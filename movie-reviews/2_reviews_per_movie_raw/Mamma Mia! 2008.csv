"bob the moo","Null","14","17","18 November 2008"," If you think you'll love/hate it then you probably will  for the same reasons as those that feel the opposite way
","The critical and audience reactions to this film seemed to suggest that it was very much a Marmite of a film, with people either loving it or hating it. By the time I thought I should check it out, the ""biggest film of the year"" had become a sing-a-long classic and I decided to wait for the DVD. Watching it myself I can totally understand why this reaction was forthcoming and it is not really down to the film so much as it is the viewers. See, those that hate it will do so for the same reasons as those that love it. Mamma Mia is a film version of a stage-show but it is not an adaptation in that it has been made into a film so much as it is a stage musical made into a film. What I mean by this clunky sentence is that all the standards of the cheesy musical have been left in  from ""big"" action, colour and simple dumb cheer.<br/><br/>For me personally this doesn't really appeal and nor did I particularly enjoy the film as it did feel all forced smiles and joys, scenes shoe-horned to fit the lyrics and fake fun in the actors and extras. By the end I had pretty much had as much camp fun as I could really stand and was glad it was done. Now others have taken that to mean that the film is rubbish, but it isn't  it just didn't work for you either. However for what it does Mamma Mia is actually very good because it knows who it is aiming for and what it has to do. Yes this means that it is daft and cheesy but that sort of ""big"" cheerfulness is what the target audience want  they want to feel elated and lifted even if it isn't real in any form. In that regard the film delivers as it is built on beautiful colours in the sets and costumes and a cast that put their egos to one side and throw themselves into it.<br/><br/>This last part is important because to my disinterested eye all the star actors came off looking daft. Streep is certainly not someone I expected to be doing this and to her credit she throws herself into it, showing a camp overacting side I didn't know she had. Likewise Walters, Baranski, Firth, Brosnan and Skarsgård all do much the same  albeit to varying degrees of success. If you're into it then the ""big"" performances are all part of the fun but if, like me, you're not, then it will be endlessly embarrassing and it will be hard to shake the feeling that I was watching award-winning actors making themselves look and sound like muppets. Of course that is why they are ""good"" in the context of what the film is trying to be and yet at the same time ""bad"" if you are not in the swing of the film.<br/><br/>What we are left with then is a film that we have seen plays really well to those that get it but leaves everyone else wondering why on earth people like Streep and Walters would make such nonsense. I personally disliked it but that does not make it a ""bad"" film, only a bad one from my point of view. For what it sets out to do though, it is a winning achievement  full of cheerful cheese and lots of colour. In fact, it is such a targeted film that you will already know whether you will love it or hate it long before you press play."
"sofie-17","9","424","677","5 July 2008"," Surprisingly good
","Went to see Mamma Mia without particularly high expectations. Not being a big connoisseur (or even fan) of musicals, I didn't really know what to expect. Though I adore ABBA, I never bothered to watch the stage production of Mamma Mia. But having a cinema membership, I didn't have much to lose (no money, at least), so I went for it. And boy, am I glad that I did! I can safely say that I enjoyed every second of it. And I'm not even ashamed to admit it!<br/><br/>Give Meryl Streep another Oscar and get it over with already. If she could get a nod for the Devil Wears Prada, she definitely deserves one for this. She really let her hair down on this one. Mrs. Streep can obviously not pass for a trained singer, but somehow, it just doesn't seem to matter. It just really worked in the movie (unlike -say- Helena Bonham Carter's singing in Sweeney Todd). When I heard Meryl's rendition of ""The winner takes it all"" in advance, it lowered my expectations considerably, but in its context, it totally made sense.<br/><br/>Most of all though, this movie was just sheer fun. People were clapping, laughing...Rarely have I seen an audience as enthusiastic. The crowd especially responded well to Meryl and her two cronies (arguably the strongholds of the movie). Also, because I had never seen the musical before, I was amazed (and amused) at the inventive ways in which they managed to incorporate so many ABBA-songs. Equally brilliant was the way the extras (usually some Greek old women) were deployed throughout the movie...And then of course the setting (beautiful Greece) was mesmerizing...<br/><br/>Basically, Mamma Mia is a superb musical that doesn't take itself too seriously. If you're just a little bit crazy and want to have a good laugh, if you love ABBA, want to see Meryl Streep like you've never seen her before or if you simply have a secret crush on Colin Firth and/or Pierce Brosnan (his singing was nothing short of hilarious), you will LOVE this movie. Best summer flick so far. Warmly recommended."

"neil-476","10","278","467","10 July 2008"," Utterly joyous
","I like, but don't love, musicals - my DVD shelves contain a selection, but the stuff there is pretty obvious: Singing in the Rain, King and I, Wizard of Oz, Moulin Rouge etc.. I'm not a Meryl Streep fan - I admire her craft, but mostly haven't liked the parts she's played. Conversely, I've always liked Abba's music. So that's my starting point when considering this movie which I have just been to see with my 80-year old mother.<br/><br/>The story is a piece of fluff. Sophie, who lives with her mother in a dilapidated hotel on an idyllic Greek island, wants nothing more than for her father to be at her forthcoming wedding. The trouble is her father could be any one of three men with whom her mother dot dot dotted twenty years ago. So Sophie invites all three of them to her wedding and, as expected, complications ensue. The story, such as it is, is quite strong enough to enable the songs to be hooked onto it. And the songs, with one or two obvious exceptions (Money Money Money cued by the rundown state of the hotel) are very cannily worked into the story so that each one is relevant.<br/><br/>The film looks great. The Greek locations overflow with sun and primary colours. The script is mostly fairly deft, and there is a sprinkling of decent laughs.<br/><br/>But the film ultimately stands or falls - and it stands, believe me! - on two things: the music, and the cast.<br/><br/>The music - sitting through this film brings home the strength of the Abba catalogue. There isn't a weak song among the two dozen which feature on the soundtrack. The music, produced by composer Benny Andersson, mostly wisely sticks very close to the original arrangements, and the occasional divergences (Greek bouzouki on I Had A Dream, for instance) are spot on.<br/><br/>And the cast - well, they deliver. Brosnan's singing has been criticised, but he is always in tune, and he delivers a satisfactory vocal performance rather than dazzling with a polished singing technique (which he hasn't got). The four leading women are all wonderful. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as Meryl Streep's two oldest friends are both very funny (Julie Walters has a particularly funny little bit of business in a rubber boat), and Baranski has her own knockout number. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is simply delightful - she sings well, carries the plot and all the emotion which goes with it, and is very easy on the eye. And Meryl Streep is a revelation.<br/><br/>This film is an utterly joyous experience. My old Mum and I came out of the cinema buoyed up by the experience of watching it, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who enjoys musicals and/or Abba's music."

","I saw this film at the screening on Sunday and was not too sure of what to expect from it. I hadn't seen the west end show so was not really aware of the story line but that really did not matter.<br/><br/>As soon as the first song started I was loving it! The actors may not be that great at singing but does it matter?! They are actors after all and this is not the west end! The actors play the parts really well and make fun of themselves at the same time. The story line is fun and has laughs for all ages. Julie Waters is her fantastic self in it and Meryl Streep plays the mother really well. The dance scenes are great and well put together. Loads of people in the cinema were singing and dancing in their seats so just enjoy it and have some laughs for a few hours.<br/><br/>If you take it for what it is, a fun laugh out loud film with good actors and fantastic songs, then you will enjoy this film so much.I suspect that this will be a summer box office hit!

","Mamma Mia! Does the mention of anything Abba-ish send you cringing to a corner? Or are you already joining in and dancing on the tabletops? Maybe another few drinks . . .<br/><br/>In short, if you are not allergic to Abba, book your tickets now. If you are, why would you be reading this? At a pinch, it is worth seeing for Meryl Streep alone, who not only throws herself headlong into every refrain with unashamed gusto, but adds a touch of class and nuance to what otherwise could be a one-dimensional adaptation. Streep vacillates engagingly between playing herself and not taking herself too seriously. Pierce Brosnan just about keeps up, and manages more expressions than he ever did as James Bond. Colin Firth and Julie Waters trail behind somewhat. Yet Mama Mia! is a roller coaster of emotion, careering colourfully from the blue waters of the Adriatic, bursting 'like Aphrodite's Fountain' into the lives of Donna (Meryl) , her lovers and friends, and her soon-to-be-wed daughter. It is the party spirit that says kick your shoes off and sing silly cheesy songs. Altogether now.<br/><br/>And yes  there's a story. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married. To the buff-looking Sky. Only  where's her dad? She's never met him. A sneak-peek at Mom's diary shows Mom had three lovers before Sophie was born and Sophie secretly invites all of them. This is a film of threesomes. Three past lovers (Sam, Bill and Harry). Three close friends (Donna and two best pals). And, not to be outdone, Sophie meets up with two other young girls at the start of the film.<br/><br/>The breakneck pace still allows for brilliantly put together shots. Like Streep doing a 'Titanic' with drapes blowing in the wind. Or a pier-load of young hunky stag night crew doing a dance in trunks and deep-dive flippers. Moonlit boats and beaches to ""I Have a Dream."" Filmed on location, the views won't disappoint. And like a favourite song whose ending we know, the drama is in the details and execution.<br/><br/>As with many adapted-from-stage musicals, two young leads are played by talented singers, and the older parts by serious actors can sing well enough. Streep manages extremely well. Her performance is so professional and assured it leaves others standing. Fortunately, it is perhaps easy to paper over any cracks in musical comedy. Sweeney Todd relied heavily on Depp's charisma and stunning cinematography. Across the Universe, too heavily on the songs. Mamma Mia!, on the other hand, simply tailors everything to its joyous headlong rush. The songs fit naturally to the action. Streep even manages to sing them with her tongue firmly in cheek. She confesses to having been a ""stupid reckless little slut"" but then says she ""grew up"". (To which her pals chime in, ""Well grow back down again!"") The film is not without faults. There is a notable lack of chemistry between the people that throw themselves rapturously against each others' faces. Even Streep looks less than convincing in a brief lips-mash. And the men are a bit croaky in the singing department (Hugh Grant might even have been a preferable casting choice). And some of the time-line is wobbly. For instance, strange as it may seem, music from more than twenty years ago does not all come from the same era. So reminiscing about flower power (early sixties) in the same breath as a Johnny Rotten t-shirt (Sex Pistols, mid-late seventies) is either anachronistic or wishful thinking.<br/><br/>Sadly, I am of a generation that can remember Abba-mania. The records would shoot to number one. Yet even then few people would admit to buying them. I used to manage a night club, and Abba was great music to ask a girl up to dance. My entire chat-up repertoire at that time consisted of, ""Would you like to dance?"" and ""Do you want to come back for a coffee?"" But girls would be so happy dancing to Mamma Mia they'd say yes anyway. I'd fall in love with a new girl each week. Ah, those were the days! Now there's a new generation of Abba fans who have no need to 'come out of a closet'. Abba is retro-chique. Even Madonna segued an Abba riff into one of her songs. From karaoke to hen nights. From '70s' nights to gay dance-floors. Dress up. Camp it up. Sing it up. Get sassy and cheesy. Or, if you're old enough to remember, fly back in time to wonderful memories.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia!, whatever detractors might say, has been one of the most successful stage shows of recent times. Supported by the same director and original band members, the movie may well reach the similar fan bases. Or just the party spirit in all of us."
"Buddy-51","5","197","334","19 July 2008"," Whose idea was it to make a musical where no one can sing or dance?
","Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near-celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - ""Waterloo,"" ""SOS,"" ""Fernando,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""The Winner Takes it All,"" etc. - that made it the world's top-selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's. Several decades later, ABBA's music became the basis for a hit stage musical entitled ""Mamma Mia!"" in which a simple narrative was deftly woven around many of the quartet's songs. Now, the much-ballyhooed movie version of ""Mamma Mia!,"" written by Catherine Johnson and directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived on the scene.<br/><br/>The story takes place on a beautiful Greek island where the never-married Donna (Meryl Streep) single-handedly runs a modest hotel for an ever-thinning crowd of tourists. Her daughter, Sophie (the charming Amanda Seyfried), has never known who her real father is, mainly because Donna herself doesn't even know. With the help of her mother's diary from twenty years ago, Sophie narrows the candidates down to three (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard), then secretly invites them to her wedding in the hope that she will be able to figure out which of them is her real father in time to have him accompany her down the aisle.<br/><br/>On stage, ""Mamma Mia!"" succeeded primarily because it was able to keep its wafer-thin storyline modest in scale and life-sized in scope. But blown up to the magnified proportions of the big screen, the material becomes a compendium of overacting (Julie Walters being the most egregious culprit in that regard), ham-handed literalization, forced spontaneity, and production values that look both gaudy and chintzy at one and the same time. Moreover, the direction is clunky, the choreography abysmal (especially compared to what we were treated to in ""Hairspray"" just a year ago), the photography either over or underexposed (depending on whether the scene is set at night or during the day), and the singing not unlike what one might hear emanating from the local pub on an average karaoke-night.<br/><br/>In fact, there has always been an inherent problem built into ""Mamma Mia!,"" which is that much of ABBA's charm derives from the crystalline voices of its lead singers, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog. Take away those harmonies and at least a certain percentage of that charm is lost. Now the movie version of ""Mamma Mia!"" comes along and simply compounds the problem by hiring big-name actors rather than trained singers to somehow interpret the pieces for us. Indeed, this must be the only musical in movie history made up almost entirely of people who can't sing (at least in the old days they used to dub the voices in if they had to). One has to give Streep brownie points for at least trying to belt out the tunes, but her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All,"" which was the rafter-rattling showstopper in the stage version, falls flat due not only to her own inadequacies as a vocalist but to the awkward staging and foolish hand gestures she uses to accompany her singing (almost as if she were trying to act out the lyrics as she's singing them). Actually, I've never understood why anyone would buy either the original cast recording or the soundtrack to ""Mamma Mia!"" anyway when the real thing is readily available and clearly far superior to any imitation.<br/><br/>All that being said, I am still inclined to at least half-heartedly recommend that people go to see this movie for a number of reasons. First, because the music itself (written by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus) is fun, infectious and finally irresistible, no matter how much the singers may be unintentionally stomping all over it; second, because even though their singing leaves much to be desired, Streep, Bosnan and Seyfried somehow make us care about the characters and the silly little predicament they're caught up in; and third, because there are a number of scenes that actually work quite nicely, the best being when Donna sings the sweet mother's lament ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" (a song clearly within Streep's limited vocal range) to her soon-to-be-wed daughter. Streep and Seyfried are both very moving and poignant not only in that particular scene but in all of the scenes in which they appear together.<br/><br/>For the half dozen or so audience members who aren't already familiar with the ABBA oeuvre, one can only hope that they will use ""Mamma Mia!"" as a springboard to sampling the real deal."

","I didn't know what to expect when going into watch ""Mamma Mia"", was this gonna be another Hairspray or Across the Universe or Rent? This was a lighthearted, quite enjoyable movie of its own style, Meryl Strep blew the entire audience away with her comedic persona in this movie. After seeing her in Devil Wears Prada, you are shaken momentarily after seeing her climb on top a roof singing ""Mamma Mia!"" and swoon and the dance teenage giddy girl dance. You'll love this movie for trio of older woman characters, they were all so funny. Mr. James Bond's character and singing was such a hilarious delight for the audience, we couldn't believe this was the man who played a top secret spy agent.<br/><br/>With just the right amount of eccentricity, heart, and *get out of those movie chairs and DANCE IN THE AISLE* ABBA music, you'll never want this adventure to end."

","I did enjoy this romp in the Greek Islands and was surprised at how well Meryl Streep sang. It's light, full of froth and bubble and perhaps has some aspects of Grease and Bollywood in it. The reason the music works I feel is that they haven't really messed with the arrangements of the songs keeping them generally faithful to the Abba originals. But Pierce Brosnan's vocal efforts were abysmal, almost laughable. Perhaps it was meant to be a send up of the original songs all the way through but he really did manage to mangle the vocals in my opinion. If you have seen the musical on stage you will know what to expect and there are some funny moments in the film and the Greek islands are as always a superb backdrop for the action."

If not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight?

"moutonbear25","6","35","54","20 July 2008"," Super Pooper
","Let me tell you. Just because I've been listening to ABBA almost non-stop since I saw MAMMA MIA! two days ago does not mean I enjoyed the film all that much. It's just the Swedish pop super group's music is so darn infectious. You would think that energy would translate to feel-great good time at the movies but sadly this is not the case. First time feature filmmaker, Phyllida Lloyd, spends far too much time dragging her feet when they should be dancing up and down the beach and no matter how many shots of the moonlight shimmering against the waves there are, the film is still a clunker instead of a stunner.<br/><br/>When a musical is paper thin on the stage, it runs the risk of being just plain silly on the screen. On the stage, MAMMA MIA! is a somewhat justified excuse to revive a bunch of ABBA tracks wrapped into a completely implausible, overly romantic farce. Young Sophie (played on screen by Amanda Seyfried) is but 20 and about to marry the very supportive and very handsome, Sky (Dominic Cooper). Something is missing though. Sophie has lived on this tiny Greek island her entire life and helped run a crumbling hotel with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) but she has never met her father. As far as she knows, he left before her mother could say anything to him but a chance encounter with her mother's diary from the summer of her conception narrows the possible men to three. So rather than talk to her mother about her desire to know where she came from, she invites all three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding, pretending to be her mother looking for a reunion. Naturally all three men accept the invite and hijinks ensue. While the campiness of the whole affair is forgiven on stage because the suspension of disbelief doesn't apply, this screen version is too far removed from the stage to feel the least bit plausible.<br/><br/>I believe in angels, something good in everything I see. And while there is very little good to focus on in MAMMA MIA!, at least there is always surprising Streep. She jumps up and down on beds, slides down banisters without the least bit of concern for breaking her hip. She can sing too. Much like she did in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, Streep's performance as the lonely mother of the bride carries the film forward and, in the show stopping ""The Winner Takes It All"", elevates the film to heights it could never have achieved without her participation. Though the two don't get nearly enough screen time together, Streep and Seyfriend make a great mother/daughter combo. Seyfried's fresh exuberance seems like it might actually be inherited from her movie mom. The rest of the cast delivers varying results  Julie Walters clearly thinks she is a comic genius but she comes off too brash; Christine Baranski is miscast as an older bombshell making for some particularly awkward moments with younger men; and someone should ensure that Pierce Brosnan never sings on screen again.<br/><br/>Ultimately, MAMMA MIA! never connects all of its components. A melodramatic moment is followed by a peppy ABBA song, which somehow erases everyone's pain. In that sense, ABBA's music is the perfect choice to set the tone as it is some of the most depressing pop lyricism set to upbeat melodies in pop history. While the contrast adds weight to the songs themselves, the musical masking casts an air of falseness that never lifts. What your left with is a compilation of poorly choreographed, plainly sung music videos. No offence, Meryl, but you are long past your MTV days."

And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments...<br/><br/>1. Middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.<br/><br/>2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag.

Or when you looked into the closet at night and had to turn away because your mind couldn't take it? This is how I felt waiting for this movie to be over.

The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79, so I did appreciate them then and I still do now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl's worst production.

And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.<br/><br/>In a ""real"" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. So, in Guys and Dolls, ""My Time of Day"" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.<br/><br/>For this lover of the Broadway Musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. While here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century Musicals. They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in ""Sweet Charity.""<br/><br/>Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps, another day, another mood, I could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.<br/><br/>But I can't help but imagining what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and I can not help but to mourn the great loss."
"trevorwynne","1","56","98","7 October 2008"," Probably the worst ever transformation from stage to screen
","This is my second review of Mamma Mia as I now have had the chance to watch it as a movie rather than a screen version of the successful stage show.<br/><br/>I think that being eager to have the distribution rights Universal gave Judy Craymer (the producer) a free reign to make the film as she wished. Ms Craymer, with no experience of films or filming, believed that she had an epic musical on her hands. She roped in her stage director, Phyllida Lloyd, who has never made a film before and had no idea how to transform the show from the confines of the theatre onto the big screen. She also roped in her stage choreographer and many other stage crew who also have no idea of the transformation from stage to big screen and the result is an amateurish production that relies totally on the ABBA feel-good factor and a participating audience.<br/><br/>Ms Craymer's idea was to cast big-name stars who, despite the film being a musical, had no singing or dancing abilities. If that was not bad enough, she also hired a cinematographer who had problems getting the light correct and camera angles right. Everything about the film is terrible and an embarrassment to watch at times. The screaming girls at the beginning. Brosnan looking more like James Bond in drag. Julie Walters hopelessly over-acting. Meryl Streep and Christine Baranski behaving like girl guides on their first date, despite supposedly being mature women in their 40s or 50s. The ensemble who were more like young children in a school play than professional dancers. Even in their brief cameos, Benny and Bjorn grinned at the camera as though it was the first time they had ever been filmed. Catherine Johnson's lacklustre script that sounded more like a working class play ""We danced on the beach and kissed on the beach and dot dot dot!"" to quote a ludicrous example. Brosnan occasionally talking as if he was on the football terraces, particularly when he cheered Meryl on during 'Souper Trouper'. Did anyone check the continuity on the film, as there seemed to be so many disjointed examples particularly whilst Meryl Streep was singing 'Mamma Mia'. At the end when the main stars were dressed in spandex suits they could not contain their laughter. When Meryl sang the moving ""The Winner Takes It All"", she and Brosnan stood motionless whilst the camera whizzed around in the air. The ""Voulez Vous"" scene when you could not even work out what was happening on screen, as the camera angles were so erratic.<br/><br/>Even though I have seen the stage show many times, I have no wish to buy the DVD when it is released, as the film was, to put in generously, nothing other than a disastrous amateurish production and probably the worst ever transformation of stage musical to screen. Doubtless, the crew, cast, distributors, financers and ABBA are not bothered. They still got their ""Money, Money, Money"" and are laughing all the way to the bank."

","After watching the Mamma Mia! musical in London, I was thrilled to hear about the movie coming out. Meryl Streep in a musical seemed like just one reason to watch it. Well, I must say.. It was a lot more than what I expected! The beautiful scenery, the cast and the songs. A good mix of tears, laughter and love that will make you feel like you're a part of the gang and enjoy every bit of this movie. Not one of the cast members let me down. It really is a feel-good movie and it made me want to stand up and sing a long. The ABBA songs are made for dancing and in this movie it reassured me. The singing and the dancing put smiles on people's faces, and it makes you feel happy and as if all worries are gone. I certainly smiled during the entire movie. The cast members were all wonderful singers and especially the two lead actresses Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried impressed me. A well-made movie that is worth watching more than once!"

","Let's get one thing out of the way first: I used to really like ABBA's music, some of the songs are recognised classics of pop and their place in pop history is assured, but this film (and the stage 'musical' by association) has savaged that legacy. This movie is so contrived, ridiculous, awfully plotted and embarrassing, it should never have seen the light of day; it makes Alvin and the Chipmunks look like high art.<br/><br/>I love genuine musicals, especially Sondheim, so to call this throwing-together of a few pop songs a musical is derogatory IMHO. Sweeney Todd showed what can be done when bringing a real musical to the screen and having big name actors (who you didn't think could sing) take the lead roles. I was embarrassed for the actors, I was angry that Benny and Bjorn every got involved with the whole project and felt cheated out of my entrance money. <br/><br/>This trend for turning pop/ rock group songs into musicals has to be stopped. Now! Please, please, let's not have a Queen or Take That musical film. Have pity on us."

But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! Her grand piece - 'The Winner Takes It All' - is Meryl at the Met! Note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters.

","It's been a while since I've watched this awful piece of Hollywood trash, but I felt the need to contribute my point of view on why I believe Mamma Mia! is an overrated soap opera.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that I love ABBA. I've been a fan since my youth. Then, one day, I saw an ad on TV about this film, combining ABBA songs with a cast of actors I adore. Even though I'm not a fan of musicals (saying I generally dislike them would be an understatement), I thought, what the hell? So I watched it.<br/><br/>I can only say that I was appalled. The first thing that hit me was the awful technicolor. It was too bright, almost like tripping on something. Then there was the singing dancing and... Acting (not that you can call it that). Meryl Streep (bless her soul) portrayed an unstable woman. And it wasn't even funny (!!!). How could she sink down like that? I was speechless. What were the directors thinking? To degrade her like that. I love her, I really do, but Meryl Streep can't sing. Or dance. And they made her do both.<br/><br/>The other actors... Like Pierce Brosnan. Whose idea was it to give this man a singing role? He can't carry a tune. At all. It was a pain to watch.<br/><br/>Then the plot... Predictable and boring. But one can live with that, right? I guess. But then they sang everything in the most horrible ways possible. It was fake, it was boring - a complete and utter flunk. A waste of time and sanity.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and don't watch Mamma Mia! Go buy an ABBA CD and enjoy their music in its pure, delightful form.<br/><br/>In the end, all this film has done was to (almost) ruin ABBA for me. I'll get over it one day, but it's a scar I have to bare now."

If you think ugly Americans stinking it up in a foreign country is bad, you should see these Brits ruining a picturesque little slice of Greece. Everybody acts like they're drunk and having a grand old time-- it's excruciating to watch. Nobody can sing. Meryl Streep has done somber, depressed roles in the past that are really good, but she is just terrible in this movie. I hope this doesn't mean she has lost her ability to pick good roles for herself. This movie felt like the actors got on board because they thought it would be great fun to have a party in Greece, but they forgot they had to make a movie."

Her daughter doesn't seem bothered by this and starts singing about it as though it's romantic. She decided to write to all three men, inviting them to her wedding, so that she could find out which one is her father.<br/><br/>Every situation is summed up with badly sung and choreographed ABBA songs presented in a style that's corny even for musicals.

"MOscarbradley","10","86","159","17 July 2008"," I'm Coming Out ... the year's guiltiest pleasure.
","I have a confession to make that could land me in serious trouble here. I love this movie with a love bordering on the unnatural. Of course, I hear you saying, that can only mean one thing; you're a gay man of a certain age and if you haven't come out of the closet already. you're coming out now, and wearing sequins at the same time. No straight man, I hear you say, could love this movie with this kind of unbridled passion, so if you have aspirations to being a 100% red-blooded heterosexual male, (is there such a thing?), then keep any fondness for ""Mama Mia"" to yourself; you will automatically be suspect. Of course, I could just as easily be a teenage girl, (it's a chick flick, after all), and be in equally serious difficulties with my peers, for loving ""Mama Mia"" would then mean I had already turned into my mother, for this is a chick flick for the older chick and no mistake.<br/><br/>I had avoided it on stage. I have never been a fan of 'juke-box' musicals where a plot is conjured up around a set of songs by a well-known group or artist. And my undiminished love of Abba, (there, I'm out of the closet - happy now?), made me shy away from, rather than run to, a show where their greatest hits were sung, karaoke-style, by others. But something drew me to the movie. Perhaps it was Meryl, (if Meryl liked it, it can't be that bad, I kept saying to myself). Perhaps it was the locations, (it all takes place on a very travelogue Greek isle). Perhaps, ultimately, it was the songs, (who isn't a dancing queen, after all). Nevertheless, going to ""Mama Mia"", the movie, was still like dipping my toe in the water before deciding if I wanted to do a full length of the pool. The last thing I expected was to fall head over heels, to turn into a blubbering mess, to turn into the oldest dancing queen on the block and into my mother all at the same time. ""Mama Mia"" is a guilty pleasure, (no self-respecting cineaste should ever admit to even liking this movie, never mind loving it), but as guilty pleasures go, this is the best junk meal you are ever likely to have.<br/><br/>It's director, Phyllida Law, did it on the stage so at least she is familiar with the material, but she is new to movies and after the mess Susan Stroman made of ""The Producers"" I didn't really expect anything, but while ""The Producers"" was stagey,(and not in an appealing way), ""Mama Mia"" is genuinely cinematic. Lloyd's idea of film-making may be to let her camera roam all over the place, (she seems to have an MTV mentality), but she also knows how to build a production number. This is a fully-fledged musical of the old school. And now I am beginning to see the light. It's OK, guys, you can admit to liking ""Mama Mia"" without worrying too much about revealing your sexuality. Straight men are allowed to like musicals, too, aren't they? Then, of course, there are those songs, the ones we grew up loving. I read somewhere that Abba didn't write great songs because no-one covered them, unlike, say, Lennon and McCartney; that what made Abba's songs 'great' was the Abba sound. There may be something in that; the 'Abba sound' produced some of the greatest pop ever. Arguably, the songs that Abba, (and by Abba, I mean Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson), wrote and recorded are the greatest pop songs we've been given. So how do they work coming from the mouths of people who, effectively, aren't singers? (Ok, Meryl, we all know you can sing and act and probably split the atom at the same time, and the girl who plays her daughter, Amanda Seyfried, sounds very pleasant to the ear). Well, the answer is bloody marvelous. Most of these songs sound as if they were written for the film and not the other way round; in other words, they fit the plot in the way that songs in a good musical should and they are good enough to stand on their own.<br/><br/>These are Broadway show-tunes and they aren't wholly reliant on 'the Abba sound'. So what if Julie Walters and Stellan Skarsgard croak their way through 'Take a Chance on Me'; by the time they get around to it I would have taken a chance on anyone. So Pierce Brosnan can't sing? Neither can Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen and yet we love them to bits. (Actually, Brosnan can just about manage to hold a tune and he makes a fairer fist of it than Lee Marvin or Clint Eastwood did in ""Paint your Wagon""). And Meryl, of course, is wonderful. Our greatest living actress is having fun here. This is her first fully-fledged musical: I just wondered what took her so long, (her rendition of 'The Winner takes it All' is one of the great solo performances in any musical).<br/><br/>But does any of this justify my over-whelming and totally inexplicable passion? Probably not, which is why it is inexplicable. It's not a 'great' movie, (although it could just be a 'great' musical); it often feels like a bunch of friends' best ever holiday video where they keep bursting into song with fully orchestrated backing, and it gives a totally new meaning to the term 'Greek Chorous'. So, obviously I am a middle-aged gay man with a full wardrobe of seventies gear. (I certainly haven't turned into my mother!). I mean, what other explanation can there be? Oh, I've just thought of one. It is a great movie musical and it's a terrific way to spend an evening. So I can now safely go back into my closet if I can find room among all the sequins and seventies gear."

I'm sure they both were convinced by their agents how amazing this movie would be..""Look you guys..you've never done something like this before, it would be so brave of you. I know you can't sing but we'll get you lessons. Take a chance on me...you'll be great"". But it seems so gratuitous that they did this movie.

The truth is I think Meryl is a great actress....just not a great singer. And my lord....how AWFUL was Pierce Brosnan's singing. It was truly painful and I was literally embarrassed for him. Shame on him for thinking he could do this role. His ego must be out of control to think he could pull it off...because he truly didn't. The only one out of the whole cast who could carry a tune was the charming and beautiful Amanda Seyfried. Now that's a girl that can act AND sing. I was just really disappointed by the film.

Sadly I will regret that decision for quite some time to come. Not only was the WHOLE film over the top with an abundance of unnecessarily shrieking women, the script was abysmal at best. The plot did not flow and seemed only there to serve as an entrance to yet another ABBA song. The last conversation Sophie and her future husband to be have before they get married is one about how neither one knows what they want anymore...next thing we see is them...getting married???<br/><br/>Plot holes and inconsistencies aside the film suffered from big-name cast overkill and aside from Meryl, Seyfield and Brosnan was woefully underused. Some of the singing *cough* Brosnan *cough* made me want to dive under my sofa cushions and not come back out. When Brosnan sings SOS it sounds like he is trying to scrape Catarrh out the back of his throat with a piece of sandpaper, achieving little success. I cannot understand why in a musical film you would need to use talented drama/comedy actors when the vast majority of the plot is based around singing!? Surely using people with a decent set of vocal chords would have been better! It is ABBA after all and as anyone who has tried to howl out the lyrics to Dancing Queen on the karaoke will know, it does not sound good if you cannot sing.<br/><br/>The cinematography was also underused. I cannot think why they staged the whole thing on a Greek island. They could have been anywhere! Add to that the terrible camera angling, lighting and settings and the entire production just smacks of amateurism.<br/><br/>The only reason this film gets two stars is because Meryl Streep was decent and the music is ABBA.

She doesn't tell her mother this so needless to say much fun ensues before the inevitable happy ending. How could it fail? Thankfully it doesn't! <br/><br/>I hadn't seen the stage musical but that really doesn't matter as the film is very good on it's own merits. The excellent supporting including Julie Walters, Christine Baranski, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard are all obviously having a ball. Perhaps the least said about some of their singing and dancing abilities the better!<br/><br/>The film is comedic most of the time though there are a few moving moments, especially a few dealing with the mother-daughter relationship.<br/><br/>I'll make one point that really struck me during the film. Given the bright and breezy nature of the story I found Meryl Streep's performance very intense. It wasn't like watching her in ""Sophie's Choice"" but she seemed to emphasise the regrets and sadness her character had about her life and parenting skills. I must add that this didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film, as it is never long before the next dance routine came up!<br/><br/>So if you want to have a laugh and sing along to Abba (if only to yourself) go and see Mamma Mia."

","This is the worst movie I have seen, even in my distant memory. The plot was muddled and completely without direction. The music was awful, only equatable to bad karaoke sounding akin to a baby seal being beaten with a bat. The level of acting from seasoned actors is ridiculously bad. The dancing was borderline seizure! Awful, awful, awful from beginning to end, this movie is terrible! Best avoided! This movie robbed me of time I could have spent watching any other movie under the sun and it would have been a better choice. If you are considering watching this movie please do not, 7/10 is a gross misrepresentation of this movie."

","When I saw the trailers on TV I started to jump and sing. After seeing the shows with interviews I got anxious to see the movie. <br/><br/>Now that I've seen it... I can't stop singing the musics and remembering the scenes. <br/><br/>A word to Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters and Colin Firth they were tremendously good in the movie.<br/><br/>They are no professional singers but they really surprised me. Specially Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan. <br/><br/>So I just can say, and using a word from another great movie, Mamma Mia just is: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.<br/><br/>I've seen it twice already, and going for a third view or more."

","Okay, so here we have an entirely implausible storyline shaped into unashamedly enjoyable cinema experience. Personally, I hate going to movies, just because they are so expensive these days. I went to see this one twice... People in the audience were laughing out loud, clapping and enjoying themselves. Isn't that what we go to the movies for, to be entertained? Admittedly, Pierce Brosnan can't sing... so what? He was a ton of fun. The leading ladies (Streep, Walters and Baranski) seemed to be having such a good time... there is not much sexier than mature women having fun and being the mature women they are... The characters looked and acted seasoned, which was quite refreshing.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the DVD with the outtakes..."

","Yikes. I have always been a Streep fan, but I have never seen anything like this. I don't know what they did to her, but throughout most of this film - I will blame the director, choreographer and editors - she is so manically jubilant and expressive and hyper-active that I was afraid the poor woman had developed an addiction to chrystal meth! In fact, most of the cast fairs poorly. Only Julie Walters seems to realize that she is in the midst of one colossal joke. For all the mania and energy forced upon these people, their deadliest flaw is that they seem to be taking this whole story seriously.<br/><br/>The term ""Greek Chorus"" has never been so horrifyingly real. Words cannot express.<br/><br/>Two stars though because I can see a future rainy Sunday with tequila shots lined up on the coffee table, a double feature of Mama Mia! and Can't Stop the Music, and a really big headache afterward."

","I liked ABBA in the '70s.<br/><br/>I saw ""Mamma Mia"" on stage in Vegas, and loved it.<br/><br/>Then I saw ""Mamma Mia"" the movie.<br/><br/>Oh dear! <br/><br/>I've never agreed with the notion of bringing in big-name stars to create a film version of an already popular musical, but in the past, when a few of those big-name movie stars couldn't sing, the directors (and I would assume the non-singing stars who didn't want to embarrass themselves) had the sense to bring in the Marni Nixons, Bill Lees, Margery McKays, Giorgio Tozzis, etc. to dub the sound tracks.<br/><br/>No such luck with ""Momma Mia."" <br/><br/>Dominic Cooper is good as ""Sky,"" and Amanda Seyfried is more than good as Sophie, but the rest of the cast is too old and can't carry a tune in the buckets it looks like they are about to kick.<br/><br/>In the 2000s, ""Duets,"" ""Chicago,"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" were pleasant big-name star surprises. <br/><br/>What happened with ""Momma Mia""?

","Okay, so maybe your six year old sister might like it, but it might just make you want to fall asleep, or chuck the remote at the television screen. The main actress is TERRIBLE. Somehow, she manages to be irritating and sickly sweet in everything she does. Meryl Streep (usually a great talent) was just as bad. The plot was tiresome and predictable, none of the actors could sing -especially poor old Brosnan-, and everything was just a little too polished and nicey. <br/><br/>Yes, it was in your face no-fears cheesy, but it was done really badly. Spare yourself some childish waste of time, and watch something of taste, please."
"JamesHitchcock","4","8","11","10 October 2008"," Knowing Me, Knowing You- Is This The Best You Can Do?
","Donna Sheridan is an American expat running a small hotel on one of the Greek islands. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married, and wants her father to give her away. Unfortunately, Sophie does not actually know who her father is. To make matters worse, even Donna (evidently something of a slut in her young days) does not know who Sophie's father is either, although she has managed to narrow it down to a shortlist of three:- Harry (British), Bill (Swedish) and Sam (American, although you wouldn't think so from Pierce Brosnan's accent). Unknown to Donna, Sophie invites all three men to the wedding. That's all the plot you need to know. The rest is just a series of excuses to sing one ABBA song after another. I'm just surprised they didn't make one of Donna's lovers a South American revolutionary named Fernando and thereby tick off another song. <br/><br/>I have a confession to make. I am probably the only heterosexual British male of my generation who likes ABBA, or at least who likes them in a straightforward way and not in an ironic, postmodernist spirit of ""I know they're naff, but then naff is the new cool!"" Even in their heyday in the seventies and eighties it was fashionable to sneer at them as uncool, and even I cannot deny that they wore some seriously bad costumes. (But what seventies pop star didn't?) To my mind, however, Andersson and Ulvaeus were in the same league as Lennon and McCartney, or Simon and Garfunkel, when it came to writing unforgettable pop tunes, even though my interest in the group may also have had something to do with the looks of its two female members. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, however, I cannot say I liked this film, and there are three main reasons why I didn't. The first is to do with the basic concept. In all great stage and screen musicals the principle is story first, songs second. The purpose of the songs is to serve the story by illustrating the thoughts and feelings of the characters. ""Mamma Mia!"" inverts this principle by putting the story at the service of the songs. ABBA's songs, of course, were individual pop songs written over a number of years. They were not written in order to tell a coherent story, so the only way a musical can be based around them is to concoct a very contrived plot.<br/><br/>Not all of ABBA's songs were cheerful ones; they also wrote their fair share of songs like ""Chiquitita"", ""SOS"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"", dealing with the pains of unhappy love affairs. ""Mamma Mia!"", however, like the song from which it takes its name, is quite remorselessly cheerful, the sort of film in which nothing seriously bad is allowed to happen. We hear all the above-mentioned songs, but in the context not of genuine unhappiness but merely of irritation at some trivial upset, which weakens their impact. <br/><br/>The second reason why I didn't like the film is to do with the songs themselves. Pop singers, provided the music is good enough, can often get away with dodgy lyrics, but in musicals the words take on greater importance. Benny and Bjorn may have been gifted musicians, but few would have considered them gifted lyricists. Contrary to popular belief, most of their songs were originally written in English (""Waterloo"", written for the Eurovision Song Contest, was an exception), but all too often they sounded as though they had been written in Swedish and then translated into English by someone with a less than fluent grasp of either language. (Sample, from ""When All is Said and Done"":-<br/><br/>""In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex""). <br/><br/>Why the lovely Frida, in her mid-thirties at the time she performed this song, felt the need to deny that she was too old for sex is beyond me. Moreover, ABBA's lyrics do not always fit the music well; for example, ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" (a song not performed in this film) is about divorce, but one would not have thought so from the catchy, upbeat melody. <br/><br/>My third reason has to do with the performances. It has long been taken for granted in the film industry that Meryl Streep can do just about anything demanded of her, but we now know there is an exception to that rule. She can't sing- at least not to the standard normally required of those aspiring to the leading role in a cinematic musical. Dame Meryl's attempt at ""The Winner Takes it All"", perhaps ABBA's most ambitious song, was particularly wanting. She was, however, not the worst singer on display here- there was some competition for that dubious distinction, but the honour must go either to Brosnan or Julie Walters. The exception was Amanda Seyfried (Sophie), who has a sweet and melodious voice, but she makes up for her above-average singing with some below-average acting. Her only techniques for expressing emotion are to open her wide blue eyes even wider and to flash her large but perfectly formed teeth. (Incidentally, Sophie's dazzling piano-keyboard dentition seems to give the lie to the idea that she has spent her whole life in Greece; Europeans generally do not share the American obsession with cosmetic dentistry). <br/><br/>No doubt anyone who goes to this film looking to have an undemanding good time will end up having one. Anyone, however, who is looking for more than that is likely to be disappointed. This is not a film that does great credit to those in it or, for that matter, to ABBA. 4/10"

","My mother and I decided to watch this movie together. We both are ABBA fans and loved the ""Mamma Mia!"" musical. This movie is nothing like it. The one thing that got me was how much everyone seemed to over act. There was so much cheese in it that I wanted some wine, or maybe that was to get past the awful singing! Pierce Brosnan never needs to sing again. He just needs to stand and look pretty. I will respect him for that.<br/><br/>I agree with my mom on this, everyone needs a film they just need to bury and this one is it for the cast and everyone involved.

"AppleSeedSy","10","24","41","22 July 2008"," True to what it promises: A First-rate Crowd Pleaser
","I have to admit that I was neither a fan of ABBA or of the musical show on which this movie was based upon, and didn't attend it when it was shown in my town. But I went to the movie excited about three things: a very good trailer, recommendations from all my friends and most importantly the presence of Myrel Streep and Colin Firth, two of my very favorite actors.<br/><br/>So, let me put it that way: Mamma Mia! is one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema that I have seen in a long, long time. Yes, it doesn't have the gorgeous stylization of Moulin Rouge or the raunchiness of Chicago, but in its own way, it's just amazing. The simple presentation is backed up by a fantastic cast, a heartwarming story about love and the meaning of family, and a bunch of beautiful songs. Watching this film was one of the most beautiful movie-going experiences I had; I saw it 3 times in packed theatres, where audiences were quiet when they needed to be, and active and responsive otherwise. In those three times, the first Dancing Queen number got wild applause by the minute it was over, a proof of the entertainment value of the film. And near the end, when Donna looks at the screen and asks why everyone is still there while the credits are rolling, she says ""do you want one more song?"" and the entire audience would scream ""YEAH"". This is a first-rate crowd pleaser; a film that takes you into its world until you feel you are part of it. What an achievement.<br/><br/>To some cynics, the story, involving a 20-year-old girl inviting three of her mother's old flames, suspecting one of them would be her father, is just an excuse to build a movie around Abba's songs. But what's wrong with that? The story is sweet and simple; the characters colorful and lovable, and the musical numbers are breathtaking without even trying to be anything spectacular. The cast are all excellent, starting with the adorable Amanda Seyfried, playing an energetic, practical girl torn between her love to her boyfriend, her sense of obligation towards her hard-working mother and her sense of incompletion because she doesn't know who her father is. A complex role, presented in an airy method, and played to perfection by the young actress. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski add comic genius to the equation as Donna's best friends, and so does Stellan Sarskard and Dominic Cooper. Colin Firth gives one of the best performances of his rich career, deserving all the praise possible for his ""spontaneous"" performance, and his final revelation is hilarious, and handled with so much cuteness and zero cheesiness that would be expected from Hollywood on such occasions. Pierce Brosnan was as hot as ever (sorry, can't find another word) and he added some real charm and star charisma to the picture.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Myrel Streep. The Woman Who Can Do No Wrong. Yes, she can appear in mediocre movies, most recently in the likes of Prime and Lions for Lambs, but even then she adds a spark to the entire project, and makes watching these films an agreeable experience. In Mamma Mia! she is just absolutely fabulous: she dances, she sings, she acts like the legend she is, and in one particular scene preparing her daughter for the big night, she reminds us why she is so respected and, at 59, she is still a major Hollywood star: she is just simply a phenomenal performer. Fun, lovable, and definitely capable of handling a tune, her Super Trouper and Mamma Mia! numbers are highlights in the film.<br/><br/>So, all in all, Mamma Mia! was the ultimate fun experience for me this year. Sweet, sensitive, and charming with a superb cast and beautiful music. Give it a shot in this summer of superheroes and bad movies, and it will help restore your faith in old-fashioned, simple cinema. If not, then at least you will have a heartwarming 2 hours of music, love and Streep and Firth excelling beyond expectations. Go see it with an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart and you will be ""having the time of your life""."

Her 'singing' could wake up the dead. It is impossible to believe that a character looking like that could ever have attracted, let alone, slept with 3 guys!

","I probably saw the trailer more than a dozen times and randomly saw the movie last night. Well, it sucked. It was bordering on absurd. And I've never felt this horrible about a movie in a long time.<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia"" was artificial and downright contrived  there was no flow with the story, the songs were hardly relevant to the situations, and the song numbers were so unnecessarily long (take ""The Winner Takes It All"" for instance.) There was hardly any conflict  just a lot of miscommunication. It was like a lengthy and overly-acted music video of sorts.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep acted so awkward, over-the-top and crazy, especially during that ""Mamma Mia"" song performance. I didn't enjoy listening to Pierce Brosnan sing and even Julie Walters was just too corny for my taste. Amanda Seyfried, Colin Firth and the movie location were the only saving graces of the film.<br/><br/>I don't know how such big names managed to be pulled to doing such a crappy project. Really. I hope they had fun doing it at the least. Maybe the stage musical is a lot better but I still can't imagine anything praise-worthy coming out of such a pretentious concept. Then again, I don't know, maybe I just totally missed whatever it was they wanted to portray.<br/><br/>Okay, so I'm completely bashing the film because I certainly hardly enjoyed it, but who knows, maybe die-hard ABBA fans would.

The idea of having all those great ABBA songs put into a musical sounds like a good idea, but when I saw who was going to be in it, I knew it was a no-hoper from the word go.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep, despite all the claims in her favor, cannot sing and/or carry a musical. Barbara Streisand can, Julie Andrews can, but not Meryl Streep. Stick to drama and accents, Meryl.<br/><br/>All the ABBA songs are performed in such an over-the-top and forced way that you simply cannot enjoy what's going on. Initially I was surprised there were so many songs in the film, but unfortunately, the cast ruined each and every one of them for me.<br/><br/>The choreography is chaotic, with everyone dancing around, trying to be desperately happy, and perhaps the cast all had fun, but the audience certainly doesn't.<br/><br/>And who thought that either Pierce Brosnan or Colin Firth would make good leading men in a musical? Clearly the director has never seen a musical before.<br/><br/>CHICAGO, MOULIN ROUGE, HAIRSPRAY and the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL films were all excellent and helped revive a genre that has been on its last legs for years.

As an open-minded movie viewer and a very positive person, I can normally find something to like, but right from the start I felt concerned. I did watch the entire film, including the embarrassing end credits, and was constantly willing myself to engage with the narrative or the characters, and towards the end hoping for the 'emotional moment' that all film-makers can conjure from the flimsiest of scripts and lightweight of characters . . . but . . . nothing!

"Paddy-49","1","17","28","31 December 2008"," My my how can I resist it? Quite easily actually....
","As the last strains of Waterloo eventually faded away I was to stay in my comfy chair for quite a while numb and trying to bring back to life my facility for objective criticism. What can possibly be said about Mamma Mia other than to recall Lord Reith who once said ""He who prides himself on giving what he thinks the public wants is often creating a fictitious demand for low standards which he will then satisfy"". That this DVD is what the public wants is not in dispute.But will this truly abysmal film now create a run on of ""fictitious demand"" as Hollywood rushes to copy it  well don't hold your breath.<br/><br/>Of course objective criticism is a bit of a waste of time as those of us who think that good Cinema should at least be about films having a decent plot, well cast actors and decent production and direction may soon be in a minority. Those of us who suggest that on the evidence of the success of Mamma Mia that it is final proof of the maxim that nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public are likely to be seen as elitist killjoys. Well so be it  I'm not going to dilute my crucial faculties just because the public votes with its feet and its money to crown Mamma Mia as worthwhile entertainment. Never mind the quality feel the width of the box office takings! But, for what its worth  and that's probably not much, here is a brief list of the reasons why Mamma Mia is such excreta. The plot is trivial, unbelievable, ill-constructed, offensive and just plain dull. The casting is dire. True Meryl Streep is wonderful  but when has she ever not been? But Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are wooden throughout and they can't sing  and no this is not irony or even remotely funny. It's a MUSICAL. The leads must be able to sing. Doh! Amanda Seyfried can sing and she's very pretty too. But what about those bloody teeth? Sorry this may be a bit from left field but why would a nice little 20 year-old have to have shining white and 100% artificial looking brilliant white teeth. It made her look like an American Ryder Cup wife for goodness sake! Stellan Skarsgard (who?) was dull and he couldn't sing either. Julie Waters gave us one of her batty old ladies  we've seen it before Jules and it made no sense in Mamma bloody Mia. Christine Baranski was good  almost in the Streep class but surely a film with this budget could have cast all of the principals rather more thoughtfully? The editing was woeful as well. There seemed to be a good few gaffes that should have been edited out and reshot  did nobody care or not think that we'd notice when an actor forgets their lines? And was that set meant to look realistic  or the extras look like real people? Maybe not. And maybe on stage it wouldn't matter. But it wasn't on stage  it's a movie! Musical Theatre only really transfers well to film when it is opened out. Think ""Sound of Music"" or ""Carousel"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Mamma Mia was claustrophobic despite the stock shots of the Aegean. It looked more like Pinewood. It was Pinewood! OK so ABBA write catchy songs and we all like occasionally to hum along with them. But why put them into a stage show with a supposed plot in the first place. Why not just perform them as song and dance in concert? And if you must try and make a facile piece of drama around a random collection of songs and put it on stage then please don't later think that it will make a film. But you have  and a few rich people have become even richer as a result. And the Cinema is the poorer for it."

","The story of Sophie, who lives with her mother in a dilapidated hotel on an idyllic Greek island, wants nothing more than for her father to be at her forthcoming wedding. The trouble is her father could be any one of three men with whom her mother dot dot dotted twenty years ago. So Sophie invites all three of them to her wedding and, as expected, complications ensue.This film has been mentioned so many times to me that I thought it was about time we had a look!! What a waste of an evening. I'm just glad I didn't take out a loan to go watch it at the cinema. The setting was great, Meryl streep was the only saving grace. Obviously if you are a massive Abba fan you will probably enjoy it but only for the songs not the vocal talent that's for sure!

Five minutes in I realised that even with the lowest of expectations the film would still have been a disappointment.

","Hubby and I paid $4.99 to watch Mama Mia on Pay Per View last night and have decided we wasted $4. We're also grateful we didn't plunk down money on movie theatre tickets to see it. Thumbnail sketch of the film: A bunch of people with women's uncombed hair streaming and guys bare-chested (so's ya know they are 70's leftovers) run up and down the streets of a seaside village, singing. They are joined by happy peasants who also seem to know the song and the dance moves. The same bunch of people run up and down a pier singing a song that sounds like the first one, and end up in the water. The same bunch of people run around rocks and trees, singing a song that sounds like the first two. The same bunch of people run up and down the beach, singing a song that sounds like the first three. The same bunch of people run through a labyrinth of halls and rooms in some sort of seaside inn, singing a songyou get the idea by now. Three men visiting the seaside inn for a wedding run around the deck of a boat, singing for the bride-to-be, whom one of them has fathered years ago but not raised. The bride (omigosh!) ends up in the water. Who knew? The same bunch of people sit transfixed on the ground as three of them, ostensibly a female trio reunited for the wedding of one of their daughters, sing the songs that made them (in)famous.<br/><br/>ABBA's songs are round-pegged into the square holes of the screenplay, with laughably awkward song cues that smack of a Broadway stage setting. I guess it might have worked on Broadway. As for the volume competition between the accompanying background music and the singers, final score is Instruments 10, Singers 0. Given the vapid nature of the lyrics, this is not necessarily a bad decision on the part of the film-makers. All the manic music in the film sounds alike--well, shoot it's ABBA for heavens sake--except for a nice ballad sung by Streep and the bride, her daughter. One of ABBA's best tunes, ""Fernando,"" was missing from the film. He probably died from a heart attack brought about by all that manic running, or maybe drowned off the boat or pier.<br/><br/>The actress playing the daughter has expressions that run the gamut from upset to VERY upset. The most active parts of her anatomy were her frowning forehead and wild eyes. Pierce Brosnan delivers a miscast performance that makes you wonder if he's contemplating strangling his agent, or throwing him off a pier or a boat. <br/><br/>I know that some commentators on IMDb thought the film was wonderful. ""Chacun son gout."" On the + side, Meryl Streep proves once again that she is a Protean actor who can really sing. Is there NO role this woman cannot play?"

","I happen to enjoy ABBA's music, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.<br/><br/>If one was to judge ABBA's music by the deliveries in this movie, ABBA would get no more exposure. People would simply turn them off.<br/><br/>I can imagine that some people thought it was brilliant casting to have Miss Streep as the mother and, especially inspired to have Pierce Brosnan in. I'm sure it looked good on paper.<br/><br/>However, an idea is not always as good in the flesh as in the mind. Miss Streep had fun with this role. I'm glad that someone did. She will never be mistaken for a real singer, but she did hold her own, I guess.<br/><br/>Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, was WAY out of his element in this one. Wow! Did it show?! As a singer, he makes a great James Bond. I can imagine someone figured that, since Brosnan is Irish, he could do the role. Not all Irish can sing a beautiful tenor - or even sing, for that matter.<br/><br/>The story itself was not all that hot, either. It is truly sad that this girl never knew who her father was, and even sadder that this was never resolved by the end of the film. The idea that her mother had no clue as to who was her daughter's father because she slept with all 3 candidates in such a short amount of time is not the food for comedy. It is fodder for tragedy, at least in the real world.<br/><br/>Miss Balanski seems fated to only play cougar-women. Type casting? At least she could sing and - to a point - dance.<br/><br/>Colin Firth got to play the requisite homosexual (Must there be one in every film?). However, I think this may be the one time that I can understand his character's decision to turn homosexual. After all he did sleep with Streep's character at one time.<br/><br/>The final tragedy was that the young couple, when it came to crunch time, decide to forego marriage and just sail off around the world.<br/><br/>How romantic! How wacked!"

","I've always been a fan of musical Theatre. You can't beat the atmosphere of a crowd fired up by excitement, laughing, crying, clapping, cheering and of course singing along to the numbers. The players on stage bring a 3D reality to the show that you can't get at the cinema - though the lack of ability to do close ups means that you do lose some of the emotion in the individual performances.<br/><br/>I never thought I would ever see a film at the cinema that successfully merges the live atmosphere of Theatre with the in your face close up acting that you can get on screen. But this is what you get when you go and see Mamma Mia the Movie. People are laughing out loud, crying, cheering, clapping and as the film progresses, dancing in the aisles. On top of that are emotional, perhaps Oscar winning performances by the likes of Meryl Streep and Julie Walters.<br/><br/>You may have read some poor reviews of Mamma Mia. Ignore them! The negative ones were probably written by men who just don't get it. Or by miserable people denying themselves the chance to spend two hours being cheered up, warmed up and entertained and made to laugh out loud. In the UK we have prices rocketing through the roof, we have stagnant pay rises, rain when it should be sunny and newspapers that feed us a constant parade of knifings, shootings and killings. This film is a panacea for the modern world. A very cheesy, camp fantasy that really is as feel good as it can get.<br/><br/>The setting is a beautiful sunny Greek island - with breathtaking landscapes of turquoise seas, white sandy beaches and green hillsides. The cast have been assembled from the best Hollywood has to offer. Amanda Seyfried looks beautiful as the young girl about to marry and wanting to know which of her mother, Donna's three former lovers is actually her father. Will she find out and will he give her away? Colin Firth, reprising his bumbling Englishman role from Love Actually and Bridget Jones Diary - and Pierce Brosnan about as far away as it is possible to be from Bond James Bond - come across really well because they are in on the joke. You can tell they are having fun and although their singing is not spectacular it is no where near as bad as some of the critics will have you believe.<br/><br/>Julie Walters is priceless as the mad as a hatter Rosie and gets the best lines. Her friend Tanya has the best song and dance scene with ""Does Your Mother Know"" - on the beach trying to put off the advances of a barman young enough to be her son - or maybe even her grand son. Given their antics you could be forgiven for saying the film is targeted at middle aged women - that was certainly the majority of the audience in the cinema I went to - but every generation is represented - this is really a film about growing up and how love can be blind when you are young and when you are old.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is astonishing as Donna. She can sing and she acts her socks off. ""Slipping through my fingers"", never my favourite Abba song - becomes a tear jerker when her acting and singing combine - and ""The Winner Takes it all"" proves just who the winner should be.<br/><br/>Whether you like Abba or not , the updated versions of the songs, despite the extremely unsubtle ways in which they are shoehorned into the plot (you can always spot those who have not seen Mamma Mia before - they are the ones who groan when they realise how the song has been introduced), sound fresh and vibrant and should attract a whole new generation of fans.<br/><br/>And at the end - once the main action has finished - the title sequence arrives like an encore - encouraging the audience to get on their feet and dance till the end. And when Streep asks the audience if they want more - and everyone cries ""Yes!!!"" - even though she isn't really there - you know that everyone has been swept away by the cheesy camp brilliance of this film. Thank you for the music!"

I hated this boring turkey with a passion. Why? I liked the actors. I love ABBA music and I like beautiful scenery. With all these positives, why did I hate this movie so much? If the singing was passable, I could have found something positive to say about it but it really was mediocre. This was so boring and didn't work on any level. Amanda Seyfried was pretty good which is about the only nice thing I can say. Maybe I would have enjoyed the Broadway play more but as movies go, this one stinks. It really and truly does."

And then I heard Merlin Shreep and Pierce Brosnen were going to be in it. At that moment I became worried that they had made the fatal mistake of filling this film with famous actors and actresses who can't sing. In my opinion, the producers got the casting wrong. They didn't need to have big names in it, the Mamma Mia name was big enough to attract viewers.<br/><br/>However, it can't be denied that the movie is hilarious and some of the bad singing is funny, indeed I can sing some of the songs better than the actual cast (and I can't sing!!)."

","Belongs on the stage, has no business being a film. Its dripping with melodrama, bad acting and atrocious singing. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks both should return Oscars for subjecting unsuspecting boyfriends and husbands to this crap. My wife hated it and I couldn't agree more. The premise is somewhat amusing, but as the plot unfolds, you have to wonder why in the world three men who had one nights stands with the same woman would a) agree to attend a wedding half way around the world for someone they slept with once and b) not suspect that maybe there is a surprise daughter/son involved. I blame the ""geniuses"" behind such junk as American Idol for this mess and the recently adopted Broadway philosophy that if any script, any story, and movie ever made is given some singing, choreography and a few well known actors, it will be a success and be worth critical acclaim. I've seen elementary school plays with more convincing acting than most of this film. Avoid at all costs unless you honestly believe that anyone can sing, act and dance and that any movie with singing involved must be good."

","So rarely do I enjoy a movie like I enjoyed this one. I've never seen the actual show, yet I'm an ABBA fan, so this movie was must, since I read about it on this website. I found myself singing the songs and laughing like I've never laughed in a movie before. Mamma Mia! is one of the leading movies of the year, even though we're still in July. And no, I won't take it back.<br/><br/>The casting for this movie was just perfect. Meryl Streep couldn't be more perfect, jumping and singing like a 20-year-old, while she's almost kissing hello to the early 60's. There's no trace of age in her, as she pretty much was the focus of the movie. The ABBA members called her a miracle. I couldn't agree more. Am I smelling an Oscar..? Our good ol' James Bond was pleasing, even though his singing abilities were.. well, let's just say he should stick to drinking his vodka martinis ""shaken, not stirred"". Acting-wise, he was great. Julie Walters, she really deserves a ""mamma mia!"" for her part in the movie. She's second in command for Streep, showing her AMAZING acting and singing abilities. She was the main reasons for the moments I laughed so much. New-comer (even though she's been in movies suck as Mean Girls) Amanda Seyfried was truly touching, proving she's more than plastic figure that follows Rachel McAdams. As for the rest of the cast, the two other father figures, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth really did make it a super cast, along with Christine Baranski as the never-aging friend, Tanya.<br/><br/>The re-makes of the songs were absolutely perfect. I've heard the ABBA version many times, but I must say, Streep made it sounds SO MUCH BETTER! I'm truly waiting to purchase the soundtrack, and add it to the movie/musical list of cd's I have on my iPod, which includes Sweeney Todd and Hairspray.<br/><br/>The view, oh wow, the view. Being shot in a Greek location really made the movie so much more believable and alive. The sets themselves were truly entertaining, especially the goat-house which plays an important part of the story.<br/><br/>Why did I give it 10? Well, I should ask, why not? It had everything I wanted in a movie like that, which makes me laugh and enjoy a Friday night like I've never enjoyed it before, when I went to a movie. Now I need to see The Dark Knight, but tell you the truth - I feel like seeing that girl and watching that scene one more time, dig in the Dancing Queen."
"didi-5","7","6","8","13 July 2008"," A strong soundtrack, casting against type, and a few laughs
","As a musical, pure and simple, 'Mamma Mia' has the briefest and silliest of stories, backed up by a large selection of Abba songs (Super Trouper, SOS, Voulez Vous, Gimme Gimme Gimme, Money Money Money, Dancing Queen, The Winner Takes It All, Lay All Your Love On Me, Our Last Summer, Mamma Mia, etc.).<br/><br/>Meryl Streep has a daughter about to marry, and a cloudy past which has left three possible dads - Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). Now you can imagine that when Brosnan was James Bond he never thought he'd be cavorting along to Swedish pop on the big screen - but despite his weak voice, he does OK - the same can be said for Firth, who seems to choose roles with such little discrimination it is no longer a surprise to see him in anything.<br/><br/>Donna (Streep) also has two friends to support her - Julie Walters and Christine Baranski. Walters is as fun as ever, cavorting in her headscarf and singing appallingly; while Baranski is another Samantha from Sex and the City - chasing young barmen and struggling in her high heeled boots. Their scenes together and apart are hilarious - and Streep's singing cannot be faulted.<br/><br/>Is the film any good? It is hard to tell. It is certainly fun, and funny. The direction isn't particularly inspired, nor is the screenplay clever or profound - but then, neither is the music of Abba. Taken purely as bubblegum, feel-good cinema, it does OK, and isn't as bad as you might have expected."

","When I first heard about this movie, I was somewhat excited to see it. It seemed like it would be a fun movie, and being as I love musicals, I was sold on it.<br/><br/>However, I was completely disappointed. The choice for Sophie was poor, she simply wasn't a good actress. She rarely showed emotion in any of the scenes, and talked as if she was acting in a middle school play. I also feel that Meryl Streep was a poor choice for her mother. They desperately tried to turn her into a hot, young mother. A whole new cast might have saved this movie, assuming they got different writers.<br/><br/>The only thing that saved the movie for me were the songs. I loved almost every song sequence. The sound was great, but visually it wasn't. Poorly choreographed, and some of them tried for humor (Dancing Queen sounded great, but the scene was just awkward enough to make me laugh.<br/><br/>I wish I would have left halfway though the movie, but I had nothing better to do that night."

Branski was frightful as usual. Pierce Brosnan's voice was too weak. Stellan was too unattractive to be in this movie. The whole thing looked like an amateur playhouse version of the Broadway musical. Why didn't they chose actors in their forties not sixties. Amanda Seyfried with her bulgy eyes just isn't pretty enough for one of the leads - she is a supporting actress at best.<br/><br/>The pretty scenery didn't even help because the singing was just so bad.

The director of Mama Mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need are ABBA songs.<br/><br/>Just to give a sample of the awfulness: An aging Meryl Streep is shot with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face.

","I will preface this by stating that I am a big fan of movie musicals, be they off-the-wall masterpieces such as 'Dancer in the Dark', top-end popcorn fare ('Hairspray') or Broadway adaptations ('Chicago', 'Evita' et al). So, no-one can accuse me of hating the genre, and blaming my negatives comments on that. Abba are the undisputed monarchs of modern pop, and I adore them. I wanted to adore this movie. I really did. I have to say, I found the stage version contrived and obvious, and didn't enjoy it at all. But I really did think that given the freedom of location shooting and a top-notch casting, this could be something special. How wrong I was.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie made so much money (highest grossing movie musical ever?!) and has a rating as high as 6.9 on IMDb astounds me. It is testament to the popularity - and brilliance - of Abba. It has to be. Because this movie is gobsmackingly bad. Just dreadful. I watched it at the theatre in disbelief. I recently rented it again, following its phenomenal success, just to be sure. Yeah  it sucks.<br/><br/>Blame the director. Not only is it full of ill-advised and badly timed farce, but it is shoddily choreographed and looks like it has been edited with a pair of children's scissors. This is a theater director who is making her first feature film, and boy does it show. Messy is not the word. Clichés work well on stage. They even work well on film, if they are used in context and with a knowing wink. But here... oh my God. I cringed through most of the movie, at the sheer depth of its amateur look and feel. The part where Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan are singing back to back with a wall in between them oh my God. Not a hint of irony. And so-obvious-it-could-be-film-school shot framing and camera 'trickery' beyond description.<br/><br/>The ONLY saving grace is the energy of the cast. Streep, Baranski, Walters and co. launch into this with so much gusto that they manage to make it not just bearable, but actually watchable. The female leads are a joy to watch, and the music itself means that I was certainly not bored. And when I found myself not being swept along by the music, it was fun to marvel at just how badly made a movie with this pedigree can be. And as for Pierce Brosnan. Sweet Jesus, NEVER let that man near a microphone again. EVER. I'm sure his performance was pitched as camp and hammy, but just comes off as amateur and embarrassing.<br/><br/>On the plus side there is one song/set piece that works beautifully  a lovely scene just before the wedding, with Meryl singing 'Slipping Through My fingers' as she helps her daughter get ready. Simple and affecting, it's what the rest of the movie should have been like. And (ironically) a deleted version of 'The Name of the Game' that has a similar feel. They deleted it presumably because it wasn't in keeping with the sheer crapness of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Make sure you have a few drinks first and prepare for what is quite possibly the most badly made big budget movie for quite some time  and you will probably enjoy it."

She does not know who her Father is as her Mother appears to have been somewhat loose. The daughter discovers an old diary of her Mother's that looks as new as if it were just bought. A diary from the time the daughter was conceived. In it the Mother details sexual encounters with 3 different men. The daughter is so happy to read this that she bursts out into joyous song. Joyous song at the discovery that her Mother was somewhat of a tramp. The daughter wants her Father to come to the wedding, but does not know which man it is, so she mails wedding invitations to all three. Are we to believe that their mailing addresses are in the diary? Are we to believe that these men still have the same mailing addresses some 20+ years later? The invitations are disguised as letters from the Mother wanting to see the men. We cut to scenes of these men scrambling to go to her. To travel across the world for a woman they had an affair with over twenty years earlier? These men are not married? No families? <br/><br/>Just a few examples of the things that constantly had me saying ""Ummmm, what?"" All throughout this, the daughter seems quite happy that her Mother was a bit of a tramp, and chose to not use birth control.<br/><br/>Some people may lose themselves in this and see it as a happy musical, but the blatant weaknesses in the story are so glaring that I couldn't let myself enjoy any aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>Watch it yourself and make your own judgements, but do not expect a solid story.

I'll admit I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep, but watching her over-act and fumble her way through this was painful. Actually, watching everyone in this was painful; even the usually good actors failed miserably.

Firstly, I am a HUGE fan of ABBA (have been since the early 70s, even before their Eurovision win) and I so wanted to enjoy this film but I'm afraid that I felt like watching it with my hands covering my face and peeking through my fingers, such was my embarrassment! Overacted to the extreme by all concerned it is truly cringeworthy. The dreadful Julie Walters was the usual awful hammy, mugging Mrs. Overall persona that she always is (you may have guessed that I can't STAND this particular 'national treasure'.I really had to force myself to go to see it knowing that this ghastly woman was in it.) The music is actually tolerably sung by most of the cast (with the exception of Pierce Brosnan) but the 'OMG' hystrionics of the actors to show that they are having 'fun' is just appalling.

Some scenes have you crying with laughter, others have you in floods of tears, because of the emotion & the lyrics of the songs.. I would definitely recommend you go out & watch this. As soon as it began, i was obsessed. I've been back twice to see it, and I'm planning to go again soon. The music will have you singing along, and seriously trying to resist the urge to stand up and dance. :) <br/><br/>Brilliant overall. Definitely recommend it. Enjoy (:"

","I loved the film. Although I am not such a huge fan of Abba, the actors made the songs adorable. The island is amazingly beautiful, the characters are very funny and the plot is touching. Ah, and Pierce Brosnan does not need to sing well: his being on screen is more than enough. Meryl Streep is as good as it gets, as always. Such a contrast to her character in The Devil Wears Prada (she was also excellent there, but the differences between the characters do show how talented she is). Amanda Seyfried shines as the light in the island and sings very well too. Christine Baranski is surprisingly vigorous and so is Julie Waters. It is one of those films that make you feel light and fresh when you leave the theater. Don't miss it."

","I have become a ""Momma Mia! aholic"". The movie is probably the most fantastic movie I have ever seen. I have never seen a movie more than once at a theater. I believe the combinations of music, comedy, near Shakespearean farce, some drama, fantastic acting and unexpected cameos makes this a top, top winner in my opinion. I know it cannot qualify for music awards but it should qualify for other awards. I don't want to spoil it for anyone out there but if you haven't seen it by now, since its been out for over a month, shame on you. Part of the reason why I have gone repeatedly is because I have enjoyed the audience reactions nearly as much as the films multi-talented stars. The audience has been mostly Baby Boomers who can relate to Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan. It has been mostly women but when couples show up, the men hoot with laughter as much as the women. The comments overheard while leaving have always been positive and most are delighted they came; surprisingly so, they say. The movie is also an education in taking chances regarding type-casting. I hope this sets a precedent for the future of all those actors who are waiting for their chance to broaden their scope of their chosen careers. Hurray for this movie on so many levels. Go see it. Now! And again. And again."

","What made the movie enjoyable for me were the music, the visuals, and, surprising to me, Meryl Streep. I usually don't like Streep's movies or her performances. Her films tend to contain subject matter I don't care for, and, often, they are preachy in a way that I find disagreeable. The tendency to underplay a role is normally a desirable quality in an actor. Unfortunately, she underplays to barbiturate levels.<br/><br/>However, Mama Mia is a musical. It is upbeat. It is over-the-top. It made her climb out of her pill-box. It also made her use her voice. She doesn't get to sing enough in the movies she typically makes. Too bad.<br/><br/>Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, is not that suited to the musical genre. Also too bad. His format is usually over-the-top, and he does that well. But, his singing voice is only passable, and, for some unknown reason, he seems to be trying to play a dramatic role here.<br/><br/>For Entertainment: 9.0/10 <br/><br/>Overall Score: 8.7/10"

","I absolutely loved Abba when I was a teenager in the late 70's. With the big names in this movie, I assumed it would be at least average and maybe even good.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie is a huge disappointment. I'm searching for the right words without being too critical, but frankly, they don't exist. No plot, no (singing) talent, and no satisfactory ending. Hard to believe Meryl Street, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth stooped to this level. Without them the movie would have been laughed out of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Please don't waste your $$.

I have purchased & am listening NOW to its CD (& under its influence) which I MUST also suggest for purchase- (whereas it is not filled w/ nonsense instrumental)- but the vocal power, accurate direction & beautiful wonder of the film. It is such a high power, feel-good film. There is nothing here anyone could talk negative about. It is bright, happy, sunny & takes place on a remote Greek Island. ABBA songs envelop the beauty of the musical. The songs are driving, w/ excellent lyrics, great (and fairly complex) composition & background musicality. Regarding the vocals in the songs- the actors/actresses whom the general public do not usually associate w/ being singers are superb (hearing Amanda w/ Rachael & Ashley as back-ups will ""blow your socks off""), Colin can sing beautifully also . Go see it. Forget prior ingrained assumptions of 007 or what exactly people are supposed to be (on film). Meryl Streep played a wonderful hard working guest house owner- singing, & acting (she was simply a beautiful & genuine ""down to earth person""). Everyone did a wonderful job in the film & I'm sure it was a wonderful film to produce. I love everyone associated w/ the film & silently (& unobtrusively) Praise Tom Hanks as the Executive Producer. I wish I had more of a part than just being a passive viewer. Your heart may be changed forever if you see this movie & take it to your heart.

","I'd been putting off going to the cinema to see this film for weeks on end. From seeing the trailer, my first thought was no way. Even though it seemed like the ultimate chick flick, which is usually my perfect genre to watch, I didn't fancy it. However, a week later my Mum asked if I'd go with her, so obviously I agreed. We never went straight away with wanting to see other current blockbusters, such as Batman etc. So I'd kept on putting it off even though everyone I work with had seen it at least once and didn't have a bad word to say about it!<br/><br/>So about 4 or 5 weeks after release i booked the tickets, and with only 2 showings i chose the 8, thinking it would be rather quiet. When we got there we had been put in the largest screen and had to queue for about 20 minutes because it was so popular! People struggling to find seats etc..<br/><br/>It was absolutely amazing! It was so different to how it had been advertised and how I expected it to be. I will admit during one earlier scene (Seyfield singing with her mother's diary)I thought it was far too cheesy to handle. But after that I was hooked.<br/><br/>I really wanted to dance when the girls were dancing to 'dancing queen!' The entire film was just really fast paced and happy. I enjoyed every song, and I think Amanda Seyfield has a beautiful voice. I'm not a fan of Abba, but i loved the entire soundtrack. I loved how there was a middle aged guy sat next to me, trying really hard not to let on that he was enjoying the film. Foot tapping etc.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't expect was the cry during the film. I don't really cry at the cinema but I couldn't stop weeping on the scene when Donna and her daughter are getting ready for her wedding. I thought it added a really serious moment to the film, making me appreciate it more. <br/><br/>Oh and another thing. The location! Wow."
"PipAndSqueak","4","13","22","13 July 2008"," Cringeworthy
","It's quite a feat for the scenery to steal the show but that's what happens in this dreadful transfer from the stage to film. I tend to avoid musicals apart from the Gilbert and Sullivan type - deliberately tongue in cheek. However, I have a feeling Mamma Mia is a fine stage musical - it just doesn't work when straight actors take the main roles. The piece requires singers primarily as there is very little acting...a bit of dancing is called for but that is typical for a stage musical and there are plenty of performers who specialise in this genre. Streep and Walters are just so wooden it is unbelievable. Brosnan can't sing and Firth, what was he doing there? The daughter character comes over as a 13year old but is supposed to be 20 or so. So silly. This film represents a missed opportunity. The costumes are so much better than the dreadful stuff ABBA really wore, and the Greek island looks really enticing. Other than that there is nothing of merit."

","To begin with, please understand that for this story to have any plausibility, the Meryl Streep character would have had to have slept with three guys all within about three days - either a guy a night or a four-way, or something like that. Pretty romantic, huh? But however good (or not) musically, certainly one major demographic of ABBA's original audience were those suburbanites and yuppies and former hippies who really did believe, at the time, that multiple partners were kind of romantic, and could enhance an ""open relationship"" with one's significant other: ABBA provided the soundtrack for many 'singles' bars' and 'swingers' parties. There are a lot of women of a certain age who really aren't quite certain who the fathers of their children are, thanks partly due to the thrilling sounds of ABBA.<br/><br/>I don't agree with the recent reviewer who referred to the older women of this film as ""whores."" Men and women have the same right to the sexual expression and enjoyment of their choosing. What does disturb me in this film is two fold - that it romanticizes choices such as these and that it insists that somehow they represent progress - all the Greek women in the background appear suddenly enlightened by experiencing the dysfunctional sit-com/soap-opera of the main characters' dilemma.<br/><br/>And wouldn't it have been a nice ironic tough if the way to discover 'real dad' would be to check to see who was spreading the STD around at the time? That would certainly have been worth a few laughs, and a nice new ABBA song, huh? ""Now I've got sores everyplace/ my nose is dropping off my face/ Hernandoooo!"" As for the young woman's response to the problem - who's the real father? - she expresses no real anger or angst or hurt or loss, just a childishly voyeuristic enjoyment of her mother's past adventures. She also doesn't know any science (and neither does the script-writer), since the simple answer to her basic question is really available through DNA cross-matching, which makes the whole story of the film pointless.<br/><br/>Given that this is a fantasy for older women, I suppose this would be forgivable - if it were a well-made fantasy - but it's not. It's gaudy, noisy, poorly designed, poorly photographed, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, It is not even amusing in a 'bad but funny' sort of way. It is visually and aurally assaultive, and emotionally and intellectually insulting. I honestly cannot think of a worst movie experience I've ever had. Maybe the disgustingly sadistic Hershel Lewis film ""10,000 Maniacs."" But that film went on to develop a cult following, and this one has apparently made millions.<br/><br/>Well, that's showbiz - you want it to be an art, but it's only another form of prostitution. Maybe that recent reviewer was right - not about the characters but the cast and crew involved in this hideous con-job. Suckers, get in line - the Brooklyn Bridge goes up for sale next."

Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are scene stealer's as Rosie and Tanya-Their individual musical numbers are hysterical!! Be warned though, the three men(Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) playing Sam, Harry and Bill do not sing very well, but thats part of their charm. They were obviously cast for their acting and the fact the characters do not sing well only adds to the fun! Dominic Cooper as Skye is a vocal revelation-he actually can carry a tune and is quite sexy to boot!! Listen , bottom line is this-""Mamma Mia"" will not be everyone's cup of tea-the local paper critic here gave it 1 star!!

Did it not occur to the film makers that they should actually find people who can sing????? It doesn't matter that they act well if they can't sing. THe Broadway show is a wonderful fluff musical, but the songs are so poorly executed that you can't enjoy them AT ALL. And the musical numbers are sooooooo poorly directed, they are laughable. The movie has a great look, and some of the cast make me laugh (a bit). But the movie sucks. Anyone who thinks this is a good film simply cannot look past their ABBA fetish.

And they most surely did! The movie is so much fun, while managing to bring out feelings related with love of different kinds, friendship, youthful spontaneity and coping with middle age. The singing wasn't perfect - I still can't decide on the proper word to describe Brosnan's attempt at it - but no one in the theater seemed to mind. The acting, especially from Streep was just simply enjoyable,the script had many exceptionally good moments, the music familiar and uplifting, the scenery was beautiful, but at the end of it all, it was FUN!

It's really very simple; there is nothing in the movie that can be enjoyed by a middle-aged heterosexual male, literally nothing. That isn't true with the typical chick flick such as ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""Ghost"". There was something there for an adult guy; a decent song, good jokes or humorous situations. None of that is there in ""Mamma Mia"". So among my friends the movie has become a running joke on how I can be tortured. Just pry my eyes open and force me to watch Mamma Mia.

Although, when the first reviews of the film were all 10 stars (fancy that - wink wink Hollywood suits), many people would have been suckered into paying to see it.<br/><br/>It really is beyond bad. Meryl Streep plays a character who ""got around"" when she was younger, so she doesn't know who the father of her daughter is. Fast forward and the daughter is getting married, but wants her father there so noses around in her mother's diary and sings songs that have nothing to do with the plot at the time- but hey they're ABBA songs so we're just supposed to go along with it. She finds out she has 3 potential fathers and invites them all to the wedding for some reason.<br/><br/>The 3 potential fathers turn up and more singing - that has nothing to do with the plot at the time - happens. Much cringing later for those who like a plot that doesn't have songs attached just because they have to be there....the girl doesn't get married and wow what a coincidence the mother and her two friends have 3 men (the fathers) to choose from. Except one of them is gay and the third woman likes to have flings with younger men and then sing songs about it.<br/><br/>The mother marries one of the potential fathers, just because he turned up and she loved him once - so naturally she must still love him.

The bad casting resulting from Mrs. Streep age range hits an all time low with Pierce Brosnan, who can't sing a three note melody without falling out of tune, with a voice that has no place singing any lead role.<br/><br/>The Greek locations and the younger casting are marvelous, too bad nobody told the producers that there are actually fine actresses and actors who can sing, and at least, 15 years younger than the average of Mammma Mia's stars."

I want a semi-getaway from reality. <br/><br/>I want romance, dancing, laughing, great music & fun (with a bit of seriousness to it - but not taking itself too seriously). In my opinion, Mamma Mia delivers that. <br/><br/>I love it when the audience is swaying to the music, smiling throughout the film, leaving the theater with big grins on their faces & humming the songs on the way out. That's entertainment, folks, & money well spent at the movie theater. <br/><br/>BTW, this is not a chick flick - it treats men with respect & personally the term ""chick flick"" is way overused.

She has kept the movie at a lively pace that it's never boring. I really don't get what all the complaints are about. She did a great job! Period.<br/><br/>Meryl is wonderful.

Julie Walters is so hilarious...and how come no one talks about Christine Baranski's eye-popping splits in ""Does Your Mother Know""! Amazing! The ABBA songs doesn't feel forced at all as some critics foolishly argue. Catherine Johnson's story is simple and I believe the whole team knew that the ABBA songs were going to be the star and the crowd-puller.<br/><br/>Of course I wished some ABBA songs were written in the movie like ""One Man, One Woman"", ""As Good As New"" or ""If It Wasn't For The Nights""...but then it would make for a 3 hour movie! I won't complain!!! The movie's general release here in Malaysia is Sept 25 but they usually have sneak previews one week earlier. Overall I'd say the crowd was mixed - males and females almost equal in number, mostly over 30s and it was like everyone knew the songs, laughed at the right spots (well, most of the time anyway!), tapped their feet and some were even bobbing their heads!

"zardoz-13","10","4","5","19 August 2008"," ""Mamma Mia!"" Says (Sings) It ALL!
","The new Meryl Streep & Pierce Brosnan musical ""Mamma Mia!"" qualifies as a feel-good, passionate celebration of life, love, and happiness rolled up into a screwball comedy of errors. Executive producers Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks obtained the rights to the long-running West End London stage play that knits the songs of the Swedish rock group ABBA into the narrative. ""Mamma Mia!"" has been running on stages around the world since 1999. Indeed, ABBA's 1975 chart-topper ""Mamma Mia!"" was the inspiration for the title. Although the band provided their popular disco-era songs, this musical comedy concentrates on a cast of characters that has nothing to do with ABBA. You could compare ""Mamma Mia!"" with the somewhat similar 2007 musical ""Across the Universe"" that integrated Beatles tunes into its tragedy-laden plot, except ""Mamma Mia!"" is ten times better.<br/><br/>Originally, British playwright Catherine Johnson adapted the ""Mamma Mia!"" plot from the obscure 1968 Gina Lollobrigida comedy ""Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell."" Despite its effervescent plot, however, you have to groove on ABBA's tunes because Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus's lyrics permeate the plot. Furthermore, people that loathe disco music should avoid this musical like the plague. Otherwise, this chick flick ranks as first-rate entertainment, and Johnson's screenplay empowers women and ripples with surprises galore. English director Phyllida Lloyd knew a thing or two about ""Mamma Mia!"" before she helmed it because she directed the Broadway play version.<br/><br/>Blond, never-married, single-mom, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep of ""The Devil Wears Prada""), operates a quaint little hotel, the Villa Donna, perched atop a mountain on the tiny remote Greek island of Kalokairi in the Mediterranean Sea. Donna's 20-year-old daughter Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried of ""Veronica Mars"") lives with her, and Sophie is preparing for her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper of ""The Escapist"") at the hotel. Sophie wants desperately to know the identity of the father that she never knew so that he can give her away at her wedding. She swipes her mom's secret diary and discovers three prime suspects. Although she has no idea which one of the three sired her, Sophie decides to mail them wedding invitations. She convinces herself that once she lays eyes on them that she will recognize her dad. Divorced architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan of ""GoldenEye""), rich investment banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth of ""Bridget Jones' Diary""), and globetrotting Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgård of ""Good Will Hunting) all receive Sophia's invitations and rush off to Kalokairi. Mistakenly, the three men think that Donna has invited them to the wedding. Anyway, Sam and Harry miss the last ferry for the island, but Bill owns a sail boat and welcomes them aboard. They reach the island and Sophie intercepts them. The surpriseas it turns outis on Sophie. She cannot figure out which is her father! Meanwhile, Donna's close friends, a writer named Rosie (Julie Walters of ""Educating Rita"") and a wealthy thrice divorced dame Tanya (Christine Baranski of ""Chicago""), arrive for Sophie's wedding. Desperately, Sophie hides the three guys in a goat house to keep her mother from learning about their presence on the island. Eventually, Donna discovers Sam, Harry, and Bill. Initially, she is overjoyed that the three have come to Kalokairi, but then she takes a different attitude and asks them to leave. Of course, they cannot and won't at this point because they want to see who sired Sophie. They retreat to Bill's boat. Sophie learns things about her hippie mom that she didn't know. Young Donna indulged in a carefree, rebellious, lifestyle that included lots of sex with all three men at different times. Donna knew that she was pregnant with Sophie not long after her last lover left. She refused to share the information about the birth of her daughter with Sophie's dad. Moreover, Donna's stern mother refused to take her pregnant daughter back so Donna stuck around in the Greece and had Sophie. The mystery that everybody tries to resolve for the rest of the action is the identity of Sophie's dad.<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia!"" radiates rainbows of infectious energy, in part owing to its array of ABBA songs. The champagne frothy, transcendental music of ABBA imbues this innocuous movie with lighter-than-helium buoyancy. Indeed, audiences could literally dance in the aisles for the movie seems like a concert with a plot. Director Phyllida Lloyd keeps those few quiet, introspective moments of intimacy to a minimum. Although ""Mamma Mia"" is a chick flick, it is neither a heartbreaker nor a tearjerker. Nobody dies from a sudden bout of cancer. Furthermore, this madcap comedy of errors doesn't have a dull moment. Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski must have been dosed up with Ritalin. Rarely do they sit around and talk. They are dancing, singing, and cavorting about a scenic Greek island, and they look like that had a terrific time. What makes ""Mamma Mia!"" so enjoyable is the elaborate way that the ABBA tunes have been worked in to compliment the film's themes. The cast, especially 59-year old Streep, does a great job of belting out chartbusters like ""Super Trouper,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Knowing Me, Knowing You,"" ""Thank You for the Music,"" ""Money, Money, Money,"" ""The Winner Takes It All,"" ""Voulez Vous,"" ""I Have a Dream,"" and ""SOS."" Moreover, the resolution to the mystery of Sophie's dad and the surprises that occur as a result will keep you guessing. If you missed taking a summer vacation, you can take a chance on ""Mamma Mia!"" The lush Greek scenery, the entertaining storyline, and the enchanting performances will transport you out of the doldrums."

Julie Walters and Meryl Streep steal the show completely, they're worth watching and Streep's version of ""The winner takes it all"" is stunning.<br/><br/>The film is a sure hit with women and most gay men, but won't satisfy the needs of most film lovers. Give it a try."

","An excellent cast, beautiful location, and absolutely fantastic singing and dancing! When I went to see this movie the movie theater was full. All the way through people were laughing and clapping. Meryl Streep was perfect for the role as was Amanda Seyfried. Julie Walters playing Rosie stole the show! In my opinion she was the best character. Her jokes and personality got most of the laughs.<br/><br/>The singing and choreography was amazing. Their adaption of the songs from Abba was spot on and sounded wonderful! The main theme of the movie fitted perfectly with all of the songs.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to everyone! Even if your not an Abba fan check out this movie! You will not be disappointed!"
"fleming617","10","4","5","18 July 2008"," The movie is FUN!
","The best way to watch Mamma Mia! is not just as a movie but for what its origins are: A musical.... It makes the movie all that more entertaining! Meryl Streep is adorable and her voice is almost like her acting - good but not over the top (of course, her acting skills are way better than good) :) The entire cast looked as if they completely enjoyed making the movie and you can totally feel their energy. (Hey, if I were able to stay in Greece for a few months, I'd be happily singing my bum off, too!) The movie added in traditional Greek dancing and local extras in tune to ABBA songs which was a great touch. I heart Meryl Streep even more after this release!"
"shiftyeyeddog","8","4","5","14 July 2008"," Surprisingly Infectious Fun
","In my mind, this movie had a lot of negatives to overcome: Christine Baranski, Meryl Streep singing, a cast that didn't exactly scream ""hit"", ...the music of ABBA, for pete's sake! But as difficult as it is to say, I'll say it.... I am a heterosexual male, and I enjoyed Mamma Mia! <br/><br/>There's plenty to like - Amanda Seyfried's infectious joy (and beauty), the stunning Greek isle scenery, and yes, the music. It won me over practically from the start. The positives far outweighed the negatives - in fact, the negatives turned out not to be. <br/><br/>Abba's music never did much for me as pop songs, but in the context of a musical, they work quite well. There are a couple numbers I think could have been left out, specifically Baranski's ""Does Your Mother Know"" and Streep and Brosnan's ""Winner Takes It All"", but even those weren't bad. The singing is good pretty much across the board. Even the weakest singer, Pierce Brosnan, did a surprisingly good job. His voice has a certain Peter Gabriel quality to it (with a dash of Randy Newman). <br/><br/>For those friends of mine that refuse to see anything not considered a ""manly"" movie (and you know who you are), skip it. But for everyone else, take a chance on Mamma Mia. You may find yourself tapping your toes and smiling along."
"wido1966","10","4","5","14 July 2008"," A great feel-good movie to sing along to
","I just went to see it. And i was not disappointed at all. Meryl Streep was so funny and she sang the songs with so much emotions. Pierce, Colin and Stellan don't have great voices but they fitted in so great. You could the pleasure and fun they had making the movie splashing off the screen. Julie Walters was a absolute delight. And Christine Baranski (Cybill) played her character absolutely wonderful. The storyline was okay but the whole of the movie was so much fun, I even caught myself singing the songs out loud. I have one advice, don't go running away at the end-titles cause there is more to see. ABBA lovers have to go and see this movie. Even Benny and Bjorn had a small cameo."
"Pranksalot","4","12","21","15 July 2008"," A So-So Experience. Sigh...Could Have Been Better...
","I never heard about Mamma Mia or any Abba songs until I saw a teaser of this movie. But I have to say I love musical films and I always give it a chance before I judge it. Don't bash or flame me, but this musical film is a so-so experience. I would put Mamma near the bottom of the list for modern musical movies alongside with Rent and Meet the Producers. Chicago, Sweeny Todd, and Hairspray were like WOW. They took me out of this world into somewhere new and enjoyable. <br/><br/>Most musical movies I seen always have a spectacular musical number in the beginning. The beginning of this movie failed to entice me. Amanda Seyfield have the sweetest voice, but she have little to no screen presence. Whenever she appears, I don't see any star quality in her. Her facial expressions are horrible and sometimes I can see the stupidness of her character Karen from Mean Girls in certain scenes. There are many dialogues in the film where she failed to deliver it with justice. I can imagine other actresses who could recite lines that would hit it out of the ballpark. Gimme, Gimme, Gimme or Money, Money, Money...whatever that song is called was frighteningly scary. I like cheesy in moderation, but that song number went a little too far and did not fit in with the movie. The director needs to make many of the scenes more realistic. In theater you can go flamboyant and electric, but in movies you need to tone it down a bit. Donna's friends are hilarious and they steal every scene they appear in. Meryl Streep was good in several memorable scenes but her forte is not in comedy. Her feeble attempts at comedy, nice try but go back to what you are good at. I give her credit in her singing though. Dancing Queen number, poorly choreograph. I cringe when Meryl jumped on the bed and when the women all jumped down into the water. They did not take the title ""dancing queen"" to heart. I don't consider all the Greek women waving their hands, pointing their fingers around, and jumping really dancing. Sophie's love interest acted way to cocky in his first musical number of the movie. Amanda's voice was amazing in that number. But the part with all those swimmer dancers made me want to vomit. I crack out laughing when Pierce (Sam) sang. I can't imagine how bad his singing really is without technology enhancing it. It must be a great deal of ugliness. I wonder if the background music added later on in his song is to somewhat drown out his voice. Christine was a knock out in her song after Pierce's song. But at the end of the number when all the guys collapse into the ground, I cringed at that part. I don't understand why Sophie's fiancé is making such a big deal about Sophie wanting to know who her father is. Sophie and Sky chemistry in the movie is rather weak. I love the song that Donna sang to Sam. It was Streep only decent number, very romantic and sad and emotional. When Sam shouted her name ""DONNA"" I again cringed in that number. The scene where Sophie's 3 possible fathers give away Sophie was wickedly funny and memorable. But I was like WTF when Sophie axed away the wedding. All the hard work and trouble put into the wedding. I would understand if she doesn't love him, but she is planning to go on a somewhat honeymoon anyways with her fellow. This movie has little to no morals. I would consider before even taking kids to see this movie and if I did...I would explain to them afterwards what the characters in the movie did wrong and how you should not follow their examples with their own life. Sam asking Donna to marry him immediately is non-sequitur. They have been separated from each other for many years, they need to re-date and get to know each other again. This is a horrible clique done in many TV shows. Pierce singing to Donna right when he proposed was dreadfully awful. The song number at the dinner table was hilarious! Colin firth was very charismatic in the film; I wished he was Sam instead of Pierce. I notice that the cast had fun making the movie so I commend them for their efforts, but energy was rather lacking in some parts of the movie. The scenery background was breathtaking. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is a forgettable piece of fluff. I would not waste 6-10 dollars for this film at the theater. I would wait for it to come out to DVD to check it out from the library for free or borrowing it from a friend or I guess you can view it online. I wouldn't say this movie is a waste of time but I would only view it once. <br/><br/>2 out of 5 stars. It is a rather generous score. It is just that I love it when the cast put out effort and have fun in a movie regardless of how good it is. I think this movie could have been better with a better director and choreographer as well as replacing some of the actors. Streep was decent in the movie. Amanda Seyfield has a lovely voice, but that is not enough."

It is worse than an Allanna Morrissette song, the kind that whines and moans from start to finish about how men and relationships have not been fair to her.

","Having seen & thoroughly enjoyed it on stage several times, most comments (pro & con) are based on the comparison to this. (I would give anything to have the first stage performance I saw on DVD!)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>The casting of everyone except Meryl Streep (including Pierce Brosnan), and particularly Amanda Seyfried - she was cute and enthusiastic, and her singing was fresh and nicely in character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The setting and the scenery - gorgeous!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music and the book (not unique to the movie, of course, but a huge part of what made this musical the success that it is!)</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Didn't like Meryl Streep's acting OR singing. (The singing could have been acceptable, but I've never seen a seasoned pro over-act so much = see ""Winner Takes it All"" or numerous other scenes). To some extent, in musicals, you need to let the music do the talking.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Pierce Brosnan's singing. Sometimes it's a GOOD thing to either dub the stars, or select stars that can sing. Actually, while on the subject of the singing in general, whether you are an ABBA fan or not, nobody can deny that Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad could belt it out. One of the pleasures of the stage play was that they were great SINGERS. The closing mini-concert in the stage play was a treat - a chance to see some of the cast really cutting loose in a flashy performance. The analogous scene in the movie was a parody of that, at best.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Continuity - the screen version didn't flow as nicely as the stage play. Maybe it's because they didn't have to pace it to a live audience, or maybe it's because the editing chopped it up too much, or maybe they just screwed up.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I didn't think the ""Take a Chance"" or ""Does Your Mother Know"" scenes were nearly as funny as they should have been (or maybe I was just disappointed with the whole thing by then).</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, you can probably tell, I was disappointed."
"furex","1","5","7","4 December 2008"," Gameplan: 1) Sing Abba 2) ??? 3) Profit
","If you want proof of how a movie could be drawn out of thin air just connecting the dots which are really songs in a band's catalog, do the right thing.<br/><br/>Choose Beatles and watch Julie Taymor's excellent Across the Universe. But if you wanna forget the nam war, and take a bite out of a fake flower power cold leftovers and feel the plasticky taste on your tongue, savour how far you can push a silly style without a bare trace of some substance, then definitely watch this.<br/><br/>In this badly casted, poorly sung and worse written movie, everything seems out of place. The first half hour goes about with everybody screaming on the top of their lungs and trying hard to convey a feeling of sunny joyfulness while brutally forcing their faces into meaningless atrocious expressions and squeezing their eyeballs out of their skulls, then again some more shrieking for good.<br/><br/>You would believe it couldn't go more downhill than that, but then a plot tries to unfold (and utterly fails), because of the sheer nothingness it is made of. Vocal performances that you could pull out under shower (and I'll just say Brosnan), leave you plenty of time to appreciate the gorgeous backdrop which is Greece, and also a bit more to ask yourself why this had to be done, really.<br/><br/>The vacuum-packed silliness of the story is completely revealed by the end (which ideally should have been the marriage), and then it will be full clear why it doesn't really end there.<br/><br/>It's just an excuse to sing some Abba. And make money. See the summary."
"marebear4610","8","5","7","9 October 2008"," Fun! Fun! Fun!
","I have a difficult time imagining anyone not being uplifted by this movie, if only for the music. I was 17 yrs old when ""Dancing Queen"" was popular on the radio, so of course, this movie would appeal to me. But my daughters (ages 20, 16 and 14) all enjoyed it as well. Even my husband, who really isn't a fan of musicals, didn't complain about this film (I dragged him to it on our anniversary - the film's opening day).<br/><br/>I get a kick out of all the people that come on this board to bash this movie when clearly they don't like musicals by their own admission. That would be like me critiquing a horror film - I despise horror films so it would be hard for me to find anything redeeming about one. So why people insist on seeing a film in a genre that they knowingly do not like or appreciate, and then proceed to criticize it, is beyond me! Anyway, regarding the movie - Here's the good: 1) The location and cinematography - absolutely breathtaking! It makes a person want to seriously consider Greece as their next vacation destination. I'm sure the Board of Tourism in Greece couldn't be happier with this film. 2) Singing talent - while many have roundly criticized the choices for the leads in this film, I find the fact that Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan and a few others aren't trained singers rather endearing. In fact, I found Meryl Streep's rendition of ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" more emotional than any stage version I've seen and even the original song. And to improve upon Agnetha Faltskog's voice/version is a tall order indeed! The young actor/singer who plays Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is beautiful and has a lovely, angelic voice. Visually, she is a believable casting choice to play Meryl Streep's daughter and I thought they had good on-screen mother-daughter chemistry. 3) The Plot - Yes, it's thin and silly and frothy, but that's what makes it so fun! I mean, think about it. Any time you watch a musical, you have to suspend disbelief. When in real life does anyone ever belt out a song and dance in the middle of a conversation (with backup singers to boot)? And besides, who amongst any of this film's viewers doesn't know and understand the fact that this plot was created from stringing a number of unrelated ABBA tunes together? Since the process of matching music to the plot is reversed from the normal way, I'm amazed that they were able to create as cohesive a story as they did. 4) The dancing bachelor party boys - Yea! the film left the flipper-flaunting boys (from the stage version) in the scene for ""Lay All Your Love on Me"". I looked around the theater when the boys first appeared and I couldn't find a single person who was not laughing or at least grinning from ear to ear! <br/><br/>With the good, comes the bad - 1) While overall I think Meryl Streep did a wonderful job, her rendition of ""The Winner Takes It All"" (the other tear-jerker song in this movie) will never allow me to listen to that song in quite the same way. Vocally, she was decent, but I'll forever be haunted by the odd hand gestures she made while singing it. The lyrics describing the breakup/betrayal are so powerful that perhaps closeups of Meryl's and Pierce's faces would have served that scene better than Meryl's over-emoting with her hands. I found the original video for the song on YouTube. In that video, the pain and anguish of the song were so beautifully conveyed by Agnetha Faltskog in just her eyes and facial expressions - no awkward hand gestures needed! 2) While I applaud the inclusion of Pierce Brosnan in this film (it never hurts to have an attractive man on the screen), perhaps the roles for Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan could have been reversed. Pierce Brosnan's voice is clearly not awful or even cringe-inducing, but it's not a particularly strong voice, and as such is not really strong enough to carry the two songs (""SOS"" and ""When All is Said and Done"") that the role required. I could definitely have seen Pierce Brosnan singing ""Our Last Summer"" instead.<br/><br/>To sum it up, if you like the music of ABBA and enjoy exuberant celebrations of life without the need to over-analyze every detail, then you'll enjoy this movie! If not, then choose a different movie.<br/><br/>Not since Grease have I seen a musical that's as much fun to watch as it must have been to make!"

She turned up to be an excellent ""Donna"". She is fun, funny and she gives an excellent emotional performance of ""The Winner Takes It All"".

","One of the unique aspects of musical theater is the ability of a good production to transform the theater stage to the location of the action with a few painted curtains, lighting and set decorations. Of course, the audience generally buys into this transformation since they have an idea of what to expect when they walk into the theater. With 'Mamma Mia', as with most other movie musicals, the actual location sets make it much easier for the audience to buy into the movie. This movie's location sets and scenery are absolutely glorious and are one of the highlights of the show.<br/><br/>Ane then there is Meryl Streep. What a wonderful lady and actress. Some have complained she is overage-cast for her role, but to me, her singing and dancing abilities do not suffer at all. If one blanks out the fact she is 55, it's obvious she is up to the role and has a great time in it it. I thought her version of ""Winner Takes It All"" (which according to the IMDb trivia was done in one take) was right on and went well beyond ABBA's pop version.<br/><br/>My only complaints with the movie are that two of my favorite songs ('I do! I do! I do' and 'Thank you for the music' from the production were shortened or placed over the credits. Oh well...<br/><br/>My recommendation is to see this movie and be prepared for a couple of hours of musical escapism and watch one of the world's best actors perform at the top of her craft."

Her acting, whilst not on a par with The Devil Wears Prada, was excellent.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried was a joy to watch, her voice was again excellent and she played her part with a great finesse that no other young actress could've brought to the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Brosnan was slightly miscast with his voice being pretty average in relation to the rest of the cast. Julie Walters did Britain proud with her best role for years & a rather unusual looking Christine Baranski provided her fair share of laughs.<br/><br/>Whilst having a fairly thin storyline, the cinematography and the execution of the entire film was brilliant.<br/><br/>This is a complete joy to watch."
"LoneWolfAndCub","7","5","7","24 July 2008"," Feel-good musical at its best!
","When you hear the name ABBA, do your eyes light up? Does it send you into a frenzy of dancing and joy? Well then, stop reading this review and go see this movie! Conversely, does the mention of ABBA send you running in the opposite direction in fear? If so, then why are you reading this? In short, Mamma Mia! is a film for ABBA-fans and even people who enjoy feel-good movies at their best! Musical is not a genre I usually go for (the select few I like are probably the most obvious: ""Chicago,"" ""West Side Story,"" ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Singin' in the Rain."" However, Mamma Mia! succeeds in every way a musical should do. With stunning locations, an excellent cast and toe-tapping musical numbers, it should strike a note with most people.<br/><br/>The story itself is a piece of light fluff. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) lives with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep), in a run-down hotel on an idyllic Greek island. She is engaged to the handsome Sky (Dominic Cooper), but wants nothing more than to have her father show up to the wedding. Unfortunately, she had no idea who he is, until she reads her mum's diary and narrows it down to three men: Bill (Stellan Skarsgård), Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan) and Harry Bright (Colin Firth). Sophie proceeds to invite all three to her wedding and naturally, chaos ensues. The story follows a seemingly predictable pattern, but honestly, too much enjoyment is to be had for that to really prove annoying.<br/><br/>Director Phyllida Lloyd does something which often determines mediocre musicals from good ones; and that is to seamlessly work the songs into the story. Every song becomes relevant to the plot and not one seems out of place. Also, all the actors can sing well, and this helps draw one into the movie. Most people have ragged Brosnan's singing ability, and while it is not perfect by any means, it is tolerable. Streep is a natural stand-out, who just throws herself into her role (obviously not taking herself seriously at all). Her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All"" is definitely a note-worthy scene. Likewise, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, who play Donna's friends Tanya and Rosie, are complete scene stealers. They can sing and dance and do not feel like supporting actresses at all (both there numbers are incredibly catchy). Seyfried was a great choice for lead actresses, she is not only gorgeous, but has a fantastic voice and just exudes charm. I can not forget the guys, though, Cooper, who plays the tanned husband is not on screen a lot, but is a competent actor. Firth and Skarsgård are as good as Brosnan, all three are funny and obviously had an awesome time making the film.<br/><br/>The music, is well, what you would expect from an ABBA musical. All the numbers are very well filmed, especially ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Lay all Your Love on Me."" Those two would easily have one dancing in the aisle and singing along. Mamma Mia! was filmed on location in Greece and what a sight it is! All the colours are vibrant, the sea sparkling and the beaches dazzling. Mamma Mia! is without a doubt one of the best feel-good films of the year that even manages to provide some genuine laughs at times. I say give it a go if you need some cheering up or you love your ABBA! <br/><br/>3½/5"

We both never stopped laughing and giggling in aloud, along with a load of other women (and about a handful of grumpy looking men) We also got very touched and emotional at the points where Glenn sing's to Sophie, and also where she does an absolutely amazing rendition of 'The Winner Take's It All' it was a spine tingling moment.

Unfortunately my scepticism was entirely justified. What on earth was Meryl Streep thinking of? To say nothing of Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgaerd and Julie Walters.<br/><br/>The only saving graces which cause me to give it the frankly generous 4/10 are the scenery (1 star), the original songs (1 star), and the excellent dance with flippers on the jetty (2 stars) which was absolutely the only point in the film where I actually laughed.<br/><br/>Streep just about gets away with her singing. Pierce Brosnan was embarrassing and I think I need therapy to get over Colin Firth sitting on a boat and strumming a guitar singing a soppy song.<br/><br/>I am so pleased that I didn't pay to see this.

This movie had me singing and dancing in my seat and was simply a wonderful feel good kind of movie. The cast made it look as though they had great fun during the filming. Who would have known that Ms. Streep could sing too? We should have known. Her strengths and diversity as an actress are unmatchable. Pierce Brosnan and Collin Firth were convincing and inspiring in their roles. Julie Walters demonstrated her ability to portray a free spirit, with wild energy and Christine Baranski did an excellent job as well.

And I love the scene where the women in the village dropped their chores and joined the ""Dancing Queen."" You suddenly feel like you are witnessing the joy of youthfulness, no matter how old you are. And of course the loving looks in Ms. Streep's eyes when she helps her daughter prepare for the wedding - how did those years go by? In fact, this was the overwhelming emotion I felt throughout the movie. That youth is so beautiful, and that one is never too old to feel or relive the joys of youth.<br/><br/>The last song included was ""Thank You For The Music."" (If you did not hear this one, you left too early!!) And I stayed until the very end, feeling exactly the way the lyrics say. ""What would life be - without a song or a dance what are we?"" And you know what? After the movie, I went home and dug out the ""ABBA Gold"" and ""More ABBA Gold"" CDs. They have been sitting idle for years and years. They've never sounded better than tonight.<br/><br/>Warmly recommended - go with your family, your best friends, or by yourself.

","When my dad and I went to see Mamma Mia, the cinema was packed, almost to the same extent as when we went to see Hancock on its opening day. However, there was one crucial difference between the audiences for Hancock and Mamma Mia. Whilst the audience for Hancock left the cinema with a slight air of ""oh, it was alright"", the audience burst into applause at the end of Mamma Mia, including me and my dad. It was unlike any audience reaction towards a movie that I have seen for a long time, and it was undoubtedly deserved.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia is the most all-out fun that you could possibly have at the cinema so far this summer, and I can't really see how any film is going to top it in that department for the rest of the holiday season. It isn't preachy, it isn't overly serious and it doesn't drag. Instead, it is filled to the brim with wonderful performances, amazing scenery and, of course, utterly joyous music. It is very cheesy, and some of the dance sequences are a bit pedestrian, but the music is so brilliant that I found it too hard to criticise the film's flaws. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple. 20-year-old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to marry her boyfriend Sky (Dominic Cooper). However, there is one thing that would make her wedding perfect, which is if the father that she has never met could walk her down the aisle. Upon discovering her mother's (Meryl Streep) diary, Sophie discovers that her mum was with three guys around the same time that she became pregnant. Not knowing which man is her father, Sophie decides to invite all three men to the wedding and see what happens. <br/><br/>The ABBA music is easily the driving force behind Mamma Mia's appeal. As soon as a song kicks off, the film shoots to a whole new level. The songs are performed with just the right amount of easy-going charm and emotion by the cast (most notably Meryl Streep, whose renditions of ""Mamma Mia!"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"" are easily the musical highlights), and are punctuated with enough decent choreography and hilarious humour to keep the energy at that marvellously high level for the whole duration of the song. To hear and see iconic numbers such as ""Dancing Queen"", ""Mamma Mia!"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"" being performed with such infectious energy and pizazz is just magnificent.<br/><br/>The cast look like they're having so much fun that it is foolish not to join in. Meryl Streep steals the show as Donna Sheridan, delivering a terrific performance full of emotion and zest whilst also showing off her surprisingly powerful vocal talents. Streep's rendition of ""The Winner Takes It All"" is pure perfection, and is full of beautifully conveyed emotion. Those who were sceptic about Streep's singing will be blown away. As three of Donna's previous suitors, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard all look like they're having a great time, and all three make an admirable attempt at singing, something which they're not entirely used to. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are absolutely hilarious in their scene-stealing performances as Donna's best mates, whilst Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper are wonderfully charming as the two young lovebirds at the centre of the plot. Much of the charm of the cast is that they feel so natural in this environment. Nobody seems to be giving a forced performance. They are just having some good, old-fashioned fun, and a lot of it.<br/><br/>Technically, the film shines. The scenery is beautiful, truly capturing the sense of love in paradise. The dance sequences are brilliantly executed, and they feel a lot more natural than, say, the calculated musical sequences in Chicago. Finally, the direction and screenplay are fantastic. This isn't surprising, seeing as the director and writer of the film version also worked on the stage version, and are therefore more likely to have an idea of the elements which capture an audience more than most other people. <br/><br/>Overall, Mamma Mia is a crowd-pleasing, toe-tapping piece of passionate entertainment that we just don't get enough of nowadays. No. it isn't perfect. But still, everyone involved in the production has excelled in creating an absolutely ensnaring musical, which is sure to captivate audiences of any age. Mamma Mia is full of life, energy and emotion, and by the end of the film, you will be too."

No, what moves me to tears is that these people all act better than we'd give someone in their situation credit for. I'll let others describe the plot though I went in thinking it'd end with everyone getting married.

"mjd1905","6","6","9","15 July 2008"," Not what I was expecting....
","**Not sure about the spoiler thing but to make sure I added it.** <br/><br/>Being a musician for 23 years I have grown to admirer musicals and those who create them in their complexity and brilliance and exactly what it takes to create a successful work of art. ABBA was a group that I grew up loving and pretty much enjoy every song they came out with. They were the masters at pop songs, throwing out hit after hit. Like other modern musicals I enjoy not only the music but the stories behind the music. So like recent film adaptations of some modern musicals(Phantom Of The Opera, Rent, etc.) I was looking forward to this movie.<br/><br/>Overall a fairly close portrayal of the theater production at least as far as the story line goes. Some of the songs are clipped and rearranged sightly as it seems all movie musicals do. Which is sad, as the songs were perfect as they were. The movie moves at a rabid pace throughout moving from song to song. The acting is enjoyable with Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep taking center stage, but I will say Julie Walters steals every single scene she is in, she is amazingly funny. The singing is bearable by everyone with Christine Baranski producing the most polished voice. Though there were a few ear numbing moments Pierce Brosnan voice wasn't as bad as some others have said. He stays in key for the most part, but his voice is very raw, and he has zero control over it. The scenery was breath taking and beautiful, just like I remember from my trips so long ago.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the cutting of some songs. I wont say which, but they are big numbers at least in my mind. Cutting them works with the flow of the movie, but for someone like me, the songs that were cut were some of my favorites and to see them missing swayed my vote. It was like cutting Music Of The Night from Phantom of the opera or Rent from Rent, well to me that is. They could have easily added twenty minutes to the film and fit in all the missing songs, or at least the big numbers.<br/><br/>Overall I give the film a 6.5/10, 8/10 if they would have added/not cut the few songs I most wanted to hear."

Really brilliant. Such a crowd pleaser. An exuberant, energetic, sparking musical, full of timeless songs and a cast (step forward Meryl Streep) who attack their roles with true gusto.

That might help in building a 1 rated review on this movie.<br/><br/>I know it's a musical, but despite not enjoying the music, it could at least be a good performance from the actors and have pleasant photography.<br/><br/>It didn't. Amanda Seyfried is such a talented actress yet you see her performance in Mamma Mia and you feel awkward. I don't think she's even enjoying what she's doing. It all seems fake.

","This is the reason women can't be taken seriously; fear of not feeling happy during every single second of their bourgeois lives. <br/><br/>The level of sophistication, realism & creativity is at an all time low. Every 'chick flick' cliché is used over & over with absolutely NO context or affiliation with the songs purloined from the Abba estate. Every situation is lived out in 3-year old perspective where bad things can never happen. <br/><br/>Middle aged women renounce all vestige of their hobbies, interests & pursuits in order to fall in line to do exactly what is expected of them. Any deviation would require character, conviction & confidence! Ha ha I know right?! So by the time they reach this default subservient stage in their life, they hinge all happiness on looking back. They can hardly look at the present because that would be tantamount for self-examination; & they can hardly look to the future when they've forfeited all freedom of choice in order to blend into the background. This leaves one thing that they all have in common - nostalgia. <br/><br/>Nostalgia is irrational, & this predilection with everything ancient hinders the ability to judge your tastes in a non-bias fashion. Abba is the epitome of nostalgia!! They're even worse than the Beatles themselves! At least their songs didn't all just sound like a string of one hit wonders. <br/><br/>This film is a disastrous instance of the formulaic juke box musical with clichéd jokes, paper thin narrative, typical throw away characters, lazy writing, & everything that happens is from a vain female perspective. It's like women who are in denial need to keep feeding their delusion by piling up pseudo laughs in a constant flurry to distract themselves from the more valuable things in life. <br/><br/>It's sad that many air heads gave this film a 10 star rating. This score is usually reserved for those films that are life changing. The irony is, this film is so blatantly made to stop their lives from changing. Keep distracting yourselves.. haha I am laughing. Ha ha I like this film. Ha ha I must not think. <br/><br/>There are much better films of this nature that aren't such a detriment to chick flicks.

They just went on to having a good time and made a complete mess out of a film. I was astounded to see Meryl Streep to work in such a stridently stupid film. I can't blame her for poor acting, the script of the film demanded her to do so.<br/><br/>Not only Meryl, but Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, such fine actors are completely wasted in this garbage. It was a shock to see that t the daughter is happy after knowing that her mother had three lovers at the same time and her own mother doesn't know who the father of her kid is, but strangely the daughter is happy to know that one out of three men is her father.<br/><br/>Songs in the film are not at all according to the situations. In the end, it was agonizing to see Meryl Streep singing 'The winner takes it all'. Even Pierce Brosnan must be laughing his ass off when the camera faced Meryl and showed his back. Another drawback of the film is that is tries to make sing people who can't sing and it can be vouched by people unanimously.<br/><br/>I hope it was a mistake by these fine actors to work in such a film, and they won't make such mistake again.

"meeza","1","7","11","22 November 2009"," Do not take a chance on this one!
","ABBA, Abbacadraba, I want to reach out and grab you! Why? In vengeance for the cinematic torture you put me through in experiencing the film adaption of the ABBA inspired musical ""Mamma Mia"". This asinine film stars Meryl Streep as Donna Sheridan, a rundown Greek hotel owner whose daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is planning her upcoming nuptials in the Greek island. The primary ""Who is my real Pappa?"" premise of this film is that Sophie was never informed by Mamadonna who her real father is, even though there are three main candidates who Mamadonna went over the sexual borderline with twenty years ago. Sophie's choice then is to invite all three to the wedding so she can finally have ""faith"" to know the ""father figure"" truth. These Sophie Daddy nominees are the ""I still love Donna even though I dumped her after I did her"" Sam, the former hippie but now stable banker Harry, and the free spirit boat-aficionado Bill. Along for the wedding ride are also Donna's best friends: the lunatic Rosie, and the middle-aged lush Tanya. Throughout all this ""Who is your daddy?"" humdrum plot there are spurts of these characters singing away to ABBA tunes. All I can say is, to quote a classic ABBA hit- ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" less of these ridiculous musical scenes; even though Meryl Streep's pipes were not as bad as I thought coming from a seasoned actress. I cannot say the same for The Three Dads who were Pierce Brosnan as Sam, Colin Firth as Harry, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bill. Brosnan was the main singing daddy here and his musical voice was undoubtedly both shaken & stirred. Let's just say that Brosnan's singing was ""The Matador"" to my ears. The ensemble acting of ""Mamma Mia"" was appalling but the ""main weapons of acting destruction"" were found in the performances of Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Catherine Johnson's screenplay of ""Mamma Mia"" was dreary & wearisome, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction was as clumsy as direction can get. Harris Zambarloukos' unauthentic cinematography seemed like he used a Greece Photoshop software program for the film's look. So to cap this monstrosity of a film in musical fashion, I will use an ABBA tune: Do not ""take a chance"" on the musical horror of ""Mamma Mia"". *Failure"

","Far too many Abba songs were shoehorned into this extraordinarily shallow and trite romantic musical.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Grease"" or ""Chicago"", the characters are not fully developed and are left with little or no substance. The tale itself is just as shallow, dotted with story lines that virtually spring up out of nowhere to bring about its end. Maybe if the characters didn't burst into song every few seconds, we'd get to know them and a true, definitive story would be allowed to develop.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a few of the songs don't correspond with what's transpiring with the characters on screen (""The Winner Takes it all"", for instance).<br/><br/>Don't fall for the overly joyous singing, lame choreography that appears to be glorious, and the light comedy fair - it all adds up to a brainless and wasted exercise without depth and structure.<br/><br/>Worst still, the story is like a glorified ""Flintstones"" episode where the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, loaded with a multitude of confusion regarding character intent and circumstance.<br/><br/>I'm not only surprised, but extremely disappointed to know that Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth agreed to appear in this utterly pathetic horror show - and that Tom Hanks was willing to produce it!"
"gary-444","8","7","11","14 July 2008"," Delightful Light Entertainment
","In recent years the success of TV shows like X Factor, Pop/American Idol and Britain / America's Got Talent have reminded everyone of the simple pleasures of singing, dancing and having a good time. Curiously, the Musical genre, which epitomises this, has been slow to reflect this interest on our cinema screens. However with the success of Hairspray, High School Musical and now Mama Mia, I suspect there will be many more to follow.<br/><br/>Mama Mia starts from a strong base. A fine musical catalogue, a successful stage production, the co-operation of songwriters Benny and Bjorn and a well known cast are a good start.But then it pretty much overwhelms the audience with it's sheer ""joie de vivre"". Don't listen to the curmudgeonly doubters, if you want to find fault with this production of course you can. But thats not really the point. This film is for enjoying the music, laughing at the slapstick comedy, having a good time and perhaps even kicking off those heels and having a dance.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep successfully dominates this film with all the enthusiasm of an Aunt visiting for Christmas and determined to have a good time. Ably assisted by Julie Walters, and a particularly good Christine Baranski the three of them laugh, dance and cry themselves through a plot which is frankly only there to allow everyone to enjoy themselves.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried as Streep's daughter is the right mix of innocence and verve and the three prospective ""fathers"",Brosnan, Firth and Skarsgard ham up their scenes monstrously.The only real query on the film is Brosnan's singing. It is terrible. I hope that it was left in as a joke because it does cause you to literally laugh out loud. Which is in marked contrast to Streep who sings admirably, giving Madonna a run for her money in the latter's starring role in Evita.<br/><br/>The sun of course always shines, the buildings look rustic and welcoming, and the sea is blue.The ""set pieces"", Voulez Vous, Dancing Queen and a raucous Does Your Mother Know always entertain, Chiquitita is an unexpected delight! The Fifties and Sixties produced a run of popular musicals making the likes of Diana Dors stars in the process. The Musical is back for the 21st century!"

","How extremely disappointing! We can't believe that ABBA would sign-off on the poor singing of Streep and Brosnan. Why didn't the five producers DUB the voices of Streep and Brosnan? Why didn't Tom Hanks and his wife exert their authority as Producers to save the singing?<br/><br/>My family loves ABBA and we love the stage musical. We love hearing ABBA songs play during Muriel's Wedding and other movies. <br/><br/>In this production, the music often drown out the voices of Streep and Brosnan. Was that by intent? Dub their voices!<br/><br/>The producers cut five songs and added one. A couple of songs were reduced to merely lines and some scenes had too much dialog.<br/><br/>A couple of songs and dance routines appeared rushed but still tried to remain loyal to the stage production while interjecting a few twists.<br/><br/>There were some wonderful elements such as great photography, a wonderful supporting cast of extras, and some nice and touching changes from the stage version (but I don't want to spoil it for you).<br/><br/>Sophie's friends have barely any time on screen, and the relationship or admiration of one young man for Aunt Tanya(Donna's friend) is not developed clearly for the movie audience and barely makes sense for fans of the stage musical. By the way, Tany's hair color was not a good match for her wonderful personality, and her graceful age.<br/><br/>Some scenes are a far stretch of the imagination which wears on the audience's ability to believe; such as all the climbing required for a location along the cliffs of a Greek Island; such as the boys ""swinging"" into the Bachelorette party; and the final roof top climbing/falling scene is distracting from reality at best.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was fun and the music still carries energy, but the fun and excitement do not rise to that of the stage musical. We love ABBA so we will buy the video. We are happy we saw the movie on a big screen cinema too. My family is simply mourning the loss of the excitement that the stage production brings to the audience."

Bad storyline, woeful direction, dreadful choreography (have they even seen any musical film to see how that such films should be done?), and just about everything in the film is wrong.<br/><br/>The worst sin however is the complete misuse of the songs. Why on earth for example did Meryl suddenly started singing Winner Takes It All in her scene with Piers Brosnan when he says he wants to give Sophie away? The scriptwriter seems to be completely oblivious to the lyrics of the song (""You've come the shake my hands""? Huh? Piers didn't come to shake your hand), and can't write a scene so that the song may fit in. It's a breakup song with the singer acknowledging she herself being the loser in a love triangle, and you can't have a breakup when there is no relationship between them for years. The same can be said about nearly all the songs in the film. Quite staggering really. They just simply drop the songs into the film with no attempt to fit them into the proper context.<br/><br/>The only good thing is the songs despite their misuse, otherwise it'll get a 1."

To me, it constitutes a desperate frenzy of fakery. EVERYTHING is forced, EVERY laugh - and there are two million - is over-the-top, and EVERYTHING is rammed down your throat, a marked contrast to the breezy confidence of the great MGM musicals.

An example of this is when the husband/fiancée, no idea what his name was as he was that forgettable, questioned whether he really wanted the weddings, yet after a song and dance routine and no discussion he suddenly has a change of heart.

We may have been able to forgive them for grinning like morons and dressing up like failed clowns, simply because they made great music, but their involvement with this should give ABBA fans the legal right to send them into a nice, quiet retirement home.

","I understand that movie critics do not see this movie as a masterpiece. Anyway this movie really stands as a movie that you want to watch especially if you like the great tradition of musicals and if are not embarrassed to share that you in fact like ABBA's music.<br/><br/>I have a seen the theatre show and I thought it was an excellent idea to promote a story using a series of songs (by the way this is possible if you have an incredible number of hits that also have meaningful lyrics). The story has a simple thread but it is as well full of lessons on motherhood, daughter-hood, friendship and it is probably really for a female audience but in fact depict the typical failure of male commitment and the recovery of romance and forgiveness that is all about life and love.<br/><br/>The movie follows up the steps of the show and it offers two hours of good spirit, great music, and at the end an uplifting and feel-good experience. I did not expect great actors to adapt well ... but in fact they did (Meryl Streep is really amazing and Julie Walters as much comparable). Yes we might not compare this to Singing in the Rain ... but given the fact we live in a very different world ... this is a musical of many generations and from my perspective a many times to see movie."
"flickernatic","1","7","12","27 January 2009"," A great musical experience for tone deaf karaoke lovers
","After so much hype, and having seen the stage show which was brilliant, I was hoping for something special from this movie. How wrong of me! It is a disaster - not because it is a flawed creation but because it has taken a superb piece of artistry and wrecked it, wonderful songs reduced to cinematic karaoke. Surely it would occur to the makers of a musical that the most fundamental requirement of it is that it should be musical! But no. All too obviously the producers have gone for the star names, presumably hoping that the audience will know and like them while being too young to have seen ABBA at work for real. It's all so embarrassing: Meryl Streep, looking like a demented retiree who has escaped by dressing up as Andy Pandy; Julie Walters, whose talent is totally wasted here; Pierce Brosnan, whose hairy chest cannot make up in my mind for his appalling 'singing',-it's too depressing to go on. Amanda Seyfried seemed to me to be the only actor who came out with any credit. The story is thin, but that's fine insofar as it is merely a scaffolding on which to hang ABBA's music and wonderful lyrics. But their legacy is trashed, most painfully when Streep tries to sing 'The Winner Takes It All', one of ABBA's most moving songs. The thought that this movie has made so much money is dispiriting to say the least. Benny and Bjorn were wary of letting this project go forward. They should have followed their gut instincts."
"teddyhp","4","7","12","23 July 2008"," Confused
","Forgive me for being cynical and for putting out everyone's fire but I seriously cannot understand the hype. I have an active imagination like any other, but there is a difference between make believe and a storyline that doesn't make sense. Can someone please tell me why, if this is set in modern times, it references them meeting in the summer of love (with old photographs that show Colin Firth looking like something from Mott the Hoople circa 1970's) and the subsequent brief encounters that year between the mother and possible fathers  using my calculations, this would make Sophie at least 39!! Alternatively, if this is set in the 1980's, why the futuristic references to the internet?!! I also can't get my head around the American girl who has grown up in Greece with an American accent and 2 British (one Scottish) childhood friends, not to mention her English fiancée. Is the island of Skiathos such a melting pot of cultures? Whilst I'm on my soap box, I can't fail to mention the far from seamless scenes where they launched into song for no apparent reason (whether it was relevant to the plot or not) which left me cringingly peeping through my fingers. I really wanted to enjoy this film (I was desperately trying to find the scene where the chorus line are dancing in flippers amusing) but no amount of imagination could make this possible. There's no doubt the mise-en-scene and the views were breathtaking and that the songs are brilliant  that goes without saying. But I could have got more fun for my money blasting out my ABBA gold album in the car, which is what I did on the way home... Long live ABBA!"

","I entered the movie theater with high hopes - the idea of Meryl Streep playing the charismatic, bohemian Donna, and mother of the bride, was enough to make me think this movie was going to be an instant hit. With the added bonus' of seeing Peirce Brosman in a musical, Colin Firth singing his heart out and Julie Walters doing what she does best, I was almost certain that this movie was going to be the biggest hit of the year.<br/><br/>Oh, Mamma Mia! Was I wrong.<br/><br/>Not only was I beyond disappointed with the over-the-top and in-your-face acting, but the vocals from some of the worlds biggest actors and actresses left a lot to the imagination. I have always been an avid Streep fan, but she let her fans down completely by slaughtering some of Abba's most famous songs. Though, her bumpy and octave-jumping voice was nothing in comparison to the torture I felt when Peirce Brosman took center stage. With every syllable I sunk deeper into my chair, wanting to curl up into a ball and imagine my happy place. Yes, it was really that bad.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised with Amanda Seyfried, who played the beautiful, soon-to-be-married Sophie. Her beautiful voice ricashaded through the cinema, and not in the same way that Brosman or Streep's had. Although, her talent was not enough to redeem this film from its unending woes.<br/><br/>Julie Walters and Christine Baranski were the small, dull lights somewhere in the back of the set. Perhaps the most talented vocalists in the movie, with the exception of Amanda Seyfriend, their energetic portrayals of Rosie and Tanya made me laugh endlessly. I was most impressed with Walter's solo at the end of the film - adapting Abba's timeless classic, Take a Chance on me.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I won't be taking another chance on this movie.<br/><br/>I left the cinema in disappointment - a movie that had so much potential was ruined by bad casting and terrible vocals. Perhaps the next adaptation of the hit stage show will not leave me wanting a refund for my ticket.<br/><br/>I give this film a 3 out of 10, and even that might be generous."

","A flat-footed movie musical that is in the same league as Darling Lili, The Wiz, Xanadu and Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band; being so bad that it's just plain bad. OK, maybe it's less annoying than Godspell(73), but that's about the best to be said for it. What appears to be home movie vacation footage has been directed without rhythm or purpose by one Phyllida Lloyd. Mamma Mia is a pointless reworking of the plot of Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell(68) which merely serves as an excuse for the cast to break into ABBA songs and cavort about sans proper lighting, direction, and vocal endowments, making unappealing and amateurish asses of themselves. Pierce Brosnon especially should leave this one off of his resume; his singing is painful. The sense of larkish fun in the film seems forced, and the characters are too old for their antics to be charming; they seem to be suffering from arrested development. Though the cast may be having a good time, the audience isn't. Can't Stop the Music, The Apple, and The Cool Ones are at least campy fun."

"Lanklamenyn","2","6","10","1 August 2008"," More of a chick-flic than ""Sex and the City""
","My first thought upon leaving the movie was, ""Can I get the last two hours of my life back?"" Turns out, I can't - so I wrote this review instead to tell others what the movie's faults (and qualities) are so maybe you won't make the same mistake as I did.<br/><br/>The movie starts out like a teen summer romance with upbeat musical numbers, but quickly descends from there. The teen-aspect is almost immediately dominated by a group of 50's+ old women acting like bratty 15+ teenie-boppers, talking about how much sex they're having (or not having). Between the over-acting of Julie Walters and main character Amanda Seyfried (who does manage to be cute in the rare moments when she isn't straight up annoying) to the unconvincing acting of Meryl Streep, there just aren't any characters lovable enough to make the viewer care what happens next.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the movie did manage to be funny (twice, at least). Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make up for the uninspired plot. The singing (which is ubiquitous) ranges from Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep's mediocre notes (which are flat almost as often as they're on pitch) to downright bad for much of the rest of the cast. And just where is this movie supposed to take place? At one point they suggest that Sophie is Greek, but the title and the location are given Italian names, and most of the cast is given Irish accents, with a few American and British accents thrown in. One is tempted to guess (for this and other reasons) that the director slept through most of this production.<br/><br/>So, the bottom line: should you see it? Maybe, if you're a fifty-something cougar of an old woman who wants to relive the 60's with other crones from that generation who refuse to act their age. But if you're a guy, make sure your cell phone has plenty of games on it before you let your girlfriend drag you to this one."

But when the movie was in the works, we waited to see how it came out, and boy are we glad we did! Meryl Streep was OUTSTANDING, especially in her solo of ""Winner Takes All"" (if she doesn't bring home another Oscar for her mantle after this, the Academy must be on crack)! Amanda Seyfried comes off the bench from ""Big Love"" and hit's a home run throughout the show. What a great talent this beautiful and talented young lady is and I hope we see more of her on the Big Screen. And Pierce Brosnan brings his charm and good looks to round the movie out. Everybody done good in this production. We didn't know that Colin Firth could sing and dance, Stellan Skarsgård who usually plays the guy you love to hate becomes the guy you love to love, Christine Baranski who stole scenes in ""The Birdcage"" and ""The Grinch"" steals the scenes in this too (you gotta see her sing ""Does Your Mother Know""- she's a killer!), Julie Walters' character is a complete departure from her usual ""Harry Potter"" role and is great comic relief... I could go on and on! And the best part- knowing that ABBA not only continues to transcend from one generation to the next, but also has crossed all medias- live concerts, recordings, radio, TV, Broadway, and now the Big Screen- and continues to entertain and wow the crowds. Be assured when this comes out on DVD we're going to by at least 10 copies because we're going to wear them out watching them again and again! Great family movie (mild, VERY mild sexual content) and overall good old fashioned toe-tappin' fun for everyone.

'The best actress in the world' can play equally in a theatrical, 'silly' way to give her character a fun, almost cartoony quality. Still, there were dramatic scenes such as when she was helping her daughter get ready before the wedding or when singing 'The winner takes it all' in front of Brosnan. As for the sets and locations, what photographic genius created this feast for the eyes! All the actors and actresses were spot on in their roles, delightful, fantastic. it allowed for singing weaknesses, after all, they are actors, not professional singers and they were hired for their charisma in acting which was delivered beyond expectation in this movie! Amanda Seyfried was perfect for the role because of her carefree, girlie manner and her fairy-like beauty as well as Julie Walters, who surprises immensely with this highly amusing character.

","'Perky' times two thousand... Ecstatic young woman on the Greek island of Kalokairi, living in the ramshackle hotel owned by her single mother, invites three strange men to her upcoming wedding--all of whom shared intimate nights with her mom some twenty years ago, resulting in her conception. So the big question is: which of the trio is the girl's biological father? And when will the prospective bride admit she stole her mother's diary and invited these lackluster would-be dads without mamma's permission? Unctuous, fatuous movie-adaptation of the international stage musical, which utilizes pop songs from the oeuvre of Swedish super-group ABBA to create its reedy-thin 'plot'. ABBA truly did record some beautifully-crafted, catchy and imaginative hits in the late-'70s, but the music as rendered here seems plastic and useless. Meryl Streep, with no character to play, hams it up; she's so professional and refined a presence that this not-inexplicably goofy approach just manages to squeak by, however her co-stars aren't so fortunate. As Streep's daughter, Amanda Seyfried bops around like a squealing teenager in a toothpaste commercial; by the time she and her fiancé are crawling towards each other on the beach singing ""Lay All Your Love On Me"", one is apt to make a mad dash for the exit. The picture is lousy, but it isn't offensive--it's far too innocuous and eager-to-please to be a complete debacle. To get angry over a movie like this would be pointless--it would be like flogging a sponge. The bloated production feasts on glittering aerial shots of the Greek isle, while the cast is continually directed to leap from boats and foot-bridges into the water. At least they don't sing underwater! *1/2 from ****"

","So you meet a girl and you start talking, things are going really well, you share a lot of common interests. You're especially attracted to her because she loves both ""Mulholland Dr."" and ""Lifeforce"" and can discuss the minutest details of labyrinthine television giant ""Lost"". Another common interest is a shared, unabashed love of ABBA. You ask her if she's seen ""Mamma Mia!"", she says she hasn't but probably wants to at some point though it looks cheesy. The DVD's out a couple of days from the conversation, so she suggests watching it together. Now it's Wednesday, the DVD was out yesterday, but knowing that she has a thing for aging, over-the-hill action stars and the movies they are involved in you attempt, after watching the sugary-sweet trailer for ""Mamma Mia!"" again, to avoid it by suggesting that you rent ""Rambo"" instead (she doesn't know that you rented ""Mamma Mia!"" the night before this phone call). To your surprise she expresses relief, and you watch Stallone destroy what seems like the entire Burmese military force. The movie's dark and grim, more so than you expected, and not very good, but you have fun and everything goes great. Now you're confronted with the choice of either wasting your ""Mamma Mia!"" rental or sitting through it alone.<br/><br/>What the heck, right? No. This was one of the most painful things I've ever sat through. Last year Julie Taymor made ""Across the Universe"", a lunkheaded, moronic, unbelievably simplistic and ridiculous movie set in the sixties using Beatles music, but it had a good cast, good performances of the songs, a neat visual style, and a dependable sort of romantic feel that took me by surprise. ""Mamma Mia!"" on the other hand, is a musical where NOBODY can sing OR dance, where every scene is dumber than the last one, where ""Dancing Queen"" is reduced to something far worse than even having a girl over and then realizing that your mom's friends are coming over for drinks under the pretense of them being 20 again, and having to be in the same house as all that. There's not one good performance here, not one good line of dialogue, the film is flat and boring visually, the choreography is unbelievably awful, and the story as bland and idiotic as can be.<br/><br/>What a completely worthless, putrid waste of space which didn't provide a second of entertainment, which butchered every song, which was clearly done without any energy or commitment, as an internet acquaintance of mine said, it feels like a bunch of stars taking advantage of a paid vacation to Greece. What a completely horrible film, what an insult to ABBA and to fans of their music. ABBA didn't become popular because they appealed only to women over 35 or gay men, and while I've enjoyed several things with that target audience this is so exclusively aimed at that audience that it truly boggles the mind. Get someone to write a good musical based on ABBA songs, PLEASE."

I didn't see the stage play so I can't compare it, however, take out the spectacular Greek scenery and what you are left with is a very stagey-performance. Overacting, simplistic choreography, and stage gimmicks (like a trampoline bed) made for an unexciting presentation.<br/><br/>Worst of all is the math... The bride is supposed to be 20 and yet the three possible fathers ranged from an ex flower power hippie to a punker... I remember 1988 -- Abba was uncool, Punk was all but dead, Disco was very dead, and hippies had been dead for so long they were due for a revival. Perhaps the movie should have made some reference to being set in 2001 when the play originally opened? That would mean the summer she met the men would have been 1980 -- a little more believable. But, however you slice it... Meryl was too old to play the part since in 1980 she would have been 30 and most women who get pregnant at the age of 30 don't get kicked out of the house by their mothers... <br/><br/>Regardless, I still enjoyed myself, just not as much as I had hoped I would."

","As gratifying as it is for me to see, say, a deeply meaningful foreign-language or independent film about the nature of man or the fundamental questions of life, there is something to be said about seeing a movie that makes absolutely no pretensions about what it is.<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia!"" is made for the sheer fun of it all. True, it is banking on the immense popularity of the stage musical, which I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed. (For the sake of full disclosure, I grew up an ABBA fan. You couldn't turn on the radio from the mid-1970s to the very early '80s without hearing one of their songs.)<br/><br/>I am giving away no secrets here - the plot of ""Mamma Mia! is flimsy at best. If you can call it a plot, that is. The basic premise - a young girl trying to find out who her real dad is on the eve of her wedding - is merely an excuse to string along a whole number of ABBA songs. It was so in the stage musical and it is the same in the movie.<br/><br/>The film relies on the charm of the songs - let's face it, ABBA was a genius at linking simple lyrics to catchy tunes. And once their songs get into your head, it's awfully difficult to get rid of them. Try listening to ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Take a Chance on Me,"" ""Waterloo"" or ""Mamma Mia!"" on the radio without finding yourself humming the tune or singing the song just minutes later.<br/><br/>The film takes a bit to get going. But it does settle down after the initial screech-fests when Sophie's two friends and Donna's two friends are introduced. The film's thin plot unwinds and all the actors gamely throw themselves lustily into the musical.<br/><br/>What surprised me about the movie was the filmmakers managed to find some pathos, some real emotion, if you will, in the midst of this disco nostalgia. Much of the credit goes to Meryl Streep, who carries this film. She brings such exuberance to her role that it's downright impossible not to be utterly charmed by her Donna. She is a marvel here and her rendition of ""The Winner Takes It All"" had some women in the audience reaching for their tissues at the screening I attended. Streep knows how to belt it and her take on the song is as emotionally potent as it was when Agnetha first sang the number in the waning days of the musical group.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good, too, though with their shortfalls. Pierce Brosnan singing ""S.O.S."" might be the cringe-inducing moment of the year. But I suppose it's forgivable to look beyond his vocal shortfall because the others make up for it and the music takes you along for a wonderful ride. Stellan Skarsgard clearly is having fun and if you ever had any questions about his talent, watch his reaction when he speaks to Sophie during ""Gimme, Gimme, Gimme."" That alone might be worth the price of admission. Though his vocal talents might be on par with Mr. Brosnan. <br/><br/>Christine Baranski is a fine comedic actress - and the role is tailor-made for her - and a sensationally good singer. She brings so much sass to her role, I couldn't really envision anyone else in it - okay, Bebe Neuwirth perhaps - and winds up having the best musical scene in the movie. If her number on the beach doesn't get you toe-tapping, I suppose nothing will.<br/><br/>Christine Johnson's screenplay doesn't exactly sizzle; her dialogue serves as mere transitions to the next song. But you aren't really going to see this movie for its crackling dialogue, are you? The film also would have benefited from more inventive choreography, especially during the initial moments of Streep's rendition of ""Mamma Mia!"" <br/><br/>While watching ""Mamma Mia!"" it occurred to me that I was actually having fun. That's one of the wonders of movies and certainly is one of the film's many charms. Sometimes it's refreshing to sit in a darkened theatre and just have fun watching a movie. <br/><br/>I have no doubt ABBA fans will love this film. But others should enjoy it as well because it actually is a surprisingly engaging piece of entertainment. True, it's silly popcorn entertainment. But given how much mediocre stuff Hollywood puts out yearly, it is nice to have some truly entertaining, goofy fluff. Frankly, the last time I had this much fun watching a movie was Shane Black's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" (2005)."

","I suppose some women will find the film wonderful; so it's risky for a guy to point out how really BAD a movie this is. Also, many will find the movie charming for what for me was the main reason for walking out on it half way through - the music of ABBA, the aural equivalent of having someone scrape your face with frozen moose do.<br/><br/>But the whole film is as vapid and silly as the music's lyrics. First, there's never any story development, just one empty and embarrassing song after another. Then there's the god-awful 'choreography' - the worst of it was the line-up of young men doing god-knows-what kind of muscle beach posing wearing floppy swimming fins - pure (unintentional) self-parody, it was straight out of Monty Python.<br/><br/>The final nail in the coffin is the acting - there's so much ham on the screen, Jews and Muslims are committing sin watching this film. Meryl Streep is particularly embarrassing - only William Shatner mugs this bad, and he does it professionally, it's what people pay him to do. Is that what they paid Streep to do? Then she should refund their money, but she does about ruins her reputation as an actress with this one. She here looks like nothing more than a drag queen Tallulah Bankhead. I mean she was PATHETICALLY amateurish - which I suppose fits in with the rest of the amateurish display of rotten ham here.<br/><br/>Oh, but let's not forget the dumb blonde daughter at the center of the - ahem, 'story'? Anyway, I almost forgave the actress doing a terrible job performing her, since she is THE most ANNOYING adolescent character ever devised for motion pictures. You almost got to feel sorry for the poor slob marrying her - except that he is the second most ANNOYING adolescent character devised for motion pictures.<br/><br/>But of course, there's the music - as sterile and puerile as I remember it from the early eighties, the soundtrack for the Reagan era that finally gave us Bush II hell - slightly 'updated' (slowed down) to appeal to (what else?) aging ABBA fans - aging 'valley girls' with an inheritance and the personality-dysfunctional males who married them in order to avoid working for a living, like John McCain. His favorite song 'Dancing Queen' is presented in all its empty-headed insultingly self-satisfied narcissistic glory, replete with aging ingénues pretending to be young.<br/><br/>And despite its rapid song-to-song pace, the film is PAINFULLY DULL - with neither plot development nor character development, what is it we're to be interested in, anyway? <br/><br/>An absolute insult to any one who loves music or musicals or film. The worst film of the year - perhaps of th next half-century."

On a Greek Island, a young girl named Sophie is about to get married, but doesn't know who her father might be apart from three possible names. Sending a letter to each of them requesting they come to the island, all three of them from different backgrounds arrive, to the utter confusion of her mother and their former girlfriend, Donna, who also runs the island's hotel which isn't doing so well financially. What follows is misunderstanding after misunderstanding with the occasional cameo by former ABBA members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.<br/><br/>What's the problems with this movie? The singing for starters. Although Meryl Streep can just about pull off some of the songs (and I do mean some), Pierce Brosnan sounds like a trapped cat, and the other songs aren't given much justice either, mostly having little to do with the story.<br/><br/>The story itself is very confused as well. Aside from being the standard A > B plot of getting the folks back together which you know they're going to do, it throws in a slew of other spontaneous romances from characters that don't even have anything to do with anything. Somehow I get the feeling that this movie was a touch confused as to where it was going, like it was stumbling through the woods without a torch, occasionally bumping into obstructive trees which are in fact mutilated ABBA songs.<br/><br/>On the whole, I really can't recommend it. Although some of the dance scenes can be fun to watch, the songs are horribly sung, the story is as basic as Cheddar Cheese, and the confusing and sudden romances that come in and go away again without any further reference.<br/><br/>Strange, very!"
"Heffernan99","7","3","4","10 August 2013"," Good wholesome entertainer, far too many songs.
","Musicals are annoying, very annoying, at least for me. And when you have a song every 5 minutes it can get very annoying. Sophie (Seyfried) is getting married. Sophie lives with her mother, Donna (Streep) off a Greek island. Sophie does not know who her father is since Donna slept with 3 men around the same time. In order to find out, Sophie discreetly invites Harry (Firth), Sam (Brosnan) and Bill (Skarsgard), her 3 possible fathers to her wedding without informing Donna. When they do turn up, Donna is reeling under a shock and Sophie is trying to determine who her father is. Harry, Sam and Bill don't know that one of them could be the father of Sophie and everything turns out to be one big mess. The movie is entertaining and there is no doubt about that. The endless songs are extremely annoying and can give you enough reason to not watch the movie anymore. For someone who hates songs in movies, this one is the ultimate torture. If songs are your thing, coupled with ideal summer destinations and a sprinkling of romance, then this movie kills it in every way."

","This is the worst movie ever made. It is the worst piece of art ever created by humans. That includes that album that Metallica & Lou Reed did together. It is possibly the worst thing humankind has ever done - yes that includes the holocaust. After watching this movie, about three men who are told they may have a daughter that the old 'goodtime'-mom never told them about and then sing ABBA SONGS ABOUT THAT NEWS, I was physically sick. I am now a heroin addict who blows other heroin addicts for small change because after watching this, I see life is a joke, there is no point to life, and I wish I was dead.<br/><br/>Ten more words? OK. <br/><br/>Bridges Of Madison County, again starring Streep, was some sick garbage also. (They made me change what I originally wrote there, use your imagination) Is that enough?

","The winter of 2010-2011 in Minnesota was very long and the worst I can remember. I bought Mamma Mia and ended up watching it three times that weekend. For the next two weekends, I had Mamma Mia parties for guy and girlfriends, with Greek and Swedish food. We sang the entire score! When bad weather traps you inside, there is no better uplifting fun than this movie. Everyone has their favorite song, but mine is the guitar ballad on the boat by Colin Firth. I never really paid attention to ABBA years ago when they were popular(even though I'm of Swedish decent), but somehow, I knew almost every one in the movie. I understand that ABBA is coming out with a revival album in 2012 and I can't wait. I actually met Benny Andersson when he was in Minneapolis at the American Swedish Institute's party, maybe that was in 2005."

","The Smash hit musical sensation on Broadway comes to the big screen in an amazing way with an all star cast including Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried, COlin Firth and many more. Mamma Mia is one of the happiest movies I've ever seen. it puts you in such a good mood and it is so Real and so energetic, and Abba is a great band and seeing their songs in a movie with a story built around it is one of the most clever ideas ever! A lot of people will criticize the movie but don't listen to it because it really is one hell of a good time. and it isn't a chick flick like many people think! it is a movie that everyone will love and there's something in it for all types of people! in my opinion a five star movie!"
"eonbluedan-1","2","3","4","15 January 2011"," Nothing could save this...
","I resisted for so long, but I figured it only fair to give ""Mamma Mia"" a fair hearing, and tried very hard to go in with an open mind. It is fair to say I'm no Abba fan, but I am a fan of some of the players in this film, and so thought there could be an element of watch-ability to this adaption of what I understand to be a popular musical. With that in mind, and understanding it was only supposed to be a light romp, I was ready to give it a fair go.<br/><br/>I was wrong, there was barely anything close to watchable about this attempt at a film. I say barely, because I did get a kick from watching those members of the cast who clearly treated this as a holiday, Julie Walters and Colin Firth, for example, having a great deal of fun on a Greek Island, generally messing about, singing Abba songs badly, and in Walters' case, I believe genuinely being at various stages of inebriation whilst filming.....throughout the entire production! We have Meryl Streep taking the whole thing far too seriously (I love Meryl's acting abilities, but here is not the place to be doing it like this), Colin Firth looking decidedly uncomfortable with every passing scene (the gradual realisation that he has signed up to make a piece of crap?), and everyone else (barring Julie Wlaters, as previously mentioned) giving a hugely forgettable, unfunny, and for the most part stupid performance. <br/><br/>This does not, however, include Pierce Brosnan. When I was told his singing is awful, I thought people were exaggerating, and even his performance of ""S.O.S."" is passable for a man who ""can't sing"". Of course, little did I know that he performs one of the closing numbers; did nobody, at any point, realise this was ear-bleedingly atrocious and think to overdub with....someone else?? It really IS that bad, and for this reason, I fear HIS performance will never be forgotten....sadly.<br/><br/>As musicals go (I would point out that I have no problem with, and even like a good musical), this is a disgrace to the genre. The idea is stupid, plot points created purely to crowbar more Abba songs in, and the story rapidly goes out the window anyway, the film quickly becoming a pastiche of a load of pretty good actors prancing about. Its colourfulness and playfulness become spirit-crushing and headache- inducing, and even for the most ardent Abba fan, I find it hard to believe the songs come through and save the day.<br/><br/>I am aware this review marks me out to be a grumpy, egotistical geek, and perhaps that is so, but make no mistake, I can do fun! I like fun, jolly romps, but I could not enjoy this film on any level, even an ironic ""isn't this funny"" one. No, it is not funny, I am getting bored, and TIRED! Jesus, this film drags! People moaned about the ending of ""Return Of The King"" being ""too many endings"", but at least the idea was to tie up all the characters' stories and actually close the film. ""Mamma Mia"" ends...then it ends...and then it seems to end again! I kid you not, I'm sure it must be close to ten minutes, waiting for the credits to roll. And all because we need more songs, apparently. I have never been this close to clawing my eyes out.<br/><br/>You couldn't pay me to put myself through this torture again."
"Catharina_Sweden","2","3","4","1 January 2011"," I felt ashamed of being Swedish
","As a Swede, one is somehow supposed to be proud of ABBA:s success - almost to feel like you are part of it. But I have never felt like that; on the contrary. I think the music is too simple and the texts too naive. It is alright to dance to in a disco, when you are a bit tipsy, I suppose - but I have never understood the big ""hype"" about ABBA.<br/><br/>Also, when you have seen Agneta and Annifrid try to pursue solo careers after ABBA split up, it became so obvious that they did not have much of a talent or voice or charm or anything. The ABBA phenomena was a result of extremely clever PR and the right timing - nothing more.<br/><br/>Therefore, I did not expect much of this movie either. Still, it was even worse than my expectations! I really cannot understand how they persuaded big celebrities like Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan to take part in it..??? The way they have striven to make the plot fit in with the songs is very contrived. Every time someone started singing, I wanted to hide behind a pillow for shame...<br/><br/>Also, I hate the way the movie portrays women - both the young and the middle-aged. Giggling, drinking, teasing each other, thinking only about sex, weddings, guys, how to find a rich man etc.. Me and my woman-friends have certainly never been behaving that silly when we have been seeing each other, and I do not want men to think that all women do...<br/><br/>Still - Greek islands and the blue Mediterranean are always beautiful to watch. And so is Pierce Brosnan! :-)"

Amanda is an absolute delight.<br/><br/>The location, Greece! Greece has had me hooked since Zorba the Greek came out and that's in black and white!<br/><br/>When I first saw Mamma Mia in the theater, I just couldn't stop singing all the words to all the songs (I think people were annoyed).<br/><br/>Mamma Mia has been on HBO every night. Watched it every night and the thing is...I own the movie!!!<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy the movie as much as I do..."
"pinknightskies","10","3","4","30 October 2009"," A brilliant modern day musical
","For someone who dosen't have a lot of time or likeness for musicals or even Abba, i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie exciting and upbeat!! It even had me singing along!! The movie is a great drama (within a musical) that has us singing and dancing as we leave the cinema. It has its laugh out loud moments, which include the hilarious Take A Chance On Me scene with Julie Walters and Stellan Skarsgard. It balances different situations within each song such as scenes of sadness (Slipping Through My Fingers), Love (Lay All Your Love On Me) and happiness (Honey Honey).<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried is brilliant as the blushing bride to be Sophie, providing a kind well rounded character that the audience loves. She has come a long way since her portrayal in Mean Girls and is delightfully entertaining in this movie. Other actors worth mentioning would be the always great Stellan Skarsgard, Julie Walters and Meryl Streep who all portray their characters wonderfully. Pierce Brosnan is off key in many songs but the rest of the cast more than make up for this.<br/><br/>I can see why everyone is talking about this film. Its catchy, its funny and it has songs that brings the drama together. I would definitely recommend this."
"jewishness5","10","3","4","14 June 2009"," Excellent
","Anything with Meryl Streep is worth watching. Even Doubt, which was uncomfortable but amazing. This movie is one of the most feel good movies I have seen in a long time. Amanda Sigfried is a revelation. Even with her voluptious body it was not distracting. I was dancing out of the theater, singing the songs in my head. Okay, I wasn't dancing, but the tunes really stuck with me. I hope we see more of Amanda in upcoming movies. I'm sure she can be a great dramatic actress too. But Streep steals the show. What did I expect? She is brilliant in every single movie she ever makes. HEr performance in this just solidifies her as the best actress probably ever. From the Bridges Of Madison County to Silkwood to The Deer Hunter to Doubt to this? Every performance is different and all of them on the same level. She is a treasure that we all need to support and embrace. There will never be another like her."
"dcfemella","3","3","4","14 February 2009"," Mamma Mia, Help Me Get Through This Movie
","This was one of the worst attempts of a musical I have ever seen. I don't know if it follows that actually play to the tee, but if it does, then I can tell that people who rave about it don't know what a great musical is. The only saving grace was that the music all came from Abba, which is one of my favorite groups of all time.<br/><br/>It's about a girl who finds her mother's diary, and invites three men, who might be her father, to her wedding. Meryl Streep, Colin Firth (I LOVE HIM), and Pierce Bronson are part of the cast to this ill-fated musical, and I must say that I am shocked that they signed on to be in it. The acting was not bad, but they didn't finish a sentence before they were singing another tune. What's worse is that their voices were not up to par. I cringed a few times and decided to just fast forward whenever they jumped into song. The plot was campy, and that is a nice way of putting it. Additionally, the movie was way too long for my taste. 90 minutes isn't a bad number. I'm tired of this movies that want to extend over two hours.<br/><br/>Aside from Abba, the only good thing about the movie was the scenery. It was in Greece, which is where I want to go for my honeymoon. If it weren't for those two things, I would have just returned it without watching it. Don't waste your time. If you want to listen to Abba, get their greatest hits cd. If you want to see the Greek isles, get a documentary. If you want to see these fine actors, then go see another movie of theirs. I am trying to save you the pain."
"the_Poppuns","Null","3","4","28 January 2009"," Not an original bone in it's body
","This movie is an incredibly loud and obnoxious mash up of movies like 'Les Comperes' and 'Ginger and Cinnamon'. Those movies are annoying enough but to combine their strengths is dangerous for humankind. When this movie was coming out I knew it would be huge. It would have to be the worst movie ever created to undo the goodwill of ABBA. It's not that, but it's not good either. Props to Meryl for showing up and still doing her job without retching the whole time. I've heard loads about how bad Pierce Brosnan's singing was but I could deal with it, he's no worse than Gerard Butler. But the lead girl, although not tone deaf, her voice sounds to me like nails on a chalkboard. Otherwise you have good actors having fun.<br/><br/>I can only imagine what the people who paid theater prices to see this on the stage must have thought. At least a movie ticket isn't that much money. I'll clue you in to a better way to spend your money. I bought the CD of ABBA Gold about 15 years ago for probably about $13. It still plays like the day I bought it and I've listened to it a million times. If you have the CD and haven't seen this yet, just listen to that instead. If you've seen the movie and love it, do yourself a favor and purchase some real ABBA."

","I have to admit that it was an ""accident"" that I even watched this movie. I had successfully ignored it on my flight to America, and I would have ignored it on the flight back, too, if not two things accidentally happened to occur in the same time: firstly, somewhere over Iceland we entered what is told to be the heaviest storm since ""Kyrill"", with heavy turbulence allowing me not even to dream of a bit of sleep. Secondly, the roundabout 70-year-old lady beside me watched this movie and seemed to be extremely happy with it (as it turned out, she had visited some ABBA-Concerts with her children some decades ago, remembered most of the songs and was mainly impressed about the accuracy ""Mamma Mia"" had been bend around the original song texts). So I finally gave up my resistance and the movie a chance.<br/><br/>It was worth it, that's why I write this comment. Enough has been written here about the story, I don't have to tell you how much I liked the performance of Meryl Streep (although I'm not at all a fan of her and was heavily disappointed about this whole Prada thing), or how beautiful the set was.<br/><br/>The only thing I want to say: If you have general doubts about this Mamma Mia idea, if you don't know whether you might like this stuff, if your girlfriend wants to lend this and you fear a boring evening on the couch: At least give it a chance. It's worth it."
"dbborroughs","7","3","4","11 November 2008"," I prefer the show but this was very good
","How was the movie? Good but not the show.<br/><br/>As many of you know the story is of twenty year old Sophie sending letters to her three possible fathers who show up the day before her wedding and cause her mom and herself to melt down.<br/><br/>Instead of a theatrical world of basically one ever changing set this is set in a ""real place"" or as near to one as you're likely to find in a movie musical. Its directed by someone who only occasionally manages to pull it all together to the magical level of the Broadway/West End show.(she never directed a film before) When it soars (Dancing Queen/ Slipping Through my Fingers/ Super Trooper) it is pure bottled joy. The Dancing Queen sequence is one of the best I've ever run across for expressing happiness. Most of the time the music is okay and gets the job done in a purely workman like way. At the same time I really wish Phyllida Lloyd had been more imaginative. There are flashes in almost every sequence but very few that truly soar as high as they should.<br/><br/>Most of the cast is good vocally though Amanda Seyfried is excellent and then some but who in the hell let Brosnan sing undubbed. Its horrible. You do not get used to it, its horrible.<br/><br/>If I was to zero in on the biggest problem it would be the script. At times its a great improvement over the book of the show with dialog that actually could be real world but in compressing a two and a half hour show to hundred five minutes they removed several songs (adding one new one for Brosnan-eeeek) and removing a great deal of character (and some plot) development. Is it any wonder that they cast stars in the male leads? They mostly have nothing to do and stand out because of personality. The Rosie/Bill romance is an after thought, as is the flirtation between Tanya and the bartender.(and as for Harry being gay---could you please make up your mind) Honestly they chopped it up in places its understandable why people hate the film.<br/><br/>I like it. I love pieces of it. I still prefer the show (which I will go see it several more times before it closes-even at Broadway prices)...but this is still pretty good with many smile inducing moments a a couple of eyes tear up from joy ones as well.<br/><br/>7 out of 10. Its light and frothy and empty and fun.<br/><br/>For the record- depending upon how you count it about 7 songs were removed from the show for the film-though some show up as music cues and end credits songs"

","It's so amazing to see the chemistry between Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, her performance as Donna is so cool, cheerful, full of life and also touching but not overwhelming, she raised her daughter Sophy as a single mom struggling with financial issues but never lose faith and optimism managing a small resort place somewhere in the mystic Greece. I enjoyed to watch this movie with one of my best friends, both of us are married and have family, we shared a little space of time for going to the movies and have a good time with Mamma Mia, we sang, we laughed and we also remembered wonderful times with those timeless songs of Abba. Excellent choice with Meryl Streep, I can't imagine this film without her and Pierce Brosnan was surprising when he sang."

","I'll admit I didn't expect to like this movie beforehand, but upon watching it, Mamma Mia! somehow still shocked me with its low quality. One third of the movie is a ridiculous story surrounding annoying, ditzy, bland characters, and the other two thirds are just a collection of cheesy, obnoxious music videos. I suppose that's the downside to writing an entire film loosely around a collection of ABBA songs. I can't exactly say I was surprised that this movie was a mess, but I didn't anticipate just how unpleasant it was. Take the poor structure I already mentioned and top it all off with terrible acting (even from Oscar winners Meryl Streep and Colin Firth), even worse singing, and an irritatingly over-the-top and campy tone, and you have Mamma Mia! In the end I got very little enjoyment out of this movie. I guess it's just not my thing."

","The only reason I stayed the whole way through this film was that I was working when I went to see it (I'm a support worker and the person I was working with wanted to see it). I love ABBA and love musicals so was fairly optimistic when I went in. What passes for a plot is completely ludicrous. Each actor seems to be working for a different director (judging by the variation in styles). Also, Meryl Streep may be a great actress but the age gap was just too big. For her to have had a 'fling' with the three men would have meant it was a mid-life crisis rather than a youthful indiscretion to have given birth to the young girl playing her daughter. I just wanted to give Pierce Brosnan a hug when he started singing to reassure him that people will forget this film eventually.The rest of the singing and dancing wouldn't have passed muster in our old school productions. The film seemed to go on for half a lifetime and I spent part of it writing my shopping list so my time wasn't totally wasted. By far and away the worst film I have had the misfortune to be forced to watch. Maybe the US military could utilise this as a new torture technique now that water boarding has fallen out of favour? I'd certainly confess to a heck of a lot rather than have to endure this again."

","The occasional moment of brilliance - like Meryl Streep's interpretation of The Winner Takes It All - only serves to hammer home the fact that Benny & Bjorn deserved a much better context into which to place their songs.<br/><br/>The plot - such as it is - is preposterous. As if three grown men would drop everything and race off to a Greek Island at the behest of a woman with whom they had a fleeting Summer romance 20 years earlier (with no subsequent contact) and all in order to attend the Wedding of someone they don't even know. It's a rotten, empty premise for a film that goes nowhere quick - but not quick enough! <br/><br/>The casting is appalling. No chemistry between Donna and her mates. The two lackluster juvenile leads would be better cast in a daytime soap. Nobody can sing - and it's a musical!!! <br/><br/>Really, words fail me. I haven't seen such a stinker since Love Actually.

Meryl Streep is amazing as always and makes you really feel for the character Donna in so many different ways, her singing is amazing I really wasn't expecting it! Amanda Seyfried is Sophie and she is lovable and makes you feel for her even after she has done something so silly, again great singer!

","As a Greekophile and a big fan of ABBA, who only got to see the stage production of Mamma Mia last year, I have to say that the movie exceeded my expectations in all respects - a tremendously talented cast gave it all they could to reproduce a fantastic collection of songs in an unique vocal style which, in my opinion, does not deserve the criticism that I have read. The movie is a true delight combining, as it does, an incredible soundtrack with a visually superb location and a light-hearted approach to a credible life situation. If you watch this film and fail to be emotionally stirred then you have no heart as it entertains on all fronts and will certainly be only the second DVD that I have ever purchased - the first being the Sound of Music! Not only will this movie see a resurgence in demand for the fabulous music but it will provide a tremendous boost to ticket sales for the stage production and Greek tourism. Every single member of the leading cast played a brilliant role and the film deserves to win many awards. Feel good factors are extremely rare these days but Mamma Mia truly compensates for this in a movie production that will undoubtedly become a classic."

The ABBA songs were put brilliantly in their place in this movie and when the first song starts in the movie you know you have a great movie to watch. Some of my colleagues said "" you don't have to be gay to enjoy ABBA in this movie"" well they are right, the movie is over before you know it and after the movie you just want more. I think it is correct to say that this is ""the ultimate summer movie"" because even when it is raining you will still see the sun shining after this movie. My favorite of 2008!"

You have feeling like actors were trying to sing as much ABBA songs as possible in shortest time. Songs are coming one after another and there is no time to tell any reasonable story... Perhaps director should make 3 hours and tell us something more?<br/><br/>I gave two stars only because it didn't kill me. Total waste of time."

","This is the worst film imaginable. I can't imagine how they could make a worse film. I would recommend it to people who want to go to sleep in a cinema. Worst film ever. Sorry, but I'm telling the truth. My sister didn't even like it and she is really girly. I apparently need to fill 10 lines in the review so here's some more. The only part of the film I liked was when the actress with dark hair got on a little boat on the river and couldn't get her balance, she ran backwards and then fall off. If that part of the film wasn't included, it would be 0 out of 10. the 0.5 is due to the fact there was a wedding and therefore the film wasn't made to make people to go to sleep. You have a review section of the page and I'm afraid that's my review."

","The 20-year old bride-to-be Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) finds in her mother's diary that the strangers Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) or Bill (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) might be her father. The needy Sophie dreams on having her father walking with her to the altar on her wedding with Sky (Dominic Cooper) in the Greek Kalokairi Island and she invites the three men to her wedding as if she were her mother Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie believes she will immediately recognize her father in the trio of guests. Donna owns a simple hotel in the island and used to sing with her friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski), who also arrives in Kalokairi for the wedding, in their band Donna and the Dynamos. When Donna sees her former three lovers together in her hotel, she gets stressed and confused with the situation while Sky is upset with Sophie's attitude.<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia!"" is an entertaining and forgettable musical that has an interesting idea but a foolish story. ABBA was a successful Swedish pop music group from the early 70's to the early 80's, and the screenplay uses the lyrics of some of their most popular songs along the story entwined with dialogs. Therefore, for fans of this group, it is a plus. Another good point is the always wonderful Meryl Streep. Last but not the least, the paradisiacal locations in Greek islands is another great attraction of this feature. Unfortunately the shallow story is too silly and the choreography is very poor and could be better and better. In the balance of pros and cons, my vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Mamma Mia!"""
"kenhw","1","6","11","9 March 2009"," What a disappointment!
","We held back on watching this DVD until now,intending it for a special, uplifting evening in our lives, remembering of course how normally quiet cinemas were packed out for weeks on end. Oh dear! after only a few minutes we looked at each other in disbelief. How could something so popular be so cringeingly awful? Naturally the music-as originally sung by ABBA- is wonderful. Set in the sunshine of a Greek Island how could the scenery fail? And the chorus, presumably composed of young professionals- excellent. That is as far as I can go with praise however. The Movie was a disaster because of the casting of the four main characters who were each so far out of their comfort zone as to be totally lost. Whatever possessed them (other than the money of course) to make such fools of themselves, I cannot imagine. I am particularly shocked at Meryl Streep and Julie Walters, each of whom have surely lost much self respect as a result of this farce. Now- where's my copy of Chicago?"
"BBCboy","1","6","11","22 December 2008"," simply dreadful!!!!!!!
","Its hard to know where to begin with this film. I avoided it in the cinemas mainly because it looked a bit cheesy and just wasn't sure I would enjoy it. Nevertheless, because this film has been so successful in the UK I decided to watch the DVD. I watched with a group of friends for about 30 minutes. They did not enjoy it and voted to switch it off! I decided to watch myself the next day because I wanted to give it chance. I think the thing that struck me most was how many of the actors could not sing! Chief among them was Pierce Brosnan. He seemed to think his mooing or moaning constituted singing! Was he auditioned for this? Colin Firth and Stellan Skargard were not much better.<br/><br/>Julie Walters also seemed out of her depth with her ""vocal talents"". Her character also seemed out of place with respect to Meryl Streep and Christine Baransksi in that she did look and feel like she was their friend. Also I found her character quite shrill and annoying. Only Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Steep seemed even come close to an adequate singing voice. The other thing that bothered and amused me in different measure were how the extras seemed to appear out of no where when musical numbers were being sung. I know that it's a convention that this happens in musicals but when the young lovers were singing ""Lay all your love on me"" on a seemingly empty beach , 25 scantily clad men appeared out of no where to finish of the song! This happened on a number of occasions during the film. <br/><br/>The only things I liked about this film was hearing an old Abba song I hadn't heard in years ""Slipping through my fingers"" and the scenery of the Greek island.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I like musicals when they are done well, for example, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, Grease etc. I just felt that in this case , take away the Abba songs and what do you have? Not much. Clearly, I am in minority since it seems to really have captured the publics' imagination but. I just don't get it"""
"theskulI42","5","6","11","20 July 2008"," Messy and plodding theatre adaptation
","Musical theatre and theater have a symbiotic relationship since the dawn of sound. Movies have been adapted for theatre and staged across the nation and across the world. On the flipside, Hollywood has been taking inspiration for just as long, as seemingly every Broadway success had received a permanent place on the screen.<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia!"" is a member of the latter club, being a famous, successful play based upon the songs of disco-transcenders ABBA for years before getting the big-budget, big-setting, big-star permanence here in 2008. But what works on the stage, where there is live action, audience participation, interactive vibes (and most importantly, an intermission), doesn't necessary work on the silver screen. It's closest cinematic relative would be last year's luscious, hate-it-or-love-it Julie Taymor concoction, but ABBA isn't the Beatles, and ""Mamma Mia!"" sure as hell ain't ""Across the Universe"".<br/><br/>Where that film also had a flimsy excuse for a plot on which to hang a bunch of famous songs, it succeeded thanks to an absolutely breathtaking visual sensibility, as every scene was a feast for the eyes as well as the ears, and if you didn't necessarily come to care for the characters, it was probably for the best as you almost didn't have time, and another layer may have been sensory overlord. Well, you don't have to worry about that in ""Mamma Mia!"", as the film's visuals are blaaand. The closest director Phyllida Lloyd comes is some crane shots and a few scenes in slow-motion.<br/><br/>The film, as stated, a flimsy excuse to sing some songs, is as basic sitcom hijinks plot, a girl is getting married, and wants her long-lost father to come. She finds her mom's diary, and finds that she has three possible fathers, so she secretly invites them all. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it appears that that was as far as they got. Its' Greek setting is pretty, but it does very little, and resembles nothing more than a play...set outside. The sea may be everpresent in the background, but it never feels OPEN, you never smell the air, feel the surf, the sort of things a film is supposed to make you feel. The lighting is garish and looks like the sort of lights you would see in a high school auditorium, lame fills just randomly placed. But the most egregious and downright baffling problem, considering the fact that IT'S BASED ON A SUCCESSFUL PLAY, is the choreography, which is simplistic and unimaginative that it looked like something my podunk college choreographer might have devised...on short notice. A couple steps to the left and right, a couple waves of the arms, and you're done. My grandmother would probably be able to not only memorize but perform this choreography in a matter of hours, and she just had both knees replaced.<br/><br/>Speaking of that, another problem. The entire enterprise looks ragged and ugly, and while perhaps they thought that casting old ladies and not letting anyone wear makeup would be sort of endearing or charming or something, but instead, it just comes off like an absence of effort, like they all just called each other up on a Thursday and said ""Hey, wanna do a movie?"" and had the reel in the can by Sunday morning. The fact that the film seems to have no idea about its timeframe only strengthens this suspicion. The three men are referred to and shown as a hippie, a '70s rocker and a punk ""headbanger"", and are said that they all knew Streep biblically within a few weeks of each other, and of course, the daughter is twenty, which goes with none of them. It doesn't matter if they were trying to jokingly play with time, the way it comes off, It just seems sloppy.<br/><br/>The one thing that should have worked, regardless of whether or not anything else worked, was the music, and even THAT was tough here. The title track was easily the only song to get any energy behind it, while the most famous ABBA song, ""Dancing Queen"", that should have been an emotional centerpiece, is handled in such a stunningly awkward and embarrassing fashion that it's impossible to enjoy in any sense.<br/><br/>The cast does their best to enliven the material, and several of them are too talented to give a bad performance. Amanda Seyfried, who should be the headliner, but apparently someone is unwilling to give her the push, is absolutely adorable, and I was surprised a woman directed the film, because while every other actor in the film is made to look at haggard as possible, the camera seemingly oggles her body at every opportunity. Meryl Streep is equally adorable, loose and funny in spurts, and the three-headed dad monster of Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgaard have a good chemistry between them and are pretty much the entire joy of the film. As for the rest of the cast, though...ugh. Dominic Cooper is empty eye candy for the ladies, Julie Walters is shrill and annoying, and Christine Baranski is a cipher who had no rhythm and is so uncoordinated and wound so tightly that her attempts to dance are as cringeworthy as the fact that they keep putting her in dance scenes.<br/><br/>I am absolutely, positively gobsmacked that this film is as short as it is (1:48) The film was on its way to earning itself an extra half-point for a rousing wedding finale...before revealing that it's not actually the finale, and wasted upwards of TWENTY MINUTES unnecessarily tying up lose ends that don't need to be tied up. It just feels so overlong, messy, lacking inspiration and lacking enjoyment. Maybe the play is a bit of harmless fun, but as a film, ""Mamma Mia!"" feels loose when it needs to be resigned, restrained when it needs to be fluid, and just ends up feeling like a waste of time.<br/><br/>{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #32 (of 56) of 2008}"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","6","11","19 July 2008"," Three Dads and A Wedding
","Phyllida Lloyd's 'Mamma Mia' is a lighthearted energetic musical shot in Greece and an English Studio. It's nowhere near 'Moulin Rouge' or 'Chicago'. It's a tribute to Abba and it's so bad that it's funny. Most of the song sequences, especially those featuring Streep, her backup girls Julie Walters and Christine Baranski and the three dads are well executed and hilarious. The only song that I felt was horribly filmed was the one at the beach between Sky and Sophie. The actors (except Pierce Brosnan and the younger cast) do a good singing job. Well, the singing itself certainly isn't of professional standards but it fits the characters and the general mood of the scene even though Brosnan is laughably bad. The non-Abba songs are totally misplaced and unnecessary. One such example is Madonna's 'Hung Up' which is repeatedly played in the background.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is the heart of 'Mamma Mia'. This is perhaps one of most energizing performance and she seems to naturally exude vibrant energy like a teenager on adrenaline. Her singing isn't particularly first rate but she so hot! Julie Walters is excellent as always and she provides some of the funniest moments. Christine Baranski is equally great and she too has an entire hilarious song. The three actresses give a great performance of 'Super Trooper' that almost reaches the heights of the classic musical moment like Rachel Griffiths and Toni Collette's 'Waterloo' sequence in 'Muriel's Wedding'. Amanda Seyfried is good but she doesn't have any chemistry with Dominic Cooper (thankfully he doesn't have much screen time because he's awful). As the three dads, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård fit their parts but except for Sam Carmichael, the other two characters aren't well fleshed out.<br/><br/>While 'Mamma Mia!' is silly, the plot is very clichéd and predictable and it gets messy in the middle. Most of the song sequences are fun to watch. It's also one of those films, you may enjoy while watching but once the end credits have rolled, there's hardly much that resonates and this isn't something I would voluntarily revisit. Even though 'Moulin Rouge' had a sketchy plot, it was the execution, the songs, the charming characters, the art direction and the overall treatment of the story among many other things, that made the film unique while 'Chicago' had all of that and an engaging story. Even 'Hairspray' stands on its own because of the whole colourful 60's feel and the message it delivers. Unfortunately, 'Mamma Mia' lacks such substance and it is most likely to be forgotten amidst other musicals. Only time would tell."

","If this aggressively, sadistically cheerful movie does not make you want to jab a fork into your eye within the first two minutes, then you and I should probably never get together for drinks.<br/><br/>A stage musical based on the songs of ABBA was probably an unnecessary endeavor to begin with, so a movie based on that stage musical is unnecessary to the second power. But was that any reason to inflict a film this terribly made and relentlessly un-entertaining on its audience? Who was director Phyllida Lloyd trying to punish anyway?<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia!"" the movie! retains a single monotonous! tone of mania! that I think is supposed to be wacky but instead comes across as deranged. I didn't think I could be embarrassed by a Meryl Streep performance, but this movie proves that there's a first time for everything. Streep mugs and writhes and jumps up and down on beds and emotes to pointless songs shoe-horned into a vapid plot to the point where I just wanted someone (the grip, the script supervisor, anyone) to shoot her and put her out of her misery. But the misery inflicted by Streep's performance is nothing compared to the misery endured having to listen to Pierce Brosnan sing ABBA songs in the style of Bruce Springsteen. Wonderful actresses like Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are asked to behave like fifteen-year-old girls (which is the only demographic I can even come close to seeing this film appeal to, by the way). Other nightmarish images flash across my eyes when I think back on this movie, like a phalanx of male dancers wearing scuba flippers and a fleeting glimpse of Stelan Skarsgaard's naked ass. Everyone looks like they're having a good time, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing so at gunpoint.<br/><br/>What's next, a musical based on television commercial jingles? <br/><br/>Grade: F"

","I heard some of the reviews and music, so off I went with wife and son to enjoy it. The ABBA music was really catchy and no-one mentioned ""global warming,"" which was a real 'plus.' This was a film that accurately reflects what goes on in society: it contains liberal profanity and sexual innuendo, infidelity, fornication and homosexuality.<br/><br/>Why, oh why could the writer not have made a film that celebrated all this good music but enjoyed the decency of good relationships, happy endings and better language? I shall see nothing from this writer again.<br/><br/>This film is said to give one ""a feel good factor,"" too. Well, I think it does, but only for those that indulge in such practices and who wish to justify their proclivities and feel they are not alone in their self indulgence. One feels less guilty about it by watching films such as this one.<br/><br/>The principal actors could have done better for themselves in a better film but sang as well as I would have expected them to - as actors. Why should they be considered poor? <br/><br/>Summarizing: so much hype, so little content and less enjoyment. PG? I wouldn't want my 18 year old to see this.

"ramalama3","3","5","9","9 August 2008"," A disappointment; poor execution ruined it's potential
","I was expecting a cute-if cheesy-musical film that would be fun to see with my mom. I can't believe how wrong I was. I know that this was adapted from a Broadway musical, but I don't think the filmmakers took into account the differences in the mediums. All of the over-the- top acting and humor works in a theatre setting because it's more difficult to portray emotions subtly to an audience who can't get a close up shot of the actors. The filmmakers should have toned it down in order to make the movie fun and not tacky. <br/><br/>The premise by itself is a cute idea, but the characters aren't well developed, and therefore I couldn't care less about what happens to them. The husband-to-be is a character that is especially lacking, and any ""argument"" the couple has is transparent. The same can be said of the 3 potential father's, whose entire background is revealed via montage and a song.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this was obviously a lame vehicle for ABBA songs over a good story because the songs used were interchangeable (mostly generic love songs, recalling past romance), some were put in unnecessarily (entire scenes just for one song unrelated to the major plot), and they simply went on for too long. Also, most of the songs were introduced too abruptly, making the term ""break out into song"" quite literal, with blasting background music on the very first note. I prefer it when the song progresses a bit more naturally into the story. <br/><br/>However, the major downfall of this film was the fact that the songs did very little to advance the plot. I understand that relying exclusively on preexisting songs can be a hurdle, but when you look at a work like Moulin Rouge, you can't make too many excuses for this film."

Had the plot been able to move forward with meaningful dialogue and character development it would have been a interesting little film, perhaps not great but amusing. The wedding plot twist with Donna and Sam was predictable but fit the plot (what little there was) and as such was quite acceptable. The wedding plot twist for Sophis looks only at the dark side of human race. The high spot of the movie was Bill's ability to capture some happiness. (Harry too.)"

The 'hated it' reviewers were spot on, in my opinion. Although Amanda Seyfried was 20 during the filming, she looks like she is 14, and that was a bit creepy for a woman about to get married. I understand overacting to give it more of a Broadway feel, but the result was very awkward. Oh, I laughed during the movie, not at the humor but rather out of embarrassment for the actors. In order to make it through the movie (in which a couple of people walked out)I closed my eyes and remembered the ABBA tunes that I loved so much as a child. <br/><br/>A couple, who had gone to see the movie twice, recommend it.

She was so energetic and she bounced off Julie Walters and Christine Baranski like they really had been friends for years.

","I can't believe I watched the entire movie. If my friend hadn't bought my ticket I think I would have left the theater half way through the movie. The plot line was rather simplistic, character development nearly non-existent, and the emotion was forced.The inner workings of the characters' minds is only scratched at and viewers are left to fill in the blanks. As far as singing is concerned I think I heard better vocals with more emotional depth in Moulin Rouge or Hairspray. Also the integration of the songs was not seamless. It felt like the actors were told at certain points to break from the film reality, do a song number,and then resume. And the fact that the chorus kept popping up out of nowhere to join in the songs was distracting and a little creepy. In a well done musical the songs seem to evolve effortlessly from the moment. Not so in this movie. The film is silly and yet I rarely laughed. If a film is going to be silly I at least expect some gut busting laughs. Didn't happen. There were two tender moments in the film, Donna's song to Sophia as she helps her prepare for the wedding and Donna singing ""Winner Takes All"". On the bright side the colors were dazzling and the scenery was beautiful. Also the Dynamos were quite humorous especially with their performance of ""Dancing Queen"". Never having seen the play I assume, because it is a hit, that the stage production is better. But I have no interest in seeing the movie again."

It seems like she (and the other actors too, Julie Walters and Amanda Seyfried and the third lady are the only ones I felt natural) doesn't know how to play her role.<br/><br/>I think these actors just want to prove something, to divert people's perception of them as cold and all dramatic, to show that they are flexible in playing roles. Partly successful, yes, my view of Merryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan changed. Hahahaha. Or that they are making a parody or spoof of themselves. Which, if ever, is very successful.<br/><br/>The producers might have relied on the weight of those big actors to attract people to watch the film. When I saw posters of this, I never thought Amanda Seyfried has the central role. Finally, I don't even think the musical merits a film adaptation. Maybe it's better to see this live. There's no story, only good music.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie if you're looking for story or even if you only feel like singing.

Let's face it, Abba's songs without Agnetha's and whatever the other one is called voices, is just not the same. Total and utter RUBBISH!!!!!!"

","I am giving it a two just because Meryl Streep is in it, otherwise it would be a plain 1.<br/><br/>If you have seen the musical, don't bother watching the film. As some other comment says, whose idea it was to make a musical movie where no one can sing or dance? At least Streep can tune! And another question, why are they still giving work to Pierce Brosnan? Skarsgård, the smallest character of Mamma Mia! There are ballet boys who get more attention to him! And his tattoos and butt! God!<br/><br/>I watched it on DVD just because it was on my hands. What a waste. I spent the entire movie searching for things that were wrong. Like, for instance, if you live in Greece, you write the country where you are sending a letter to in Greek. I'd like to see how much of Greece is really out there, I mean, behind the touching up, because those landscapes not even in Greece and I am from right in the Mediterranean, so I should know.<br/><br/>Pierce Brosnan, retire, or learn to sing!<br/><br/>And what's the deal with Colin Firth's character? I don't remember that well when I saw the musical (it's been 5 years now) but I reckon it wasn't like that. The movie was made in 2008, for goodness sake, what's the deal with the hugs? Gay people also kiss, huh!<br/><br/>And that black guy who tries to flirt with Tanya, doesn't he know he is gay? If he was a good actor, he'd be able to hide that fact! Well, that Dominic Cooper, the groom to be, he must certainly be gay too. Horrible, horrible acting! (He reminds me of Camilo Sexto, an Spanish singer).<br/><br/>What's the problem with Hollywood and depicting reality? Do they think Greece is really like that? Phew!<br/><br/>I love musicals and it is hard to find one where everybody sings and acts well. But this is the worst case of all! They can't sing, nor dance, neither act! Thanks for Meryl Streep! Thanks for her!<br/><br/>Bad! Bad! Bad!<br/><br/>Just get a ticket to London and watch the musical!"

","Saw the stage production twice. I loved it. First Amanda Seyfied as Sophie is wonderful here. The setting is great. But...Meryl Streep as Donna was totally unbelievable. She is 20yrs too old for the part(Donna is supposed to be about 38) and although she can sing..she can't sing ABBA. As a charter member of ""Overactors Anonymous"" she was what can be expected, and it didn't work for this movie. I like most Pierce Brosnan movies, but it was PAINFUL to hear him try to sing!The Rosie and Tanya roles were supposed to be spoofs of Agnetha and Anni-Frid (one who let herself go physically and the other that's had too much plastic surgery). Again the casting was totally off. Imagine ""Wilson Phillips"" in the ""Donna and the Dynamoes"" roles and you would be closer to the age and singing talent needed for this to be believable--even as a movie. I also could have done without the plot twist of Harry being gay..who cares..I don't want to see it."

I wish I had listened to her. The audience seemed to love it. They laughed and laughed each time one of the characters fell into the water. This was the worst movie I have seen in a theater since ""Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band"" starring Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees. The Greek Chorus! Impressive.

","This colossal misfire of a film should be re-named ""Oy!"", and its advertising poster should feature Amanda Seyfried slapping her forehead instead of beaming like a starry-eyed bride. Let's be honest - the stage version of ""Mamma Mia"" wasn't exactly Pulitzer material, but it worked because of enthusiastic performances, great choreography, and inspired staging that got audiences on their feet.<br/><br/>Director Phyllida Lloyd fails to transfer any of this to the big screen. She miscasts virtually every character, she pulls off the nearly impossible feat of making Kastani Beach in Greece look bland, dull, and fuzzy, and she robs the film of the potential for some terrific, infectious musical numbers by incorporating spastic, nausea-inducing camera cuts.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep, God love her, does her best with what she's been given. To her credit, she looks like she's having a blast from beginning to end, even as Lloyd photographs her in the most unflattering light possible, then makes her hop on beds, skulk across rooftops, and jump into the sea. Streep does shine, however, during her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All."" Her voice is powerful and moving, and she manages to make us feel for her character for about three minutes.<br/><br/>The other actors don't fare nearly as well. Pierce Brosnan should never, ever be allowed to sing on film again. Stellan Skaarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters appear to be drunk on ouzo in most of their scenes, and Amanda Seyfried, while a competent vocalist (she almost saves the ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" number), seems to have attended an acting class in which she was taught that screaming while burying your head in your hands equals emoting.<br/><br/>If anything positive can be said about ""Mamma Mia,"" it's that it's nice to see a Hollywood film featuring mostly middle-aged actors. Too bad this is the mess that showcases them."
"simonparker1990","9","7","15","10 July 2008"," Mamma Mia! It is really good!
","The musical is a genre that I have to confess I do quite enjoy. The older musicals such as Sound of Music, Grease, Annie don't interest me in the slightest, but then again my mum killed Sound of Music with endless repeats many years ago. However the more recent musicals have really been quite brilliant. Starting off with Moulin Rouge really, sure it wasn't a stage show before hand, sure it was odd, but my god it was brilliant. Chicago followed suit, although this time being adapted from a screen show. And in the past year two of my all time favourite musicals, Hairspray and Sweeney Todd, have all been made and been amazing. However two previously stage show musicals that did not do so well had to be The Producers (enjoyable but uninspired), and the dismal Phantom of the Opera that had me crawling at the walls. So I was unsure how good Mamma Mia would be, take out the songs would it be lame and uninspired, or would the story hold together. Thankfully Mamma Mia is a truly brilliant musicals and also the feel good film of the summer! The film features an extremely strong cast, brilliant songs, and a story which while unoriginal does hold together and works quite well. But what makes the movie work so damned well has to be the certain level of charm, you can't help but smile for some reason. Perhaps it is ABBA's infectious songs, perhaps its Meryl Streep giving a superb performance, either way it still makes for a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>So onto the cast and of course their singing voice. When Meryl Streep was announced as the lead Donna I was unsure how she would work, but after seeing the movie I have no idea why I doubted her. Her performance here reinforces the fact that she really is one of the greatest actresses of our time. And by god does she have a good singing voice as well. Its her brilliant rendition of Mamma Mia and Dancing Queen that really livens the film up. Right up until then the movie does seem to drag a tiny bit. Amanda Seyfried is surprisingly brilliant as Amanda, the girl the wedding all revolves around. We'll hopefully be seeing a lot more of her after this movie. Pierce Brosnan does well in the talking moments, yet not so well in the singing department. He starts off terribly but does seem to improve. Colin Firth is pretty good and much like St Trinian's proves he doesn't take himself too seriously. Stellen Skarsgard is decent in a pretty limited role to be honest. Julie Walters is a hoot as the brilliant aunt, her final scene being truly priceless.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia of course is mostly all about the songs, and while a few of the songs weren't as recognisable to me as others, the main songs, Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia, Money, Money, Money etc, are all there and are all done to absolutely perfection. But the very best song comes courtesy of Meryle Streep on top of a mountain singing The Winner Takes It All, its the emotional height of the movie and it is just amazing. Definitely one of the best scenes of the year so far. But thankfully the story does work very well. You're kept guessing right up to the very end who the actual father is, and there are a few twists and turns along the way as well that make the movie a more interesting ride. The direction and script are also done pretty well. The only reason this fall short of being as good as Hairspray to be honest is the movie does hit a snag ten minutes in and roughly twenty minutes before the end. The movie doesn't have as many songs and it seems a tiny bit dull without them. Still the minute the songs start up again the movie is great and lively.<br/><br/>Overall Mamma Mia isn't the best scripted, directed movie of all time, but its something light, fluffy and downright entertaining. If you don't like ABBA then avoid this like the plague, but if you find the songs infectious (even if you don't like to admit it as I do) the movie is quite brilliant and worth seeing for Meryl Streep mighty impressive performance alone."
"MASONSHAW","2","43","140","22 June 2008"," Mamma Mia What a Mess!
","I saw this at a screening this week, and since I had never seen the stage play it is based on, I went in with an open mind. How could it be bad, the ABBA music is great. From the first song, I knew that this was going to be a disaster. Not only could the actress playing the daughter not carry a tune in a bucket, the visuals were just plain ugly. It looked grainy and out of focus. The acting was uniformly bad and not one of the actors or actresses could sing a lick either. Oddly, it seemed like they were singing with the actual ABBA soundtrack in the background. The dance numbers looked like they came straight a badly produced high school play. There was absolutely no polish to any of the proceedings.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of both Streep and Brosnan, I was stunned how amateurish they came off. Also, they were way too old to play their parts since Streep's character presumably had her child when she was in her wild early twenties and her daughter was now twenty. Streep, at best, looks like she is in her early to mid-fifties. Brosnan, flabby and out of shape looks even older. The supporting players including Colin Firth and Julie Walters were just embarrassing. If you can't sing or dance, maybe, a musical is not the best place to pick up a paycheck.<br/><br/>There were a few cute moments, but unfortunately, I had to watch a lot of trash to get to them. I wasn't alone in my feelings, though I stayed to the very painful end, I have never seen so many people walk out of a free movie screening. I was surprised to learn that Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson produced this. They usually produce good movies like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""That Thing You Do"". My guess is that they lost a bet.<br/><br/>Life is short, don't waste your time or money on this awful film. If you like ABBA's music, buy their greatest hits CD instead."

","Having seen the play on Broadway made me anxious to see this movie adaptation. God, what a waste of good material and great songs. It is hard to pick the worst elements of this mish-mash of a motion picture, because everything is. The songs come out of nowhere. The directing reminded me of a third-rate school movie - the scenes are not connected and nothing makes any sense. And now Meryl Streep ? What is this Oscar buzz I hear about her ? Her acting is pathetic and she just can't sing. Why doesn't she shut her mouth up ? It could do everybody a big favour. She is an embarrassment to watch - the same actress of ""Sophie's Choice"" plays ""Mamma Mia""."

There was no Mario nor was there Luigi, Princess, or those little mushroom things you jump on. In fact, I don't even know what this was about. I remember walking in paying for my ticket getting a vat of popcorn expecting to see a Mario documentary, I took my seat. About ten minutes later the movie started and five or ten minutes after that(Yeah I'm surprised I lasted that long too) I blacked out. Well I was in a big void with some swirling colors and dancing bananas for a while and when I came to I was in an ambulance. Apparently I had a seizure and hurt myself when some college student who apparently liked the movie tried to hold me still while I was flopping around. Who taught her first aid! Anyway the doctor examined me and determined that I was not epileptic and that the seizure was caused by terror; then he suggested that I avoid any movie based on a Broadway musical. And that how my day at the movies went."

","For over a year, as a huge Abba fan, I have been horrified by the mere notion of this movie, and terrified by the idea of Meryl Streep starring. I really hated the musical with a vengeance. Went to see it twice, thinking I might have misunderstood it the first time. <br/><br/>After having seen the really bland trailers, heard the shrill Streep and the piercing Brosnan on You Tube, seen the atrocious costumes, the lovely dance Meryl did with Agnetha and Frida on the Stockholm carpet, well, I was electrified, welcome to you here I am my arms are open wide (as in 'I am the city') to go watch the resulting movie with my better half and our friends.<br/><br/>First impression: it probably was bit like Ocean 12 for them: a total guilty pleasure and the fun these post-midlife crisis folks had in the making of, splatters off screen. Meryl's wild arms' gestures in Mamma Mia made me fear I might have to vomit. But, as soon as her Donna character meets her exes (which is fairly at the beginning), everything turned for me. I must say, I love all three actors (bravo to them for taking up these roles! The horrible singing at least is natural), and what a fun trio they made up, those guys. But the real discovery is Streep. Not only does she pull it off, diving into the Abba classics with merry self-deprecating mockery, she makes the songs her own. My highlights were Slipping Through My Fingers, which is one of Agnetha's signature songs, SOS and, yes, The Winner Takes It All -to cover that song is sacrilegious. She made it beautifully. The Dancing Queen reprise is spectacular, better than the first performance. Fair enough, I do want the 'real thing' after having watched this, but I'm sure that may have been the whole purpose. Special mention for Julie Walters, the spunky kid, and Amanda Seyfried, who's a lovely songstress. Minuses: the direction, the art direction and the story. Too bad about The name of the game, One of Us, I wonder and many more (My love my life, My Mama Said, Like an Angel Passing..., Tiger)?<br/><br/>Abba rules forever, and Ms. Streep seemingly has endlessly deep running talents. We knew that already and can now look forward to her next projects, Doubt and Julie & Julia. <br/><br/>This is a movie you safely can take your grandmother and children to see."

","If you can get diabetes from a movie this one's it.<br/><br/>I have nothing against cheerful movies, but this one starts out with a smile so broad you'd think it had a coat hanger in its mouth - and it never lets up. <br/><br/>It wasn't helped by all the performances being over-the-top. Here you have a cast of excellent actors noted for their abilities to create subtle, believable, characters and they are all chewing the scenery like an army of Tasmanian Devils. Even Christine Baranski, who has turned over-the-top characters into an art form, is notched up too high. When a talented group of people like this all overact, you know it has to be the result of the director.<br/><br/>The staging of the dance numbers was an odd combination of boring and bizarre. There were some little bits that were clever, but all the while the cast seemed to have annoying ""see how clever we are"" expressions on their faces. The resulting effect was as if you were watching a movie acted and choreographed for live theater, where sitting in an audience seated in front of a stage, it would look fine. But staring at it photographed and blown up to twenty feet high gave it a kind of horrific intensity. <br/><br/>I will say that the singing was not as bad as I had heard. Meryl Streep was fine, even Pierce Brosnan was good at times. (But don't give up your day job.)<br/><br/>The one note cheerfulness made the 108 minute running time seem very long. The actors enjoyed what they were doing so much, I didn't have to. Perhaps if they had dialed it down to a more realistic level I could have gotten involved with them. After all, I believed John Travolta in a fat suit.<br/><br/>At the end, right before the credits, there is a reprieve of ""Dancing Queen."" When the song is over Meryl Streep turns straight to the audience and says, ""Do you want more?"" My friends and I looked at each other and said quietly, ""Noooooooooo!"""

I have to admit to trying to figure out how they managed to dredge a plot out of a mash-up of those songs. They did and they didn't. I know this has been a huge hit on Broadway and it has toured for a couple decades. Those companies probably were successful because they were talented Broadway, second team singers and dancers. Which means they were quite good. This film is mostly made up of recognizable, non-singing stars or stars that can sing in the shower but not very well.

"Schnayblay","3","2","3","28 July 2014"," This Movie Is Bad. Plain as That
","I'm going to try to keep this as simple as possible. This movie is terrible. It is one of the most gruelling films I've ever had to sit through. You would think a concept such as taking an ABBA-inspired Broadway musical and adapting it to the big screen would be at least decent. But this film is so poorly executed in every scene that you can tell within ten minutes that all your hopes for this movie are gone.<br/><br/>So ""Mamma Mia!"" is about a young girl named Sophie who is about to get married. However, she doesn't know who her father is, and after reading her mother's diary, she deduces there are three possibilities as to the identity of her dad. So she invites all three to her wedding, much to her mother's displeasure, and now we have our movie. Literally there is no real plot to this film, we get that five minute set up and the rest of the film is just stupidity that ensues, and you know precisely where this is going. Daughter's going to have mixed feelings between ""fathers"", the mom is going to fall in love with one of them, and the dads are going to all try to connect with Sophie. You've seen this movie before, just in better quality. It's cheap, cliché, and boring. No one cares.<br/><br/>And there's another thing about this movie. I care for absolutely nobody. None of the characters strike my interest, none of them demand attention, and none of them are relatable because they are all acted so poorly. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried are the only ones I can say actually tried in this film. But everyone else phones in false energy, painful smiles and typically awful singing, in particular Pierce Brosnan. I know the man isn't a stellar actor, but I at least enjoyed him in the Bond films. Here, I want to punch him. His character becomes one of the leads, but honestly he was the ""father"" I was least cared about, not to say I had much care for any of them.<br/><br/>Now, the singing. I was excited for this movie at the beginning honestly, because I enjoy musicals and ABBA's songs are always enjoyable. Well scratch ""always"" because I've found the exception. The pitches, the tones, the ranges, everything about this soundtrack screams for help. Pierce Brosnan has the worst singing voice I've ever heard an actor present on screen. Next time anyone complains about Russell Crowe in ""Les Miserablés"", show them this movie and see what they say afterwards.<br/><br/>I honestly don't have anything else to say about this film. It's so shallow and unappealing I don't even want to talk about it. Everything is bad. I will never watch this willingly ever again, and if I do by chance have to sit through it with a future girlfriend or something, I think I'll just plug in my iPod and play ABBA's original tracks over the musical numbers. At least that'll add some enjoyment to it."

Who cares if some of the voices are not the best singers in the world, it makes it all seem more real.

","When I came to the premiere of ""Mamma Mia!"" last year, it was flooded with couples bringing their loved ones to be amused, entertained and humming to the beat of their classic song from the 1970's Swedish pop band ABBA. The ladies were having a ball, and were laughing hysterically at every joke and every well-timed spoof. Some of them, sang and even a danced along, making it an evening they'll never forget. Even a guy like me was enjoying the moment in a more subtle way.<br/><br/>What got me into the mood was the crowd-pleasing movie, the props, the sets and of course, the always charismatic Meryl Streep. This time, she takes herself to a new level, by underplaying her role and keeping it sublime. <br/><br/>Sure in musicals, it's normal to be over-the-top, and it gave her a chance to sing, which she rarely does in her films. Which is a shame because she has a natural singing voice.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Pierce Brosnan is not cut out for musicals. His antics on the screen are overdone, which is good. But, his singing voice can only be deemed as average at best. It's like he's only there for the drama and not much on the music. <br/><br/>The Greek Island is thing of traveller's eye-candy. The beautiful location. With the material provided, it was the perfect setting for this story to commence. <br/><br/>Sure we modest men are afraid to admit it, but you can't deny that ABBA is the best thing to come along in Sweden since the invention of the printing press (Johan Guttenberg). Sure it can be one-note in their tone, but if you listen carefully to the lyrics and to leave out the beat of the music you'll be surprised at the subliminal message behind their lyrics and the go together with the silly story.<br/><br/>So my advice, to those married couples when your wife asks to see ""Mamma Mia!"" just go with them enjoy the night out, regardless that it's not manly enough for you. You can even just sit there eating your popcorn if you have to. After the movie's over you can go back to your manly ways again."

","Meryl Steep was the only reason I wanted to see this film. As usual she's very good - but far from Oscar nominee consideration. I suppose it's a ""happy"" film. I was bored to death - even when Ms. Streep overwhelmed the (my HDTV-HBO) silver screen. Contrived story/plot line contributed to my overall chagrin. In fact - in all fairness - I had to turn it off after 90 minutes - so I might have done myself a great injustice? I simply could not take another minute of someone breaking out in disco melody.<br/><br/>Okay, take the plot: young girl (overplayed by Ms. Amanda Seyfried) wants her father - a man she's never met to give her away at her wedding. Sitcom plot intervenes - she's got three fathers. I should've stopped there - but I subjected myself - only because Meryl must continue through this trash and I was compelled to be her audience. While she was good - even Meryl could not rise above the poor direction, writing and casting. Pierce Bronson can not act his way out of a paper bag and is uncomfortably miscast as one of the fathers. Julie Walters, another great talent wasted as Meryl's long ago singing partner. Christine Baranski completes the supreme singing trio and phones in her lackluster performance.<br/><br/>The backdrop of the Greek isle (I read it was filmed on location) looked like something off a studio backlot.<br/><br/>I guess I did not like this film. I'll give it another try someday.<br/><br/>The ""Abba"" soundtrack was poorly mixed in some silly attempt to make it more contemporary. It was 70/80's pop trash and is equally - if not worse - for the film version.<br/><br/>3/10 only for Ms. Streep's attempt to make this sitcom reject palatable."

"Anonymous_Maxine","3","2","3","1 March 2009"," Hollywire's Film Critic Suffers Terribly Through Intolerably Sappy Musical  'Mamma Mia' Review
","It was a very unique and specific kind of torture for me to sit through Mamma Mia, one of the most unendurable pieces of cinematic confection that I can remember ever having experienced ever since I was about ten years old and my mother used to punish my brother and I by making us watch Peggy Sue Got Married. I haven't seen that movie in nearly 20 years and there's a good chance I might enjoy it today, but as a kid it became synonymous with the worst movie ever made. <br/><br/>Mamma Mia is not the worst movie ever made. It's not even a bad movie, it's actually pretty good, for what it is. But in order to enjoy it you have to be a fan of the musical and by God, you had better be an ABBA fan.<br/><br/>Myself, I can't stand ABBA and I am notorious for hating musicals. There is nothing more distracting than an emotional love scene that is suddenly disrupted as the characters break into song. YAWN.<br/><br/>There are a lot of people that will love Mamma Mia, and it is a well-presented adaptation of the successful Broadway play. The locations are stunningly beautiful, the story is well-told and the performances, despite an over-abundance of cartoonish over-acting (mostly on the part of Amanda Seyfried as the afflicted Sophie), are wonderful in their own way. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I happen to agree unequivocally on the subject of musicals with the late Pauline Kael, who wondered about even The Sound of Music, one of the most enduring of musical classics (and the Best Picture of 1965) if there wasn't at least one Von Trapp child who didn't feel like bursting into song and singing his head off along with everyone else. My thoughts exactly about Mamma Mia, and any other musical in which the characters break into song at no other provocation than the gradual rise of the orchestra. It just makes no sense to me.<br/><br/>According to Kael, musicals are about ""a freshness that is so mechanically engineered and so shrewdly calculated that the background music rises, the already soft focus blurs and melts, and, upon the instant, you can hear all those noses blowing in the theater."" <br/><br/>""Whom could this operetta offend,"" Kael asks? ""Only those of us who, despite the fact that we may respond, loathe being manipulated in this way and are aware of how cheap and ready- made are the responses we are made to feel. We may become even more aware of the way we have been turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.""<br/><br/>Amen to that!<br/><br/>The story of Mamma Mia, despite being shrouded in ridiculous sing-a-longs, is about a young lady who has never known her father. She discovers her mother's diary that names three possible, ah, suitors, and she secretly invites them to her wedding in Grece, believing that she will instantly know her real father on sight and can finally bring him into her life.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep plays the part of the mother, now living a comfortable single life in an astonishingly beautiful little Greek villa overlooking the Aegean Sea, who has long since moved on from what can only be described as her flagrantly promiscuous youth. Through a series of misunderstandings, the three men who arrive at the wedding all simultaneously come to believe that they are Sophie's father, and each confides in Sophie, before she has a chance to argue, mind you, that it will remain their little secret until they can make the big announcement at the wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>If you're wondering how she could manage to get three different men to think that they are her father and those three different men to engage in such one-way conversations with her that they could make exactly the same plans before she could argue with them, then you are wondering about one of the great many preposterous absurdities of the movie's plot. <br/><br/>I will admit that I feel like a stick in the mud criticizing what is obviously a popular movie, but it seems pretty accurate to say that you can assume your opinion of the movie will hinge entirely on your opinion of ABBA's sing-writing repertoire, which I find insufferably cheesy and cloying. And the convenience of the ending, in which all loose ends miraculously fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces, doesn't help.<br/><br/>Note: I understand that this review is a bit of a rant, but please understand that this is a movie with a very specific audience in mind, and there won't be many fans of it outside that audience. I'm outside it. Also, I watched the movie with one of my gay friends, and he gleefully sang every song word-for-word in my ear throughout the entire movie. This also did not enhance the experience"

","Meryl Streep as always is a consummate actress. She pulls off a strong performance. Most of the main cast, also good, however there are problems with the cast, problems with the choreography and definitely problems with the director. It needed someone with a real motion picture vision, who can take a mediocre script and plot, with songs most everyone knows, and really make it work. It just didn't do it for me. Camera angles were disturbing, the constant thump thump throb of music with same type of dancing was boring and Meryl is asked to jump up and down all over the place, which works on stage, but the film limits everyone.<br/><br/>Too bad! I was hoping for something stronger. I saw the show and enjoyed it. Let's face it, the show is an international phenomenon, which one cannot explain, except for the obvious, ABBA is so very popular. And the music is interjected in the right places. The film doesn't work as well as the stage performance. You can of course just sit back and enjoy the music if you want, even if the arrangements are a bit dull.<br/><br/>Meryl S has a lovely voice - and has been professionally trained. It shows! Too bad she didn't do more musicals when she was younger. <br/><br/>I am sure many will enjoy the film. The big problem as mentioned before, the director is poor and she had no control over the motion picture. Too bad!"

","Although ""Mamma Mia!"" is full with many imperfections, it brings so much happiness that you get out from the cinema desiring to dance and sing the tunes you've just listened during the film, and I think this is a very positive aspect in these trying times. Abba's songs are crystalline and joyous, and they still maintain their potential also in this film, in which, let's admit it, not everybody can sing (Pierce Brosnan wasn't born to sing, and even Meryl Streep hasn't an unforgettable voice, but the newcomer Amanda Seyfried is quite OK according to me). All in all, the best things in this film are: the character of Tanya (Christine Baranski is so funny!), the ""Dancing Queen"" scene with that fantastic choreography, and the paradise island setting of this story."

Further casting issues: actors who are older than the parts they are playing and a lack of chemistry which kept me from believing the story.<br/><br/>BUT, and it's a big BUT, if you love someone enough, the way I love many of these actors (especially Pierce Brosnan--hubba hubba), it doesn't matter if their singing makes you cringeit'll pass. And if you love a song enough, you'll keep watching even when it's not being performed by your favorite performers.

It shouldn't matter. It's a fun movie with a fabulous cast of characters, and dazzling Greek scenery. For a great escapist film, ""Mamma Mia"" is the one to rent! I think everyone can relate to Sophie, wanting to know who her father is, thinking that's where her future lies. Or with Donna, whose past comes back to haunt her in the form of three flings from back in the day. But lucky for both of them, they each have two supportive best friends (who are carbon copies of each other. Donna=Sophie, Rosie/Tanya=Lisa/Ali), and for Donna, an entire Greek Chorus telling her what she wants is right in front of her face. It's a nice throwback to classic theater that way.

","Let's face it, with out the music of Benny Andersonn and Bjorn Ulvaeus, this musical wouldn't have made it past the concept stage. I became an absolute ABBA nut rather late in life and think this trivial plot became something more when written around ABBA's music. I was well past the ""teenie bopper"" phase when ABBA first came on the scene and liked their music well enough but I wasn't really listening to pop music then. When the music resurfaced after the opening of Mamma Mia the musical, I heard the radio and TV commercials and thought, ""You know these folks were really very good"". We went to see the show on Broadway and were instantly hooked. Singing along with all the songs, we watched joyfully as people ACTUALLY DID start dancing in the aisles!! We have seen it twice more since and enjoyed it then too. The folks we sat next to were also repeaters (Three times!!) When the movie was announced, we awaited it anxiously and saw it the second day after release. Somewhere on this site a previous reviewer said that an inherent flaw was that Frida and Agnetha's marvelous voices were missing and that was right on. How the producers of this movie could cast Merryl Streep , Pierce Brosnan and a cast of non singers to do this is beyond me. That said, they were OK, and the setting in the Greek Isles is beautiful, but it's still the songs and arrangements that are top notch. If you're not an ABBA fan, you will be after watching this movie. It's now being released on DVD, Watch it."

She can turn her hand to anything, whether side-splitting comedy or tear-jerking drama.<br/><br/>Each and every one who had a hand in the making of this film deserve the heartiest pat on the back for producing such a great musical which I feel sure will be a hit for many years to come."

"EUyeshima","7","2","3","28 July 2008"," Bollywood-Style Jukebox Musical Benefits from Streep and a Game Cast
","Let's face it. If Meryl Streep was cast in a Fruit of the Loom commercial, she would still be the standout piece of produce, lending conviction to a one-dimensional part others would easily dismiss as too superficial. That's the way to view this ebullient, featherweight 2008 confection based on the long-running jukebox musical from the prolific songbook of 1970's super-pop group ABBA, all of which were written by bandmates Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it was Sophie Zawistowski, Karen Blixen, or Miranda Priestly. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce called ""Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell"", you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.<br/><br/>This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark, which is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.<br/><br/>Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant film-making experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic ""Dancing Queen"" number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.<br/><br/>In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and ""Money, Money, Money"", as well as the more emotive ballads like ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"". She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on ""S.O.S."" (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsgård as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry  are also likable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, ""I Have a Dream"". The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of ""Dancing Queen"" complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of ""Waterloo"" (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook). Go at your own riskyou may love it."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","3","23 July 2008"," Mixed feelings
","As everybody knows, ""Mama Mia!"" the movie got there through two stages, first as ABBA's songs, then as the musical stringing some twenty of those song together with a story. To the audience familiar with one or both, this familiarity cuts both ways. On the one hand, they would have an innate liking for the movie. But then the expectations may be unduly high. I have mixed feeling after seeing the movie.<br/><br/>Inasmuch as I like many of ABBA's songs, I'm a long way from being ABBA's fan as I would be The Beatles (it's, like, you know, a generation thing). This way, I am less demanding and easily enjoy the toe-tapping numbers as well as the more lyrical songs, as long as they are reasonably delivered. I am therefore quite happy with the movie in this regard.<br/><br/>What a movie can do that a stage musical can't is obvious. On stage, performance of every song is confined to the acting area while the use of monatges in a movie has unlimited possibilities. In this movie, unfortunately, utilization of this advantage has gone a little overboard. There is too much ""business"" (borrowing a term often used in staging a light opera such as those of Gilbert and Sullivan) and they distract from the beauty of the song. If you have seen the movie, think about ""Take a chance on me"" and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell (it's quite a while ago when I saw the musical), the movie has all the songs in the musical, but I have one complaint. In the musical, one of the most beautiful ABBA song, ""Thank you for the music"", is beautifully placed, enhancing a scene in which Sophie gets to know one of the prospective fathers better (I'm not sure which one now). In the movie, they cut out the scene and put the song in the ending credit as background. Well, that's better than not having it at all but I would love to SEE Amanda Seyfried sing it. Five point deducted! What the movie can do though is show the idyllic Greek paradise, particularly the island where the wedding take place. Quite a few point gained back here.<br/><br/>Big cast notwithstanding, the focal point of the story is Sophie, and this role is well casted with Amanda Seyfried, bathing the audience in the glow of her wholesome sweetness. And you can't get any better with Stellan Skarsgard, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth as the three prospective fathers. Playing Donna's two sidekicks, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are great too. One critic suggests that this movie is quite clearly Meryl Streep's worst performance of her career. I agree, but I think he purposefully left out the accompanying line in his review. Let me finish it for him. At her career's worst in this movie, Streep is better than anybody else that they can cast for this role."
"3xHCCH","8","2","3","17 July 2008"," A Very Summer-y Musical
","What can I say about this movie? I grew up on that ABBA music and I really enjoyed watching these songs actually fit into the situations in the lives of single mom Donna (veteran Meryl Streep) and her daughter Sophie (a very charming Amanda Seyfried), who live in their own villa-inn on a Greek island.<br/><br/>Sophie is now 20 years old and getting married to a guy named Sky. She never knew who her real father was. A few days before the wedding, she was able to get hold of her mom's old diary and got three names of possible candidates. How she was able to find the current addresses of an American architect Sam (a very enthusiastic Pierce Brosnan), a British banker Harry (a typical Colin Firth) and a Swedish writer Bill (a bit out of place Stellan Skarsgard), we will never know. But she was able to send invitations to them, and they all accept! As I said, I was amazed how the Abba songs seem to fit right into specific situations. Like when Donna's best friends Tanya (Christine Baransky) and Rosie (Julie Walters) try to get a crying Donna to open up with ""Chiquitita"", as in ""Chiquitita tell me what's wrong..."") Later, they try to cheer her up with a rousing version of ""Dancing Queen"" that gets all the womenfolk on the island dancing.<br/><br/>Another part which made you feel as if the music was written for the story was ""Slipping Through My Fingers"", sung by Donna when she was bonding with Sophie for the last time before her wedding ceremony. This part was so beautifully touching (and yes, tear-jerking). I have not yet heard this song before, but I think I could sing this song at my own daughter's wedding.<br/><br/>The next song was the hit ""The Winner Takes It All."" Sam wanted to talk to Donna before Sophie's wedding, but Donna replies, ""I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through..."" Slipped in like a Cinderella's glass slipper, PERFECT! And Meryl Streep's singing was show-stopping. Vocally not perfect, but it was raw and convincing -- a bravura performance! <br/><br/>Everyone had a highlight. My favorite Pierce Brosnan song was ""S.O.S."" His rather gruff voice sounded quite unusual singing, but he kept on key. Julie Walters had her solo moment towards the end with ""Take A Chance On Me"", when she was trying to seduce Bill who was reluctant to give up his bachelorhood (imagine the scene ...""If you change your mind, I'm the first in line...take a chance on me"" -- so appropriate!).<br/><br/>The story is simple, but engaging with surprises at the end. The look of the film may appear very rough around the edges due to the set design, make up and photography, but this was really like how Donna and Sophie lived their lives on that island. Cinematography was great looking with the breathtaking Greek scenery, but for some reason, it was very unflattering to the senior stars, including Ms. Streep and Mr. Brosnan. Ms. Streep's costumes do not really look very good on her.<br/><br/>But in general, it was very enjoyable and fun to watch.

","Being the 17 year old straight male, many would think i should hate this, but i didn't - i thought it was great.<br/><br/>The best thing about this is of course the songs, which span from Waterloo (1974) to Lay All Your Love On Me (1981), and they really do fit in with the story line of Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried) who is marrying her fiancée Sky (Dominic Cooper) at her mother Donna's (played amazingly by Meryl Streep) Greek hilltop Villa / Hotel. The only problem is, Sophie wants her father to walk her down the aisle, yet realises from her Mothers diary that it could be 1 of 3 different men. Sophie invites the men to her Wedding, without telling anyone. The 3 men arrive and chaos ensues. Christine Baranski and Julie Walters are hysterical, and i personally think they make this movie as Donna's 2 best friends, serial divorcée Tanya (played by Baranski) and Rosie (played by Walters.) But the film does have its faults, especially the chorus of Greek's that keep popping up, make it cringeworthy at times (no disrespect to the Greeks) and some moments in the film will make you want to throw up, but on the whole, this film is pretty good. Its the type of film you want to see for a feel good laugh out loud moment. And i thoroughly enjoyed it!"
"saragilbert-68102","6","1","1","6 December 2019"," Who is her Father?
","There are a few issues I have with this movie. The biggest issue is that Sophie has spent her whole chasing this idea that only her father should walk her down the aisle and because she has never met him she decides to bring all three men who could potentially be her father to her island for the wedding, which is absurd. Instead of just trying to talk to Donna more, she takes it upon herself to create chaos.<br/><br/>Another issue I have is the idea that Sam, Harry and Bill all feel some sort of familial or rather parental connection to Sophie, without them even knowing se is looking for her father until towards the end of the movie. None of them reject the idea of being her father at all, not even in the slightest which is fairly unrealistic. The best part is that no one even asks for a paternity test to be done to prove who her actual father is. In the real world this would most likely be the first thing people have done and then go from there. There is no, we are family and I love you and want you to be part of my family even though we just met and know nothing about each other.<br/><br/>This movie is fun to watch, but gives people unrealistic ideas as to how you can go about finding your long lost parent, or father in this case."

"ChristianLeFeuvre","9","1","1","27 April 2019"," Extremely camp, glitzy fun movie
","I don't really know anyone who isn't a fan of ABBA songs and in 1999 producer Judy Craymer and writer Catherine Johnson skillfully put together a story based on the songs and the musical 'Mamma Mia!' was born.
9 years later, Craymer and Johnson brought the musical to the big screen.
Single mother Donna Sheridan's past comes back to haunt her as her daughter Sophie, who has read her mother's diary and realising there are three men who are potentially her father, invites them to her wedding in the hope of finding out which one it is.
The cast list is fantastic, with names like Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried as 'Donna' and 'Sophie', Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellen Skarsgard play 'Sam', 'Harry' and 'Bill' (the tree potential fathers), Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as 'Tanya' and 'Rosie', Donna's best friends and Dominic Cooper as 'Sky' (Sophie's fiance), who are all obviously having a fantastic and fun time singing and dancing away to ABBA songs whilst moving the story along. There was severe criticism when the film first came out that the singing wasn't very good especially from Brosnan, but in my opinion the critics missed the point, even Brosnan himself admitted in interviews at the time that he isn't a singer, but he was having the time of his life and with the film's intention of just being a fun, enjoyable movie it was not setting out to be a serious film-musical.
The cinematography is wonderful, the direction, acting and production are superb, and the choreography of the dance routines are terrific.
'Mamma Mia!' is a fantastic, camp, glitzy film. It's highly entertaining, very funny and even quite touching at times.
Even if you are not a 'musicals' fan but you love the songs from ABBA, grab a bag of popcorn, dispel all credibility and just enjoy."

","I've watched many musicals throughout my lifetime , and I remember never liking any. The dances are too choreographed and make the film seem so unrealistic , characters that break out into songs at the weirdest moments , and a movie filled with terrible music that I just want to turn off. Im 15 and at this point of my life all my friends and schoolmates , were or are still at some point in their lives , obsessed with highschool musical. Me though , I hate it , always have. The newest all the rage musical , The Greatest Showman , that everyone was so head of heels for , I've watched it , and I couldn't tell you what everyone was so crazy about this movie for.<br/><br/>But I have never loved something quite like ""Mamma Mia"". I've watched this film over 6 times and each time I love it more. When character bust in song , I'm likely to bust into song too. With an amazing soundtrack and thrilling storyline is a need to see for musical romance lovers everywhere.<br/><br/>Donna, an independent hotelier in the Greek islands, is preparing for her daughter's wedding with the help of two old friends. Meanwhile Sophie, the spirited bride, and daughter of Donna , has a plan. She secretly invites three men from her mother's past in hope of meeting her real father and having him escort her down the aisle on her big day. When the three men arrive on the island and Sophie not sure what to do next , will put the audience through a thrilling roller coaster. WIll sophie ever find her biological father? And who will walk her down the aisle on her big day?<br/><br/>The Mamma Mia movie soundtrack , being a major success, peaked at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was a certified platinum. It also topped the U.S. Billboard Top Soundtracks Chart. The album was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Over all the music in this film just makes you want to dance and sing. When Sophie is explaining to her friends that she invited three potential dad candidates through the song , ""honey , honey"" , not only is this song upbeat and makes one want to dance and sing but , through this song sophie completely tells her friends what she's done.<br/><br/>This thrilling storyline and great soundtrack will leave you begging for more-
Overall , I would recommend this movie for all musical lovers or, to watch on a movie date with mom."

","Bright and cheery, good-humored but absent-minded.<br/><br/>Mama Mia! has a great premise: three guys, who is the father? However much of the comic potential gets lost in catchy but long-winded songs. The film remains light-hearted though and if you have a mind to cheer yourself up after watching a horror film like I have, this is good escapism. How believable the film is another question, often moving up and down the emotional steps without a moment's breath.<br/><br/>Still a charming and optimistic film, but lacking depth. The three men are all very good-looking and likable fellows with their own kind of charm and humor. However their portrayal is not exactly realistic. They are almost in permanent good humor.<br/><br/>This is a fluff film, but it doesn't really try to be anything else either and there is a unified tone. However there are dramatic actors here and it felt like the film was a bit more average than it really had to be, being far too bright and shiny and lacking contrasting shade.<br/><br/>But do watch this film because of its good humored charm. Sometimes there is a time and place for fluff starring your favorite actors and actresses (looking at you Colin Firth). 7/10."

","This famous musical is so shiny, so glossy and so enthusiastic about itself that one feels like a curmudgeon pointing out its structural flaws, but there's plenty of those to be found. For starters the story is rather strange and off-putting despite its shiny presentation, what with Amanda Seyfried's Sophie basically upending the lives of three strangers on a whim, and it only gets weirder from there. Meryl Streep is surprisingly miscast as Donna, wandering through the movie like she's acting in a different film than the rest of the cast, while much of her singing (especially on ""The Winner Takes It All"") is uneven and off-key. The same is true of Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth and (especially) Pierce Brosnan, and while all of them share on-screen chemistry, it's hard to enjoy a musical when the cast is not up for it. Overall however, the setting is aesthetically pleasing and of course the ABBA music is always a blast to hear, and there are some musical numbers that work very well, like the ""Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight"") segment that rescue the overall movie from doldrums."

","I was shocked to find out that Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, the sequel was much better rated than this.
Mamma Mia! Changed my life and introduced me to the fantastic and talented universe of Meryl Streep's movies.
I have to say, and I'm not afraid to afirm it, that this is the best musical of the XXI century. Which means, CLEARLY, that it can be superated by musicals like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But to my eyes, this movie has a great script-songs balance (which is rare to find in MOVIE musicals), an excellent cast, very well chosen photography and colours, the coreographies are super musicalesques(?) and selection of time for each song is perfectly well selected as to the chronology of the story. Besides, and this is a SUPER extra beautiful point, anyone who ever heard at least ONE ABBA song, will feel extremely touch by the interpretation of all the songs that are carefully edited to last less than the original with the aim of not being boring or exhausting.
I HAVE TO SAY, that I can understand people don't appretiate this film very much and I strongly believe it's because of the plot.
The female characters are not ""special"" or ""sexier"" enough and he male characters are not ""deep"" or ""strong"" enough. It's just a romantic comedy made into a musical, with a story that can be recognized as very common.
But I think anyone with just a slight taste for the Feeling Good Cinema will FOR SURE enjoy this beautiful and thrilling piece of art!"

","The surprise smash hit musical of its year, sweeping up a bunch of hit songs by ABBA who'd split and last recorded as a group in 1982 into a slight if sunny musical set on a picturesque Greek island.<br/><br/>The plot could have been written on the back of one of the envelopes sent by the betrothed young daughter of Meryl Streep on the eve of her wedding to her mum's three summer-nights (oops, wrong musical) romances twenty odd years before, any one of whom could have been her father. Also on the island for the big day are Streep 's two ex-girl group singers and just to keep the three theme going, daughter Sophia's two girl-friends are there too. Much flirtation, confusion, indignation, reconciliation and elation duly follow accompanied of course by almost every ABBA song you can think of shoehorned into helping the plot along.<br/><br/>I couldn't bring myself to dislike it, even if the plot had more cheese than Gorgonzola and the acting more ham than Denmark. The singing by the leads is mixed in quality with Meryl Streep surprisingly good and Pierce Brosnan unsurprisingly not so good.<br/><br/>This feelgood harmless piece of fluff I guess did me no harm and made me feel okay even if it omitted highlighting some of ABBA's best songs like ""Name Of The Game"", ""Knowing Me Knowing You"" and ""Summernight City"" while I could have done without hearing some of their worst like ""I Do I Do I Do I Do"", ""I Have A Dream"" and ""Thank You For The Music"".<br/><br/>But that was always ABBA for you, sometimes brilliant sometimes terrible and I suppose the best I could say about this film was that it was neither brilliant or terrible."

"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","1","20 July 2018"," Don't watch it if you love ABBA
","""Mamma Mia!"" is an American (and more) 105-minute movie from 2008 and the title makes obvious already that the focus here is on the Swedish band ABBA, a highly successful band that just announced a comeback. Their work is never considered among the most influential or best from all time or their era, but with the fun spirit and impact on society, it is the favorite band of oh so many. Right now a sequel is coming to theaters, so I thought it would be a good occasion to finally watch this first film we have here. Director is Phyllida Lloyd and writer is Catherine Johnson, who adapted her own musical book for the screen here and so you could say it's not exactly in favor of these two that the film is still considered their most known and most successful work a decade later. Aside from all the songs, we are getting the story of a young woman about to get married and she invites her three potential fathers for the wedding with her mother not knowing one bit about it. The latter is played by Meryl Streep and the more I see from her, the more disappointed I am. I was actually quite a fan a few years ago. I guess her Golden Globe nomination here can only be explained that she is not as bad a singer as everybody else here, especially the three men who were part of her character's life a long time ago. These are played by a former Bond, a (now) Oscar winner and one of Sweden's finest fitting the subject. But despite their talent, not one of them has the material to shine. It's all about Streep and ABBA I guess, at least the latter can somewhat be justified.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? The film is pretty much what I expected in terms of the quality of the plot, maybe even worse sadly, but there is not one moment that stands out. Baranski is also such a good actress and what we see from her here is just ridiculously embarrassing. The rushed-in gay story line at the end is kinda embarrassing too, but not as embarrassing as these moments when the film really tries to take itself seriously in terms of father-daughter relationships, the daughter not wanting to end up like the mother, the daughter struggling all of a sudden with her soon-to-be husband etc. None of this is working and I wish I could say instead you should just appreciate the movie for the lighter moments, but these are just as weak and often feel fake, especially the many cringeworthy sex references. I am normally a big musical movie lover and I also like ABBA quite a bit, but the performances here are so poor that they make it painfully obvious how empty and vain some ABBA songs are when not given the right approach. It's almost a delight when the film is over and you hear the music from the actual band, not the actors, but of course this will not make up for everything that went wrong during the previous 100 minutes before the closing credits. Not at all. So skip this movie and just watch some old ABBA concert footage instead. I read that the sequel actually got better reviews, so I am a bit curious. But then again, it does not need to be great exactly to turn out better than this one here. Thumbs down without a doubt. Don't watch."
"Jared_Andrews","4","1","1","19 July 2018"," Quickly Loses Steam and becomes Exhausting to Watch
","I'm not opposed to musicals, as long as they are done well, like 'La La Land.' And though I would not call myself a huge fan of ABBA, I do enjoy a handful of their songs, many of which were used in the movie. Still, this is certainly not a movie made for me. <br/><br/>If you love musicals and ABBA and cheesy romances, you'll probably love this movie too. If your tolerance for an absurd storyline and endless decadent musical numbers is low, you should avoid this one. <br/><br/>At first, I didn't have to try-I just liked it. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried exude such bubbly energy and joy that it's all easy to enjoy. The plot is somewhat believable-a soon-to-be-married girl invites three strangers to her wedding, anyone of whom may be her father. She hopes to meet her father and have him walk her down the aisle. Her mother, who hasn't seen any of the men in 20 years, has no idea what her daughter has planned. <br/><br/>One thing leads to the next, and one song leads to the next, and try as I did, I couldn't manage to keep liking the movie. The whimsy wears thin before long. Eventually, it all builds to a ridiculous bit of inconceivable nonsense. Then more reckless decisions are made and celebrated. The next sound you'll hear isn't music. It's the slap of countless palms hitting foreheads throughout the audience. <br/><br/>Even before the troublesome ending, the movie just runs out of steam. Then it carries on for another hour. Evidently, it's difficult to construct a cohesive and compelling movie plot around a bunch of ABBA songs (no kidding!). And to anyone who isn't an ABBA superfan, the songs become exhausting. Song plugs feel forced, and actual non-song-related conversations disappear, as does any hope that the downhill slide can be stopped. <br/><br/>What else is there to say? The beautiful island and mostly charming characters are not enough to overcome the weak and absurd plot."

","I remember summer afternoons playing over my friend's house when we were kids. Her older brother's bedroom was in the basement and we would play his ABBA albums on his stereo. Loved it and still love ABBA to this day. Hence, the reason I watched this film. I am giving it 3 stars because of the ABBA songs; I would have liked to have given it a higher rating with the ABBA songs, but unfortunately, the rest of the film is trash. <br/><br/>The writer/script obviously hates marriage and treats it as though it were an evil anathema. Sophie is supposed to be getting married. Problem is, she doesn't know who her father is. She confiscates her mother's journal and finds out her mother was, shall we say, less than moral in her younger years. She wants to invite the sperm donors to the wedding. Her fiancée scolds her for it because well, he just loves her so much, he wants to take the wedding funds and use it to travel instead of wasting it on getting married. Sophie, trust me, you can do better. Find a man who will put you first instead of himself. Of note, if I lived on a Greek, tropical island, I'd be ecstatic. Why travel when you already live in paradise. <br/><br/>Meantime, mother Donna's friends arrive for the wedding. Why is is that some women, when they turn 50, act like imbeciles? Donna goes to the dock to meet her friends at the ferry. They whoop and yell like idiots while Donna has to gyrate and shimmy all over the dock like a fool. Her friends return the greeting with equal idiocy. They embarrass themselves in front of the natives. <br/><br/>Almost every adult in the film is either divorced or separated; they are miserable and wonder why Sophie is ""wasting her life getting married"". She ends up not marrying Sky. Donna ends up marrying Sam, one of the sperm donors. Which is a surprise since she complains about male menopause throughout the film and wonders how she could put up with a man around. <br/><br/>Stupid story, although we do get plenty of ABBA! We could do without Pierce Brosnan's singing, though."
"abluhm-247-93601","6","1","1","23 February 2015"," Mamma Mia!: A Star-Filled Musical Movie
","The Broadway musical Mamma Mia! took London by storm in 1999 and was later developed into a flamboyant film in 2008. This musical was written revolving around the greatest hits from the Swedish pop group ABBA. The movie adaptation of this musical utilizes the storyline that is less than brilliant and features back-to-back ABBA tracks that are not everyone's favorite format of film. What makes this movie appealing is the striking list of names that appear over the title of the film: the cast. From Meryl Streep to Pierce Brosnan, this film is packed with big name actors that draw in viewers of all ages.<br/><br/>Many of these actors had been very prevalent during the time this movie was released. It tends to be agreed upon that Meryl Streep is one of the most well- rounded and talented actresses out there today. She is known for her ability to successfully portray any character that she could be given and her role in Mamma Mia! is no exception. Streep had seen the musical in New York and was thrilled to be asked to play the part of Donna, the carefree mother figure (Levy 2008). We see Streep employ a childish nature throughout this film that we don't usually experience. From jumping on beds, to daydreaming about money, to feverishly interacting with past lovers Streep is able to completely embody the multi-faceted character of Donna (Puig 2008). <br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried was a no-brainer for the role of Sophie: a young woman with a charming balance of minx-like youth and innocent fun. She stood out for her vocals during auditions and was able to blow every number out of the water with emotion and playfulness. Seyfried starred in the teen flick Mean Girls that had just been released four years prior to this movie and was thriving in the continuous wake of that movie's success. Her name had been thrown around so much because of her unforgettable role as weather-girl Karen in Mean Girls. This gave her a new credibility and name-recognition that she didn't have before the Mean Girls phenomenon. <br/><br/>The list continues with Sophie's father prospects: Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgrd. Brosnan claims to have been nervous about the idea of having to sing and dance. He says, ""I experienced sheer terror at the idea. I don't think I have ever been so nervous about a job. In the end, I just surrendered to the whole experience, and had a great time doing it"" (Levy 2008). Firth had much success in previous films including Nanny McPhee and Love Actually and therefore his name served as an effective attention-getter to prospective viewers.<br/><br/>The promotional movie poster was specifically designed to draw attention to the cast list. Instead of naming just one or two of the main actors it lists eight names side by side on the top of the poster. This advertising mechanism is rarely used and shows how much this movie relied on its star-power cast list. It is a plead asking viewers to focus on the actors and watch the movie to see their favorite celebrities. The poster also features the two leads, Streep and Seyfried, front and center of the design. The picture clearly shows the faces of these two immensely recognizable actresses. By clearly showing these actresses the focus is brought to their celebrity. If the movie poster had decided to not showcase any of the actors and instead shown something completely different, a portion of the movie pull would be lost.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia! is unique in the way we see these actors. Many of these actors are more commonly featured in slightly serious, non-musical films and roles. When we experience Meryl Streep, a sixty-five year old woman, jumping up into a split or being pushed off of a dock, we cannot help but be surprised at her youthful demeanor. Many of these older actors are usually relatively put-together and its fun for their fans to get to see them in a different light. There is a scene when Julie Walter's character, Rosie, is crawling on top of a dinner table trying to chase after one of Sophie's fathers (Mamma Mia!). These youthful acts send carefree vibes throughout the whole film and leave the audience feeling like they want to run off to Greece and live life freely. By having these well-established actors play child-at- heart, adult roles, the audience absorbs the contrast and really gets in touch with the feel of the magical musical movie. <br/><br/>Mamma Mia! saw much success not just because of its attractive story-line and fun musical hits, but because of the incredible talent of all the cast members. The casting in this movie was crucial to its success and was done with precision and accuracy. Each actor was able to completely take on their free-spirited character and pull in audiences of all backgrounds.<br/><br/>Works Cited Levy, Emanuel. ""Mamma Mia!: Casting the Film."" Emanuel Levy.

","Who doesn't like ABBA music? There's no doubt that the infectious songs are the best and cheeriest part of Mamma Mia! Unfortunately the rest of the film can't live up to it. The story has potential but its payoffs are weak. The cast feel out of tune with each other and the music. They're either too comfortable and it's cringeworthy drunken karaoke or too uncomfortable and difficult to watch. Perhaps it's due to the lack of charisma from Amanda Seyfried, who usually has a personality, but here she couldn't be less interesting. I imagine it's something that works way better on stage because all you need is a pretty young thing but film demands more, at least a more visionary director. The production design is otherwise underwhelming and unconvincing, not having the colour that it needs, although it may have the sunlight. Catchy songs sure, but I can't help but not be convinced by the conviction, even if there's a touch of passion there.<br/><br/>5/10"

","When I was young, my parents told me that they need Abba's songs to be played to feed me all three times a day. I'm still a big fan of Abba. The movie features 22 songs of Abba. Few of my favorite songs weren't there but still this movie features many others. Thanks to the actors Meryl, Brosnan, Firth and Stellan who re-sung these classic songs. Meryl was particularly good in that and I felt the voice of an Abba within her (my opinion). The movie was very joyful from start to finish and made my mind relaxed because of the magic of Abba. The movie location in Greece was like a summer fantasy.<br/><br/>If you're watching it as a serious movie watcher then you may have these problems. One with women (of all ages) screaming in a number of scenes. Brosnan could've worked on his voice better and so many actors' voices. The plot line without such great songs would be certainly be horrible. The songs could have been choreographed better. Having such great actors, the script could've been far better."
"myspecialparadise","9","1","1","23 November 2013"," One Of The Best Musicals Ever!
","First off ... I gave it a nine star rating due to a couple of mistakes, a slightly over the top musical number, and one of the major parts was possibly miscast.<br/><br/>When ABBA was on top, I was elsewhere ... I've never gone for fads, and, being an entertainer, at their time of solid hits, I was too into my own career. Being autistic, I generally have tunnel vision. So, my real introduction was years after the craze ... in the Aussie film ""Priscilla"". Cute movie ... interesting. However, I did not manage to become an ABBA fan, even after the fact. And then came this movie!!! The songs were done very professionally ... and the casting was superb, other than one part that seemed miscast, and I am not going to name that actor, as he did the best he could ... but he had some real heavy talent to be intimidated by.<br/><br/>Meryl was as excellent as was her back-up girls! Frankly, I thought the casting of the two others was rather odd ... but that thought vanished as quickly as it appeared. Most of the major actors are not seasoned singers ... especially Pierce Brosnan, but he seemed to meet the challenge head-on, and did a superb job of it! God love him. I actually blew a chance on meeting Pierce ... but I can tell you this ... the man is very much the actor, meaning that he is as cool in person as he is in the parts he plays. A gentleman! One scene that bothered me was the scene on the roof of the goat-house. Were the people on the roof suppose to be invisible to Meryl? That part did not play well, for me.<br/><br/>The big surprise, but not shockingly, is Christine Baranski!!! This is a woman that should be busy, every minute of the day, working on some film project! The woman is a dynamo. The beach number she does blew my mind. Oh, the over the top part was when the male dancers leave the music behind them with a fast forward strained section of the number. Short, thank GOD, but still a big mistake. However, the number is so perfect, otherwise, one just needs to blink that section into oblivion! There was a scene between Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper, in bed, which was deleted from the released movie ... and it should not have been deleted. Fantasy is what this type of movie creates in the minds of its audiences, and that scene was filled with fantasies for both women and The Rainbow Connection. The chemistry was hot! Lets talk Julie Walters. I'd never seen her in anything before, but she has a new fan with this movie. The woman is so naturally earthy, and in your face, that you can't help but want to become friends with her. I found her a total delight ... and she had no problem matching talent for talent with the rest of the major cast. I would love to see more of her in the future. On the other hand, I think I've seen a little too much of Stellan Skarsgård ... the man has guts, I'll say that for him. But I'd rather had seen the deleted scene instead of Stellan's breakfast scene. Although, I imagine a few senior citizens went wild over that one.<br/><br/>All in all ... this is definitely one heck of a classic that will never lose its popularity!"

Donna has never divulged any information to Sophie about her father, except that he was not an option that needed to be in their lives. But now, Sophie is all consumed with her dad and what it would mean to her to know him and have him at her wedding. So she secretly invites all three men to her wedding under the pretense that Donna wants each of them there. Donna used to be in girls singing group called Donna and the Dynamos, with her best friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) and so naturally she invites them to the wedding and it becomes a wonderful reunion for the three of them that brings back old memories, heartaches, secrets and a lot of fun.<br/><br/>As the guests are arriving, so do the three possible dads, and low and behold, they meet each other on the boat ride to the island, not realizing that they are all there on a false pretense and for the same reason.<br/><br/>During the process of discovery for the bride-to-be, many old feelings resurface for Donna and the men. When she first learns that they are on the island and Sophie knows that one of them is her father, Donna is outraged. She goes through every emotion from anger, fear, sadness, elation, paranoia, and confusion and she does it so well.<br/><br/>Every fiber of this movie is told with music and singing. One of the things that I enjoyed the most was the way the camera caught so many different angles of the character's movements. Angles that add depth to the film, such as the scene where the three best friends are singing ""Dancing Queen."" The trio is all over the place, acting out the lyrics of the song, helping to relate Donna's current mood to lyrics that are universally familiar. And the musicit's the reason I watched this film the first time.<br/><br/>The entire movie is a celebration of ABBA's greatest hits and it feels like the screenplay was created around the music...the two fit like a glove. This film is a wonderful combination of young love, old flames, emerging secrets and a warm, lighthearted story about finding yourself, no matter what how young or how old, and no matter at what price. Once Sophie has set the ball in motion, there is no stopping the laughs, tears, and fun! This is a wonderful movie and I give it a 10; I highly recommend it for anyone who is young at heart, a romantic and loves emotion in song."
"BeneCumb","8","1","1","28 October 2013"," Surprisingly good frivolous entertainment
","Quite often, I tend to skip musical/romantic comedies as they are too slushy and predictable, and frequently aimed for a wide audience (= avoiding sensitive topics). Mamma Mia! is a nice exception, dealing with e.g. promiscuity and gay issues. As ABBA songs are timeless, then using them in a creation provides additional value - not distracting as some viewers have said. Of course, as all actors sing themselves, the quality of presentations is floating, but it is still better solution than characters having two performers - one for acting and the other for singing (particularly if an opera singer is used). The script has some nice twists and so does the ending, and overall joy, fun and talented dancing/moving scenes are pleasant to follow; to those seeking profundity: you cannot expect Wenders, Jarmusch or Malick to get involved in such a direction, and musicals are not meant to be gloomy and protracted.<br/><br/>The cast is brilliant as well, particularly Meryl Streep - as Donna - who has again shown her talent and versatility; her voice is far above average as well. On the whole, female characters outperform male ones: Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya are pleasantly funny, Amanda Seyfried as Sophie brings along both sad and grave undertones. Male characters spend limited time on screen, are shallow and Pierce Brosnan's singing is quite terrible...<br/><br/>Thus, if you like musicals with fine music and great performances, Mamma Mia! is definitely for you. Also for fans of Streep."
"vchimpanzee","Null","1","1","13 September 2013"," Funny and enjoyable even without the music
","I liked the music of ABBA in the 1970s. Or rather, I liked the familiar music of ABBA. This movie features a lot of songs I never heard and for the most part don't like. But part of the appeal of ABBA songs is those beautiful voices. An added bonus, as I found out after Dick Clark died and ABC showed a New Year's Eve special with the best moments from New Year's Eves past, is seeing those good-looking girls perform.<br/><br/>This movie had a perfectly good plot without the songs. I liked the mystery of who Sophie's father is. I liked all the comedy and seeing Meryl Streep not take herself too seriously. The film was especially funny when each potential Dad realized he must be Sophie's Dad.<br/><br/>The songs do add something. Some of them have dancing that is fun to watch. And Streep gets to be even more silly. Plus she's quite flexible, but that's nothing compared to Christine Baranski, who apparently can move like a circus performer.<br/><br/>The natives seemed real enough. I'm referring to the people who didn't seem American or British who apparently had always lived wherever this movie took place.<br/><br/>I don't even remember the names of the potential fathers, but they all did a good job. Particularly the one with the boat. Pierce Brosnan was my favorite of the three, and he could even sing. Well, he had the talent that George Burns has for singing. In other words, not really singing talent, but you like him enough you don't care. Sadly, I saw the movie ""Evelyn"" around the same time I saw this, and he sang in that too. He wasn't any better and yet his character was trying to make a living.<br/><br/>I could have done without the wild rock concert at the end. Surely Streep has more dignity than that. And yet she is so respected even that couldn't hurt her reputation, and she seemed to be enjoying it. I'm sure many others will.<br/><br/>It's a worthy effort.<br/><br/>Sophie looks good in a swimsuit."

","Mamma Mia! is a musical/romantic comedy film adapted from the 1999 West End/2001 Broadway musical of the same name, based on the songs of successful pop group ABBA, with additional music composed by ABBA member Benny Andersson.The title originates from ABBA's 1975 chart-topper ""Mamma Mia"". Meryl Streep heads the cast, playing the role of single mother Donna Sheridan together with Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgård,who play the three possible fathers to Donna's daughter, Sophie,played by Amanda Seyfried.The other cast includes Julie Walters,Dominic Cooper,Christine Baranski and Juan Pablo Di Pace. The film was directed by Phyllida Lloyd.<br/><br/>Independent-minded single mother Donna has always done her best to raise her spirited daughter, Sophie, while simultaneously running a successful hotel on a small Greek island, but now the time has come for this hardworking mom to finally let go. In just a few days, Sophie will be married, and Donna will stand by bittersweetly as her little girl takes flight. Of course, Donna's lifelong friends Rosie and Tanya will both be present at the wedding, but unbeknownst to the mother, Sophie has furtively invited three very special guests of her own. When Sophie walks down the aisle on that fateful day, she wants her father to hand her off. The only problem is that Donna has never revealed the true identity of Sophie's father, leaving the resourceful future bride to narrow the list down to three potential candidates. Now, as three key figures from Donna's past return to the picturesque Mediterranean shores they all walked 20 years prior, one beautiful bride will discover the secret of her past while one.<br/><br/>It wasn't a perfect adaptation, but it definitely captured the flavor, spirit and fun of the original material despite the fact that this jukebox musical is full of fun. Unfortunately,rough singing voices and a campy tone might not make you feel like dancing.But nevertheless,there's a neat free spirit versus family values message here, about a dad being no big deal when you can have three. Not to mention that family is more about who loves you, than whatever does or doesn't dangle between their legs."
"marquiswillis98","2","1","1","27 October 2012"," A cheesy musical not worth watching
","This movie was incredibly cheesy and a waste of time. Even though this is a musical there was no need to literally sing every 2 minutes. I do not understand why everyone in the movie would be so joyful and happy when they are singing about a serious subject like how she didn't grow up with a father and did not know who he was. I did not even want to finish this movie because it was just too overly peppy. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who does not like stupid musiclas. I am a fan of Meryl Streep but i think this is her one of her worst movies. this movie was a disappointment even with Meryl Streep in it. I feel like the characters did not fit well either. The only people who would like this movie would have to love corny musicals. Maybe with a better script this movie would have turned out better."
"PartialMovieViewer","Null","1","1","12 October 2011"," Very Depressing Cast on Happy Drugs?
","One of the greatest advancements of the entertainment industry has to be the invention of the, 'Best of Albums', and, of course, that is the main way I will always remember ABBA. It was one of the first 'Best of Albums' I ever purchased. And to me, this is the ideal way to enjoy their music. You just pick the music you wanted to listen to and skip the songs you had no interest in. This 'Best of Album' probably saved my life. I know if I had listened to ABBA all the way through, the depression probably would have ended me up on the wrong side of a hemp necktie. Gotta love modern technology. In retrospect, I remember listening to these songs as they first hit the airways. I am still amazed at the authors' abilities to put gushing heart wounds to paper, script river-of-tears-music and have these emotional thorns of despair vocalized by ABBA – a true WIN-WIN proposal. I also thought each song told an individual story that may have been experienced by one of the members of quartet. Boy was I wrong. And why did they call the movie Mama-Mia? It should have been named, 'Who's Your Daddy?' Why do I say that – you ask. Well this is a story about a bunch of guys getting invited to an island by the same woman, to witness the wedding of said-woman's daughter. The daughter does not know who her pop is, the guys are bunch of horns waggled horn-dogs and the mom – well – let's just say she obviously has a problem with the word, 'No.' Where do we go next? Hmmmmm. Wait – wait – I feel a song coming on. I really do. Let me break into an ABBA song (oh pick one – they have nothing to do with the movie), slap on my dancing shoes, and just go-a-leaping across the screen. The plot turns into a wild, wacky romp across some exotic island – with stars-a-singing and dancing, and random hootenannies and weddings popping up everywhere. I did sit through this thing from beginning to end and was emotionally beaten down. As with all ABBA songs, the peppy music is anchored to extremely depressing lyrics. The movie was – well – the same. At the end – do you laugh, cry or just commit suicide? I did make one helpful observation at the end though. I noticed that all ABBA songs sound the same."
"laraliu10","10","1","1","1 June 2011"," Can someone PLEASE explain to me why this thing landed a mediocre 6.4?!?!?!?!? No spoilers!! Promise!!
","To start, I should probably tell you about me so you don't say she's bias. So... I am a fourteen year old girl. I love ABBA. I had been begging my mother to see the musical for years after I got the soundtrack from my aunt. I knew every song by heart walking into the theater. All I got from my mom in terms of summary is ""Its about this girl who wants her dad at her wedding and has three possible dads.""<br/><br/>So... my review. I am telling you right now, all those people who hated it, I don't know what movie they saw. This movie was absolutely amazing. It is a happy, feel good, singing in your seat kinda movie. I loved it: it was funny, the cast was spectacular, the settings beautiful, and those songs left me dancing my way through the parking lot. NO lies. So to review this movie for you I am going to ""borrow"" aka ""steal"" a review method I really liked from Brooklyn Sherman (this right here thats me giving credit OK :) ). So here it goes: <br/><br/>-->Characters: 18/20- For me, it was nailed. All the characters had their own personality and life to them. They were fun personalities that had interesting characteristics that you could easily step into their shoes, see life from their angle. I only gave this two off because Sophie's best friends (whom you will meet in the first scene, no spoilers here!) weren't developed that much, but its not bad because they weren't the main part of the movie.<br/><br/>-->Story: 20/20- This is a truly great story. It had lots of fun, twists and turns, cool key plot points. The basic plot line is this girl has three possible dads and wants the right one at her wedding, as I said before. Its a fun story and has a great foundation for the music and characters. Anyway, the story idea was awesome. Just look at its running on Broadway!<br/><br/>-->Acting: 19/20- The acting was amazing. The four leading ladies were great, especially Meryl Streep as Donna, I think she should have had an Oscar for this. Amanda Seyfried also did a great job in one of her breakthrough performances. Firth, Bronsan, and Skarsgard were also great as the three leading men. Both Sophie and Donnas (daughter and mother) friends were great, they were very funny. The only 1 point off is for Brosnans attempt at singing, he was in tune and stayed on key, but hes not the best singer in the world. If you see this movie, which I hope you do after my review, you will be looking at stellar acting by a great cast.<br/><br/>-->Moral and Family Orientation: 17/20- The movie is VERY funny and a great for a family night. I mean it doesn't exactly have 'morals' but it does teach you things like appreciate what you have, don't give up, treasure life and such like that. The only issue someone might have with this is its not suited for younger children (6 down) as there are many sexual references. But it is good family fun and good for boys and girls alike.<br/><br/>-->Music: 20/20- Yay we have reached this i was looking forward to reviewing this part!! I love ABBA the music is classy, catchy, fun, and has great instrumentals. The music is fun, lively, and positively toe-tapping! (why yes, i did write toe-tapping!) And the music fits neatly into the context of the story, and gives the events surrounding each # some life! The songs are great, and there is one very comedic song.<br/><br/>-->Overall: 94/100- Thats an A in my book! Overall the movie is funny family film with a great story line and songs that will leave you on a trip to iTunes so you can hear them all day long! (I seriously did this, again NO lies. I went and bought the soundtrack and listened to it the whole day) <br/><br/>-->Bonus-Cinematography: 20/20- This movie has absolutely beautiful scenery, if nothing else watch it for that. I mean this is gorgeous. It is set in a small island off of Greece where the water is crystal clear and the sun shimmers on the waves, the palm trees sway in the wind, and its the kind of movie scenery that makes you wish you were there.<br/><br/>So, thats a pretty good score is it not? I loved this movie, as did everyone in the theater, my friends, and entire family. Every single one of us loved it. I hope this review has made you want to watch this movie, and I hope you enjoy Mamma Mia!!!! p.s. Every time you see a bad review, look at its award winning streaks on Broadway and change your mind!"
"marcin_kukuczka","8","1","1","22 May 2011"," When All Is Sung And Won
","Being a fan of the legendary pop group that supplied us with such adorable hits, I was keen on seeing this musical for several reasons. The title, MAMMA MIA, which originates from ABBA's 1975 chart-topper, evokes certain curiosity and enthusiasm. Except for the world-known song ""Mamma Mia,"" and the box office success of the movie, there is a story behind, a story to sing rather than to tell...a story to sing with the creative use of immortal ABBA hits...<br/><br/>And I admit that the great merit of this musical lies in the humorous, adequate use of the lyrics and dynamic music by the Swedish pop group. As a matter of fact, we get the wide range of their tunes with certain contexts that fit particularly to the very moments. Among many unforgettable scenes, I particularly enjoyed ""Money Money Money"" (with its excellent manifestation of Donna's finances); ""Our Last Summer"" (with its desirable reference to her carefree past); ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" (with the lovely combination of fun and erotic tension); and ""The Winner Takes it All"", one of my ABBA's favorites where pain of loss goes with some hope for the future...the scene is very good because it does resist the 'temptation' to fall into exaggerated sentimentality. And the content? <br/><br/>The dilemmas of a young woman, Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) are depicted humorously and flexibly enough to result in a convincing storyline. Her dilemmas, just before her wedding, focused on figuring out who her real father is absorbs all the people around, including her two best friends Ali (Ashley Lilley) and Lisa (Rachel Mc Dowall), her mother's friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baransky), and, most importantly, her own mother Donna (Meryl Streep). What a character....this Mamma Mia! Donna Sheridan is the owner of a wonderful villa rumored to have been built on the legendary fountain of the goddess of love, Aphrodite. And love has a significant word in that... Donna seems to know her 'secret Fernando...' As the story develops, the love occurs to be stronger than anything else and ""there is no hurry any more when all is said and done..."" More and more couples, more and more sympathies, the lovely words ""I Do I Do I Do"" are being sung and the hearts in dance being won.<br/><br/>The locations of the movie...Greece...where people breathe love with the air and where song, no matter if romantic or ecstatic...has a power to win people's hearts constitute an important aspect of the artistry. The small Greek island Skopelos and the Pelion area have been chosen as the locations for the Kalokairi island where the events are set. And the use of the sets is truly brilliant with the feeling for the Mediterranean beauty. Where else could such a story be set if not in those idyllic places? <br/><br/>Except for Amanda Seyfried who looks gorgeous, the performances are rather average...even if the movie has such an important cinema star as Pierce Brosnan. Yet, there is one exception, one person that truly stands out in her performance and that is Meryl Streep. She does a marvelous job portraying her character with wit, with flexibility, with a magnificent flair for combining craziness essential in such comedy with a great degree of emotionality that links her with the viewers. But, foremost, she surprises as by her singing ABBA songs. Having been taught opera as a child, she has already stunned viewers by singing in films like SILKWOOD and A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION but in MAMMA MIA she is just marvelous, magnetizing and incomparable.<br/><br/>A nice musical, a lovely film for TWO being watched affectionately at a summer night city flat, a beach bar somewhere on the coast or in a nice cottage room...an inspiring romantic sentiment, humor that always makes our lives brighter and a lovely escape from the everyday rush that occurs pointless when all is sung and won... It seems that we are having fun, indeed! Thank you for the musicAL!"

","I have to admit that I am a fan of ABBA and I really enjoyed their music so I decided to check this movie out because when I saw the trailer, I thought to my self, ""I am going to love this movie"".<br/><br/>So 5 minutes in I saw that the movie was really over the top, most people would call it bad acting but I believe they were meant to play them so over the top. It was like theater performances were every character is like he's going to have a stroke in the next 10 minutes. The music starts early and as a fan of ABBA I had no real problems with the songs. It takes time to get used to Meryl Streep and other actors singing but it gets there. When the song start there is a lot of energy that comes through it and it was mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>In the second part of the movie that energy went away very quickly and it became dreadful with the cliché storyline and the horrifically obvious outcome. The actors are most fine, still there was something so wrong about hearing Pierce Brosnan singing, he fit the part but not the singing, James Bond doesn't sing! Christine Baranski, Stellan Skarsgaard and Julie Walters are also rather entertaining but got a little on my nerves when the movie went on.<br/><br/>Just like Sex and the City, you have a very good idea what you're going into and if you don't , you're going to be rather disappointed. If you don't like ABBA, this movie is not for you. If you like ABBA you will at least like me, mildly enjoy it.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia is not Hairspray that's for sure. I believe it needed less over the top acting and more quality writing but unfortunately everything thing went into becoming an up-beat musical and when that happens everything else suffers. Mamma Mia is watchable I you like musicals but if not, don't bother.<br/><br/>5/10"

The production values just seem low.<br/><br/>For example, you see Meryl Streep singing a great song on a hill with barely movement from her or the camera, it's like she's singing on a stage, but worse.

The camera angles and movements are amateurish, not helped by her often out of focus cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukos. Oh, it's a great chick flick cum Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants or Little Miss Sunshine with music, but West Side Story it ain't. It lacks the polish of Hairspray, Chicago or Little Shop of Horrors.

"jcduffy","Null","1","1","22 September 2009"," Just go listen to ABBA Gold
","Having read Anthony Lane's review of Mamma Mia for the New Yorker, I approached this film with appropriately low expectations. I knew everyone was going to have orange skin. I knew the actors would not be doing very graceful or interesting things while they sang. I knew the film was just a vehicle for ABBA songs, which meant that it was going to have a thin, contrived plot--and that was fine with me. Like virtually every other viewer who has chipped in to the financial success of this film and the Broadway musical it was based on, I was only watching it for the ABBA anyway. It would be nostalgic, it would be peppy, it would be fun. I'd get to enjoy the pleasure of anticipation--""Oh, I know what song is coming here!""--or, alternatively, the laughter of surprised recognition when the actors launched into a song I hadn't seen coming.<br/><br/>In the end, I didn't even get that. It was clear within five minutes that this film was going to be excruciatingly overacted. The loud cackling laughter, the slapstick, the spastic dancing, the needless acrobatics (hanging and falling off of roofs). Certain leading actors' inability to sing, which made it hard to enjoy the music. I give the creators credit for incorporating songs into the storyline in, let's say moderately clever ways. But watching how poorly acted and choreographed this movie was, I thought: Is the problem that the people making this film are too embarrassed by the silliness of the premise to take it seriously enough to make it good? You can know that the premise of your film is silly--you can signal to the audience that you know it's silly--but you can still love it enough and pour enough care into it to create a film that's impressively executed and delightful to watch, even heartwarming. Baz Luhrmann has demonstrated that brilliantly with Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge. Perhaps Luhrmann could have made this film enjoyable. As is, I'd have gotten more enjoyment from just putting on my headphones and popping ABBA Gold into my CD player."
"Galina_movie_fan","6","1","1","31 August 2009"," Saving the world is easy, singing is difficult
","In order to enjoy this movie, you should be a fan or at least like ABBA's songs because the whole Mamma Mia's idea is just an excuse for letting the grateful viewers/listeners experience their favorite songs in a relaxing and feeling good setting on a colorful sunny idyllic Greek isle surrounded by the bluest sea you can imagine. I consider myself a loyal ABBA's fan. I still remember how I heard their songs for the first time almost thirty years ago, how happy I was to be able to own their albums on LPs, how much I enjoyed ABBA: The Movie (1977) which came to Moscow in the beginning of the 1980s and was basically the record of their concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. I also saw the famous musical Mamma Mia on which the last year movie is based on and I liked it a lot. It would not hurt if you can take with humor outrageous psychedelic outfits of the 1970s and the tight boots with the platforms so huge that it makes your feet hurt just to look at them. If that sounds like your idea of fun, fun you'll have. I sure did, at least for the first hour or to be precise until the very moment, Pierce Brosnan had ruined my favorite ABBA's song S.O.S by attempting to sing it. I guess it is sometimes easier to save the world from all sorts of evil than just to sing a song. While that torture lasted, I kept repeating instead of S.O.S, S.O.E which means Save Our Ears. I later found out that when asked during an interview why he took the role, Brosnan replied that when he heard from his agent, ""Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep"", he took it without asking whom he'd play. Well, acting next to Streep is a great reason, and I believe Brosnan had a lot of fun sharing the screen with her. I also believe that there is nothing impossible for Meryl. She can play anything and anybody. Just to think what she has done in all the movies she has graced with her presence. She did very convincing accents, she learned how to play a violin, she dances, she has been a villain and a saint, and everybody in between and she's been always the reason to watch any movie. While watching Mamma Mia, I got the crazy idea. What if Meryl played all six older characters, Donna, her two girlfriends and three men from her past? I know it sounds weird but if Eddie Murphy could do it, I am sure Meryl Streep could act and sing for six characters and she would be simply fabulous. Between Streep and young talented Amanda Seyfried, two of them made a nice singing/acting team. But even with Meryl playing and singing only one part, the film is still entertaining and fun mostly due to the fact that everyone involved had a good time on the charming little island, the serious actors were not afraid to make fools out of themselves for all of us to enjoy, and in the end everyone was happy and got what they wanted even if it was not exactly what they wanted in the beginning of the movie."

His character was portrayed beautifully and has the good rightful singing voice! <br/><br/>Seeming like I know every ABBA sang, this film made me up and running. The singing was not bad, not like Whitney Houston, but it still captivated me and the audience to dance about and laugh. Everything a dazzling film could hope for.

"crossbow0106","8","1","1","22 July 2009"," You Know What? Its Good.
","I didn't expect much so I was happy watching this film. There isn't much of a story here, a young lady named Sophie is getting married and she invites three men that dated her mom in and around the same time, one of whom is her father. This would fall flat as a drama but as a musical with those infectious ABBA songs, it becomes fun to watch. Meryl Streep is fine as Donna, Sophie's mom and she sings reasonably well. I would suggest turning up the movie a bit louder and immerse yourself in it. The supporting players, including Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, are all part of the fun. Not much to think about, but that makes it a better film. So, enjoy, its worth watching."
"hannahwhiteley","7","1","1","14 June 2009"," Good Songs!
","I'd definitely give this ten out of ten for the songs but I feel that the storyline wasn't very good at all! Julie Walters is hilarious in this but i feel that the film has but a bad reputation to both Abba and their songs. I also fail to recognise why Colin Firth was gay. What was the point? Furthermore I think that wasn't that a waste of a good actor? I did love the setting though - the Greek Island took my heart away. The beach looked gorgeous and it looked incredibly warm. I have nothing against the actors I thought they were all amazing, their voices were great I just think that comparing such great songs to quite a rubbish story failed to impress me!"
"mnpollio","6","1","1","3 April 2009"," Pleasant, but unremarkable rendition of the far better stage hit
","Back when the stage show Mamma Mia first arrived, I refused to see it largely because it sounded inane to me. A year later still going strong on Broadway, I knuckled under and was stunned at how much joyful fun that it turned out to be. The energy between the performers and the audience and the show's unflinchingly sunny demeanor were infectious. Unfortunately, these are elements that are incredibly difficult to translate to the screen, as proved by the film adaptation of the same show.<br/><br/>The slight storyline is a transparent reworking of Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell. Set on an exotic Greek island, Meryl Streep finds her world turned upside-down when wedding preparations for her daughter Amanda Seyfried to Dominic Cooper are interrupted by the arrival of three men from her past, one of whom unknowingly is the father of the bride. The storyline only has to be good enough to hang a wide diversity of ABBA songs on – and for the most part it is. However, the film takes some liberties from the play that simply do not work on screen.<br/><br/>The lion's share of the muted effect of this film, cannot be laid at the feet of the cast or the screenplay, but on the direction. Director Phyllida Lloyd does not seem to know how to film production numbers for maximum impact or stages them in such a completely inappropriate way as to diminish them. As a result, numbers that worked incredibly well on stage are re-staged here amateurishly. Several times, Lloyd actually interrupts numbers that have real potential to cut away to dialog scenes and then never returns to the music. This happens several times. Other numbers are clumsily rendered to try to get a laugh which takes the winds out of the sails of the performers. Julie Walters' version of Take a Chance of Me is constantly upstaged by crummy attempts at physical comedy which prevent the actress from really belting it out of the park, which anyone who has heard her on the soundtrack knows she could do. Similarly, Does Your Mother Know was a show-stopper on stage and would seem a perfect fit for Christine Baranski, but the filming and choreography of the number in the film comes across like ball bearings in a garbage disposal, leaving the viewer to wonder at its end, ""Is that it?"" <br/><br/>This is not to suggest that the film does not have its moments or some charm. Streep is surprisingly appealing and amusing despite a pleasant, but limited vocal range. Walters and Baranski are amusing as her friends, although they are never given the opportunities of their stage counterparts to really showcase their vocal and comic chops. One respects the efforts of the film to beef up the male roles to some extent, but this has limited success. Stellan Skarsgaard is fine, but the comedic aspects appear to have been drained from what was a very funny role on the stage. I like Pierce Brosnan in most everything, but when he opens his mouth to sing, some unholy combination of Joe Cocker and Winston Churchill bursts forth that makes one want to drive spikes into their ears. The relief that they have spared us his mutilating Knowing Me, Knowing You, is short-lived when we then must endure a tortuous new addition for him at the end. Of the three male leads, Colin Firth comes across as the most charming and appealing and reveals a sweet singing voice. I do have a problem with the film's treatment of his character, though. In the play, it is not unexpectedly revealed that Harry is gay and has a long-time partner back in England. Here, while I have no problem with the film pairing Harry up with a hot younger guy in Greece to keep him close to his newfound ""family"", the ludicrous build-up that heretofore this guy in his late 40s had ""no idea"" that he was gay until exchanging some barely noticeable glances with a male bartender feeds into a lot of misguided myths about homosexuality being a choice. Seyfried is a revelation as the daughter and she is nicely matched by the hot, underused Cooper as her paramour – who sadly does his one production number in bathing trunks and not a form-fitting Speedo like his stage counterpart.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is pleasant, easy on the eyes, and a relatively painless 90 minutes, but never comes close to capturing the lightning-in-a-bottle, unapologetically cheesy charisma of the mega-hit Broadway show."

","""Take a trip down the aisle you'll never forget"" <br/><br/>Longing to discover the identity of her true father before she exchanges her wedding vows, the daughter of a once-rebellious single mother secretly invites a trio of paternal candidates to her upcoming wedding in this feature adaptation of the beloved stage musical. Independent-minded single mother Donna (Meryl Streep) has always done her best to raise her spirited daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), while simultaneously running a successful hotel on a small Greek island, but now the time has come for this hardworking mom to finally let go. In just a few days, Sophie will be married, and Donna will stand by bittersweetly as her little girl takes flight. Of course, Donna's lifelong friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) will both be present at the wedding, but unbeknownst to the mother, Sophie has furtively invited three very special guests of her own. When Sophie walks down the aisle on that fateful day, she wants her father to hand her off. The only problem is that Donna has never revealed the true identity of Sophie's father, leaving the resourceful future bride to narrow the list down to three potential candidates. Now, as three key figures from Donna's past return to the picturesque Mediterranean shores they all walked 20 years prior, one beautiful bride will discover the secret of her past while one lonely mother finds out that it's never too late for a little romance. Phyllida Lloyd, director of both the original London sensation as well as the hit Broadway incarnation, makes her feature directorial debut with this big-screen version of the beloved musical featuring 22 classic ABBA hits. Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, and Dominic Cooper co-star. <br/><br/>Review The gayest movie to have come out this year (and by gay I mean jolly), Mamma Mia! surprisingly, shocked me. 'Shock' might be the right term because first off, I'm not really a fan of ABBA and second, musicals isn't really my cup of tea; but every once in a while, I'm head over heels when a good musical comes my way (Across the Universe and Sweeney Todd comes to mind). <br/><br/>Mamma Mia! told a story: a story of a young woman searching for his real dad in scenic Greece the day before her wedding and they used the music of ABBA as the narrative device. The music is hip, its funky, its catchy and some adults out there might just feel nostalgic listening to the songs they grew up with when they were young. <br/><br/>I'm gonna use the word 'shock' once again as Pierce Brosnan, the man we know and love as Agent 007 belts it out to the tune of the gayest song ever (and by gay I mean jolly). The guy sang, and he sang his heart out. A pretty impressive turn from hard edged spy thrillers to a dancing and singing gay movie. Meryl Streep, also quite the charmer, sang her heart out as well. Newcomer Amanda Seyfried, last time I saw her she was cupping her boobs to predict the weather in Mean Girls also took a mighty impressive turn as the poster girl for the promotion of the movie and quite honestly, she held out on her own. She definitely has the acting (and singing) chops. I'm gonna see more of her in the future. <br/><br/>In its entirety, Mamma Mia! is quite an enjoyable musical ride from start to finish. You wouldn't want to miss it."
"ranger6000","1","5","12","20 December 2008"," Worst movie since remake of Lost Horizon
","One would like to say something good about this film, since it has done so well on the stage. But this travesty of a musical is about as bad as it can be. The casting is lame. The film editing is deplorable. Pierce Brosnan cannot carry a tune in a water bucket. Given their appearance, none of the men could possibly be the girl's father. Halfway through, I was wishing I was somewhere else and hoping the camera would malfunction. Meryl Streep, a fine actress, should fire her agent for getting her into this mess. There is just no continuity in the story, and some of the ABBA songs don't even fit the situations that have been contrived to squeeze them into the production. Buy the soundtrack if you must have something of this to remember."
"menamebekamp","1","5","12","16 August 2008"," Argh.
","I really, really don't now what to say with this one. It's... just absolutely the opposite of a good film. Or a good musical. There is only one set of words to describe this film. *&^%# &%%^%%#$* (*&%#$@&. It's like watching a training video. ""How NOT to Make A Musical"". While watching it, I can imagine a Leonard Nimoy-type saying ""People don't like excessive overacting."" ""Remember, even if your picture is a comedy, make the plot at least cohesive enough for escapism, if not intellectual thought"". Well,now I'm going to run through what is wrong with this film. PLOT: The plot summary is this: three teenage girlfriends are going to some island in Greece so that one of them can marry her ""LOOOOOVE"". Along for the ride are an earlier generation that is exactly the same as the younger one- I mean EXACTLY. They even shriek the same way when they greet each other. But that's another story. The girl who's getting married wants her daddykins on the island for the wedding, but she doesn't know who dear daddy is because her mum slept with three different men. For the majority of the movie we see i'm-getting-married girl search for daddy and her mum and her girlfriends hang out to cheesy pop music. Near the end, we find out who's her daddy, she doesn't get married to her boyfriend because he doesn't want commitment,and for some totally unrealistic and unfunny reason everyone in the film is somehow in love with someone else in the film. this has no particular purpose apart from making a contrived ""happy"" ending or simply responding to the general stupidity, ridiculous optimism, and general love-themed ABBA music. Which brings me to the next thing- MUSIC: What would they pick for a musical? Now, I am slightly biased in this area because a can't lose myself or be serious about a movie in which the characters suddenly and for no apparent reason start singing. However, musicals done correctly- The sound of music, or the fiddler on the roof- I do enjoy. So trust me when I tell you that ABBA's records played in this film are absolute drivel. I was quite neutral about abba's music before seeing this movie, but now I feel like hanging every band member. The songs used in the movie, as i said, are ridiculous, insanely chirpy, cheesy, optimistic crap of the highest level. Add to the fact that one ""ditty"" is played every two minutes and you've got extremely annoying. So it's too stupid to be a drama. but the writing and jokes alternate between insanely obvious to unexpected but stupid, so it can't be a comedy either. The acting is either unbelievably overacted- for example, when the two sets of ""girlfriends"" shriek, screech, holler, and generally act as though they've just been transported to Alien- as a greeting. Yes, there are screechy groups of women, but this exaggeration is un-comparably out-of-whack. and then, it branches into monotone, as in the talking scenes, which shift to mentally disabled north-dakotans talking to each other (in other words, no emotion whatsoever). All in all, I would rather take arsenic pills than watch this film again, I hope you won't ever watch it. Please, spare yourself the horror."

","Musical movies are movies after all, and even a good musical play can be a bad, bad movie.<br/><br/>This is a bad bad movie, made by someone who is not a filmmaker. No Julie Taymor here: her stage skills do not translate well to the screen and in fact every single cinematic device here is borrowed, many even from ""Sound of Music.""<br/><br/>But its still an enjoyable experience. The girl is pretty and there are is a staging of a wedding that will color fantasies for a hundred years. The songs, even in their versions here, are gloriously catching. They all seem to have been designed to walk, walk, walk, hold, so even by listening you are dancing; the prancing we see is only a reminder, clothes exaggerated to highlight the important parts.<br/><br/>The only affecting thing in the performances is that Meryl gives the impression that she is having fun. And we enjoy that, especially a bit after the credits start. She's near sixty and I imagine has a long life yet.

It's one thing for there to be songs thrown in with quality acting otherwise, but no one acts like that. <br/><br/>Streep was very good with her songs at times; other times, again, far too campy. The scene where she is just writhing and rolling on the rooftop - please! <br/><br/>There were some decent song scenes that were very entertaining.

"krisroboneil","3","4","9","24 July 2008"," Horrible ! Horrible !
","Icky, sticky, gooey, and lighter-than-air. Oh, and, almost meaningless. I went to see Meryl Streep,who, ordinarily could read the phonebook and make it compelling. I don't know what possessed her(?) Could the greatest actress of my time lack judgement, completely? Would she really rather be a singer? Her gentle parlando is pretty good. The big, over-the-top numbers had me grimacing and wincing. Musicals, I would think, should have people who can sing, and I mean really well. There were some good voices, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, the daughter character. Most of the rest reminded me of why needed Marni Nixon.Actors want to be singers and singers want to be actors. There are only a handful who can do both, successfully. I don't think a singer has to have a pristine voice, necessarily, ""Acting"" a song makes it real, so, I am a little conflicted. I just expect to hear better-than-average musicianship, when I go to a musical.That only makes sense. Would you tolerate bad violin playing at the symphony? PierceBrosnan, if that was his real voice, is a freak of nature. He sounded like he was playing Bluebeard the Pirate whenever he sang. I was literally afraid another musical number would ensue with him in it, and yet, I was giddy for all the wrong reasons. I've never heard someone vomit lyrics before. Okay, enough bashing of singers. Now, I have an unusual comment. Meryl Streep looked really weird. Her skin tone looked sickly to me. It was very distracting.And,I did not like watching my favorite actress debasing herself with this saccharine, melodramatic, cartoon of a movie.I don't understand how she could amaze me in so many roles and then, utterly disappoint me in this thing. Is it direction?<br/><br/>The few shots of the actual outdoors of Greece, or Corfu, or wherever were quite beautiful. It's true, the outdoor shots actually did enhance this movie. The soundstage shots were obvious.<br/><br/>Christine Baranski stole the show. Imagine that !Just like when she stole it from another over-acting blonde who could only kinda-sorta sing. Her singing was really quite fine, and she performed in what I considered the best musical bit in the whole movie.<br/><br/>I love musicals. I don't need bombs and chase scenes to make me happy. I've seen lots and lots of them. This musical falls short of the mark. I'm sure it scored very well with it's intended audience.<br/><br/>Meryl, Julie, you are two of the greatest actresses of our time....WTF?"

","Who'd of thought that Abba songs could be so operatic? Certainly not me! The fact that I hadn't seen the stage-play (by the same name) probably added to my surprise.<br/><br/>Being no fan of that Swedish rock group of the 70s and 80s, I was doubly surprised to find myself enjoying this film so much. In no small measure was my enjoyment thanks to the all-star cast, no doubt, but also how well incorporated the songs were within the story.<br/><br/>The story is worthy of a Shakespearean comedy with high confusion, paternal bonds in question, and lady-love finding its way into the audiences heart in unusual ways. The story, this time, revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, HOUSE M.D.) and her desire to find her true father before her wedding. Stumbling upon her mother's diary, Sophie finds three candidates that might be her dad. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA) has no idea that her daughter has invited three of her former loves to the wedding. And when they arrive, paternal sparks go a-flying, as do the flickers of old romances. Harry (Colin Firth) comes to the wedding out of fear that he'd done something and then left it undone (i.e., not properly fathering his daughter). Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END) comes simply because he's curious. But Sam (Pierce Brosnan, THE MATADOR) arrives with a burning love-gone-by for Donna. And when Donna finds out all three of these old flames have arrived for the wedding, chaos ensues ...mixed with some toe-tapping music (Gah! Toe-tapping to Abba!).<br/><br/>The other element to the story are two old work friends of Donna's (they were a trio of singers at one time) who arrive for the wedding and find Donna in a frazzled state. Rosie (Julie Walters, BECOMING JANE) is the active and playful one with plenty of spunk, while Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the sexual over-achiever who has to fight off the advances of a few young island boys.<br/><br/>Surprises abound as the movie winds down. One person comes out of the closet, while two others find love (even though one is running away from any possible commitment). Donna herself might find love in the arms of one of those old flames. And Sophie's wedding gets a change of venue.<br/><br/>One of the final songs on the track (""Take a Chance on Me"") is extremely funny and well thought-out. And as the credits roll, there's some laugh-out-loud moments as we get to watch Colin Firth try to dance in a skin-tight, sequined outfit (along with the other main players in the film).<br/><br/>The final positive note for this movie has to be that the director Phyllida Lloyd was also responsible for MAMMA MIA's huge stage production success, and her translation of it from stage to silver screen was exceptionally well-rendered. This one's a surprisingly good film, even for those folks who aren't into Abba."

","Consider it a guilty pleasure, but I was caught up in the charm and high spirits of Mamma Mia! For those who have been asleep, this is the film version of the hit Broadway musical, a movie incidentally that has now surpassed Titanic as the biggest box office hit in UK history. Culled from the jukebox tunes of the Swedish pop group Abba that roll around in your head forever, the film stars the ubiquitous Meryl Streep and the ever charming Pierce Brosnan, two enormously popular Hollywood stars, as the romantic leads with some strong supporting help.<br/><br/>Set on a remote Greek island, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to be married to Sky (Dominic Harper) but wishes her dad was there to give her away. Seems like she doesn't really know who her father is so she invites to the wedding the three men her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) has written about in her diary: Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) who writes travel books, Harry (Colin Firth) a banker, and Sam (Pierce Brosnan) a businessman. Donna, who runs a crumbling hotel on the island, is naturally quite taken aback when she sees her ex-boyfriends and it is left up to Sophie and friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) to sort everything out. None of the men realize, however, why they have been invited but when things sink in, each claims to be Sophie's father and is ready to walk her down the aisle.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the three wise men do everything in their power to make the wedding a success which leads to some silly moments and some that are genuinely moving. Amanda Seyfried has a purity and innocence about her that is quite captivating and Meryl Streep, though not blessed with a great singing voice, more than makes up for it with her passion and versatility. Her singing is more than adequate, however, especially in Slipping Through My Fingers, The Winner Takes It All, Money, Money, Money, Voulez-Vous, and Does Your Mother Know? With stunning photography and timeless Abba hits of the 1970s such as Dancing Queen, Take a Chance on Me, Mamma Mia, SOS, Super Trooper and many others, the film is pure entertainment. If the director had included some real singers and dancers and fewer manic production numbers, it might have even been memorable. Barring that, one settles for great songs and positive energy."

I did that with this movie and left feeling happy and ready for the next day of life. I think this is why ABBA music has survived for so long and I'm happy to see another generation exposed to great lyrics and music. May someone see this that is in influence in Hollywood and attempt to pick up the gauntlet and continue to make fun, feel good movies. Musicals are a way to do this. With our economy in the tank we need to be inspired and have somewhere to forget the trials ahead and be uplifted and left feeling good."

","I must admit, when I first agreed to watch ""Mama Mia!"" with my wife, I felt I was doing penance for some terrible slight that I didn't remember. I've always considered ABBA to be a ""guilty pleasure,"" songs too inconsequential for me to change the FM station, but nothing I'd even consider having in my collection. I honestly believe ABBA represents the 70s at its worst, conspiring perfectly with the dreadful clothing styles and visual elements of the time. Further, the trite, contrived storyline is as appropriately dreadful as the music and costumes. That being said, I am thankfully pleased to state that ""Mama Mia!"" is the most thoroughly entertaining film I've seen and heard this year (Pierce Brosnan's singing, notwithstanding), beautifully choreographed, photographed and directed. While Meryl Streep deservedly receives accolades, the ensemble performances are all perfect.<br/><br/>If I have any quibble at all, it's why the producers cut one of ABBAs ""best"" songs, particularly since the sequence is less than 2 minutes.<br/><br/>I give ""Mama Mia!"" an 8."

Although I don't understand why the 20 year old girls would tie a 40-45 year old man to a pole and dance around him. Gross. Overall the movie wasn't so great. Of the six people that were in the theater, two left halfway through, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't because they had other plans.

If i where to describe this film in one word it would be awkward. really awkward. These actors tried so hard to look like they where having ""fun"" that they created this bizarre and unholy feel of ""happiness and well being"" which made you feel uncomfortable. But this comes as no surprise as ABBA was born from Eurovison back in the day which is infamous for its fake and cheese factor appeal. I couldn't help cringing and curling up in my seat when Pirece bleat out a classic ABBA song. Seeing that i am too young to have been a part of the ABBA craze and the play Mamma Mia itself i have taken into account that i could be ignorant to factors of what made this band so amazing back in the day. But if they where hoping to bring a new legion of fans to the ABBA scene they are sorely mistaken. The young Amanda Seyfried surprisingly held her notes and has come along way since mean girls and tried her best to work the Streeps corny ways and clicked with her rather well considering the little screen time which they had.<br/><br/>But one thing which caught my eye was the locations. The vast shots of the ocean and the golden light which spread all over the rocky shores were amazing. Shots like this probably saved the producers a couple of million on not having to spend so much money on tanning up and air brushing the actors. Streep is doing rather well for her age i might add. I began to envy these poor suckers in this film and almost considered them lucky to have been on such a beautiful set!

","The anodyne bubblegum music of Abba exemplifies the pre -Punk era of 70's pop.The Sex Pistols - compared to the Swedish Supergroup - were like Tequila compared to Babycham.From the lofty heights of their inverse musical snobbery,rock critics espoused the superiority of the unwashed ones over the glitzy candyfloss of the easy - on -the -eye - and - ear foursome whose popularity some saw as rivalling that of the Beatles. Thirty years on in a world bereft of Punk tribute groups,there is an Abba wannabe band on every street corner and their music has been further immortalised in the fabulously successful movie ""Mamma Mia!"".Eat that,rock critics! Let it be said right from the start that ""Mamma Mia"" is more likely to appeal to members of the gentler sex.Admirers of messrs Willis,Seagal,Stallone,Van Damme et al would be well advised to stay at home and play with their remotes.There is nothing here for you,boys. And the first twenty minutes or so,full of squealing girls and middle - aged ladies, is a tad tiresome,but the movie finds its own rhythm in due course.Even the most cold - hearted of critics will be won over by the sheer enthusiasm of the performances.This is not a Hollywood Musical,there are no great singers or dancers on display - indeed one might say some of the dancing is definitely of the end - of - the - pier variety,but it is all so energetic and good - humoured that it defies po - faced criticism. Miss M.Streep,not by any means a favourite of mine,gives her first truly great performance since ""The Deer Hunter"".Near the end of the movie she sings ""The winner takes it all"" against a backcloth of towering cliffs and the sparkling sea and it is a veritable tour de force.It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Ever since Mr Rex Harris proved back in 1956 that you don't have to be able to sing to star in a musical,actors have happily croaked their way through even the most complex of melodies(Miss Glynis Johns in Sondheim's ""A Little Night Music"" being amongst the most notable). Fortunately for Mr Pierce Brosnan,Abba's tunes are slightly less challenging and his valiant attempts are all the more charming for being clearly the work of an amateur rather than the polished dubbing of a seasoned pro. It is left to Miss Amanda Seyfried as Miss Streep's daughter to deliver the best performance of the movie when,accompanied by a solo piano,she sings ""Thank you for the music"" over the End - Titles.In complete contrast to the brash brassiness of all that has gone before it is a performance of true sensitivity,thoughtful,insightful and sincere. Wonderful;and a fitting finale to a movie that will bring back joy and laughter to our cinemas after far too long an absence."

Only Amanda Seyfried can sing and Colin Firth is a close second but they are definitely NOT singers. The rest of the cast can't carry a tune in a bucket. This could have been a really good musical w/the right cast. What they ended up with is really mediocre at best. Sure glad I didn't pay to see this. I'm sure the Broadway musical blows this away with little effort. The performances are fairly blah and the scenes don't transition smoothly. Even the acting is sub-par.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Any plot that is simply an excuse for a bunch of overpaid actors to sing bloody Abba songs really doesn't deserve any great detail off me but here's mine...twenty year old Sophie (Amanda Syfried) is about to get married and wants her real father to give her away and so sends letters off to three different men, including Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard.) Going on Jeremy Kyle and getting a DNA test would have saved everyone (especially the audience!) a lot of bother but instead they travel from Sweden, London and New York to the home of Sophie's mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on a Greek/cypriot? island and catch up on old times, all to a medley of none stop Abba tunes.<br/><br/>I had no intention of seeing Mamma Mia! From the outset, I could see it wouldn't be my type of film, as would be expected from one that appears to be aimed at women. But hey, guess what, it's gone and become the most successful film of the year and it's never nice to feel the odd one out. It's been very manipulative, drawing in a largely older audience with a strong affinity for Abba and their music, knocking far more deserving films (i.e. The Dark Knight) from their rightful box office top spot. But there you go. At times it got on my nerves so much I just wished Sweeney Todd would come along and slash all their smiley, sappy throats (""...think you can do musicals, huh? Well here's your old friend Sweeeney!!!"") another film that's had attention diverted from it as top musical of the year.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm just in a grumpy mood. There is an undeniable feel good factor to it, as well as the (unintentional?) hilarity of 007 himself Brosnan (easily the most out of place performer here) giving his rendition of SOS. And surely the sing along version's even better? **"

","First of all anyone who says this basic plot wasn't stolen from ""Buena Ser, Mrs. Campbell"" is nuts. The real difference is that the 60s movie with Gina Lollbrigida was hilarious and well- plotted and this Abba dabba doo film is a mess. Despite a wonderful cast, notably Meryl Streep, the story is completely implausible from the Greek Isle setting to the arrival of the three possible fathers, to the fact that no song has anything to do with the plot (or what there is of it). This is not a musical, but a music video with every song pretty much the same, which is fine if there were no pretense at having a story and real characters. The good news is that it shows us how deeply talented, Streep,Julie Walters, and Christine Baransky are. The bad news is that the three male leads fared less well and everybody looked old, tired and unmade up. One wonders if the misdirected director ever helmed another film. This film will probably do very well with millions of unsophisticated moviegoers who will tell you how swell it is. But if you really care about the integrated music, character development and silly little things like logic, you'll probably find yourself saying, ""Mama Mia, who thinks this is a good movie?"" Plus how can you possible love a character (the adorable lead) who reads someone else's diary. That already makes them despicable."

","There's quite a lot good in the movie version of Mamma Mia. Unfortunately that's offset by way-too-much bad. Like having filet mignon for dinner -- served cold; you gotta ask why?<br/><br/>To begin with the good, the girl playing Sophie is just perfect in every scene, and she generates much of the emotion in the story. The music is wonderful, but neither as good, or abundant as in the stage version.<br/><br/>To begin with the bad, the stage version managed to immediately place the audience on an island in Greece by using a few very basic stage sets; the movie's vastly expanded setting fails absolutely to place the story in Greece. Contributing to this is the liberal-agenda casting of the bartender role by a strange looking Jamaican actor. Hmmm! Only a liberal with a diversity agenda would fail to realize the role ought be played by a handsome young Greek. Where do you find a handsome Greek in Greece: Easier than finding sand in the desert. But the liberal diversity agenda comes first, appropriate casting doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The three older women are genuinely dis-likable in the movie. Washed up hippie s...ts (their word, not mine) and proud of it. The druggies of yesteryear haven't matured at all. (Not so with the three men.) In the play the women were a sympathetic trio; not here. <br/><br/>The photography is often excellent but is too frequently awful and careless. The worst of many examples is having the wedding scene in a small dimly lit church instead of outside in the sunshine. It's dark in there, you ninnies! <br/><br/>It takes two to make a romance, and while Sophie's role is perfect, where did they get the guy who plays her soon-to-be husband? He looks like a towel-jockey at the beach club. There is NO chemistry between them. In the final scene when the couple leave together, a real emotional swallow-hard in the play, the boy friend is completely off camera. We know he's there (more or less) but the only person the camera sees is Sophie.<br/><br/>Here were two flubs to disappoint the female audience. Not casting a handsome Greek in the role of the handsome Greek; and not casting a guy with sex appeal (or emotional appeal) as the fiancé. 4 out of 10."

However, despite cringing at a few of the songs (one of Pierce Brosnan's solos made my ears bleed and Julie Walter's ""Take a Chance"" made me attempt suicide--twice) and blanching at the dopey plot, I couldn't help but still enjoy the film on a totally brainless level because no matter who sings the songs (even Pierce), you can't help but tap your feet and enjoy the songs of ABBA...even if it's being sung by boobs. Like most people who saw this film, it brought me back to my younger days when the group was still around...however, my love for ABBA does NOT mean that I am so blinded as to ignore the many dumb moments in this film.<br/><br/>Here are the dumb points to this film:<br/><br/>1. The film is basically BUONA SERA MRS. CAMPBELL set to ABBA music. Come on, folks--try something new. <br/><br/>2.Clichés, clichés, clichés!!! Some of the worst and most amateur writing and dialog I've heard in years.<br/><br/>3. You make a musical and you choose people who can either sing adequately (Streep) or barely at all. Brosnan actually wasn't always horrible in the film (his third solo song was nice) but when he was bad, he was bad....really bad. Worse than Satan bad!<br/><br/>4. It's a great message for the kids here--a heart-warming family film about a single mom who turns out to be a super-slut. And, despite risking STDs and having a kid to raise all alone, everything works out perfectly in the end (14 year-olds take note).<br/><br/>5. Garish production numbers and a case of too much, too often when it comes to the songs. It often took the place of plot and made the film look, at times, like a giant music video. A musical is not the same as a two hour long music video.<br/><br/>So, while it's obvious that I didn't like the movie technically (uggh), it STILL is worth seeing just because ABBA is just amazing. Instead, however, I'd have just preferred they kidnapped Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Frida and made them perform once last time on film--now THAT would have been worth seeing! <br/><br/>Oh, and while I am thinking of it, all you oldsters out there (like me), you might want to think twice about seeing this film around your kids unless they already love ABBA---otherwise you'll never get them to like or listen to ABBA again after hearing their songs sung so poorly.<br/><br/>By the way, read over Leandro Dubost's review for a laugh.

","Basically everyone involved decided it would be hilarious if they just phoned it in really hard, and felt that their celebrity and ABBA would make it okay.

Him being a celebrity is not an excuse for casting Pierce Brosnan to sing and attempt an American accent. Being the most respected actress in the world is not an excuse for Meryl Streep to phone it in. Being a stupid movie is not an excuse for everyone involved to not try.<br/><br/>I'm torn about calling it the worst movie I've ever seen as a matter of the end product, but it is the one I hold in the most contempt. Nearly every other movie I've seen (including many a MST3K worthy outing) has given me the impression that most the people involved at least put in a workmanly effort, and usually that many people tried their best, to make it good. If one takes ""the Room"" for example, although the film is objectively terrible there is a sense that those involved are doing their often-pathetic, sometimes-deranged best. Even going down to detritus like ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"", many of the largely talentless local actors involved seemed to have been very invested in being in the movie and gave it their all.<br/><br/>In ""Mamma Mia!"", with minor exceptions (Christine Baranski, for example, played the exact same part she always does and always does well), everyone involved in this clearly had a lot of fun using the campy, fun feel of the film as an excuse to not do their jobs competently. It is a black stain on their resumés so far as I am concerned, and I'm sorry ABBA, I now associate your music with purposeful mediocrity every time I hear it."

I still have in mind, the dance between Dewey and babysitter played by Bea Arthur in ""Malcolm in the Middle', with ""Fernando"" (one of my favorite ABBA songs) in the background or ""Waterloo"" playing while Mr. Burns was pulling a 'Ride of the Valkyries' attack on the Simpsons' house. <br/><br/>ABBA songs have that incredible appeal, and it's no wonder that Catherine Johnson thought it would make a terrific musical, and no wonder it was that successful. But what I expected from the film (directed by Phyllida Lloyd) was to rely on a little more than the worldwide popularity of ABBA songs and the musical, because one can easily argue that the hardest part was over, the songs were great already; even the 'plot' on which to hang every popular song was written, with the exception of ""Fernando"" (couldn't they invent a character with that name!?). <br/><br/>Now, I saw the bonus features and I understand how shooting on location was difficult and what's more, teaching all the actors how to sing and dance, but with such a star-studded cast, the film was a no-fail-guarantee, let's not kid ourselves. And I won't even complain about the cast, Streep and Seyfried made the film, their enthusiasm was so catching that the screen was always illuminated by their presence, and the three bimbo males (Firth, Brosnan and Skargaard) took the whole thing in good spirit and everything was made in a fun and innocent way. So what went wrong? <br/><br/>Nothing exactly, except that the film basically recycled the plot from the original version and put stars into it, the director didn't try to appeal to a more demanding audience or to enrich the story a little bit, as if she was convinced it would be a hit already. In the end, the story doesn't really matter, and if some plot elements are incredibly contrived, if it's the kind of idiotic plot that could be solved if simple questions were asked at the right moment, well, we'll just have to pretend that the film is deliberately fun and corny and doesn't take itself seriously, so why should we? But I don't know, sometimes, I enjoy the 'what the heck, let's have fun' aspect, and sometimes, I wonder if they aren't all in on a big joke, that we're supposed to enjoy, without asking questions. <br/><br/>But I'm sorry, I couldn't believe Donna wouldn't figure out why these three guys were here at the same time, I couldn't believe that it took her till the wedding to realize the truth or not to have the right conversation with her daughter, I couldn't believe that that free-spirited woman would finally pick that guy and I couldn't believe that the three guys would react the same way. I understand that the plot is as unconventional and lighthearted as a female-oriented fantasy, but these are not complex points, and the reason why I insist on these elements is because the impact of a song should rely on the moment's genuine emotional resonance. When Streep sings ""The Winner Takes it All"", it should have been a powerful moment, emotionally rewarding, but since they preferred ""not to take themselves seriously'"", well, it only works for the song is powerful, nothing else. <br/><br/>See, I only wish that 'Mamma Mia!"" tried to be embrace its own free-spirited fun and take enough distance from the stage musical, so that we could wonder if we loved the story as well as the songs. The film took its material for granted and didn't try to elevate it a little more. I understand we should enjoy it for what it is, but sometimes, that just works as a convenient alibi against criticism, especially since there are other feel-good musicals that still cared about telling a good story, ""Chicago"" or ""Singin' in the Rain"" to name them.<br/><br/>Now, I feel guilty after having written these lines, to conclude on a positive note, I'll say this is an enjoyable movie as far as you can enjoy ABBA song, the beautiful Mediterranean isles' landscape and Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried's communicative smiles, I guess sometimes that's enough. But it's precisely because I enjoyed these elements that I wish the film tried a little more. To keep on the bright side, after having watched the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"", I want to say ""Mamma Mia!"" is the perfect example of how a film can make fun of men in such a good spirit that even a man can enjoy it.<br/><br/>This is film written, directed and driven by women, but it's far from being just a chick flick, not surprising since ABBA was perhaps one of the rare bands represented by both sexes., and certainly the most successful. At least, this is a film that is not divisive, and it's fun, positive, exactly what ""Ghostbusters"" should have been, but wasn't."
"DeadHeadCycler","3","2","4","22 February 2010"," Is this a musical?!
","Mostly, Meryl Streep can outshine in certain roles but, her star dims in this screech fest. The choreography may be fine for actors with talented legs but, not this group. To qualify or quantify the attempts at singing are pointless because, audible guttural emanations do not deserve it. After the first note was sung or the first toe tapped at a Broadway audition all but one performer would have heard the ubiquitous word, NEXT! Amanda Seyfried is the one that might have received a call back.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed attending live musicals, opera, ballet, dramatic theater, and concerts all over the earth, and I am embarrassed for the performers of this piece of Mamma Mia! The performers had little choice but to perform once tapped by their agents simply because the Grande Goddess incarnate was starring. Some of the performers must have worked out of friendship to her because, they knew she and 95% of the rest of the cast could not sing, or dance. An overpriced paycheck and a line to their resumes, both of which made most of their agents grin, in retrospect may not be fair compensation to the cast of this painful disaster.<br/><br/>The studio and the producers made too much money for delivering so little of anything substantive. This group's sincere desire of making something of quality for the people reminds me of every politician in D.C.: Take the money and run. This was their thinking: ""Look we've got Meryl, we've got Pierce, so we can justify an expensive shoot on some gorgeous Greek island for a few months and make a wad of cash. Cha-Ching.""<br/><br/>So, thanks to this film I have added a new phrase to my vernacular, such as: ""I don't give a Mamma Mia! about Meryl Streep starring if she can't perform"" and ""That movie was a pile of Mamma Mia!"".<br/><br/>I did hear some ABBA music in the background, which I enjoy, so my rating is a 3 instead of a 1. This is another film on movie review websites that has succumbed to a PR firm working into the night and and in the dark on website ratings. Come on Meryl, accept the truth, and save some money with your PR group and donate the excess. You don't need to control everything. Do you?"

Secondly she has barely passable singing skill that should be in a second rate bar, rather than a major motion picture. And Pierce Bronsan, what a terrible singer. He sounded on the same level as two angry cats breeding. What a terrible voice. He must have paid the producers a lot of money to make a fool of himself on the screen. Horrible; I will have nightmares for years. It was terrible on anyone who has good hearing. Take a chance on this movie? NOT! Even though I watched it for free, I feel I was ripped off. Do yourself a favor and rent Rain Man. Better entertainment and I HATED that movie!"
"John_Truby","Null","2","4","7 January 2010"," Musical train wreck
","I had no idea the entire musical oeuvre of ABBA was really about a girl looking for her true father before she gets married on a Greek Island. This is the storyline on which the writer hangs 18 ABBA songs in Mamma Mia! It gives you an idea of the immense popularity of ABBA's music that this combination of story and song has produced a worldwide theatrical smash hit. As if 400 million records sold didn't already tell us this.<br/><br/>If you have to write the book or script for a musical, the big problem you have to solve is how to use the songs to drive the story. Otherwise story and song become two separate tracks and the audience waits for the song to end so they can get back to what happens next.<br/><br/>But in Mamma Mia! this problem is reversed. The storyline is so lame, absurd and emotionally phony that the audience can't wait to hear another catchy song to find relief from the awful script. I've never been a big ABBA fan, but during the course of this movie I came to believe that they were the greatest musical geniuses in history; such was the chasm between story and song.<br/><br/>And then there is the matter of the casting. Any director will tell you that 80-90% of the job is who you pick to play the roles. This has to be the worst cast movie in modern memory. Most of these actors are at least 20 years too old for their parts. Watching 60+ Meryl Streep cavorting like a 15-year-old teeny bopper was one of the five most painful moments of my life. And Pierce Brosnan will surely be nominated for best statue imitating a person trying to sing. In fact, the casting of this movie was so mind-boggling that I realized it was actually a stroke of genius in which the filmmakers were using aged movie stars to highlight the artistic absurdity of the entire decade of the 70s.<br/><br/>What can a screenwriter learn from this train wreck? Well, first, be sure to make friends with the most popular candy pop band in history so they will give you the rights to 18 of their songs, and then you can write a horrible script tying them all together and no one will care.

"jhsteel","8","2","4","1 March 2009"," Great fun
","I loved this movie because it had a fun atmosphere and didn't take itself too seriously. I love ABBA songs and the beauty of this music is that anyone who can sing can make the songs their own - their success is owed to that fact. The cast all sing and with varying success, but the acting was great and that helped to carry off the voices that weren't particularly designed for singing in public. I wasn't offended by Pierce Brosnan's performance, although he's no great singer. He was in tune and the spirit of the movie was that it was musical theatre. The story was light but sort of made sense, and the advantage of a musical is that the story can be silly and still be OK. Overall, it was an uplifting experience and I enjoyed it a lot. I have also remembered another film musical which had a similar feel, but a different atmosphere - Everyone Says I love You by Woody Allen. In that wonderful movie, all the cast sang their songs with varying degrees of musical ability, and it worked. I like this approach, and I'd be happy to see more of it in the future."
"theowinthrop","8","2","4","4 January 2009"," Entertaining enough and fun, but ultimately forgettable.
","Meryl Streep has actually sung in several films. She sang a great spoof of opening musical numbers in DEATH BECOMES HER, and also sang a country western tune in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE at the end of that film. She has a good voice and can carry a tune. But this film is the first one where she is center stage in a musical, and carrying several show tunes. Again she does well enough singing them.<br/><br/>MAMMA MIA has been on Broadway for several years, and it is an infectious musical, even if only the tune ""Dancing Queen"" has managed to get any permanent notice. The story line is slightly like that of the film BUONO SERA MRS. CAMPBELL. Donna Sheridan (Streep) runs a hotel on a small Greek island. Her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to marry Sky (Domenick Cooper), and there is a large scale wedding being planned (although Sophie and Sky wanted to elope). Sophie has discovered her mother's diary and finds that in the year that she was born her mother had very close affairs with three men: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Harry Bright (Colin Firth), and Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard), one of whom was her biological father. Confiding in her two closest friends Sophie has secretly contacted all three men and invited them back to the hotel. At the same time Donna has invited her two oldest friends the much married Tanya (Christine Baransky) and the well known cooking expert Rosie (Julie Walters) to help her get through the wedding weekend.<br/><br/>The story follows how Donna discovers the three loves of her past (especially Sam) are back, and she is upset that Sophie will want to know which one is her father (a question that Donna is unable to answer). The three men are interested in why they were called back, Sam being a divorced man with children, Harry a successful businessman in London, and Bill an independent type who lives most of his life on board a ship. Each slowly realizes what Sopnie is doing, but each concludes that he must be the father - something Sophie (for some reason, presumably over-enthusiasm) never carefully thought out. Donna enlists her two friends to assist her in keeping the three ex-boyfriends away from her, which they try to do. As it turns out she is most glad to see Sam again, but is uncertain that the relationship is still revive-able.<br/><br/>The film is one that keeps the viewers involved, and is fun. It's unusual to see an actor like Brosnan singing and dancing (passably), and apparently enjoying the experience. Baransky has a nice number thrown in when she reveals her sexual control over a bartender and would-be lover (a number her alter-ego, ""Mary Ann"" would have enjoyed on ""Cybel""). And it does end with a satisfactory conclusion. But it's pleasant but not a great film. It is worthwhile for entertainment value only - not thought provoking. But then, it was meant for entertainment value when it was put on Broadway, and when it was produced as a film."

The movie makers here were just out to make a fast buck, and don't have a single clue as to the reason for Abba's popularity.<br/><br/>They created a story to cram the songs into, instead of the obvious - make a movie celebrating the wonder and pleasure so many have got from listening to Abba's music. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, a movie with Abba music from start to finish, can't fail to entertain, but this movie has been done in such a back-handed amateurish way, you can tell all involved didn't care a toss. <br/><br/>The sound sucked, the actors were all to old, Abba were not in their 50's in their heyday, so why on Earth are the actors singing so ancient? <br/><br/>The storyline is NOT the reason folk will go to see Mamma Mia! The main point is this movie could, no SHOULD have been done so much better. <br/><br/>But obviously - not by these dolts!"
"anarresa","4","2","4","17 December 2008"," Theater to Film Troubles
","This adaptation is getting the full brunt of my annoyance with films that were once musicals yet don't hire theatrical actors. It's a totally different style of acting, particularly with musicals where you need to sing and dance and be aware of your whole body every second of the song. I say sing but really they ridiculously lip-synch and dance, another annoyance. If actors and musicians can do it every night on stage why can't a film actor do it for a few scenes a few times a day! Stagger the filming so no one is singing too much at once, know what your doing physically so it's only a couple takes. I'd rather see little cutting bloopers than the weird mouth movements and missed dance steps of fake singing! This is a romantic comedy cast and what looks like random Greek locals who accidentally stumbled into a musical and tried to make the best of it. I'm blaming the director for the uncontrolled mess they made of it, because I'm blaming him also for the choppy cutting between pretty Greek locations and crappy CGI backgrounds- again, plan ahead in your filming!<br/><br/>Other than several tiny points which drive me crazy this is just the fun, silly musical it advertises itself to be and on which people based their recommendation to me. Good for a light evening or weekend afternoon viewing. Make sure you like ABBA first, this is a full-fledged musical."

Its delightfully entertaining.<br/><br/>The choreography was spot on, voice quality was near perfect, and the story was very joyful. You can tell that everyone involved really enjoyed what they were doing.<br/><br/>The most surprising thing to me was the fact that Pierce Brosnan can actually carry a tune.

"spookycopter","3","2","4","12 December 2008"," Poor adaptation of terrible Musical
","Growing up in the 80s, and having a fondness of electro-disco, I love ABBA. I also love movies and especially musicals.<br/><br/>Having seen the stage version of this show with my mother some 4 years ago, I went into this movie with exceedingly low expectations and still left disappointed.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia suffers from a story that features some of the most unsympathetic characters ever. From Merryl Streep as the woman who had unprotected affairs with three loves of her life in the same week and never informed any of the possible fathers that they had a daughter, to her over-the-hill girlfriends who can neither sing nor dance.<br/><br/>Nothing is taken seriously, but nothing feels natural either. Old-style musicals blend music into story lines naturally and the music is based around the story. Here, the opposite is in effect. The lyrics of the music often have only a passing applicability to the wafer-thin plot device and often contradict the story itself. I found myself forced to not listen to the lyrics other than the chorus which more often than not fit the story with the rest of the lyrics relegated to noise to be ignored.<br/><br/>It just doesn't gel.<br/><br/>Performances are uniformly bad from everyone but it is the script and the singing that is particularly bad.<br/><br/>The girl-power message of the movie seemed over-stated. True equality comes from treating everyone with respect equally, not from making a unilateral decision to remove a father/fathers from your child's life. Youth is treated as a big joke and entering into marriage when young is implied to be a huge mistake. This movie is sexist in a way that would not be acceptable of the gender of the key players were inverted.<br/><br/>Donna's friends were simply loathsome creatures. Screechy without a modicum of musical talent. They were simply there to re-enforce the girl-power message but in being present, they were responsible for butchering some of ABBA's finest tunes.<br/><br/>I was hoping that a movie would remove the flaws of the stage-show and inject a little more believability into any of the characters. This did not happen.<br/><br/>If you love musicals, and if you love ABBA, then give this movie a miss. I love both, but this movie is enough to make you go cold-turkey."

Pierce Brosnan is good to look at but his singing was terrible. If I had a fast forward button, I would have used it through most of this film. I don't think there was any part of it that was worth wanting to see ever again. I do not want to own a disk of this either.

WOW!<br/><br/>What can I say... Meryl Strip, this is a film about Meryl Strip. <br/><br/>She made it her own. Everything fades away when she is acting. She is probably the best drama actress of the 20th century and she dances and sings like a child with a voice comparable to the best of the best out there!

","I saw the play in London several years ago and even though it didn't strike me back then as a work of art, compared to this movie it sure felt like it. While I appreciate Streep's charisma in a part which really doesn't play to her incredible dramatic skills, everybody else in the cast gave me the feeling I was watching an improvised high school play done by people with very little talent. I was always a fan of Brosnan's James Bond but his musical talents are no more than pedestrian, specially while singing (that may be too strong a word) SOS and just standing there with not much to do but stare at Meryl, during her interpretation of THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL. I guess it didn't feel to surprising that with so many people dancing near the water, a bunch of them would ""accidentaly"" fall in it and it's not like I was expecting anything close to great but the only thing I could say to my wife at the end of this movie was ""how come in movies where you don't want people to die they do while here, you wish everybody would died and nobody does""."

I came out of the cinema thinking I should have just stayed at home and listened to Abba Gold. My 3-star rating is for the music alone.<br/><br/>The plot was worse than corny. It was lazy. Not even the slightest attempt to make a plausible link between SOS and Gimme Gimme Gimme. They could have played all the Abba film clips one after the other and the resultant plot would have been more coherent than this tosh.<br/><br/>Finally, although I've always admired Julie Walters, I'd like to wring her bloody neck for her performance here.

","I have seen Mama Mia twice on stage, and it is one of my favorite musicals, so I could barely wait to get to the theater to see it as a full feature film. Unfortunately, the movie was quite disappointing to say the least. I felt the casting of the characters was weak and poorly represented the characters as originally written. Donna was always portrayed as spunky and attractive though overworked and exhausted, and Meryl Streep just didn't have that ""umph"" to her. Pierce Brosnan had the look of Sam, but his singing was terrible. When adapting a musical to the big screen, quality of singing voice should be given more consideration. There are so many amazing actors with phenomenal voices, I can't understand why they didn't cast a little more carefully. There were also songs from the stage production that were not included in the movie including my favorite, ""Thank you for the Music"". I kept waiting for it to be thrown in somewhere along the way, but it was not included at all. While I wouldn't say the movie was terrible, I think if you have seen it live on stage, prepare to be disappointed."

I know it's a stretch to think that Meryl Streep and Pierce Bosnan can sing but they did a passable job. However, if you are expecting Broadway type singers you'll be disappointed but the acting was very good and the plot was charming. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) was fantastic both as a singer and an actor. Colin Firth is always good and Christine Baranski was funny as ever. There are quite a few songs that I didn't recognize but most of the popular ABBA songs were there and the audience was humming and toe-tapping along. There was one song that was a little long and drawn out in the middle of the show but some tunes were just background music. I also noted that everyone (young and old) came out of the theater smiling and some singing so that's my indication that it's an excellent feel-good movie. Go see it with a date."
"dreamer_girl","5","2","4","1 August 2008"," OK for lighthearted fun, but unsubstantial
","This was entertaining overall, but didn't have much substance. Also, some ABBA fans may cringe at the singing of their songs by the actors, many of which pale in comparison to the original versions, especially as sung by Pierce Brosnan. The audience laughed when he sang, and I got the impression they were laughing at him and his horrendous singing, not because they were enjoying his performance. It was a poor casting decision; almost anyone would have been better. In addition, I didn't sense any emotion from him when he sang, which is usually the point of a musical number or even acting in general; he was just barking out words. I read a review in which his vocal performance was described as bleating ""like a moose who just took a bullet"" (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone) and I would have to agree with that description. Amanda Seyfried is cute as Sophie and Christine Baranski and Julie Walters were entertaining (and Baranski and Seyfried can actually sing). Meryl Streep was okay, too, but she seemed to jump from one extreme emotion to another at times, which made her character less believable to me. I put this down to poor directing. So, it's good for an evening of fun if you want to see a fluff movie. Probably worth the price of a cheap movie ticket."

","Mamma Mia is the most magical movie of the spring and summer. What charm - what happiness. ""Dancing Queen"" was so spectacular that I had tears in my eyes. I haven't felt that way since I saw John Travolta sing and dance the number ""Welcome To The Sixties"" from HAIRSPRAY. The duet between Meryl Streep and Sophie was exquisite and poignant. I found creative cleverness with the use of the chorus; reminiscent of a a ""Greek Chorus"" commenting in a tragedy. Most of the songs work well within the framework of the story line, while the scenery of the Greek Isle only added to the joy of the movie. So Pierce didn't sing so well, it certainly didn't spoil the movie. I can't wait to see it again and again."

Go see the movie because Meryl should get another Oscar for this one. Pierce Bronson can't sing and that is okay--it just makes it that much more delightful (like my dad singing around the house).

At the end of the film when Ms. Streep asked the audience if they wanted another song they chanted, YES, GIVE US ANOTHER ONE! Everyone had so much fun that you felt so good when you came out. I mean, I LOVED Chicago but feeling was much different, and Hairspray can't compare either. You don't have to love Abba to love this musical. My 83 year old catholic mother-in-law who didn't even know the music before going in loved the movie. The best song moments for me were Mammia Mia, Slipping Through My Fingers, Winner Takes It All, and of course Dancing Queen. Everyone was good in the film but the best has to be Meryl Streep who keeps proving herself as someone who can do it all. Man, when she belted out Winner Takes It All I was stunned. She was good. She also showed she can let her hair down and have some fun. I mean, no one in this film is a great singer, but you forgave them by the way they presented the songs in the film. Only exception would be Pierce Brosman who's delivery of SOS was, er, not good but the women forgave him I'm sure. So if you want a feel good film where you will be singing when you come out of the cinema, AND you will actually know some of the tunes, go see MAMMIA MIA!"

","Amanda Seyfried stars as Sophie, a young woman on the brink of getting married who sends out 3 invitations to Bill, Sam and Harry, 3 men who could possibly be her father.<br/><br/>Using the songs of one of the most popular famous bands of the 70's, Mamma Mia delivers wave after wave of feel good moments in an entertaining romantic musical which was a delightful surprise.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep (Devil wears Prada) gives a great performance as the mother to Sophie and she steals the show with her singing, timing and utter perfection throughout and with the help of an excellent support cast.<br/><br/>I think it may be fair to say that Pierce Brosnan, as likable person and actor as he is, should stay away from the singing stage, but to give him credit at least there was no other artist doing it for him like in so many other films. Colin Firth (Love actually) and Stellen Skarsgard (Good Will Hunting) to are good in their respective roles and try at the singing parts.<br/><br/>Julie Walters (Educating Rita) is hilarious in her role as Rosie and juxtaposed with Christine Baranski (Cybill) as Tanya the two make a great pairing and make the film even more relaxing and humorous with plenty of physical humour, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>Though the plot is fairly cheesy and I was one of 10 guys in a fully packed screen, it really is a chick flick with stories about love, flings, dresses, weddings etc all encoded. And though not usually the top of my list, were covered well through the use of some of the classic Abba songs, and by using songs, it prevented the plot from being dull and made it an extremely vibrant feel good film.<br/><br/>The direction is exceptionally poor and totally predictable and dull, though there are a few excellent shots towards the end, especially with Sophie on the boat, a shadow with the dark blue sea around her.<br/><br/>The ending was really rushed and there are plenty of unanswered questions which left me feeling slightly disappointed but nevertheless with great songs, performances and feel good ideologies, it is a wonderful sing-along enjoyable musical."
"kimberlyadam","9","2","4","26 July 2008"," Love It!
","I'm a huge fan of musicals anyway but still I'm pretty hard to please. ""Mamma Mia!""was excellent! The only reason that I didn't give it a 10 is... well, in my mind a 10 equals perfection and no movie is perfect. All the vocalists were at least competent and able to carry a tune. Who knew Meryl Streep had a decent singing voice? Go figure. The songs tied in neatly to the storyline and there were plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes, some of which left me in tears and gasping for breath. This film is pure camp, all the actors know it's pure camp and they are inviting us along for the ride. Don't come to this one looking for anything profound - just come expecting a good time. And if you're within a certain age range, prepare to be reminded of your younger days. I was not a big fan of Meryl Streep but this movie changed the way I see her. Now I want to BE Meryl Streep!"
"lilacpilgrim-1","8","2","4","25 July 2008"," Take A Chance On This
","I admit that I went into the cinema to see this with very low expectations. I'm a big ABBA fan, and I've always wanted to see the musical, but never had the chance. I rationalised my reasons for seeing the film until finally deciding it didn't matter my reasoning; ABBA rocks! And I have to say, it's something of a mixed bag. The songs are very good, but brought in under flimsy pretexts (""I'm a little bit confused about who my father is, let's have everyone sing Voulez-Vous at me!""/""I'm a little upset, my friends will help by singing Chiquitita at me!""). Still, if you love ABBA like myself, just try not to sing along. Only the girls at the back and my friends and sister and I were participating in our cinema, but it was fun nonetheless. Although, the girls around you wailing ""The winner takes it aaaaaaalllllll!!!!"" as they bawl their eyes out is pretty distracting.<br/><br/>Some actors' singing is a little sub-par (Pierce Brosnan performing SOS had me yelling at him to shut up, though some of it was admittedly pretty lovable) and songs are shoved in where they're not needed (Does Your Mother Know?).<br/><br/>But overall, the plot is pretty steady and the acting is solid. Some people cry ""over acting"", but this isn't really a film to be taken seriously. It's a musical for crying out loud! If you do go to see this film, just enjoy it, join in regardless of ""etiquette"" and try to ignore any parts grating on you.<br/><br/>It can be enjoyable, the tunes are fun and emotional, sure there have been a few changes to the story (for some odd reason they made Bill a Swedish writer, but Skarsgård played him in some sort of mixed accent; I think he may have been attempting the original accent).<br/><br/>And hey, if you're a Stellan Skarsgård lover (quite literally), it's so worth it. You'll see why ;)"
"cashmere-12","10","2","4","25 July 2008"," Great
","Before I went to see Mamma Mia I read some reviews on this website about it. I had seen the stage show so I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. It didn't disappoint. We were laughing and smiling. I didn't think Pierce Brosnan sounded as bad as people made him out to be. I could be tone deaf and he is so good looking it didn't matter what he sounded like. I thought Colin Firth sounded a bit like a Bee Gee. All in all it was a fun movie. I went a couple of times to see it with different people and everyone enjoyed watching the movie. The church scene was great and also the Bride's evening before the wedding. It was hard not to clap after each song. Especially the ending what a hoot!"
"kellypaul","10","2","4","24 July 2008"," Great fun
","Loved it! A great adaptation of the stage show. Why shouldn't it be, with the creators of the stage show at the helm. As for Benny and Bjorn's songs, how amazing to think the the fabulous arrangements of 30 years ago still sound joyful and infectious. Catherine Johnson does a neat job of constructing a story round the songs. So when Meryl (brilliant!) starts MONEY,MONEY,MONEY, it makes sense - Donna has been struggling for years. Of course, having Meryl, Christine and Julie as a singing group (Donna and the Dynamos) meant songs like SUPER TROUPER and DANCING QUEEN didn't need a story context. I liked the use of the Greek villagers as chorus. And the imaginative staging of each number was very good. My only quibble (as with CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE)was the over editing of dance scenes. Cutting every 5 or 10 seco0nds is ridiculous. Let's see the dancing! Wonder why the soundtrack cd doesn't have the wonderful finale of DANCING QUEEN and WATERLOO. I hope the DVD has lots of extras! My favorite song is THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL, sung so passionately by Meryl. I don't suppose Meryl would do any concerts but if she did and she came to my home town Glasgow, we have a lovely Royal Concert Hall. I can imagine the reception she would get if she sang SUPER TROUPER and got to that line: ""..When I called you last night from Glasgow..""! If Andrew Lloyd-Webber's musical version of SUNSET BOULEVARD is ever film, move over Glenn Close!"
"emily0218","10","2","4","24 July 2008"," so much fun!
","Sure, the plot's silly, Pierce Brosnan can't sing, and there is WAY too much screeching in the first 1/2 hour of the film. But that doesn't matter, because it is so much FUN!<br/><br/>If you go to the cinema with an open mind, you will LOVE this movie. It's not pretending to be a serious film with deep characters, it's there to lift your spirits and have a good time. It was the most fun I've had in ages and I think what it is is it's so bad it's good and now I still can't get ABBA songs out of my head!<br/><br/>I went to the cinema expecting there to only be a couple of people in there as it's been out a couple of weeks now, but the cinema was full, and a lot of the people had even seen it before. I think that's what made the film so much fun as people were laughing a lot, clapping at the end of good songs and even singing along at the end. At one point, people even started shouting at the screen (I can't tell you where, it'll ruin the plot) and I think all of this made the film even better as I could see everyone else was enjoying it too and having a great time. I have been to the cinema a lot and this was the first ever film where there was an applause at the end, showing the audience's appreciation of the film.<br/><br/>So, what's good about Mamma Mia!? It doesn't take itself seriously and has lots of funny moments. I thought the random villagers that pop up as the backing singers for each song were good too! The songs were really catchy and make you want to sing along, and even if you don't like ABBA it's worth going to see as it's just a feel-good musical that happens to have ABBA songs in it (I don't even like ABBA that much). Meryl Streep is very good at singing and portrays strong emotion in The Winner Takes It All, and her daughter is a good actress too. Donna's two friends are very good and Julie Walters almost steals the show at some points! I think that the three men chosen for the Dads were good for their roles, especially Colin Firth (""I'm Spontaneous""!). The film never dragged and the 1 3/4 hours flew by. When it ended, we all wanted more, and make sure that you stay to see the singing in the credits. They even managed to shoe Waterloo in there!<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, if you haven't seen it yet, GO!<br/><br/>Also, a note for any man who's unsure: My Dad's the most heterosexual man I know, and he really enjoyed the film as well! He went there wanting to hate it, but it was so cheesy and fun he came out of the cinema thanking me for dragging him in!"
"mlcrizer","10","2","4","21 July 2008"," Loved Mamma Mia
","Saw Mamma Mia the first day it was shown in the U.S. Found every minute to be quite fun and joyful. Loved the singing, dancing and humor and it made me feel good about life! My husband who was recently diagnosed with alzheimers, felt exactly as good about it as I did...we held hands as we watched it as it made us feel good to be watching and enjoying it together and for those couple of hours we forgot about our problems. A true short time healer for the soul and I recommend it to anyone who needs a little fix of fun in their life. It was made for no other apparent reason that I can imagine...just to make folks feel good to be alive. Will definitely see it again and again, especially when I buy my DVD (can't wait)."
"A-movie-lover-H","9","2","4","20 July 2008"," Ridiculous, glittery, silly...and totally worth it,
","The first thing you need to know going into this movie is that it is not serious, and is intended solely to provide unrestricted amusement to the audience. After the first number or so, it becomes really easy to just relax and join in on the joke which all of the actors are so obviously aware of. Everyone in this knows that it is campy and silly, which is what adds to the film's overall enjoyment. You feel as though you should be uncomfortable as Pierce Brosnan sings a rock-starry, amusingly affected version of ""SOS,"" but as he, and the rest of the cast, don't take themselves seriously at all, you don't get embarrassed, and feel free to laugh and enjoy it. This movie is a ton of fun for a hot summer afternoon, and will really brighten anyone's day.<br/><br/>That said, a few warnings first: 1) do not see it alone, because your enjoyment will be exponentially increased if you can laugh and sing with other people, and 2) you really cannot enjoy this movie half as much if you don't know the actors. You won't really appreciate Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth in glittery spandex if you don't have a prior knowledge of their suave, tough guy roles, and you won't understand that Meryl Streep is allowed to relax and be dramatically silly if you don't know how great an actress she really is. But, since most people do know them, it will be enjoyed by most who see it. If you like Abba, or really just music, and you like (or even just know) the main actors, you will have a lot of fun with this, and I recommend it. I gave it 9 out of 10 stars, but for what it is--silly and fun."
"Carycomic","5","2","4","20 July 2008"," My folks found it funnier than I did.
","Me? I found it slightly funnier than GET SMART: THE MOVIE. But, only to the extent that I was able to sit all the way through to the ""Waterloo"" number during the ending credits.<br/><br/>Aside from that? It was just a musical remake of BUONO SERA, MRS. CAMPBELL. At least, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>For those who might not remember it? BUONO SERA, MRS. CAMPBELL is an old Gina Lollabrigida movie where she has told each of three GI's she met, during WWII (Telly Savalas, Peter Lawford, Phil Silvers), that her daughter is also theirs. In MAMMA MIA!, each of Sophie's possible fathers were counter-cultural teens during the 1980's. And, _none_ of them were told by Donna--Meryl Streep--that one of them had fathered Sophie.<br/><br/>That and the Abba songs are the only major differences between the two films. But, again, only as far as I'm concerned. As stated way above, both my parents thought it was hysterical.<br/><br/>The only belly laugh I had, however, was seeing Pierce Brosnan in that blue jump suit during ""Waterloo."" Oi vay (and I'm not even Jewish)!"
"scottarooni","10","2","4","20 July 2008"," Critics be damned! I liked ""Mamma Mia!"" even better the second time around!
","First, let's get the disclosures out of the way. The first album I ever bought was the ""Xanadu"" soundtrack, and the second one was ""Super Trouper"" by ABBA. Even at 11 years old, I loved the song ""The Winner Takes It All"" at wanted to own that record. Unfortunately, I discovered ABBA at a time when their career had peaked, the band had dissolved, and it was pretty uncool to like them.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 1999, and the stage version of ""Mamma Mia!"" opens in London. ABBA Gold is a certified worldwide best-seller, and the group was enjoying a resurgence, as well as receiving critical acclaim for their music which they had never really had before. I saw the play in London, and since then, I've seen it in Chicago, on Broadway after September 11 (a truly magical experience I will never forget!), in Los Angeles, and 6 times here in Las Vegas. Needless to say, I was thrilled to hear a movie version of the musical was being made! I had read many of the critics' reviews and was really disappointed at some of the venomous and harsh words some critics had to say. When I saw the movie opening night, I was afraid I was going to be let down.<br/><br/>I needn't have worried. The storyline of the movie follows fairly closely to the stage play, but more importantly, the spirit and heart of the play (and the songs) remain in tact. I did feel the movie was a bit rushed and some parts felt really cut down, but enjoyed it nonetheless.<br/><br/>Then I went to see it a second time, to watch it with a more critical eye, and I ended up enjoying the movie even more.<br/><br/>First the bad news: Four songs are deleted from the movie (""Under Attack,"" ""One of Us,"" ""The Name of the Game,"" and ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"") ""Thank You for the Music"" is sung over the end credits, and ""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do"" is featured in a shortened version. Actually, with the exception losing of ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" I think these changes suit the movie just fine. A lot has been made of Pierce Brosnan's singing voice. Okay, it isn't the greatest, but he doesn't sing any song by himself, and it's good that he has help. I actually think the new version of ""When All Is Said and Done"" is very touching. You do have to pay close attention to the dialog and every scene, because the editing of the movie is VERY fast paced. I wish some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more.<br/><br/>Now for the good stuff: Meryl Streep is magnificent. She can speak volumes with just an expression on her face. I loved her rendition of ""Mamma Mia."" In an instant, she goes from horrified (at finding her three former lovers in her goat house) to filled with glee at the prospect of seeing them again. Listen to the lyrics of the song ""Mamma Mia,"" and you will appreciate how Meryl brings them to life. She also does fine with ""Money, Money, Money"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"" (still a showstopper!).<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried is wonderful as Sophie, the bride-to-be. Her singing voice is very good, and she does a great job on ""Honey, Honey"" (especially the last line, which sets up the whole movie) and ""Lay All Your Love On Me."" Seyfried lights up the screen whenever she's on, and the chemistry between her and Meryl is beautiful. I have to admit that I welled up during ""Slipping Through My Fingers."" Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are hilarious. I especially loved Walters on ""Take a Chance on Me."" They steal practically every scene they're in.<br/><br/>The three possible dads, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard are all fine in their respective roles. They really aren't given much to do, but they make the most of it. There is a very funny bit with Skarsgard on a boat in a towel. I won't say more than that. The audience roared with laughter both times I saw it.<br/><br/>The on-location scenery in Greece is absolutely gorgeous. The sun-lit seas and mountain retreats are breathtaking.<br/><br/>The crowning moment of the film, though, has to be the ""Dancing Queen"" number. The crowd erupted in applause both times I saw the movie, and how can you blame them? It is one of the most joyous moments ever captured on screen. How can you help but tap your toes and sing along? And I can't forget the grand finale. Stick around for the end credits. The movie mirrors the play in every way. Again, it is a crowd pleasing finale, met with cheers and laughter.<br/><br/>I realize the film isn't perfect; it's corny, campy, and not everyone is the greatest singer, but I'm giving it a 10 for the sheer joy that it brings and the performances of Streep and Seyfried. I can't wait to see it again!!!"
"blackburnj-1","6","2","4","20 July 2008"," Halfway through ""The Winner Takes it All"", my resistance finally died
","Don't get me wrong. This is a bad film. The plot is poor and badly carried out. Some of the songs are appalling. Pierce Brosnan cannot sing at all. Colin Firth struggles. Story lines pop out of nowhere. In short, it's badly written, badly directed and has some of the worst singing ever heard in a cinema.<br/><br/>I had spent quite a lot of the film with my head in my hands as the awfulness just flooded off the screen. And then, halfway through ""The Winner Takes it All"", with Meryl Streep delivering the lyrics as if it were the ""To be, or not to be"" of musicals, I suddenly had a realisation. ""Oh dear"", I thought, ""it's all gone right"".<br/><br/>That is about two-thirds of the way through the film which leaves you smiling by virtue of the fact that it's done with such a great deal of fun that some of it is bound to rub off on you. If you have no affection for Abba then you will be in trouble but if you do there is fun to be had.<br/><br/>And it's not all bad. The aforementioned Streep is excellent as Donna, belting the songs out with gusto and clearly having a lot of fun. Brosnan's singing has to be heard to be believed but other than that he's fine. Stellan Skarsgaard's is as good as ever, whilst Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are as entertaining as ever.<br/><br/>But it is a bad film, a very bad film. But, almost because of its awfulness, it's actually a good way to spend a couple of hours. This joins the very large category of films that are absolutely terrible, but wonderfully enjoyable.<br/><br/>N.B. In Britain, this has been given a PG rating. It is questionable as to whether many children will enjoy this anyway, but there are some jokes and lines that might be unsuitable. Check the BBFC's parents' website before taking young children to see this."
"mkkelly70","10","2","4","19 July 2008"," Can't wait to see it again!
","I saw the stage musical twice and was thrilled when I found out a movie was coming out! Now I can't wait for the DVD so I can watch it over and over. The movie made me want to stand up and dance it was so uplifting. It is a shame the movie came out the same day as Batman (The Dark Knight). While many movie goers prefer fast action, violence and special effects, Mama Mia was the perfect movie for me. I love the creative genius who brought songs from one artist together with a clever plot to create this all inspiring show. I absolutely want to visit Greece and see the beautiful scenery I saw in this movie and the vocals of Meryl Streep were amazing. Props to Pierce Bronson for stepping out of his comfort zone and singing and dancing.....I thought he did great. Guitar player and singer Colin Firth was also a surprise. Who knew! The movie was perfectly cast and the whole village dancing and singing scenes were so fun to watch. I left the theatre with a huge smile on my face looking for some tables to dance on!"
"ladyjane99","10","2","4","19 July 2008"," Perfect Bullseye for A Summer Movie
","Fantastic, fun, and entertaining. If you like Abba songs, you'll love the movie, and maybe you'll like it for the humor and just plain fun and silliness even if you don't like the music so much, though this truly is a musical with a lot of songs crammed in it. I don't usually care for musicals, but this somehow hit the spot. I wish more movies were shot in the beautiful Mediterranean islands, because the setting was absolutely gorgeous. Watching the movie was like being on vacation without having to travel anywhere. I still remember watching Abba win the Eurovision Song Contest with ""Waterloo."" So glad they made the musical into a movie for even more people to enjoy."
"jemmytee","7","2","4","19 July 2008"," Cotton candy no good for tummy but sometimes good for heart
","I never saw ""Mamma Mia!"", the play. Never cared one way or the other about ABBA -- though I did enjoy how neatly their music fit ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."" And I understand that in a musical, all you need in the way of a story is just enough to link the production numbers. So I wasn't planning to go see this movie -- until I saw not only was Meryl Streep in it but also Colin Firth and Christine Baranski and Julie Walters and Stellan Skarsgard, and I'm thinking this'll either be a major train wreck or glorious fun.<br/><br/>The story's simple -- as it should be. Girl lives on fantasy island but don't know who daddy is. Invites three likely candidates to her wedding but doesn't tell mom. All three come and chaos ensues...along with big production numbers and lots of joy and laughter after all the tears.<br/><br/>Well -- it wasn't glorious fun, but I left the theater smiling and humming the music. And that's despite Phyllida Lloyd's nearly catastrophic turn as director. Who the hell decided just because somebody's directed a play on a stage they know how to direct a movie? Her clumsiness came damn close to ruining the film...as did the editor, who really must have been on coke at the time or else has a major case of ADD. I think it works better for a musical if you can see the numbers come together as all of a piece and not four-thousand, three-hundred and fifty seven different pieces, like they do on music videos.<br/><br/>But -- and this is the film's saving grace -- the actors barreled right over Ms. Lloyd's mistakes and blasted through the jittery editing to provide performances that can be intoxicating. Meryl was fun and sexy and actually decent as a singer, and Christine and Julie backed her up, bigtime, in the musical numbers -- turning ""Dancin' Queen"" into an anthem of GRRL power and memories of youth was beautiful. I was shocked at Pierce Brosnan's tinny voice; he's Irish, for pity's sake, and don't ALL Irishmen sing beautifully? But he has charisma to spare and his charm made up for it. Same for Colin Firth and Stellan in thankless roles. It shows what not only talent but experience and professionalism can do with a bad script and characterizations. Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper -- they're pretty and have nice voices, but they still have a lot to learn about commanding a screen.<br/><br/>Overall, however, this was a pleasant experience and I did not want any part of my $12 back. It was like going to a carnival and seeing all the sights and eating too much popcorn and cotton candy and getting a bit of a tummy ache...but having had a joyous time of it all, considering. If you go in with that expectation, you'll have fun, as well.<br/><br/>But there's no way ANYBODY'S ever gonna say this is in the same league as ""Singin' In The Rain."""
"cultfilmfan","9","2","4","19 July 2008"," Mamma Mia!
","Mamma Mia is a live action version of the Broadway musical which is set to songs from the 70's pop group Abba. The film takes place on a Greek island where a young woman named Sophie is set to be married in a few days. All her life, Sophie, has never known who her father was, so she comes upon her mother's old diary and decides to invite all the men who could possibly be her father. Throughout the next couple of days Sophie learns to think for herself and we can see the close bond between her and her mother and family who are all a little shall we say eccentric. This results in a lot of old fashioned style musical numbers and dancing and a lot of over the top yet fun characters. Much like the Abba songs featured in the film, Mamma Mia is very sugary, playful and sometimes downright silly, but it all makes for an enjoyable time at the theatre. A lot of the film's characters, the actors playing them and the plot can be ridiculously over the top and silly at times, but you can tell the cast is having a great time here and there are a lot of laughs to be had and overall this isn't a movie to be taken too seriously, it's just a fun night out and an entertaining two hour diversion that is actually a lot better than this summer's movie fare so far and how refreshing it was not to see a film that was based on a comic book, or overloaded with mediocre to bad special effects. Basically the weekend I saw Mamma Mia was also the opening weekend of The Dark Knight, and it doesn't take a nuclear physicist to figure out that The Dark Knight will be the top film at the box office, not only for this weekend, but for many weekends to come. I myself am a little tired out of all these big action superhero films and I'm still debating whether, or not to even see The Dark Knight, but for those who want something just a little different, but still fun and entertaining than I think Mamma Mia will be the film for you. Just like this year's Sex And The City movie, Mamma Mia is being thought of and bad mouthed as a film strictly for the girls with no redeeming value for the male viewers. Being a male viewer, I actually found a lot to enjoy in this big ball of fluff. The songs which I would never go out and buy or anything, are still catchy and even though all the performers are really camping it up they are still having fun and you will have fun watching them. There are a lot of visual and sly in-jokes in the film that will be sure to cause a chuckle and like any of the old traditional musicals that this film is modeled after it is basically a big vibrant and joyous film with big flashy musical numbers and a lot of hamming it up from the cast and crew. I overall had a very good time with this film and while it may not be as good as some other past musicals from this decade like Dancer In The Dark, or Hedwig And The Angry Inch, it is still a very good time to be had and for those looking for something different than The Dark Knight, I think this is a good film to try."
"jaddison383","7","2","4","18 July 2008"," A Wonderfully Entertaining and Uplifting Musical
","Mamma Mia! What more needs to be said? In the latest Broadway-to-film adaptation to hit theaters, Meryl Streep stars as Donna, whose daughter, Sophie, has discovered all three of her possible fathers by reading her mother's diary and has now invited all three to her Greek Island Wedding. From the first moment 'Mamma Mia!' starts you know you're in for a unique and uplifting experience, and the film does not disappoint that expectation. Full of catchy pop songs and fun choreography, this is one musical that embraces its flamboyance for all it's worth- and comes out the better for it.<br/><br/>The cast is all having a great time and it shows. Meryl Streep turns in yet another wonderfully entertaining performance and creates a character unlike anything we've ever seen from her before. Her Donna is a heroine for middle-aged women everywhere, a funny, saucy, and utterly lovable mom. Then there's Donna's two best friends played to comedic brilliance by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Any moment those two appear on screen you know is gonna be great. Amanda Seyfried also turns in a fine performance in her first semi-leading role as Sophie, and her ""fathers"" (Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Stellan Skarsgard) all deserve praise for committing to such a different project for all of them.<br/><br/>I'm sure that there will be many people who will refuse to enjoy 'Mamma Mia!' and find it over-the-top, silly, and utterly cheerful. But if you open your mind and let yourself give in to the infectious happiness radiating from the screen you're in for a wonderful ride. It is over-the-top, silly, and utterly cheerful; it's also utterly entertaining and enjoyable. Mamma Mia indeed! How can I resist ya??? 8/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"agmoldham","7","2","4","16 July 2008"," It's hard not to be drawn in by this film!!
","I heard a cynical reviewer give Mamma Mia a good review and I was intrigued to see whether the film could work the same trick on me. This is the sort of film that I'd generally hate. I'm really into intelligent films that make the viewer think. You couldn't get a film that's further from this genre than Mamma Mia. The plot consists of a soon to be bride trying to work out who is her father from three possible candidates that she discovers from her mothers diary. She invites all three to the wedding in order to find out who her father is. That's it in terms of plot.<br/><br/>The film uses the songs of Abba as a backdrop and all of the characters launch into renditions of the Abba songs at regular intervals. It's one of the most ridiculously cheerful movies I've seen and the camp/crass levels of the film are off the scale! The amazing thing is that even though the singing ranges from average to appalling (Brosnan has to be heard to be believed) you can't help tapping along and loving every minute by the end of the film.<br/><br/>At some point in the future I may well be ashamed of my score/review and come back to make changes. The truth is though that even though the only thing I'll remember in the long run is how awful Brosnan was at singing the other thing that will lodge in the memory is how feel good the movie was. To make my life harder in the future I give this film eight out of ten!!"

","I was much looking forward to seeing this film. I am a lifelong ABBA fan, but despite being a Londoner now I have avoided seeing the West End musical on which this film is based, because of the extortionate ticket prices. A cinema ticket, I surmised, would be much cheaper, and indeed it was.<br/><br/>It's a simple enough story with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a young girl who lives on a Greek Island with her mum Donna (Meryl Streep) who is about to get married. Trouble is she doesn't know who her father is, and a quick rifle through her mum's diary brings in three possible suspects: Sam Carmicheal (Pierce Brosnan), Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard) and Harry Bright (Colin Firth). To her mum's dismay, she invites them all to her wedding to find out which one it is...<br/><br/>Loads of fun on offer here, with the campness of all these name actors belting out ABBA songs, some of them rather badly. Doesn't really matter in the end, though, it's all good fun and the scenic backdrop of the Greek Islands is superb. The only weakness is the whiff of theatricality about it all, despite some fancy camera tricks.<br/><br/>Still, recommended for ABBA fans, cheaper than going to see the show and is decent night out over all. Make sure you see it with a big audience, though, as that's exactly what this kind of film demands."

Sadly, this movie offers exactly that - better sets and nothing else.<br/><br/>The one thing that completely ruined the movie is the cast. I loved Brosnan since his Remington Steele days but boy can he butcher the ABBA songs! I really admire his courage to sing despite being completely unable to, but seriously there's no actor suitable for the role that can sing too? I also like Colin Firth but his singing was at best bland and weak, and the other guy's in between Firth and Brosnan.<br/><br/>As for Donna and her two long time friends, the chosen actresses were simply way too old for the role, particularly Streep. Her singing was at best so so even with all the sound enhancements movies employ, but it's her age that's really completely off. Donna's supposed to be around 40, while Streep was 59 when she was in the movie, and it showed. She tried to hide it with crazy and over the top acting but it only served to backfire. The other two were not good singers either, nor good actresses.<br/><br/>I hate to admit but frankly Amanda sounded significantly better than any of the other main characters, although she too, had quite exaggerated acting. I blame the novice director for that.<br/><br/>So the cast and directing really failed to deliver the nice story/music. I gave it 2 stars for the scenery and Amanda's singing."

Sure, Meryl Streep does a lot of jumping around for a woman her age and that's interesting, but, not very much. The few acting segments that we see these actors work through are not very interesting, inspired, engaging, fun, funny... They do look like people who are just waiting for the music to start playing so they can sing (and dance).<br/><br/>I do believe that there is a movie to be made with this premise, as ABBA did have a pretty wide range of themes in their popular songs, but, this just simply isn't it.<br/><br/>So, if you like both ABBA music and this show format, it's worthwhile.

","""Mamma Mia!"" is a jukebox musical film that features songs from the 70s famous pop group ABBA. It is also a romantic comedy, but mainly the musical part of the film is in front of the camera. While watching ""Mamma Mia!"" you should not be too concerned about the story. The film is about a bride-to-be who invites three men to her wedding without her mother's knowledge thinking one of them is her father and doesn't know which one. Why ""Mamma Mia!"" is not a story oriented film is because it starts with a mission - finding the father and get married with the boy you love - but quits before finishing it. It is not important who the father is or who is getting married. What is important is the visual and musical show. These two features are accompanied by the beautiful Greek island Kalokairi and bright colors of the scenes. So, based on these facts ""Mamma Mia!"" is not a story oriented film.<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia!"" is based on the musical with the same name from the year 1999. The musical, as well as the film, got its name from the famous ABBA song that topped the charts in the 1975. In this point of view, it wouldn't be wrong to say that ""Mamma Mia!"" is devoted to ABBA. The film was released on several dates but Swedish premiere was particularly important because all four members of ABBA were present in the premiere and photographed all together for the first time since 1986. As an ABBA fan, it was very nice to listen and watch the newer versions of those brilliant songs performed by Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and so on. Once again Meryl Streep has shown us why she is one of the most successful actresses of cinema history. She is a complete actress with her voice, gestures, mimics and acting (now added dancing and singing). She is a big plus for ""Mamma Mia!"" because we are not used to see her in this kind of roles. I have realized she was enjoying what she was doing in ""Mamma Mia!."" Director Phyllida Lloyd has two films in her directing career so far and both are with Meryl Streep. The other one is ""The Iron Lady"" that won two Oscars for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role (Meryl Streep) and Best Achievement in Makeup (Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland). Lloyd has experience mostly for stage directing. She has directed Macbeth for stage which makes her a suitable for the directing position of a film that was remade based on a musical.<br/><br/>A lot of friends and old lovers are gathering around a marriage that is going to happen in the beautiful summer island Kalokairi. All those gatherings are surrounded by songs and visual performances. All these combinations make the audience feel good about themselves. ""Mamma Mia!"" is a happy film where nothing bad really happens. Even from this piece of information you can pretty much guess what to expect from it. The effects of ABBA songs and those brilliant artists performing them have a boost on film's general picture and progress. Because when no one is singing, ""Mamma Mia!"" has no magic in it.<br/><br/>""Mamma Mia!"" is like a colorful music festival. Everyone has their own song to perform with an invisible orchestra in the background and you don't know when someone is going to sing. This kind of mystery alone worth watching it. I had a look at the box office results of the film and saw that ""Mamma Mia!"" became the 5th highest grossing film of 2008 with a total earning of $615 million against $52 million budget. By looking at this financial result, you can understand what it means to present famous songs and well-known artists to perform them in a film even though you don't have a story to tell. Because of all the success and praise from the audience, in 2018 they are releasing ""Mamma Mia!"" Here We Go Again!"" as a sequel. But I can say that the story (if there is one) ends with the film. Still I personally wouldn't mind watching another film with equally beautiful performances. The background scenes are breathtaking. I am just one of the people who checked about that beautiful island of Kalokairi. The camera angles and shots allow the audience fully to admire the Aegean Sea.<br/><br/>Happy thoughts, beautiful people, friendships and all these features are other good points of ""Mamma Mia!"" apart from the songs and individual performances."
"dastedham","5","0","0","13 June 2018"," Cutesy
","The overall IMDB rating for this film is accurate and earned. It's just OK. The music and cinematography, along with costuming are all lovely, and I think they take center stage. The acting isn't that great, and I was disappointed in Amanda Seyfried, who seemed at times like she couldn't take herself seriously. The film in its entirety drones on too long for its plot/theme. The most irritating thing for me is the main struggle for Sophie, that she doesn't know who her Dad is and ""boo-hoo"" he can't come to her wedding. I just didn't feel enough sympathy for this trivial ""problem"" as the script or acting didn't garner it, and lots of people deal with the same thing or worse. When she fights with her mother and chastises her for it, I just got a bratty vibe and it was unappealing at most. Otherwise, cutesy is the best word I can use for it."

","Mamma Mia! is an all around good film. The movie is filled with heartwarming moments and soul searching scenes. This movie follows a mother and a daughter on a journey of finding themselves and re establishing relationship from their past. With first class acting from Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried, they bring their characters to life. They give the story everything it needs to let those watching relate to the story as well as giving the viewers a sense of self power and hope. This story is powerful, and charming while showing all the awkward moments that make life, life.
This movie follows a mother and a daughter on a journey of finding themselves and re establishing relationship from their past. This story begins with the main character Sophie. A few days before he wedding she sends out letters to three men, inviting them to her wedding. From the evidence she found in her mother, Donna's, diary about her crazy summer in Greece she concluded that one of these three men is her father. Wanting to be given away by her dad on her wedding day she invites them with certainty that she will know her father as soon as she sees them. However this isn't the case and creates a small dilemma.
Apart from Sophie being unsure who her real dad is she also must deal with telling her mother that she invited her former lovers. Throughout the movie Donna and Sophie try to find out who Sophie's real father is while planning a wedding. Throughout their journey they discover parts of themselves and the meaning of relationships. 
The musical components of the film not only fit into the theme of searching for yourself but, made it even stronger. The theatrical performances directly connected to the plot left the movie without a dull moment. 
The bright visuals give the movie an uplifting mood. Placing the setting along the ocean aided in the care-free wild life style. But it didn't take away from the fact that Meryl Streep's character is a hardworking mother. 
The dialogue brought everything together yet it felt at times there was not enough dialogue between the two main characters. This left the audience with some slight frustration because many of the issues would have been resolved with communication between the two. This also resulted in what felt was a semi-forced plot.
Mamma Mia! is a fantastic film that left the audience feeling ready to take on the world."

","Mamma Mia!, the film adaptation of the popular stage musical, packs no surprises, no new insights, no real emotions, but it never had to. Like the popular Broadway play, Mamma Mia! is a sweet, summery tonic of wholesome good cheer. The kind of which that women and families will drink up, even if the nutritional content is low.<br/><br/>The plot, (you know, that thing in between the ABBA music) is about bride-to-be Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and her quest to discover the identity of her real father by inviting the three possible candidates to her mother's beautiful Greek villa, in hopes that she will ""just know"". Things aren't so simple in practice however, as Donna (Meryl Streep) rekindles flames she thought were lost forever. It's not a horrible idea for a story, it's not a great idea, but it's cute. The three suitors, played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgård, are instantly appealing. Put a less likable actor in any of their shoes and you would have yourself a far less tolerable film.<br/><br/>Most of the leads are charming, with Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep standing out. One could criticize both their singing voices, if one were so inclined, but I enjoyed Streep's airy vocals and Brosnan's deep, hard rock style. The ABBA songs are hit or miss, with some lethargic early songs, and a few vivacious tunes to close the film. The music is what you would expect. Every musical has some duds, but Mamma Mia! has enough good stuff to justify them. The film pulls a nice balancing act when it comes to the songs, not too many, (ABBA overkill never fully sets in), and the best stuff is saved for last. Pretty good formula, if you ask me.<br/><br/>I'm not the best audience for Mamma Mia! I've never seen the play, I don't particularly like ABBA, and I'm not a woman. For those who fit into any of those categories, Mamma Mia! will be a joy. I wasn't impressed with some of the formulaic chick flick fluff, but beyond that, I liked Mamma Mia! It's what your grandmother might call a ""nice"" picture. Wholesome, charming, and sugary sweet.<br/><br/>66/100"

","It's really weird how the inner-workings of my brain function. Sometimes I'll be completely turned off by cheesy musicals (or cheesy films in general). Other times, I get a real joy out of watching something cheesy with earnest and intended heartfelt emotion. It's a case by case basis and depends on my mood I guess. 'Mamma Mia!' falls somewhere in between. The musical based off the broadway play, which is in turn based off music from ABBA, is outrageously silly and really lacks coherence in most parts. But it also contains endlessly catchy ABBA music and some performances that you absolutely cannot miss. And not necessarily great performances, more like actors you can't miss doing stupid-cheesy-musical stuff.<br/><br/>The last paragraph is hardly written well, and that tends to fit the tone of the film. Sporadic, unexplainably and questionably sensual, colorful, with some (perhaps unintentionally) laugh out loud moments. It's not like this movie acts like it's an awards contender, although Streep was inexplicably nominated for a Globe that year (not like the Globes are the end-all be-all of award shows anyway). However, the cast is an impressive ensemble. Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Julie Walters, Stellan Skarsgard, and Christine Baranski among others.<br/><br/>There are some undeniably cringe worthy moments, most of which include actors or actresses who aren't musically inclined and attempt to perform a musical number. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of some cringey Disney Channel Original Movies. Which is why this movie can be a pain to watch but possibly a joy to re-watch. However, it can't be overstated how much of a soft-spot I have for ABBA's music, especially with this cheese-ball acting behind it. For that alone, I'm looking forward to the second film this summer.<br/><br/>6.0/10"

","First review here on imdb. To be honest i took years to see Mamma Mia because i tought oh this is going to be a crap never take a moment in years to see the movie.
It came the right moment i take myself a time to see the whole movie and i was very surprised with this movie. 
Some say it isin´t good or it´s horrible because of the singings. I say the actors and actresses can sing very well in this attending that they are not professional singers like most of the singing industry who can´t really sing. You need to give credit to this actors. 
Meryl Streep, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski were phenomenal in this. The only fault in this was Pierce Brosnan, i´m not sure about his cast here he sings nice but the face expressions makes me confused doesn´t match with the singing while Meryl Streep pour her emotions trough the singing perfectly. About Amanda Seyfried her voice is okay. 
The story of the movie is funny but not the best. Tought is very funny, it makes you want to sing and dance through the whole movie. <br/><br/>The movie left me with a stupid smile on my face for seconds.

Then, the music is the best of the film, all the songs and the actors have a song in the film, all the songs are ABBA, a wonderful band, but they with their covers are not left behind, they are all magnificent. The movie is a musical comedy and it's great, it has super fun parts as well as super sad and melancholy. The film is 10/10 in soundtrack, 10/10 in set design and 10/10 in acting. Completely recommended, look at it."

","As I am addicted to Abba-music, it was kind of a duty for me to go and watch the film. And guess what! It was great! Not only the actors give heart to their role, but also the landscape is breathtaking. Both underlines the richness of the adorable ABBA-music in an unexpected pleasant way. The dance performances make you want to jump up from your seat and move and groove to the beating rhythm. The little love story between the two younger people is played in a believable way and touches your heart. And finally we see a double marriage! Don't forget your tissues!"

","No Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! More! I can't stand you anymore. Mamma Mia, now I really know, my my, I can let you go. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, the movie is pretty mediocre. Don't get me wrong, I love the Swedish pop group band, ABBA and their songs. ""Lay all your love on me"", ""Fernando"", ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Mamma Mia"" are all in my music playlist. I even love musicals, but I was never a huge fan of this Broadway hit. I'll give you, my reasons why. Like the stage musical, the movie doesn't mixed the songs with the story that well. Honestly, what does a story about 20-year-old, bride, Sophie Sheridan. (Amanda Seyfried) who invite three of her mother's ex-boyfriends: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard), and Harry Bright (Colin Firth), to her wedding in Greece, so that she can find out, who her father is; have to do with ABBA!? It doesn't. Honestly, I don't know why the movie isn't set, during the disco era. The movie is apparently set in the early 2000s, way past, ABBA's popularity. I guess, the movie is supposed to feel nostalgia, but the settling of Greece as the backdrop wasn't much help. Greece is a beautiful country, and the movie shot the locations, very well, but it never felt like, the place channel the feeling of ABBA. I don't know, why the movie wasn't set in Sweden, in all places. When, I think of ABBA, I think of Stockholm. Sadly, if anything, this movie should had just went into biopic musical route, like 2014's Jersey Boys and have the movie be about the band, rise and fall. It would make a better film. This jukebox musical feels like it was written by drunk people who just went through a Marryoke. Somehow, they thought that partaking in drunken karaoke with a wedding theme, would make a good musical! And you know what? It doesn't work. Jukebox musicals movie like 2007's Across the Universe & 2001's Moulin Rouge work, because they took time, to make sure, the songs they use, have some connection with that of what happening on screen. They use it to add depth, and feeling. In this film, the ABBA songs feel like distractions. The songs were so random. It was obvious that they were thrown, willy-nilly. They even add songs to pointless comedy characters that hasn't nothing to do with the main story. It just there to add to the run-time. The songs rarely fuel any real deep emotion, or make us understand anything about any of the main characters. Honestly, I still don't know, anything about Sophie and her relationship with the groom, Skye (Dominic Cooper), after their song number and they're supposed to be the main focus. The movie is just careless, about the wedding sub-plot. It almost seems, secondary to the sub-plot of Sophie's mother, Donna (Meryl Streep), getting back with one of her exes. The movie has one of the weakest reason to conflict, I have ever saw in a film. They is really nothing much in stalk. I don't want to ruin the whole ending, but it's really stupid. There was no reason for the odd twist. I really hope, people got their money, back if they helped fund this wedding. This was an utter waste. Another fault of the film comes from the acting, and singing. Amanda Seyfried is OK in her role, but her character is such a clueless idiot, that I stopped caring for her. I was really hoping for Skye to leave her for another woman. I really couldn't stand with most of her bad decision making. Meryl Streep as Donna was ridiculous. It's nice to see that, she was having a lot of fun with this film, but I wish, she took her singing a little more serious. It's sound so mediocre. The worst singing, has to be Pierce Brosnan. This was his Waterloo. He can't carry a tune. It was painful to watch. The other supporting characters are just there for comedy relief, and in my opinion, takes way too much time away from the main characters of the film. I really couldn't get behind, seeing middle aged people doing god-awful dance moves with over the top costumes, while squeeing and giggling like schoolgirls. It really hurt my eyes and ears. I don't want to see this dancing queen. The movie has a problem with being way too cheerful, hamming and upbeat. Its reasons like that, the movie fails to be, really funny. Don't get me wrong, it's OK to have an upbeat story, but the movie could have play more on the misery of setting up a wedding, to a higher degree. There was so much, they could had done, to make the movie, funnier. It feels disappointing. I do love the cameos of the band, ABBA as Benny Andersson appears as a piano player during ""Dancing Queen."" Bjorn Ulvaeus appears as a member of the Greek Pantheon during ""Waterloo."" It's nice to see them, again. Overall: There are better chick flicks musicals out there, ones that are smart, funny, dramatic, even groundbreaking, but Mamma Mia isn't that. This film is disjointed, clichés, nonsensical, and fairly cheesy. I don't recommended. Just buy the Mamma Mia soundtrack if you want to hear ABBA songs."
"bbewnylorac","7","0","0","14 February 2015"," Not bad entertainment
","People who hate musicals will loathe Mamma Mia. It's cheesy, its characters burst into overblown ABBA songs for no reason and the acting is as hammy as the script. It is a strange beast -- a plot about a wedding on a Greek Island, built around about 30 ABBA anthems. Meryl Streep, as the bride's mother, goes right over the top, and belts out those songs while determined to keep it light and breezy, as do Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as her best friends. Sometimes the jolly dialogue between the trio, not to mention the dancing, gets a little too forced. As the bride's possible fathers, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth enjoy themselves immensely, camping it up, and they are all very likable actors. As the bride Sophie, Amanda Seyfried is a little wide eyed and angelic but she does fairly well in what is a pretty frivolous role. The Greek island location is gorgeous and ABBA fans will just love the songs being given a lush airing. A highlight for me is the scene when Sophie is led up to the chapel on a donkey, and Streep sings The Winner Takes It All. Also Brosnan singing SOS and I Do I Do I Do. Sure, Brosnan isn't much of a singer. But it's touching that here is James Bond trying to be a musical star. And he can laugh at himself. Let's face it, the renditions of many of the popular ABBA songs can never match Agnetha and Anni-Frid's original renditions (Chiquitita, for example). But I like how some of the lesser known ABBA songs are sung. Amanda Seyfriend and her three possible Dads do a lovely version of Our Last Summer while strumming guitars and on a yacht, and Meryl Streep gives genuine emotion to Slipping Through My Fingers, about a mother watching her daughter grow up. If I was home sick for a day and this movie came on the TV, I wouldn't change the channel."

","I absolutely LOVE THIS MOVIE! <br/><br/>If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, don't waste any further time! However, my aim, at this point, is not exactly to comment the movie -you can find loads of reviews either way. I'm right now seeing some scenes of Mamma Mia, for the third time this day, and I'm thinking... one thing that I adore about this movie, and about Meryl Streep in general, is that both Dona and Meryl show me that there is no need to be afraid of growing up. (I first heard for Meryl Streep from Mamma Mia. I was extremely surprised when I learned that she was 59 years old, I thought she was only 40!!)I used, as a 17,5 years old-teenager that I am, to wonder if I'm gonna lose some characteristics of my personality that I adore while becoming older, like energy to jump upside-down all the time and be descriptive and graphic while talking and all these stuff that usually teenagers do. You see, adults in my life are more severe and think a lot before doing something... But both Meryl's interviews and Dona, Tanya, Rosie showed me that you can remain the person you are.<br/><br/>So, it's the most appropriate movie to find your good mood again!"

","Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting marry, and she wants to invite her father. So she invites 3 possibles from her mother's (Meryl Streep) past loves. The actors are all great The story is rom-com cheese, but that's not the problem.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the singing from these actors. Many of them are not natural singers. Luckily Seyfried is actually a sweet pretty singer. I wouldn't say the same for Streep. Although Streep puts it all out there, and the spectacle of her doing a musical is enough to get me to watch. She just needs to burn that ugly pair of overalls.<br/><br/>There is a varying degree of singing talents among Stellan Skarsgård, Colin Firth, and Pierce Brosnan. Colin has to be the best, and Stellan is surprisingly good. However Pierce stands out with his talk-singing. It's the most embarrassing performance until Russell Crowe in 'Les Misérables'. Of all the actors, the best singer has to be Christine Baranski. She's a natural in a musical.<br/><br/>I like ABBA just not my favorite band. I like the ABBA song 'The Winner Takes It All' the most because it's actually about something personal. And this song occurs at a crucial time dramatically. But Streep does too much on-the-nose gesturing, and Brosnan can't do much other than just stand there. It's a small hiccup in what could have been amazing.<br/><br/>This would have always had a certain amount of cheese factor. Pierce Brosnan didn't help any. Meryl Streep is the greatest actor ever, but there is a lot to be desired about her musical theater work."

","MAMMA MIA! is a joyous musical romp, the film version of the long running Broadway musical based on the music of 70's pop group Abba. The film stars Meryl Streep as Donna, the lusty and free spirited innkeeper who runs a broken down hotel in the Greek Islands, who is rocked by the arrival of three former suitors (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard)in Greece for the wedding of Donna's daughter, Sophie, not knowing that one of them is really Sophie's father, though Donna is not sure which one is the real Daddy. <br/><br/>This paper-thin plot line serves as the basis for an amusing and spirited musical journey exploring Donna's regrets about her past and Sophie's search for a future identity through knowing who her real father is. <br/><br/>Filmed on location in the Greek Islands, the film is visually stunning and should really be experienced on a big screen. Streep, as always, commands the screen as Donna, giving a rich performance that almost makes you forget you're watching a musical. Amanda Seyfried is charming as Sophie offering an impressive turn in her first real leading role. There are also a pair of razor sharp supporting performances from Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's best friends, also in town for the wedding. <br/><br/>The film features beautiful location photography and some very inventive staging of musical numbers, which include ""Dancing Queen"", "" In a Rich Man's World"", ""The Winner Takes it All"", ""Our Last Summer"", ""Take a Chance on Me"", and of course, the title tune. Not for all tastes, but for fans of musicals and Streep, a must."

I think it's a fun family movie and everyone will enjoy it. The scenery was beautiful and that is also probably why I liked it even more.

The story is much deeper than it seems at first viewing, the acting first rate and as for ABBA, what can you say, unless you are are into the mindless nonsense that passes for popular music today.<br/><br/>It probably is an over 40's flick but as good as it gets for that demographic. It is very good fun, doesn't challenge the brain to much and is an ideal tonic for the soul on a Saturday night. I cannot see how anyone could dislike this piece of pure escapist fun, with no killing and dying, profanities, and with super party music and happy outcomes all round.<br/><br/>There is a time and place for Schindlers List (possibly my most admired film) but there is a time and place for Mamma Mia."

","I used to love ABBA when I was just a boy. Their music was extremely cheerful, easy to listen, catchy and it just made you want to dance. So, while musicals aren't exactly my personal cup of tea, I went into this film with a smile on my face. And, I can't say that it disappointed. I wouldn't exactly call this a good film, as the execution is rather corny, the story is predictable and some of the characters consist of a singular stereotype. But, the thing is that the movie doesn't need to be anything more than a well-good film. It is its purpose and it succeeds spectacularly. The songs all work, and I was actually kind of amazed how they managed to fit all of them in and tell a coherent story at the same time, but then, I believe that we can thank the original stage musical for that. Very nicely done in any case. Furthermore, most the actors are very talented with special mention going to the mom-daughter duo that is Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried. Many of the best scenes in this film revolve around the relationship between these two.<br/><br/>The movie isn't without its faults, though. The story, as mentioned, is nice enough on its own, but it's also very predictable and, dare I say, mushy. This film's reputation as one THE chick flicks is well-earned, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but the dudes and ladettes should be forewarned. The movie's biggest concern, though, are some of the characters and the actors playing them. Like the two old friends of Meryl Streep's character, whose main characteristic seems to be that they like to party. Sure they are there for Streep, but I still got the impression that it was more because they wanted to start drinking already. The love interest of Amanda Seyfried didn't leave much of an impression either.<br/><br/>Still, I must admit that I liked this film in sort of a guilty pleasure kind of way, which is the way that most people like this film, I suppose. And really, the point of this film is ABBA's music and that is brought forward and played out beautifully. The songs are classics, they are catchy, they are performed well and they create their own unique mood to this film. Sure some of the actors leave something to hope for as singers, but the passion and the enjoyment is still there. Pop the DVD in, take your special someone to your arms and just relax. It's cool."

Sophia invites the three men to her wedding, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). Sophia believes that she will be able to instantly recognize the man that is her father, and it is her dreams to have her father walk her down the aisle.<br/><br/>The three men arrived at the Villa thinking that Donna had invited them to the wedding. Sophia hides them from her mother with them agreeing not to let her know that she wrote to them pretending to be her mother. Meanwhile a couple of Donna's friends arrive for the wedding, Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski).

As she is hunting for the materials, she discovers the three men that Sophia had hiding.<br/><br/>As the guests were arriving at the villa, the angle of the camera gave a feeling of actually being at the fictional Greek island of Kalorkairi. The camera shot a close up of the guest arriving with the scenery of the waters in the distance. This shot gave you a feeling of depth as if you were actually on the mountain side arriving at the villa.<br/><br/>As the guests were being welcomed into the Villa, the lighting was soft which gave a sense of warm and welcome feeling. The same soft lighting was used as the guests were gathered around the table with the scenery of the mountains and water behind them. The soft lighting and the angle of the camera definitely made you feel like you were actually on scene rather than in a studio. The music was good, however I thought it was just randomly placed throughout the movie without much thought in transitioning from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe that the movie was good entertainment and anyone who likes musicals will enjoy Mama Mia'.

","In short, if you are not allergic to Abba, book your tickets now. If you are, why would you be reading this? At a pinch, it is worth seeing for Meryl Streep alone, who not only throws herself headlong into every refrain with unashamed gusto, but adds a touch of class and nuance to what otherwise could be a one-dimensional adaptation. Streep vacillates engagingly between playing herself and not taking herself too seriously. Pierce Brosnan just about keeps up, and manages more expressions than he ever did as James Bond. Colin Firth and Julie Waters trail behind somewhat. Yet Mama Mia! is a roller coaster of emotion, careering colourfully from the blue waters of the Adriatic, bursting 'like Aphrodite's Fountain' into the lives of Donna (Meryl) , her lovers and friends, and her soon-to-be-wed daughter. It is the party spirit that says kick your shoes off and sing silly cheesy songs. Altogether now.<br/><br/>And yes – there's a story. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married. To the buff-looking Sky. Only – where's her dad? She's never met him. A sneak-peek at Mom's diary shows Mom had three lovers before Sophie was born and Sophie secretly invites all of them. This is a film of threesomes. Three past lovers (Sam, Bill and Harry). Three close friends (Donna and two best pals). And, not to be outdone, Sophie meets up with two other young girls at the start of the film.<br/><br/>The breakneck pace still allows for brilliantly put together shots. Like Streep doing a 'Titanic' with drapes blowing in the wind. Or a pier-load of young hunky stag night crew doing a dance in trunks and deep-dive flippers. Moonlit boats and beaches to ""I Have a Dream."" Filmed on location, the views won't disappoint. And like a favourite song whose ending we know, the drama is in the details and execution.<br/><br/>As with many adapted-from-stage musicals, two young leads are played by talented singers, and the older parts by serious actors can sing well enough. Streep manages extremely well. Her performance is so professional and assured it leaves others standing. Fortunately, it is perhaps easy to paper over any cracks in musical comedy. Sweeney Todd relied heavily on Depp's charisma and stunning cinematography. Across the Universe, too heavily on the songs. Mamma Mia!, on the other hand, simply tailors everything to its joyous headlong rush. The songs fit naturally to the action. Streep even manages to sing them with her tongue firmly in cheek. She confesses to having been a ""stupid reckless little slut"" but then says she ""grew up"". (To which her pals chime in, ""Well grow back down again!"") The film is not without faults. There is a notable lack of chemistry between the people that throw themselves rapturously against each others' faces. Even Streep looks less than convincing in a brief lips-mash. And the men are a bit croaky in the singing department (Hugh Grant might even have been a preferable casting choice). And some of the time-line is wobbly. For instance, strange as it may seem, music from more than twenty years ago does not all come from the same era. So reminiscing about flower power (early sixties) in the same breath as a Johnny Rotten t-shirt (Sex Pistols, mid-late seventies) is either anachronistic or wishful thinking."

Nobody likes to watch it with me, though, because I already know every song, every choreography and every line by heart and I'm not ashamed of singing and speaking along with the characters. The landscapes couldn't be more beautiful, and even though it can get a little bit confusing the first time you watch it, the story of this movie is somewhat intriguing and fascinating.

Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep are my favorite actresses, and they did such a terrific job! Their acting skills are amazing, and so are their singing skills! In my opinion, Pierce Brosnan shouldn't have sung in the movie, but it was something that ended up growing in me. It doesn't bother me much anymore. The only parts I dislike on this movie, are the performances of ""The Winner Takes It All"" and ""Slipping through My Fingers"", as they end up being a little bit boring.

","Mamma Mia is a happy, joyful, musical romp! It is such a feel-good movie and the songs are so memorable you will be singing them in the shower for weeks! This film has all those great, music group, ABBA songs you know and love. The all-star cast is led by Meryl Streep (as Donna), Amanda Seyfried (as Sophie), Pierce Brosnan (as Sam), Christine Baranski (as Tanya), Colin Firth (as Harry), Stellan Skarsgard (as Bill), Julie Walters (as Rosie), and more. On a beautiful Greek Island, the young vivacious Sophie is about to be married to her handsome fiancé Sky, and reveals to her friends that she has read her mother Donna's diary and found that any of three men could be her father, and she has invited them all to the wedding, and the fun begins! This is a movie about moms and daughters, lovers and friends and how the past becomes your future. Donna operates a small inn on the island, in a beautiful setting with turquoise water and lovely hillsides. Donna's friends show up to celebrate the wedding with their old friend. The fellows all show up just about the same time, and even though Sophie tries to hide their presence from her mother, Donna finds out they are there and hilarity ensues. Donna had been quite the fun-loving girl back in her hippie days, and even had a girl band called Donna and the Dynamos. Her friends Tanya and Rosie were her back-up singers. Donna freaks out that all three of her former lovers are there for fear they will spoil her daughter's wedding. In her excitement and fear, she sings ""Mamma Mia"". What she doesn't know is that Sophie invited them all. Donna has flashbacks of all three of her former lovers in their hippie days with the musical number"" Our Last Summer"". Over the course of the next 24 hours, preparations for the wedding, and parties for the bride and groom bring on many memorable musical numbers; such as ""Dancing Queen"", ""The Winner Takes All"", and ""When All is Said and Done"". The day before the wedding Sky admits he really wasn't sure he wanted to be married right away, and suggests a trip around the world first. Sophie is confused and upset and runs away from her fiancé. At the bachelorette party, Donna and Dynamos revive their act with the songs ""Super Trouper"","" Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"", and ""Voulez-Vous"". These turn into great crowd dance numbers. Mother and daughter have a touching moment as Donna helps Sophie dress for the wedding. Mom is feeling the pain of giving her daughter away, with the melody ""Slipping Through My Fingers"". Shortly after dressing, Sophie and the wedding party head up the hill to the church with Donna lagging behind. Sam catches up with her and admits that he has loved her for the last 20 years, but Donna doesn't want to hear it. At the church, Donna walks Sophie down the aisle to Sky. When the minister asks who is giving the daughter away, all three men say they are. They don't know which one is actually Sophie's dad, but all agree to all take one third of being her father. Sophie admits to inviting them, and then in an ironic twist, looks at Sky and agrees with him that they should take a trip around the world instead of getting married. Not wanting to waste a good wedding, Sam again tells Donna that he has loved her since he left and proposes. Donna says I do, and with the musical number"" I do, I do, I do, I do, I do"", Sam and Donna get married. As the friends party to celebrate the wedding, Rosie admits to Bill that she has a ""thing"" for him with the song"" Take a Chance on Me"". The movie ends with Sophie and Sky sailing off into the sunset to the song ""I Have a Dream"", as Donna and Sam stay happily behind to run Donna's Inn. As the credits roll, the film ends with Donna and the Dynamos and the rest of the cast singing and dancing to ""Super Trouper"". Their 80's costuming is hilarious, especially the men, in their a-la-KISS costumes and platform boots! This film is a fun and memorable musical delight. You will find yourself dancing and singing the rest of the day! <br/><br/>Review by Nancy Weaver."

But that is only part of the explanation, why this film left me with a warm and happy feeling that everything is okay, and if it isn't it will always work out for the best in the end however long and complicated the journey might be. The other part of the explanation is that this is a good if somewhat naive story with some of the best actors in the world, and without any doubt the best actress in it. Bless Meryl, for she blesses us! The music is as wonderful as it ever was and even if some professional singers might have been able to deliver the songs much better in a strictly musical sense, I don't think anyone could have made it feel as real and fun as these actors did. I didn't mind that Stellan and Pierce didn't hit all the notes, it's not that important. What is important is, that you like them and you believe them, and you want them, all of them, to be happy and have fun in the sun on that gorgeous island.

","I'm a sucker for movie musicals. ""Grease"" got me started, and from then forth, I was hooked. There have been some great movie musicals(i.e. ""Rent,"" ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" and ""Chicago""), and there have been some bad ones(""A Chorus Line,"" ""Mame,"" and ""The Wiz""). ""Mamma Mia"" is a very popular show on Broadway, thanks to the classic ABBA soundtrack. So, it was inevitable that it would get the big screen treatment. So, how does the movie version work out? <br/><br/>Sophie travels to her mother Donna's beautiful island to get married. The plans are set, and the invitations have been sent out. But Sophie's idea of a complete dream wedding is to have her father give her away, and she has never met her real father. Therefore, she invites three men to the wedding, one of them being her birth father. Donna has no clue that Sophie took such actions, and when she finds out, the plans for the wedding spiral out of control.<br/><br/>Okay. I have no problem saying this. ""Mamma Mia"" is certainly not the best movie musical. However, compared with the likes of ""A Chorus Line""(complete laziness) or ""The Wiz""(all style but no substance or acting talent), it's actually quite good.<br/><br/>Growing up, my mom loved ABBA music, and still does. So it's safe to say that the die-hard ABBA fans have met their match with ""Mamma Mia"" I have been rather neutral about ABBA, not all for them or against them. But in the end, I do enjoy some of their songs, and overall, the ""Mamma Mia"" soundtrack is irresistible. No matter how they are sung in the film, they are extremely catchy.<br/><br/>A really good movie musical is able to balance a good plot with its songs. Unfortunately, this film's storyline is a little weak. However, the reason ""Mamma Mia"" works is not because of the story, but because of the nostalgia and shamelessness of the film. Director Phyllida Lloyd(who also directed the stage production) never apologizes for the film's energy, even if she isn't the best film director. ""Mamma Mia"" is so cheesy, you can't help but smile.<br/><br/>Now, it all comes down to the cast. ""Mamma Mia"" has an unapologetically odd cast of characters. They don't have the greatest, most Broadway-style voices in the world(don't get me started on Pierce Brosnan), but who cares? It's a musical! The true star of the movie (although everyone gives it their all and does well) is Meryl Streep. Seeing her in ""Mamma Mia"" surprised me. For all of the amazing performances in her career, she abandons the accent and sings. And man, she has a voice! With such highlights as ""Money, Money, Money"" and ""The Winner Takes It All,"" Streep is a showstopper. Of course, no one is getting Oscars for this, but their happiness and energy vibrate off of the screen and on to us. Their emotion is infectious, and therefore, the cast of ""Mamma Mia"" is lovably weird.<br/><br/>No thanks to the critics and the expectations of common movie-going perfectionists, the film has been taken too seriously and has been disliked by many, despite the major B.O. income. But the movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. The point of some movie musicals is to just have fun. What you see is what you get. And this is where I say screw the critics! ""Mamma Mia"" is like an enjoyable night at a karaoke bar. Leave your brain cells at the door, and enjoy yourself."

","Having watched musical comedies since I was a little girl I have to say I enjoyed this and would put it on top for just plain unadulterated FUN! I have been a fan of Betty Davis since the 50's. Ms. Streep undeniable study of Ms. Davis has paid off for her in spades. Now I can see why Ms. Streep is held so accountably high in the artistic community. She is wonderful in Mama Mia. I rented it out of boredom and curiosity, I kept it for two days, just for the pure fun and pleasure it gave me. Ms. Streep threw herself into the character she plays so well that I can not imagine ever hearing the words to the songs again without picturing her face and/or her gestures. Who ever did the casting for this movie really knew what they were doing. I find it hard to believe where most of the scenes were shot (listen to the commentary after you have watched the movie). While I can say everyone did an excellent job and the parts definitely made the whole it is Ms. Streeps character wish seams everything together into such a believable scenario. I don't want to spoil any part of the movie by saying to much. So rent it, watch it, and enjoy your evening."

","Yes, the movie is extremely shallow. It might be intended to be a ""feel-good"" musical comedy, but it is overdone in it's sheer mind-numbing, brainless optimism, for want of a better word. Moreover, the excessive shrieks and squeals of excitement from the women in the movie pose a serious threat to the viewers' brain cells, unless one has had the foresight to switch one's brain off before watching the movie. I have tried my utmost to keep my feelings about Abba's music and Meryl Streep, whose only role I enjoyed was in the movie Taxi Driver with Deniro separate from my appraisal of the movie, however I still could not enjoy it enough to even watch it through to the end. The plot line and the music, in my opinion, could only work well in musical theatre, which is why I would dearly like to watch the new Broadway musical by the same name, however they have made for a mediocre movie at best. I recall Meryl Streep saying in an interview that one of the reasons she took the role was to embarrass her children, and I find that much easier to believe now that I've tried to watch the movie. A menopausal, overly optimistic, happy-go-lucky materialistic movie. However, if you watch it without any expectations and if you manage to switch your brain off, or even if you just like Abba's music, you should enjoy the movie thoroughly. I had the misfortune of not knowing what the movie was about, and watching it because I saw Colin Firth among the cast - if that is your case, don't watch it."

"dy158","8","0","0","21 October 2008"," Let the good times roll
","After slightly more than a month since it's being released here, I finally get to watch it over the weekend at the cinema. I will always remember the original musical version for all the happy reasons - it was because of Mamma Mia! I went to the theatre for the first time in my life.<br/><br/>Though it was four years ago when I watched the original musical when it arrived here. Having a father whom count ABBA as one of his favourite music groups in his teenage years, I began to like their songs as well. He did watched the original musical production when he was in London for work four years ago and it brought back all those past schooling days for him. And I have to say I didn't regret watching the musical production when it came here. Now anyone will wonder why someone who had only just been in her early stages of adulthood be liking a film which is based on songs coming out before way she was born. But then I actually grew up listening to songs from my parents' time, apart from listening to what is on the radio these days.<br/><br/>To the review proper. Growing up, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) had always lived with her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on the small Greek island of Kalokairi where her mother runs a hotel. Sophie is going to get married to Sky (Dominic Cooper) and she wants her father to give her away on her wedding day. But the problem is, she doesn't know who he is and how he looks like. It was after she read her mother's diary from 20 years ago, she realised there are three possibilities. Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Harry Bright (Colin Firth), or Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgård). The three men who had once entered her mother's life.<br/><br/>The three arrived at the island, thinking it was their old flame Donna who had invited them. Sophie hides them upstairs in the old goat house, before revealing it was her who wrote the invitation. At the same time, other guests have arrived for the wedding and it even included Donna's friends: single writer Rosie (Julie Walters) and rich three-time divorcée Tanya (Christine Baranski).<br/><br/>For many years, the hotel has been run down and while Donna was making repairs, there was a tremor and the dolphin mosaic in the courtyard floor splited. It was when she was searching for supplies, she heard noises coming from the old goat house after peering into the window, she realised the three men whom she used to date in her younger days had arrived. That was the beginning of what was to come. Donna confronting with her past, Sophie trying to find out who is her father.<br/><br/>It's definitely a fluffy kind of film. Adapted from the original musical production, based on the hits of Swedish group ABBA, being brought to life to the screen. A young woman, searching for who is her father, searching for her past. A film which makes you want to know who is Sophie's father given after all, he only revealed himself towards the end of the film. And there is even a twist to the ending as well.<br/><br/>Whatever I remembered back when I watched the original musical version, the important scenes were there. Though I actually know because of the time constraints, not all the scenes from the musical fit into the film. Of course I'm happy when my favourite scenes from the musical were being brought to the screen. Like when Donna was singing 'Money, Money, Money' when she was making repairs to the hotel, Donna and the Dynamos (the group she together with Rosie and Tanya formed in their younger days) in their 80s outfit, Tanya rejecting the playful advances of Pepper and some of Sky's other friends in 'Does Your Mother Know', when Donna sang 'The Winner Takes It All' to Sam.<br/><br/>One thing did amazed me. Pierce Brosnan (who is Sam in the film) can really sing.<br/><br/>If you like musicals and/or like ABBA, then Mamma Mia! is for you. For me, it's a case of both. My younger sister, whom I will never associate with listening to songs which came out way before she was born, had actually said after watching the film that she wants to see it again. That is just the impact of Mamma Mia!."

It has a wonderful cast, Meryl Streep is excellent, her performance is flawless and she doesn't sing that bad, she looks that she really enjoyed this role. Pierce Brosnan is also very good as always, although he can't sing, Colin Firth on a very nice role, Amanda Seyfried is lovely as Meryl's daughter and Christine Baranski was a real joy as one of Meryl's friend, she was so funny. The music was excellent with all ABBA hits. The photography is amazing, the Greek landscapes are the most beautiful I've ever seen, it is a plus the movie gives you that the musical can't.

","OK, so this film is unlikely to win any awards for direction - not even from a partisan British Academy - but I suspect that is part of what makes it work. Mama Mia is a great big home movie with a cast, sound track and location to die for. Adding to the home movie feel, and I suspect to the charm of the film for many,is seeing superstars stripped of the Hollywood trappings and at times looking more than a touch vulnerable. On this showing, perhaps we could all do it! Certainly my husband can sing better than Pierce Brosnan - though he may be lacking in other areas! If Julie Walters' performance had been her first, surely it would also have been her last, and why producers go on casting Colin Firth is beyond me. But who cares, this movie is fun, totally harmless fun and such a pleasant change to the social comment dirges or gratuitously violent bloodbaths that fill our screens.

","seeing all the commments out there. i just couldn't resists not writing my own comment about the movie. just one word, FABULOUS !!!!! the plot was quite good. the acting was fantastic, the song..... out of this world (of course i'm a ABBA fan), the singing was excellent ...... in every characters own way. <br/><br/>just one thing i felt about this movie was, it is too rush. the plot can be expanded more. every songs interval is too short making the movie look like it is just rushing through. thats me feeling not everyone opinion is the same. if the plot can just expand and not be restricted by time limit, the show will be fanstatica!! <br/><br/>THis is the first show i ever experience (somemore is in Malaysia!!!)where all the audiences regardless of all background were so engrossed. i was in the cinema watching when sitting behind me were this group of monkeys making so much noise that i just wish i can slap them. BUT when the movie started they were so quite i can hear pin fall on the CARPET!! they were so engrossed that they do not relieased they are singing along with the movie!!<br/><br/>This is the first time all the audiences in the cinema singing along the movie not knowing it.they even sang louder than the show itself. I'm not making it up, REALLY!! esp the ending song""i have a dream"" everyone were singing along just as if they were Sofie. OMG OMG!!better still, no one left during the credits, they just stay back and enjoy the music and the fuuny acting on the screen. First time, man..... First time!!!<br/><br/>The acting was fanstatic, esp on some part of the show where i could just feel how Donna felt when she sang that song ""Slipping through my fingers"" how worried a parents will be as though i'm Sophie's parent. And also how frustrated was Donna when she sang ""The winner takes it all"" i almost shed some tears over her frustration. She captivated me, the acting was very pure and beautiful. <br/><br/>About Pierce Brosnan singing....... well , one thing for sure he can't hit high notes. But his Baritone (if i'm correct) was almost prefect. abit scrachy and rough but OK for a man in his 50's singing. he is good not bad. he is getting a 6/10 from me esp for the part he sang ""SOS"". but for the ""our last summer"".... eeekkkk. need practise..... a lot..... But we can be sure why he was once voted sexiest man alive, he is just too cool and sexy.<br/><br/>one more thing the ending a abit shaky. not really stable, as though they are just going to simply end this show. (i mean the part before Sophie sang ""i have a dream."" <br/><br/>overall : i'm giving 9/10 -the reason was the show managed to captive the heart of the audience which is the most important for all movies. <br/><br/>You must watch it, don't miss out on this."

","Mamma Mia will go down in film history as 2008's Lost Horizon. www.imdb.com/title/tt0070337 It was badly cast, badly filmed, badly lit and badly written. This should have been a celebration, but it is really nothing more than a dud. It is proof, yet again, that the person who directed it on stage should not be allowed to transfer it to screen. Susan Stroman's horrible film version of The Producers should have been a lesson to all, but then this mess of a movie is made and makes the same mistakes all over again. If anyone can believe any of the relationships in this film, then it is a mystery to me how, as nothing about it rang true. Even on a whimsical level, it was a bad effort. and this is from someone who grew up loving Abba and enjoyed the stage show for the bit of lighthearted fun it was. But this movie never reaches that either. It has no idea what it is meant to be, and fails on every level. And if you never thought Meryl Streep could give a bad performance, take a look at this and she achieves that feat here."

","Musical adaptation of the hit play with Abba songs. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is going to marry handsome Sky (Dominic Cooper) on a Greek island. She lives there with her single mom Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie wants to find her father to give her away at the wedding. She finds out her mom slept with three different men at the time she was conceived and any one of them can be her dad! They are Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). She invites them all to her wedding WITHOUT telling her mom.<br/><br/>The plot is, to be nice, simplistic and predictable (it's just like the play) but who cares? It's just an excuse to bring in a huge amount of Abba songs belted out full blast by the cast members. Now I LOVE Abba so this movie just had me from the beginning. It was beautifully shot in Greece--some of the scenery takes your breath away. With one exception everyone can sing and the songs are worked seamlessly into the story. All the numbers are good but three stand out for me: Streep letting lose with ""The Winner Takes It All"" and ""Dancing Queen"" (which is turned into a women empowerment song) and Christine Baranski singing ""Does Your Mother Know"" to a beach full of young hunky guys. The dancing is energetic and all the extras are young and attractive (especially the men) and are just great. There's young hunky guys all over the movie. There are some confusing dance numbers (I'm STILL trying to figure out what all those guys are doing during ""Lay All Your Love On Me"") but the energy they have pulls them through. The acting is as good as it can be. Really--this is no great acting challenge but everybody seems to realize this is a slight story and play along with it. A few minor quibbles--the dancing is cut into quick shots here and there. I call it MTV style editing. It's TOO quick! I wanted it to stay put so we can see the dancing. Cooper is handsome and engaging but the character of Sky is supposed to be tall and muscular. Cooper is neither--but he CAN sing. On the other hand Pierce Brosnan can't. Hs singing is terrible! When he started singing ""S.O.S."" my audience broke out laughing! It doesn't ruin the movie but it brings a lot of unintentional laughter.<br/><br/>The stage show ends with the cast members coming out and doing two more songs for the audience. The movie ends with Streep, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters singing full blast. At my theatre TONS of paper came out flying from two large ""cannons"" hidden on each side of the screen! The paper went swirling around all through the theatre and REALLY set the audience off! Then Streep asks the audience ""Do you want another one?"" My audience roared ""Yes!"" and ""Waterloo"" came barreling out. I walked out of the theatre laughing and exhausted but full of energy! Even without all the confetti flying around it would have worked.<br/><br/>Beautiful fun musical full of energy and color. If you hate Abba don't see it but Abba fans (like me) will LOVE it! A 10 all the way! ADDENDUM: I saw this THREE times at a theatre! I paid FULL PRICE each time!! That must tell you how much I love this."

","*caution there may be spoilers* Mama Mia! What a B movie.<br/><br/>I am a lover of musicals, and love those classic musical movies of the 50's and 60's the very most. I went to the movie theatre thinking, 'a musical! This should be fun!' It was fun, especially when the 'greek chorus' would start singing.<br/><br/>The men in it (Stellan Skarsgård, Colin Firth, and Pierce Brosnan) were all pretty cute, and did a fairly good job with the singing when not doing solos. Poor Pierce got laughed at while singing, even in parts where I'm not entirely sure we were supposed to be laughing.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried (That girl from Mean Girls) was really good in her part- she sang well, had a great 'stage' presence, and was just generally very good.<br/><br/>Some of the older ladies, though, seemed less inspired than the males and younger cast. Christine Baranski was the very best, of course, stealing the show whenever she was on screen- though her character never felt like a real person. Julie Walters was funny, but again felt like a shallow unnatural caricature- and her final song was just not good at ALL.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep ended up being the weak link, to me- she had next to no 'stage presence.' Where she was supposed to be the charming lovely dynamo, I just saw a low watt, weak voiced woman who can act well, but not give the songs the energy and pizazz they needed. Half the time she sang, I was uncomfortable. At one point she was singing a song for minutes and minutes, verse after verse, and to this minute I'm still not sure how that song connected to anything in that film- all I know is it was supposed to be dramatic.<br/><br/>The directing was unimaginative and poor. They would do closeups on people singing for minutes, and barely ever did wide shots. I could see great potential for shots what with the beautiful locations, and interesting sets- and they squandered them. Phyllida Lloyd had so much to work with, and did next to nothing with it. Considering how well known she is in the world of theater I would have thought she'd be more imaginative with the musical numbers- instead they were frenetic, poorly shot, and unflattering to most of the actors in every way they can be. This is Lloyds first time to direct a movie for theaters, and it SHOWS.<br/><br/>So while I had some fun, in the end this was very poorly directed, and not a home run by any means. I'm underwhelmed."
"blackwidowis7cool","9","2","5","29 September 2019"," Mamma Mia
","This is officially my top favourite musical movie of all time. I won't go into the plot as I suck at describing them. I wasn't even aware of that this existed until I read a post talking about the sequel, so decided that I would give the first one a shot.
The story is hilarious and well-written. I had never heard of ABBA before, so I concur with Mark Baker (a blogger), that if I hadn't known where the music had come from, I would have thought that they were written solely for this movie. They really fit this movie's storyline that perfectly - and I am now a big fan of ABBA music. And I also really loved how whenever someone burst out singing, it had me and my family cracking up laughing.
The cast was perfect for their roles - they really threw themselves into their roles and their singing scenes. I was surprised to find that they were all singing themselves - especially Pierce Brosnan. It's weird thinking that someone who played James Bond can sing, but he did and he did it very, very well. What's with the complaints about Brosnan singing? It's silly, like people complaining about Sean Connery's role in the third Indiana Jones movie. In fact, everyone who sang did it excellently.
The laughs were plenty and that's what made me enjoy this so much. I've never laughed so hard in my life.
I really, really, really love Donna's two besties - they are hilarious! They steal a lot of the scenes they are in and are the cause for plenty of laughs. I especially really love Tanya - don't mess with her as you'll be playing with fire (and you'll love her singing scene). The characters are all great and they really draw you in.
I love how it ends - it fits it. It's not weak, but a strong, fitting end for the movie. I highly recommend this movie to those who love musicals or to those who simply love a good laugh - which this movie will provide it bucket loads."

","I actually enjoyed the play. Worked great on the stage.<br/><br/>However, I could not help but be struck by the fact that according to the premise of the plot, Meryl Streep was old enough to be the girl's Grandmother. She was 59, for crying out loud, and the women playing her friends were not much younger. Since singing was not a big criterion for the lead parts, how about Mariska Hargitay, Gillian Anderson, or Jennifer Anniston? Want singers? Jennifer Lopez or Vanessa Williams. Or, go to the women who played the role on Broadway or in the road shows.<br/><br/>The men were no better, in their mid to late fifties, and they all looked every day of their ages.<br/><br/>Very painful to watch."

","""I said it once, and I'll say it again. No f***ing ABBA!"" Thus spake Bernice, one-third of the female-impersonating lip-synching stage act in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994). ABBA were an enormously popular group at the height of their fame in the seventies, and partly for this reason many who might otherwise have simply not cared for them actively detest them, sort of a backlash effect. I have to admit I liked them. I still have three or four of their albums. When the movie Mamma Mia!, based on the hit stage show, came out, I thought, Meryl Streep and the music of ABBA, how can it miss? Well, it was pretty much as I expected, except that it was something like two or three times as good as I expected. The music was great, as expected. Meryl Streep was astounding, magnificent, sublime. She was by turns a child, a goddess, a force of nature, a work of art. I hadn't known she could sing; I guess if I'd thought about it I would have supposed she could do anything she wants. But she far more than holds her own as a vocalist; she's not just an actress who can sing a little, she's a great singer, IMO.<br/><br/>The gorgeous Mediterranean scenery was an unexpected bonus. There's a story, too, one which sounds a little contrived but works well in context. A young woman living with her mother on a Greek island where the mother runs a hotel wonders who her father is. Her mother tells her only that he was a brief fling who disappeared before she knew she was pregnant. The girl steals her mother's diary and learns that her mother had brief affairs with three different men during the appropriate time frame, so she invites all three to her upcoming wedding hoping to learn which of the three is her father. The main characters come in threes: there's the mother and her two old friends who come for the wedding (Streep, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters), the daughter and her two friends who come for the wedding (Amanda Seyfried, Ashley Lilley, Rachel McDowall), and the three former lovers (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard). Rounding it out to an even ten is the groom, played by Dominic Cooper. All are excellent. Brosnan's singing isn't the best, but he makes up for it otherwise, and Brosnan singing is a little like the joke about the dog walking on its hind legs; it isn't how well he does it that matters, it's the fact that he can do it at all. One would suspect that Brosnan had a lot more fun doing this movie than playing James Bond; he certainly got to do more acting. Baranski, who played the mother of Robin Williams's son in The Birdcage (1996), the American remake of La Cage aux Folles (1979), does a very funny and energetic rendition of ""Does Your Mother Know?"", sung mostly to (or at) the young bartender trying to put a move on her. There's a remarkable number with friends of the groom singing and dancing in swim fins, and the title song is of course superb. However, the highlight, the showstopper, is Streep's extraordinary performance of ""The Winner Takes It All"", near the end.<br/><br/>There's just enough sentiment to keep things real without ever getting sticky. As a paean to middle-aged love and second chances, it's probably more popular with people of my generation than to the youngsters. As for ABBA, the songs are the same but the production is more show-tune and less slickly pop, so even those who didn't like ABBA might like this movie anyway. However, if you're determined to hate it because you hate ABBA, then there's just no hope."
"Ely-girl","8","2","5","29 December 2008"," Entertaining!
","You don't have to be a fan of Abba to enjoy this movie. It is a sit back and relax kind of movie that leaves you feeling very positive at the end. I must warn you though, it is a bit of a chick flick and has (paticulary near the end) a few cheesy scenes but hey, if you like that kind of stuff, you should definitely enjoy this movie. If not, watch it anyway because you will not regret it.<br/><br/>The great thing about this film is that it features a lot of well known actors/actresses and Pierce Brosnan, whom I did not think could pull it off played superbly as Sam Carmichael. Julie Walters, was as usual fantastic and did not fail to give it her best. She was by far one of the funniest characters in the movie and had a great sense of humour, as did the others. Although you could not always feel the chemistry between the characters, they all seemed like they were having a really good time and are friends on/off screen.<br/><br/>There was not much of a plot but here it is anyway - Sophie Sheridan is due to get married but when she reads her mother's diary, she finds 'that any one of three men could be her father' so she invites them to the island so one of them can give her away at her wedding. But which one? This film has two sub plots. One was about Sophie and how she is determined to find out who her father is and keep them a secret from her mother. The other is about Donna Sheridan (her mother), who invites to the island Rosie and Tanya (as backup singers) but who discovers her ex's sooner than expected.<br/><br/>This is a fun film which I think adults can enjoy as well as teenagers/kids as there is no violence, very mild language and a lot of laughs. The songs sung were brilliant and included some of Abba's best songs e.g. Mamma Mia, Dancing Queen, Honey, Honey, Last Summer, the Winner takes it All and many others. The script was solid, the acting was un-flawed, the dance moves were cool and the jokes, although crude at times were funny. However, I do think that the ending could have been concluded better but I will leave that up to you to decide. To sum it up, I think this movie is great. 8/10."
"Atreyu_II","5","2","5","28 December 2008"," Nothing special
","Once I began to hear that they were going to do a movie named ""Mamma Mia"" and that its soundtrack would consist mostly in ABBA's songs, I was curious to see what would it be like. I am one of the greatest fans of ABBA and thought that this would be a biographical movie. While watching the movie, I realized this is no biography at all. Instead, this is a movie adaptation of the stage musical ""Mamma Mia"" based on ABBA's songs, which opened in 1999. Until I found out about that, I even though that this was probably a story about fans of ABBA, people that liked their songs, so they sang it.<br/><br/>I never saw the stage musical in question, but I found the movie silly and mediocre. It's not all that bad comparing to most movies of this generation, but it's not my tea cup either. The movie itself is kinda pathetic. Plus, I think they should have made a biographical movie about ABBA. That would have been a more interesting idea for me and possibly for many ABBA's fans around the world. True, there's always the Internet to search for information about ABBA or any other musical band. Even if I have an idea about ABBA's story, I still think it would be interesting to see a biographical film of them. Something like they did with Ritchie Valens in the 1987 film ""La Bamba"", for example.<br/><br/>The movie's cast includes Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Amanda Seyfried, for example. No one is especially great in their performances, both as actors and as singers. Not even the overrated Meryl Streep. Nevertheless, Amanda Seyfried is very pretty in this.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a Greek island named Skopelos. The Greek scenario is beautiful and quite exotic. There are also some great vistas of the immense sea and the Greek island itself.<br/><br/>As for the soundtrack, there is a reasonable number of ABBA's songs. Many of these new versions aren't bad but they're far from being great. They just don't hold a candle for the original versions. The original versions are timeless classics and there will never be anything like them.<br/><br/>But, back to the movie, in these new versions they seem to transform some of ABBA's saddest songs into jolly songs, which is a bit strange. Not to mention that they made minor changes in the lyrics of some songs. Any ABBA fan who grew up with their songs notices that.<br/><br/>Strange that Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus themselves are two of the executive producers of this movie. Even the actor Tom Hanks is one of the executive producers. Well, it doesn't matter. This is not a worthy movie."
"michaelyouell","8","2","5","20 December 2008"," Lies in extras!
","I saw Meryl Streep interviewed where she said that she hadn't heard ABBA songs before being asked to do the film.<br/><br/>BUT in the Blu-ray extras, the writer (I think it was the writer anyway) says that Meryl Streep wrote a fan letter to her after seeing the stage show.<br/><br/>Can anyone confirm this, and if so which interview was it?<br/><br/>I am going to have to waffle now due to the daft 10 lines of text rule... I've made my point but I should talk random crap for a little bit. What a stupid thing to be forced to write 10 lines... blah blah blah. How dumb."

","Mamma Mia is not your typical ""female"" movie. It is a nice, refreshing film that is a lot of fun to watch. It does not have the typical female movie aspects of two horrible characters you cannot stand (As Good As It Gets) or two characters who despise each other yet somehow get together (Message in a Bottle)--it is an old time romantic musical that intelligently brings the aspects of Abba's music into the storyline. The characters are portrayed very well, though a few of them are not the greatest singers. The storyline is well thought out and written. The direction is well paced and nicely done. The scenery is gorgeous and adds to the story. It is an overall nice film that you can sit down with the family and watch."
"movedout","8","2","5","17 September 2008"," Irrepressible camp, purely entertaining  flaws and all
","Stage director Phyllida Lloyd's film debut knows exactly what it is and what it means to a clamouring fanbase worldwide. Already one of the biggest ever musicals ever put to stage  consistently selling out Broadway and the West End, its translation to the screen is now poised to be the biggest film musical of all time through its knack of reaching across generations (a theme that runs through the film) through a timeless soundtrack and the rare ability to garner repeat business. The film's force of showmanship is distinctive all right, and to be sure, ""Mamma Mia!"" utilises the preternaturally addictive ABBA catalogue to clever use by never veering far from its showcase tunes of instantly recognisable anthems. But there's a much more crucial factor to its commercial success than its inherently gratifying, time-tested Europop extravaganza, and that would seem to be how the viewing experience energises audiences into a frenzy before, during and after the film.<br/><br/>Each of them  and you know who you are  on a certain level view ""Mamma Mia!"" as a sort of audience participation, seen in the likes of originals like ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", ""Cabaret"", ""Grease"", ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""Hairspray"" (circa 1988) and of course, its spiritual predecessor, ""Xanadu"". These films trade heavily on their camp sensibilities and tacky production numbers that go above a natural tolerance for kitsch and the hysterical. You'd be hard-pressed to not find shoes tapping, fingers strumming invisible chords and sotto voce singing at a screening room. This collective spirit of celebration, the utter gaiety of being apart of a harmonious thread is apparent everywhere in the film, particularly when a Greek chorus becomes suddenly apparent as its impressive array of acting talent attempt to sing their way out of paper bags.<br/><br/>What you hear is what you get. Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Julie Walters, Stellan Skarsgard and its young lead, Amanda Seyfried are shoehorned into singing roles. The uninspired, contrived, threadbare story that strings most of ABBA's Top 20 hits together revolves around a soon-to-be-wed Sophie's (Seyfried) attempts to bring three men (Brosnan, Firth, Skarsgard) to the small, idyllic Greek island of Kalokairi for the very purpose of rooting out which of them is her biological father by bringing them face to face with her feisty single mother Donna played by an indomitable Streep. Never you mind its absolute farce of a premise, just admire its sheer audacity of even attempting it.<br/><br/>Steeped in mediocrity, the film is a dissonant fuse of feckless film-making and unqualified brio. Lloyd underdirects every aspect of the film by playing it safe, giving way to an overly effusive and overly acted emoting by its usually terrific cast, proving that even the best of them stumble over tricky song-and-dance material. Brosnan gives a muscular performance even through throaty recitals, but Streep surprises with an impassioned salvo. But the musical performances have a delightfully novel quality of a night at a karaoke bar with awkward uncles and drunken mothers. They are rough around the edges, but remain charming, proving that not everything equates to the sum of its parts. ""Mamma Mia!"" wants to be an experience to be relished, with an intrinsic need to convert the unconverted by its purely stupendous force of ardent spectacle and delirious pizazz."
"philip-caveney","4","2","5","12 September 2008"," Neopolitan Pizza with Extra Cheese
","Abba have long been a guilty pleasure for me. It began back in the 70's when, with the fellow members of the pomp rock band I drummed for, we sneeringly slipped the bass player's mum's copy of Arrival onto the turntable, intending to laugh at it; only to be silenced by the majestic 12 string bombast of When I Kissed The Teacher. Those harmonies! That production! And God, the melody! I ended up buying every one of their records (on vinyl naturally) up to and including The Visitors, their dark and difficult swan song.<br/><br/>When I heard that somebody had stitched together a whole collection of Abba songs into a stage musical, I thought, ' hmm, that probably won't work,' and left it at that. So the phenomenon that is Mama Mia, took me somewhat by surprise. It has gripped the nation and put Abba right back where they belong, at the top of the charts. So, what I wondered, would the movie be like?<br/><br/>Well, it isn't going to give Paul Thomas Anderson any sleepless nights, that's for sure. Let's me honest, it can't have been easy to come up with a storyline that features so many disparate songs. Usually, these affairs are created the other way round, the music written to tell the story. Here, we're offered a pretty unlikely tale that occasionally threatens to career off the rails and into the realms of a fairy story, but with plenty of opportunities for the cast members to burst into song.<br/><br/>An older woman being pursued by a younger man. Quick, go into Does Your Mother Know! A former lover trying to get across to the woman he jilted. Oh, that'll be S.O.S then! You get the general idea. <br/><br/>Meryl Streep plays Donna, former lead singer with girl band, Donna and the Dynamos. She has retreated to an idyllic Greek isle to run a hotel, after having tempestuous affairs with three men. One of them is the father of her daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and as the girl approaches her own wedding day, she rashly invites the three men to attend her wedding, thinking that it's the only way she can ensure that her father is present. Amazingly, they all turn up in the forms of Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard; and then the fun begins. <br/><br/>Or rather, we are offered a film that works in fits and starts, but more often than not just makes you cringe. If this film were a meal it would be a triple Neopolitan pizza with extra cheese. Occasionally, it is genuinely uplifting  a raucous rendition of Dancing Queen has Ms Streep leading all the women of the village in a Sapphic romp along the beach and it's surely the high point of the proceedings. A plaintive Slipping Through My Fingers, with Donna helping Sophia prepare for her wedding was pretty affecting too  it wasn't just me that had tears in my eyes. Was it? WAS IT? But there are low points too, most of them occurring every time Mr Brosnan opens his mouth and murders yet another Abba classic. And even the fabulous Meryl, who largely does wonders with her thankless role, struggles to emote as she stands on a cliff top at sunset, mugging and wriggling her way through the sublime Winner Takes It All while an impassive Pierce looks on in silent bemusement.<br/><br/>Mind you, this didn't seem to bother the packed crowd in my local flea pit, who seemed delighted by every twist and turn; and I can't ever remember a film being brought back for a second run 'by popular demand' in that venue before.<br/><br/>In the end, it all comes down to the 22 carat Swedish pop phenomenon that is Abba. Substitute the hits of just about any other band in a vehicle like this and I'm fairly sure it wouldn't float. Mama Mia just about gets away with it and those looking for a cheerful and undemanding way to spend an evening, might enjoy this one. But be warned. If Abba never floated your boat in the first place, this is going to feel like being slowly tortured to death by violin."

","What a shock. After hearing about a new musical based around the songs of pop sensation Abba i very much decided right away at that moment that i would avoid the whole thing. Eventually i was won round and decided to try it, believing i would find every painful minute a hellish in your face debacle.<br/><br/>Imagine my astonishment,sat there smiling eye to eye throughout finding it almost impossible to stop my legs from bouncing up and down to the fantastic tunes. Nothing i ever expected. Not even slightly. One of the most unrecognisably brilliant films you could ever (not) want to see.<br/><br/>The story is based around a 20 year old young lady (Amanda Seyfried) who is soon to be wed but has a need to know who her father is before the big day. It could be one of three men, so of course the best idea is to invite them all and hope that fate brings them together. Meryl Streep is fantastic as Donna,absolutely perfect for the roll.The lonely mother who eventually finds her lost love from the past in one of the dads to be. Her singing is so passionate, yes she may not be amazing quality but this follows the traits of the film all the way. Along With Sam's (Pierce Brosnan's) best efforts with the vocals. It helps crack a smile, his overly throaty version of SOS having the cinema crowd in pure merriment.<br/><br/>Colin Firth, one of my favourite British actors is a welcome inclusion as one of Donnas previous boyfriends Harry Bright. He produces a beautiful version of ""Our Last Summer"" even if he decides to use the words rain...seine and remain with a slight and almost Australian accent. Colin has a rather funny twist at the end involving him and a local Greek man which just about sums up the film. <br/><br/>Julie Walters is hilarious in her role as one of Donnas life friends, Rosie, the ""Lone Wolf"" with witty one liners and a version of ""take a chance on me"" that is everlasting in the mind chasing Stellen Skarsgard (Bill Anderson) over the rooftops. As true a performance to a character as you will ever see.<br/><br/>By the conclusion to the film i felt like i didn't want to leave the sensational world of Mama Mia. With beautiful scenery,Pure quintessentially British hilarity, and a song about everything possible. I could sing all day.<br/><br/>Truly. Thankyou for the Music."

Meryl is amazing and I give Pierce props, he knows he's not a singer and he still did it and he gave it his all you can tell and it was not that bad. What I found the most enduring is the fact that none of the players are professional singers, who needs more American Idol wannabe's remember ""From Justin to Kelly"" yuck now that is a horrible movie. The not perfect singing made the characters more realistic and I found myself loving their faults as well as their charms.

"CrystallineBlue","4","2","5","9 August 2008"," Disappointing rendition
","I had the privilege of seeing the original North American cast - who premiered in Toronto and went on to Broadway - perform Mama Mia on stage. Sadly the movie does not compare.<br/><br/>Scenery is pretty but the cast are all abysmally bad singers. The ""stagey"" dance routines and exaggerated gestures are fun in the play but look ludicrous on screen.<br/><br/>Other major problem: The cast is too old! SkarsgÃ¥rd, Brosnan, Walters and Baranski are age 55 to 59. The story was written for actors approximately 40, not almost-60. The guys look like Grandads, not hip Dads of a young bride-to-be.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is 59 - not believable she would be the mother of a 20-year old.<br/><br/>As always Streep's bad overacting is a distraction.<br/><br/>I have a good sense of humour but the incredibly cheesy sight-gag involving hippie wigs was pathetic. An unnecessary indignity to the actor.<br/><br/>All in all I did not buy in but MM is worth 4 for the lovely Mediterranean scenery and of course good old Abba songs - after all these years they still sound great. How could anyone resist singing along!"

","As an Avid suspense thriller fan, it was the dutiful husband who was dragged along to see a Musical with ABBA songs which had sent my preconceived opinions and ideas into overdrive. 1 tub of Popcorn, 1 ½ hours later and some of the worst singing you'll hear in a musical and I was totally hooked.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, yet not wholly predictable. The interpretation of the ABBA sounds to a particular scene or Scenario was brilliant and at times very sensitive. I'm not sure it was intentional, but Pierce Brosnan's slightly off Key singing (I'm Kind) gave the film an authenticity that Hollywood does not usually allow. It made you picture yourself at your daughters wedding, you Know your singing voice is awful  yet you go for it because the occasion led you there. I'm sure they could have dubbed or enhanced the singing, but that would have put a gloss on the film which would have been to its detriment.<br/><br/>The Greek Locations and the rustic setting just made you want to be there. The production showed Phyllida Lloyd's experience within the Theatre, and I was also impressed with the lighting Technicians, as they carefully balanced the fill in light to counter the strong Mediterranean Shadows.<br/><br/>On the Whole, The acting, the lack of big names in the younger set, the dancing & singing scenes, not unlike Grease, were totally uplifting, and you walked out of the Cinema singing ABBA songs.<br/><br/>It's a long time since I've experienced the Audience (including me) clapping at the end of a Film  that says it all  If you want a feel good factor film, this is for you.<br/><br/>Vaughan from Leeds"

Meryl Streep was breathtaking and amazing . . . The Winner Takes It All was out of this world. Is she perfect vocally? No, but the emotion she puts into her songs, especially that one, and her AMAZING (amazing and perfect are different things) voice just sucked me in. Baranski and Walters were utterly fantastic.<br/><br/>If you are expecting an earth shattering, message carrying, deep movie, then no, this is not the movie for you. but if you just want to feel good and leave with a smile on your face and witness a legend in her prime (Streep) then you will be blown away. It is a musical, most of the time corny and cheesy are synonymous with musicals, so are there moments? absolutely, dancing with flippers? I could have done without that, but other than that, fantastic film! I have to admit, I have seen it more than once. I really have been blown away by some of the unbelievably harsh comments from some of the members, we obviously saw 2 completely different movie (and no, i am not a silly teen or an old woman as i am sure some might think, i am in my late 20s, classically and music theater trained).

At the beginning I was starting to think it was going to turn out as perhaps I had expected - a cringe-worthy girlie flick. And I think perhaps in some ways it still is. But the more I watched the more I found myself feeling something unusual. I began to feel happy, even joyous within myself. By the end I had a few tears both of happiness and for my own nostalgic days of youth when Abba-mania ruled and the future held all sorts of possibilities.<br/><br/>I was stunned to see Pierce Brosnan break into song and I thought it was very brave on his part. He wasn't too bad, actually for a man he's pretty good, and the film *is* supposed to be about a bunch of ordinary people not professional singers, after all.

"wolverinesforever","7","2","5","29 July 2008"," Greece. Abba. Meyrl Streep and Amanda Seyfried. What else could you ask for?
","""Mamma Mia!"" may not be the best musical of this decade, but it certainly is one of the funnest. After an action laden summer with ""Iron Man,"" ""Indy Jones 4,"" ""Wanted,"" and ""Hancock,"" it's nice to see at least one film without stunts but dances, and with without special effects but songs. Director Phyllida Lloyd has fashioned ""Mamma Mia!"" more in tune with its stage counterpart; the cutting isn't so fast (so you can focus more on each individual shot) and, like the musical, has a big encore at the end featuring all of the major characters in tight spandex (that alone is worth the price of admission). The result is a lot of bright, feel-good fun and a bunch of ABBA hits to go along with it.<br/><br/>The plot is ridiculously easy to follow (not that it matters much anyway). 20-year-old Sophie (Seyfried) is about to be married to Sky (Dominic Cooper), but wants her dad to give her away. Upon reading her mom's (Meyrl Streep) journal, she learns that she has three possible dads (Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, and Colin Firth). When they arrive on the island, expected complications ensue.<br/><br/>Both Streep and Seyfried are the standouts of this movie. Streep moves with such agility and energy you'll be surprised that she still has it all in her at 50+ years. She's also quite funny and, in one scene with Pierce Brosnan, she steals the show with ""The Winner Takes it All"" by putting some real, genuine emotion into her performance. Seyfried is a surprising find; I'll admit, after watching ""Mean Girls,"" I never thought she'd make for such a great singing lead! But great she is; her voice sounds wonderful and she's easy on the eyes too. Both Streep and Seyfriend do a good job acting too.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, both Christina Baranski and Julie Walters steal scenes with ""Does your mother know"" and ""Take a chance of me."" (respectively) And yes, the rumors are true, Pierce Brosnan sounds very un-Pierce Brosnanish when he sings (but its fun watching him try anyway- at least he can act well). Skarsgard and Firth do relatively well with their roles to, as does Dominic Cooper.<br/><br/>The choreography is good, and the cinematography is easy to watch. As said before, the director fashions this a little more on the Broadway side, so if you're looking for something insightful or enthralling like last year's ""Sweeney Todd,"" you've come to the wrong place. This musical is nothing more than fun, fun, fun. In a summer season so dominated by ""blockbuster"" pictures, take a chance (quite literally) on this movie. It's better than you think, and its 107 minutes of your time that you will enjoy a lot."

","We really enjoyed this film because we are big fans of ABBA, Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Julie Waters, Christine Baranski and Pierce Brosnan. The dancing and acting was top notch, but as expected the bride and groom, and MS Baranski were by far the best singers. No one really expected the rest of the cast to be professional singers. The older generation was a bit too old to fit the story line and it was probably a mistake to mention the internet in one scene and then show pictures of a hippy past in the next. But the beauty of Mamma Mia is that the quality of the music is such that the next door neighbors could perform it and the audience would still be dancing in the aisles.<br/><br/>The stand out character in this film (aside from the Music) was of course the Greek Isles and the Blue Med. The location and the cinematography was FANTASTIC. <br/><br/>You need to see this movie in the theater with big screen and the high quality sound system. It was a lot of fun."
"sidunrau","8","2","5","19 July 2008"," Get Up & Dance (or at least sing along!)
","Wow what a fun ride! First of all, when I was a kid growing up the popular groups were Rush, Kiss, Styxx, Kansas, J Giles Band, Blondie, Pink Floyd, etc. - and I loved them all, just like everyone else, but, having a German father, I had spent some time in Europe with my cousins and ABBA was all the rage. I loved ABBA, too - and still do to this day (have an iTunes playlist titled ABBA-mania) - but nobody else did (except for a nerdy girl). So all these years (I graduated in '81) I've held onto my love of ABBA, and, until the play Mamma Mia!, I was pretty much the only one I knew who even knew the music at all well.<br/><br/>Sitting in the theater yesternight (opening night, OF COURSE!) with my wife, having never seen the play (of course I have the soundtrack) I knew the general story from the previews - girl getting married/doesn't know who her dad is/invites all three possible candidates/ABBA music throughout. But I was unprepared for the emotional thrill-ride I was about to experience...<br/><br/>From the opening notes to the closing credits, the show was pure entertainment. Seeing the very-slightly-adapted ABBA songs in ""video/story"" form was amazing. The writers cleverly worked the lyrics into the plot of the story. Meryl Streep - perhaps a bit old for her role - was pretty much perfect as the mother of the bride; her voice was surprisingly delicious, but even better: her acting like a teenager (the character never grew out of it) was SUPERB.<br/><br/>The bride herself had the best voice of all, and ALL of the characters added emotion, passion, meaning and depth to the lyrics as the songs were sung.<br/><br/>I was moved to dance, sing along, weep, LAUGH, rejoice, clap, and otherwise SMILE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. In a sense, I felt my childhood love for ABBA vindicated as I saw so many audience members - young and old alike - experiencing the same. The renditions, though familiar, were fresh and performed excellently (mostly, see below).<br/><br/>My only complaints are these: 1 - The story ended too abruptly; not much follow-through on anything; seemed like a play rather than a movie - I feel the transition from play to movie should've been a bit deeper; 2 - Most critics I heard lampooned Pierce Brosnan's voice but that misses the mark - his voice was fine (not like a professional singer, but absolutely adequate for the part); the problem is: his facial expressions while he sings were distractingly uncomfortable; he looked like he had just swallowed a few spiders every time he sang - and the director should've given some more direction there,IMHO; 3 - The VERY FEW adult-oriented site-gags and bits of dialogue could've been toned down so that this could have been a more family/teenager-friendly movie; and 4 - It was over too fast; they could've fit a few more of my favorites into the script somehow (am I the only one who loves Dum Dum Diddle, The Piper, Knowing Me - Knowing You and The Visitor?); but hey, it wasn't MY show to create.<br/><br/>Cameos by Benny Andersson were also fun.<br/><br/>THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC and the MOVIE to all involved."
"laz-smilebehappy","9","2","5","17 July 2008"," Absolutely Fantastic!!!
","Firstly, I will admit that I am a huge musical fan. I enjoy all the random bursting out in song, and the choreography that everyone strangely seems to know. Unrealistic dancing in a supposedly real setting has always seemed interesting to me.<br/><br/>I saw the original stage show of this movie, and I have to say that being about 10 at the time, I don't remember most of it. But I do remember enjoying myself immensely. This remembered enjoyment of the story and especially the music, only heightened my expectations of this movie, and boy did it deliver.<br/><br/>The plot was predictable to a point, but the casting was excellent, and nobody can find fault with ABBA music. Amanda Seyfried was truly fantastic as Sophie, she sang brilliantly and her acting was superb. Meryl Streep really did suit her role, and while there were a couple of grimaces in regards to her vocal ability, she did do a truly excellent job, especially on ""The Winner Takes it All"". Pierce Brosnan on the other hand was truly terrible. That man should never open his mouth to sing again. He was carried along by Streep in ""SOS"", and even then could not handle his own part in that song, and that was his best number.<br/><br/>Despite some atrocious singing, the movie was absolutely fantastic. It diverged a bit from the original stage show in some plot aspects as I remember them, but everything fit perfectly and hilariously. I went in to the cinema with high expectations, and it truly did not disappoint in music, acting or comedy."

It is a very joyful and delightful movie. The plot is OK, the actors seem to have the time of their lives and everything in the world seems to go just fine after watching this wonderful movie. No worries then, go and see it. You will have a very well spent afternoon. And never forget: You can dance!!! P.S.

Most of my favourites were in there: Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Julie Walters were amongst the greatest in this movie.<br/><br/>This play, aside from having an amazing choice of Abba songs, is a story about a girl who is getting married. She wants her father to give her away, but however, she doesn't know who her father is. She reads her mother's diary and finds that there were three one night stands nine months before she was conceived so she sends a wedding invitation to all three of them.

Mamma Mia stars Amanda Seyfried as Sophie a girl on the verge of getting married in two days, there's just one catch. She wants her father to give her away except she doesn't know who her father is, know it's a musical mystery to which of the three men she invited to the villa is her father, could it be Sam Carmichael the architect, Bill the free spirit, or Harry the quiet business man. Which one could it be? That's an answer for you to find out in this amazingly beautiful musical that boast some of the best ABBA song around and some other great music too.

","Okay, so I finally saw what now seems to be my mother's favorite musical-her being an ABBA fan and all-in both stage and movie versions since she loved this when she saw it on her birthday last year and requested it for a Christmas present from me. Overall, it was indeed enjoyable despite the somewhat shallow characterizations and plot. Of the singing cast, Meryl Streep comes off best and Pierce Brosnan the worst. In fact, I wished he and Colin Firth had switched roles since Mr. Firth is the much better singer. Of the supporting cast, both Julie Walters and Christine Baranski had good vocal chops throughout while Stellan Skarsgard was adequate the few times he sang. Then there are the young leads Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper who both warbled in fine form. Nice cameos by both former ABBA members Bjorn Ulvaeus and, in the ""Dancing Queen"" number, Benny Andersson on the piano. Overall, Mamma Mia! The Movie was a very enjoyable experience. So to anyone who doesn't mind a little frothy entertainment, that's a recommendation."
"engelst","4","2","6","25 December 2008"," Gloriously and involuntarily funny
","Mamma Mia is good fun. Honestly. Too bad that fun is smeared over much too long a distance, and is interspersed with some of the most horrible acting, singing and directing I've seen in years.<br/><br/>The story, unimaginative though it was, did have some potential but was ruined by a bad cast. To name a few: Sky, the bridegroom who moves like a monkey and has a matching voice. Pierce Brosnan, who acts well enough but boy oh boy .. how did he get trapped on the set of a musical? And they let him SING?! It's actually so strange it's funny. Another role that made my blood curdle was Meryl Streep's. Yes, she has a decent voice and does a commendable job of most of the songs. But some of it, especially The Winner Takes It All, was so over the top, so badly badly acted, just mindblowing.<br/><br/>The direction did the rest to finish off the bland story and make sure it will end in the DVD grab bag at the supermarket. Unfortunately, a lot of potential was wasted here. Most of the scenes are shot in the most boring fashion. A lot of the dancing shots are badly cut and are screaming for some choreography that deserves the name.<br/><br/>Fans of good musicals, steer clear. Fans of the actors in it, beware. You may see something that will change the way you saw your idol forever."

Because it aims to be total fun, succeeds on almost every level and dares to give the movie going public what they want - entertainment. It is virtually critic proof, full of tried and tested catchy tunes and will delight even the most jaded of moviegoers. Released as the perfect antidote to 'The Dark Knight', this film enables one to forget about your worries of the day and indulge in a world of harmless fun.<br/><br/>How lucky we are that in the transition from stage to screen, 'Mamma Mia' has been given the care and attention that has created an instant cult classic. Many moviegoers will return to 'Mamma Mia' over and over again, with repeat visits by many who will have barely set foot in a cinema in the last year. A whole history awaits this movie on DVD.<br/><br/>The shimmering Greek locations, the toe tapping songs, the ingenious casting of Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters, Christine Baranski, Colin Firth and the delightful Amanda Seyfried (to name just a few) have created one of the most entertaining movies of the year. Leave your cynicism at the door and just look at the smiles on peoples faces after the movie has ended."
"FosseFilmGuy","9","2","6","23 July 2008"," A brilliant adaptation of the play!
","From the minute it opened with, ""Honey Honey"", I knew 'Mamma Mia"", I whispered to my wife, ""If the film maintains this pace, it's gonna be great."" It did. Aside from Pierce Brosnan's brave attempt at singing (not bad) along with Julie Walters' so-so voice, this is truly a great film for all to see that out soars the play. Amanda Seyfried is absolutely beautiful; voice, looks, etc. I thought her fiancée was a bit of a wimp, but who cares? He wasn't the main character for a reason. Meryl Streep is always a blast, but Christine Baranski steals the show as an aging sex kitten. Skarsgaard is a true sport and is clearly having fun with his role as one of Sophie's possible dads. It's rare in an adaptation or any film in general where everything is staged just right. Musical numbers were perfect, performances were right on the money, and unlike ""Dreamgirls"", clichés were avoided at every turn here. As a filmmaker myself, I would've either dubbed Walters and Brosnan or recast them. I still give this a 10 out of 10 because a film done so well like this one can easily over compensate for a couple of people who can't sing. Obviously the arrangers knew this since Brosnan and Walters sang the first verse solo then were loudly joined by an ensemble. All in all, ""Mamma Mia"" is a blast, bring everybody, see if you can catch Amanda Seyfried's nipple slip when she's getting ready for her wedding, and STAY FOR THE END CREDITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"taichai","6","2","6","19 July 2008"," The stage version was better
","I've seen the stage version 3 times. Was hoping the movie to be good too, but it doesn't deliver.<br/><br/>One problem is the cast. None of the big names are much above amateur level in singing, unlike the leads in Chicago. It really distracts from the songs. As for the acting, I felt Streep did a bad job with ""The Winner takes it all"" by resorting to pantomime (pointing to the sky for ""the Gods"", throwing her hands for ""roll a dice"", crouching for ""staying low"" ...) Though her acting in ""Slipping through my fingers"" was exquisite.<br/><br/>The other problem is the transition from stage to screen. Apart from the fantastic outdoor scenery, there is not much improvement. You can forgive certain things on a stage play, like being dumped into the middle of the story in the first few minutes, or jarring transitions, but on the big screen these problems are magnified. And not only are these issues retained, some of the character interactions are even more truncated than the stage version! Lastly, the final ""encore"" numbers on stage got the audience on their feet. Here the energy just peters out.<br/><br/>The one clever thing introduced here is having the Greek ladies etc. comment on the action just like a Greek Chorus. As well, the full blown fantasy segment of ""Money money money"" was great.<br/><br/>I would have given 5 stars if not for the music."
"naurimas-1","8","2","6","18 July 2008"," Great songs, sunny days and suspense of the musical
","Watching this movie will undoubtedly give the happy feelings of Europop and Disco songs of ABBA, some expectations, suspense about love stories of the screen and the sunny mood of the land of Greece.<br/><br/>The musical was made using songs of ABBA about the ""flower power"", joy of life, loss and discovery of love. The songs are sung by different characters and sometimes repeated several times, especially at the beginning and at the end of the movie. Also the songs have been humorously improvised not only for the stag party, the hen party, the marriage ceremony at the church, but also while reflecting the situation of the unmarried mother, who had many passionate love affairs, her friends: the serial divorced lady, the lady who describes herself as the loner. The songs of the male characters, the former fellows of the ""flower power"" (the rich owner of the yacht, the banker and the architect) also are about search for love. Fortunately, not always the songs deal with the search for Mr Right or Miss Right, but also happy moments of life.<br/><br/>The generation gap ideas coming from the single mother, her daughter, her former lovers, the ladies who have not been successful in love are given in a humorous way.<br/><br/>Besides that, the sunny days in the land of Greece of this movie will make the days of winter, spring or autumn happier due to songs, plot, suspense.<br/><br/>A musical worth watching."
"Dan-I-am","6","2","6","11 July 2008"," Fun,feel good flick but s.o.s from some of the singing!
","I never saw the Broadway show but today I decided to go see Mamma Mia the movie in hope that it would be as great as last years Hairspray. Unfortunately, I found it quite disappointing. It tells the story of Sophie who, in an attempt to find a father to walk her down the isle on her big day, secretly reads her mothers diary and finds three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) that might possibly be her father . Meanwhile everyone keeps breaking out into Abba songs and dancing around cheerfully. The music is fine but the singing pretty laughable at times, especially from Brosnan who the audience were actually laughing at whilst he was breaking out into song. The main problem with this movie is that it can't figure out who the story is following, Sophie or her mother Donna. One moment we are following Donna around trying to work out which man out of the three men who have arrived she loves the most and then we follow Sophie who is trying to sort out which one is her father. In the end it becomes one huge mess and the songs become quite annoying and just plain corny! Streep does OK with her singing but not good enough for someone that sings around 10 songs throughout the whole film. All in all, Mamma Mia has some great jokes, good scenery and good acting, but the singing and story line let it down. But by all means go see it for the feel good vibe and the songs that will stick in your head for days!"
"MGPT80","2","1","2","27 June 2020"," Great music but... um, yeah.
","Come on now. I know it's a musical and there will be songs and all but seriously, that's virtually all there is. The music takes up so much of the movie that there isn't any time left to tell an actual story. But maybe that's a blessing, because the little bit of 'plot' we are left with is absolutely pathetic and a stain on the resumes of all involved. The whole experience feels like a Meryl Streep mid-life crisis and the karaoke scenes are a complete embarassment. Yes I know this is supposed to be 'a bit of fun' but you could get all the same enjoyment by watching an ABBA concert on youtube and sparing yourself the ridiculous celebrity posturing."

The casting of her to play Donna is laughable.<br/><br/>Let's move on to the singing and acting. Several cast members can't carry a tune in their back pocket.

","Overall I think this movie was pretty good but there are a few things that don't quite make this a 10/10 film. I first watched this movie in my 10th grade music class. I've never heard of it and I didn't really pay much attention until I hear the song ""Dancing Queen"". It was actually a really good song and it made me watch the movie at home. The story has a pretty good plot. Sophie is about to get married and she wants her father to be there for her wedding. She reads about three men in her mothers journal and invites them all out to the wedding. She doesn't know which one is her father but she's hopeful that she'll find out. When you read the summary of the movie you think it sounds pretty spicy and interesting. It it's indeed that and the scenery from the Greek islands is beautiful! It's great if you like musicals and the songs are all very catchy. Meryl Streep plays the mother and has a few solos as well. In my opinion I don't think Meryl Streep is the best singer but she's a good actress. Maybe if the role was played by someone else the singing would be better but then again they're just actors. I would recommend this. The plot of the story is very enjoyable but I do think people will judge the songs and the actors chosen to sing. Overall though it is a very good movie and I still enjoyed it."

This is a warm, entertainment that immerses music, comedy, along with a great acting, particularly by Meryl Streep, easily an award winning performance. The only two weaknesses appear to be Colin Firth's role whose character was fully depicted until much later in the movie and Dominic Cooper's scene where he gets upset and then somehow the subsequently his upset somehow dissipates without explanation. Pierce Brosnan's role is fascinating, especially with his less than stellar singing vocals which could be considered a weakness but can also be considered more authentic and emotionally compelling. There is a lot of free flowing depictions of fun gyrating, dancing moves that sparkle and shine on the screen. This a genuine smash musical extravaganza. Nine out of Ten Stars."

The setting in Greece is stunning and since I first watched it ten years ago (and subsequently visited several of the islands) has inspired a long-term love of the Greek islands. The cast is perfect, Amanda Seyfried plays Sophie perfectly and has a gorgeous voice, Meryl Streep is amazing as Donna, and Julie Walters is hilarious. The music finishes it all off and makes the film. Couldn't recommend enough if you want a snippet of summer and to leave feeling good."
"charlywiles","6","1","2","5 April 2016"," ABBA-dabba-do
","I'm a fan of movie musicals and fondly remembered the group ABBA's tunes from the 1970's so I thought I'd give this one a shot. It's based on the world-wide stage sensation which was, in turn, based on the Swedish pop-group's hits. It's kind of fun at times and has beautiful location photography, but this middle-aged, female fantasy is awfully contrived and somewhat sappy. Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth seem uncomfortable in their roles and Pierce Brosnan's singing leaves a lot to be desired. It does showcase Streep's fine voice and some of the numbers are inventively staged, but I think an appreciation of the film is pretty dependent on one's enjoyment of the stage show or the group's music."
"CMTiago","9","1","2","21 July 2014"," The joy of ABBA's music
","Whenever the time comes for me to re watch this wonderful movie, the feeling that most resonates with myself is joy and the great melodies from ABBA's music that made us basically just enjoy the songs with a smile in our faces. This movie takes their lyrics and turns it into a musical story about family, romance and the everlasting mark of youth power.<br/><br/>So our plot begins with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) sending 3 wedding invitations to three men, from which she thinks one might be her father. As soon as these men arrive on the island, trouble will ensue as Sophie's mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) tries to figure out why they are there and ultimately keep them away from Sophie. Sophie on the other hand tries to figure out which one of the three, Bill (Skarsgaard), Sam (Brosnan) and Harry (Firth), is her dad. Add in secondary characters like Donna's old friends and Sophie's fiancée, and you have the stage set for great comedic situations.<br/><br/>Overall I consider this movie to be a success in terms of the performances, granted there were a few amateur mistakes, but given that some of these actors hadn't done a musical yet and the fact that they actually tried, one can look past them. However a key player in this movie is Amanda Seyfried, as she steals the show with heavenly voice. In the end, Mamma Mia! will always be a movie I enjoy based purely on its entertainment value, as it isn't exactly a storytelling masterpiece, but it delivers laughs and a splendid time.<br/><br/>Rating: 9,5/10"
"libmarj","2","1","2","16 June 2013"," miscast for this musical lover
","I have always loved musicals, but was not very familiar with Abba's music. I did hear that the stage musical of Mamma Mia was good. Meryl Streep was miscast, she rarely plays an airhead woman. Pierce Brosnan could not sing; another actor who could sing would have been better. The Greek isles scenes I was hoping to see were few and far between. My friends who were big Abba fans liked it, but I did not. The only other musical I disliked was Moulin Rouge, but that was so visually stunning I couldn't stop looking at it. Many musicals don't have elaborate plots, but if there is a thin plot, as there was in this one, there has to be stellar musical performances, costumes, or sets. Give me Chicago, Hairspray, or any older musical, please!"
"LilMissMuffit","8","1","2","16 December 2011"," A heartfelt, fun musical comedy everyone can enjoy!
","I have been a huge fan of musical theatre for some time now, and I always get excited when it comes to movie adaptations. However, I'm always a bit cautious as many of these adaptations just fall flat for me for whatever reason. Mamma Mia is an exception to this. Although nothing can compare to the magic of theatre, Mamma Mia comes close to delivering the same atmosphere the musical has on stage. It also helps that the three creators of Mamma Mia were heavily implicated in its production as well as the two men from Abba. This gave the movie a solid foundation to build upon.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia features a star studded cast, with Meryl Streep leading the bunch. The older generation of the cast are all well established actors, and guess what? They can also sing! Meryl Streep is definitely a strong singer, and her two female costars Julie Walters and Christine Baranski also hold their own. The three males are also quite good. I personally adored Colin Firth's voice and I wished he'd had more solos. Stellan Skarsgard's voice was fairly good, at least good enough for the few solo lines he had. Pierce Brosnan's performance was interesting. His acting was definitely less wooden than when he played our favourite hero James Bond, and he made his character likable. His singing, although definitely not as good as a trained Broadway performer, was still fairly strong. However, I found his delivery of the songs a little comical as looked as if he were in pain while in some parts of the movie.<br/><br/>The younger actors also hold their own. For Amanda Seyfried, this movie was what made her a household name, and she fully deserves it. Her performance is wonderful. She's full of energy, and her singing voice is absolutely beautiful. She definitely embodies the youthfulness Sophie is meant to have. Dominic Cooper does a great job acting in the limited screen time he has. He and Amanda have great chemistry and his singing is also quite good. <br/><br/>The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the sound stages are equally as lovely. The musical numbers were full of energy and fun to watch. Nothing felt out of place or dragged on for too long. Everything in the movie was there for a purpose, and the pacing was just right. One of my favourite parts of the movie is the Greek chorus (literally, a chorus of Greek locals), who add both fantastic harmonies, and comical moments.<br/><br/>Although not a very deep or complex movie, Mamma Mia delivers a heartfelt, fun musical comedy that everyone can enjoy. The actors had the times of their lives making this movie and it really shines through in all their performances. This is the kind of movie to be watched again and again, and definitely a good pick me up on a very bad day."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","3 November 2011"," Just like ABBA's music, you'll either really like or just hate this movie.
","Right after having seen this movie I still feel like I could go either way on it. I could completely pick this movie apart and blast it for its silly story, weak directing and whatever more but truth is that this movie is simply harmless fun, that you can either hate on or just surrender yourself to. <br/><br/>Maybe it will also depend on your mood on how you'll see this movie. Guess I was in the right mood, since I'm really willing to give this movie the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>It's a true happy-go-lucky and cheerful looking movie, that you obviously shouldn't take very seriously. I see this movie as basically a great one to have a fun time with and for a while makes you forget everything you might had on your mind.<br/><br/>Don't tell anybody else but sometimes I can be quite fond of ABBA music, so I was never opposed to the idea of a musical movie featuring most of the ABBA evergreens. As a matter of fact, I though it was a great idea! So how did it work out in the movie? Only half successfully I feel. They were of course very depended on already existing songs, that were never supposed to be part of one big musical or movie in this case. Some songs fit really well into the movie, while others seem a bit forced in and actually have very little to do with what is happening on the screen.<br/><br/>It also was quite annoying and weird at times how fast some of the songs were following each other. There are moments in the movie that they perform 3 musical numbers in a row, without a real break between them. That's just crazy! Even for normal musical movie standards. It also seems like more songs got crammed in as the movie was heading toward its ending. It was like the movie was saying in its first half; here we set up the story and characters and in the second half; here we can go crazy with all of the songs and forget all about the story!<br/><br/>Overall the songs are all performed quite well, even though the choreography, for musical standards, isn't really anything impressive to look at. I'm also afraid not all of the actors had the best singing voices. I really like Stellan Skarsgård, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth and all but the movie should had never allowed them to sing! Sorry to say but their talents obviously lay elsewhere. Luckily the female cast seemed to have less problems with this and also luckily they are the ones that do most of the singing in this movie.<br/><br/>I really can see and understand that this is not a great movie by any means but it's nevertheless perfectly fun and harmless to watch, if you're in the right mood and can handle the funky Swedish sounds of the ABBA music.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"s_daad","10","1","2","21 November 2010"," Greece, the Musical!
","Agreed that Mamma Mia is a fantastically crafted musical, with amazing energy, top class music, mesmerising song and dance numbers and great central performances. But can all that distract us from a horrendously immoral story at the core? What is going on here? It clearly glamorises promiscuity and the rejection of family values, and to an extent that has never been seen beyond the bounds of pornography. Why is the music of ABBA framing this sordid tale? Couldn't they have a normal story and still make it fun? I'm afraid not, and I'll spell out the reasons below.<br/><br/>ABBA is cheese to begin with. ""Nothing more to say / No more ace to play""?!! They were a Swedish group with little English trying to break the Anglo-Saxon market, and the result was pure cheese. But with four people bursting with musical talent, the cheese became irresistible too. This music was different from everything else on the market. Where music in general was losing its grammar, busy rocking and rolling, going through punk, hip hop, grunge, etc etc, ABBA stuck to the basics of structure. Each ABBA song is a masterpiece of composition, worthy to be studied next to Bach and Beethoven in my opinion. And such meticulous grammar does not work without cheese. I can't imagine Winner Takes It All being sung with feisty lyrics. ""Nothing more to say / Go ahead, make my day""? It just doesn't work. Cheese was an integral part of ABBA songs. We just got used to it.<br/><br/>ABBA music was in need of a serious shake-up. It sounds good, but it's also stiflingly strait-jacketed. For thirty years we've been listening to perfect compositions, and don't we just wish that it would let its hair down! This is where the filmmakers of Mamma Mia come in. I believe that they are responding to this aching popular need. The songs are sung in a more spontaneous manner, and put into a story where the energy flows. But how to offset the cheese? This, I realise, was a major problem for the makers. If the songs are cheesy to begin with, how cheesy is it to put them in a musical where they appear to be part of the story? The story had to be as feisty as possible. It needed to plumb the depths of liberal and permissive society. Otherwise it would be laughed off the planet. And that's what the story of Mamma Mia does too. We have the mother not knowing who the father of her daughter is, and yet all three candidates turn up at the wedding of the daughter. After all the guilt and angst has served its plot purposes, we have both mother and daughter being cool about the mother's immoral past, and in fact celebrating it. The daughter cancels her wedding, and presumably embraces the immoral lifestyle of her mother. So the whole father thing was just a ruse to have a story with a lot of song and dance. It appears that normally these people have banished fatherhood from the earth, and then only bring up the prehistoric concept when they want to make a musical. I think that is as subversive as you can possibly get.<br/><br/>And it works too. The energy of the film is unbelievable. And it was exactly this energy that was needed for the thing to click. Would the people involved have been as enthusiastic if they had been working with tread-of-the-mill Cinderella story? I don't think so. The hot cake story at the center is the energising force. In the end we are just about distracted from the luridness of the story. We are immersed into the fun of it all, and in cinematic terms that spells success. The music too sounds far better than their ABBA versions.<br/><br/>But we are going to be sorry in the end. Sorry that we took part in this celebration of promiscuous matriarchy. There is no doubt about it. This film is plumbing the depths of decadence. Greece is where Western civilisation began. By the evidence of this film, it is also where it ends."

","An independent, single mother who owns a small hotel on an idyllic Greek island, Donna is about to let go of Sophie, the spirited daughter she's raised alone. For Sophie's wedding, Donna has invited her two lifelong best girlfriends—practical and no-nonsense Rosie and wealthy, multi-divorcée Tanya—from her one-time backing band, Donna and the Dynamos. But Sophie has secretly invited three guests of her own. On a quest to find the identity of her father to walk her down the aisle, she brings back three men from Donna's past to the Mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier. Over 24 chaotic, magical hours, new love will bloom and old romances will be rekindled on this lush island full of possibilities.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia! What is this?! The story was below average and was lacking that spark to grab your attention immediately and also felt like it wasn't thought through properly, you just didn't care what happened. The singing was laughable as none of them had decent voices except for maybe Amanda Seyfried, the worst voice being Pierce Brosnan who should stick to what he's good at. The songs felt like they were placed randomly in the movie. The choreography was quite bad too, there were some scenes in which I felt embarrassed for the characters because of the dancing. The characters were also done poorly as they were one-dimensional and you didn't really give a hoot for them much. When they weren't either singing or dancing, the acting was actually decent but an all-star cast couldn't save this.<br/><br/>I don't know what it is that attracts people to Mamma Mia: The Movie so much that it has made a lot of money. I've seen some musicals in my time and the majority of them I like but this was beyond over-the-top cheesiness and not very good. It was too in-your-face, I felt like the characters were basically screaming ""we're having an awesome time, you're having an awesome time too"" constantly.

","I bought this movie because somebody recommended it to me. Then, on seeing the cast, that is, Meryl Streep, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth, i said to my self wow this must be good! I was disappointed to learn that great actors can make quite a poor show of themselves. Not that the script had allowed them to do any better; it was sketchy, ridiculous, sloppy, slapdash work, as if written hastily at a party by a bunch of amateurs after smoking a few joints. <br/><br/>The acting was accordingly. Meryl is no merry peach and all her dancing and singing was so out of place I wanted to scream. But she did it all for me. Halfway through the movie her voice sounds as if somebody was strangling her. Unlike Amanda Seyfried, who has some talent in this respect. She was the only one not scratching my ears with her vocal performance. <br/><br/>Another thing that I found greatly irritating was all that joyful yelling whenever 'the girls'(both young and old generation) met. It sounded simply hysterical. Real people don't scream with joy like they're drunk or something when meeting again, even if it's after a long time. I'm convinced the intention was to convey youthfulness and fun but it all failed lamentably to do so. <br/><br/>Given these and other negative remarks I won't add here out of boredom, I'll give this so called musical a 2 out of 10."

"ohmmaya","9","1","2","30 June 2010"," Horrey Mamma Mia
","My review of Mamma Mia is just like that I can't meet this fabulous musical movie anywhere else. When I saw the musical ""Mary Poppins"", I was astonished at its special effects with the actors' wonderful songs. On the contrary, Mamma Mia put the high technological special effect aside and is rather faithful in a musical genre. Mamma Mia can be called a joint movie musical by Meryl Streep and lovely and fantastic songs of ABBA. This looks like a marvelous music video. Meryl Streep (Donna) is not a professional singer but her outstanding performance blew my worries far away and Pierce Brosnan (Sam) was seen making lots of effort on his singing as much as he could, so I can tell he must get a thrill in singing and dancing after all. Amanda Seyfried (Sophie) is so adorable that I couldn't turn my eyes away from her. The plot of the film is comical enough to throw your head out and roar with laughter. Sophie, a bride-to-be woman has one dream that is to go to the altar with her father. She happens to find her mother's diary and know that one of three strangers Sam, Harry and Bill might be her father. She invites them secretly to her wedding hoping that her mother Donna could recognize her father among the guests. Donna has trouble in making a living with her dilapidated hotel. While she used to sing with her friends, Rosie and Tanya, she is now a mother worrying her daughter too much. This sounds sad but it is never just a simple tearjerker. While I was watching Mamma Mia, I was astonished at its beautiful and splendid scenery. How could the director, Phyllida Lloyd find the perfect place for this film? The shinning blue sea and a small harbor, the old but lovely hotel and the fantastic winding stairs to the altar on the top of the hill nearby the sea, you can't believe that this is an existing small town in Italy. Even the setting is absolutely brilliant, without the director's amazing job, this film shines like a blue diamond. Apart from the setting, there is a big musical angle too, resulting in a heart beating in almost every scene where the actors sing a song of ABBA. How could the scriptwriter create the story with the songs of ABBA? It is incredible that the songs show exactly the situations and the feelings the characters are facing. The marvelous soundtrack throughout the movie and Meryl Streep stir the audience and without them, Mamma Mia could not make a big hit. Some people say this is just for girls (what is called the chick flick) but is that a big deal? If you really enjoy and feel warm-hearted, that's enough. How many times do you hum after this film? I think this is the best movie to make us go to the karaoke and try to sing a song."
"johnstonjames","9","1","2","11 June 2010"," I Was Converted From ABBA Hater To ABBA Fan.
","When I was younger I hated ABBA. Even the mention of the song 'Dancing Queen' made me want to puke and feel embarrassed for it's fans. I preferred hard rock like 'Sabbath' or the 'Stones'. I simply couldn't stand most pop and disco.<br/><br/>Now that I'm all grown up(another way of saying 'old')I must have mellowed or something because now I love ABBA. If you had told me twenty, even ten years ago, that one day I would be an ABBA fan I would have said that wasn't possible. No way. Well it was possible and now I own the movie and an ABBA video collection. NEVER thought that would happen.<br/><br/>I only went to see this movie because of Streep and that I've developed a taste for movie musicals as I got older. Even though I like musicals now, I still thought this would suck and stink and make me puke. Instead I was hooked from the first song and I couldn't stop laughing at how funny the movie was.<br/><br/>Now that I look back, I see the threads of my acceptance in the making. Before I was into hard rock and the stuff like the 'Dead', I bought Osmond brothers records and liked the Partridge Family. So I can kind of see how this happened.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie as simple easy going fun for everybody. I do not endorse, however, the heavy alcohol consumption in the film. I mean these woman drink like they're W.C. Fields. Alcohol can be fun for adults, but if not done in moderation it can be a killer. So have fun with this. Just don't drink your brains(or bladder)into oblivion."

","It's another musical movie. Thiz movie is a tribute to ABBA, the famous disco sensation in 1970-1980s. It's a simple story about a girl who wishes his father presence on her wedding day. The problem is she doesn't actually know who her father is. She has been raised by her mother alone. According to her mother diary, there are three possibilities that are represented with three persons that could be her father. The things become complicated when she finally decides to invite them all. You just can't imagine what will happen next. The movie is starred by a lot of senior Actors such as Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth. Apparently, the surprise comes from a promising rising Amanda Seyfried. She delivers her role with easy-going and lovable character. The ABBA's hits like ""Honey"", ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Mamma Mia!"" are performed well by the Actors and Actresses themselves. In my opinion, the songs are successfully refreshed. On top of that, I think nowadays musical movies become more acceptable. It begins to sound familiar because the music is more likely to base on pop rock trends. It's very different from musical movies that made from 1950-1960s which were mostly based on classic orchestra. The movie is surprisingly directed by first time Director, Phyllida Llyod. In overall, the movie is so fresh and full of joys. Before I went to watch thiz movie, I thought it would be another teen movie. But after I have seen it, I come to the conclusion that thiz movie is simply enjoyable and fun for all ages.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","Mamma Mia is a movie I really didn't care for, and I actually like Abba. It's pleasant, and Meryl Streep is completely game, but after an hour of this stuff or so, the entertainment value, really started to wain. Some will find the whole plot of Amanda Seyfried trying to figure out who her father is amusing, but I soon grew tiresome of it. Seeing Meryl and Peirce Brosnan belt out Abba songs I guess was a really funny idea to some, but they sounded awful! though I did admire there spirit. One thing I did love was the location it was set in. The beautiful view of the bright blue Ocean, with the sun shining down on it, was a great sight to see. I had actually avoided this movie for quite awhile, because I'm quite picky on musicals, and even respectfully passed on watching it when my Mom rented it. Well I finally bit the bullet and gave it a shot, and while I admired it's good natured plot, dug the scenery, and admired the characters, it just gets completely exhausting after a while.<br/><br/>Performances. Amanda Seyfried is charming and showed why she's one of Hollywood's best up and coming actresses. Meryl Streep,Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are a hoot as the inseparable threesome, and made the movie that much more bearable with there natural chemistry. Pierce Brosnan,Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth all have there own unique charms as the the gentleman who are dying to find out, if there Sophie's father.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Mamma Mia is a decent Musical, but not one i'll see again. For what it was I suppose I enjoyed a lot of it, but the constant Abba just got on my nerves after a while, and as I said I like Abba.

I guess it's what everyone mostly feels, but it is such a fun romp. Watching Streep play this role is a dazzling journey and the rest of the cast is wonderful, too. The music is bouncy and fun and it's just a good time. Sometimes you need that, instead of something serious and cerebral.<br/><br/>And I will confess, the first time through I didn't know that was Julie Walters until the credits rolled and then I shouted, ""Mrs. Weasely??!"" I had to run the DVD back to see that last number. She was so into her different persona that she fooled me completely.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep . . . perhaps the greatest actress of the 20th century.

","In many films,the key to it is the people starring in it. Mamma Mia is a fun film for many reasons. But the main reason is because of Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski. The three women in the film play best friends. Almost everything that comes out of their mouth is funny.""That yoga is making my feet bigger"" is an example of stuff that they say. Mamma Mia is a musical about a girl named Sophie(Amanda Seygfried from Mean Girls) who doesn't know her father is. She's always been curious. Her mother(the great Meryl Streep)has never told her and she doesn't know. So Sophie is getting married in a few days. She ends up finding her Mom's diary and reads it. It turns out that she has three possible fathers: Sam Charmichael(Pierce Brosnan), Harry ""Headbanger"" Bright(Colin Firth)and Bill Anderson(Stellan Skarsgard). She writes to all three of these men and they all come. Sophie gets close to these men and tries to figure out which one is her father. But she doesn't know because they could all be. That sounds kind of weird but it's true. Some people may think the the ending is disappointing. It is disappointing, but for a musical, Mamma Mia is really entertaining and fun. I think if you want to rent something, rent Mamma Mia."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","1","2","30 July 2009"," Tapping your toe won't make this musical adaptation get much better
","""Mamma Mia!"" is one of those movies that looks like it was more fun for the cast than it was for the audience. The actors look like they're having a blast dancing on the shores and piers of various Greek islands, while in the meantime we sit in a theater trying to hum our way through another poor conversion of a stage musical to the silver screen.<br/><br/>The musical, based on music by Swedish pop group ABBA, was written for the stage by Catherine Johnson, who also writes the screenplay. Bringing her vision to life is fellow Brit theatre director Phyllida Lloyd. Between them, the two haven't a lick of real movie-making experience and it shows. Stage minds should never be put in charge of a movie, something proved many a time, most recently Susan Stroman's ""The Producers"" movie, the Mel Brooks musical she directed on stage. The thinking of theatre minds does not grasp the scope of film and so ""Mamma Mia!"" looks more like a scrapbook of music montages, cheesy dances and bad MTV videos.<br/><br/>The hit Broadway show takes some narrative suggestions in the lyrics of several ABBA songs and dreams up a way to thread them together, really quite genius. A young girl named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, most notably the ditzy Karen from ""Mean Girls"") is getting married on a Greek island where her former pop singer mother (Streep) runs a hotel. Unsure of who her father is but curious, she invites the only three possible candidates in hopes she'll find out which one it is. The men are older English hunks Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and not-so- much-hunk Stellan Skarsgard<br/><br/>The musical is diluted on the screen by a feeling that all the songs need to be included, that the show can naturally translate when in fact it's more of a showy feel-good musical and not a very visual story. Numbers are forced and the camera feels lost because it doesn't know what to focus on. When it runs out of ideas, terrible things happen like an image of Meryl Streep's face in a roulette wheel singing about money. Johnson and Lloyd between them have no creative answers and settle with stage direction.<br/><br/>Even as talented as Streep is, some of the things she's asked to do in this movie have me convinced she just took the money and said ""I'll at least have fun with this."" Her talents help most in the drama between mother and daughter and perhaps she rubs off on Seyfried who is really quite nice too. Both have the best singing voices in the movie too, though Streep does have to stylize her singing a bit more to make up for her vocal shortcomings. On the opposite of that spectrum is Brosnan, who must've worked tirelessly with a vocal coach to no avail. Clearly star power was valued more than musical talent in much of the casting.<br/><br/>Most of the cast has great chemistry, but I would too if I were out there wining and dining in Greece with all these notable actors when the camera wasn't rolling. Fun is easy to capture on camera -- a stage musical is not. Truthfully, it's worth the higher admission price to see the show again or even just listen to its soundtrack than waste time with this movie version. It's all about the music anyway."

","This film was more enjoyable than I expected. I found it to be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Although I recognize ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Take A Chance On Me"" as big hits, I don't really know much about the singing group ABBA and the songs they wrote. According to the reviews of ""Mamma Mia,"" I shouldn't have liked this musical. But it was free on my cable TV so I thought I would watch a little to see for myself if it was as bad as some reviews said. After all, while Meryl Streep has been in occasional ""B"" movies (e.g., 1994's ""The River Wild""), her performances in her movies have all been worth watching.<br/><br/>But despite all of its faults, and with the knowledge that the film is not meant to be taken seriously, I found I really enjoyed ""Mamma Mia."" As has already been described in other reviews, the plot (a girl, raised by a single mother (played by Meryl Streep), is about to be married and invites three men to the wedding to give her away on her belief that one of the three is her father) is merely a device on which to hang a number of Abba songs, not all of which have lyrics that are completely appropriate to the story. The fun is watching the mostly tongue-in-cheek performances. Meryl Streep did some singing in at least one of her previous films, but she really gets to show off her more than adequate singing ability in ""Mamma Mia."" Accompanying her as a trio are long time Broadway musical star and comedic actress Christine Baranski, and British actress/performer Julie Walters. The one star who seemed miscast as a singer was Pierce Brosnan."

","I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this movie. Even those of us (cough, cough) too young to remember Abba in their heyday will enjoy this fast-paced supersized music video of their hits. <br/><br/>If nothing else it is a chance to see Meryl Streep who hits her stride letting loose with her singing talents shown at the end of ""Postcards from the Edge."" Her rendition of ""Winner Takes It All"" alone is worthy of an Oscar as she delivers the song in great voice but with all of the acting passion that the words are meant to convey. <br/><br/>Abba's music is the epitome of deeply melodic, feel-good, moving (physically or emotionally) music and this film does a great job of conveying that. I can't imagine anyone seeing it in the theater as a play and not dancing in the aisles. <br/><br/>There were only two down sides. There's something about the directing/audio that is off- putting. There seems to be a wall between us and the folks in the film, an artifice that keeps you from really getting the ""zing"" it must have had in a live performance. And the other is the downright bizarre singing voice of Pierce Brosnan. LOL. Some commenter said that ""no one"" can sing, which is an obvious reference to the writer's own ""tin ear"" as most of the cast sing very, very well. But Brosnan, who apparently sang his own songs, sounds like a whiskey-voiced folk singer from the 60s. It's especially jarring to not hear his accent. Like the old days of hearing Gomer Pyle singing opera. :)<br/><br/>Other than those two things, though Mama Mia, and especially Meryl Streep, shine like the sun through a streaky window. Warming and joyful, and the streaks can be forgiven as they only encourage you to go find the real thing for yourself."

Pierce Brosnan actually sounds like Paul McCartney when he sings. Meryl Streep is a very good singer. Christine Baranski stole the show. The camera loves this woman and she's still very sexy at 55. Julie Walters and Meryl Streep are invisible when they share the screen with her; especially Julie Walters - invisible. Baranski is very graceful and carries the dance scenes. Amanda Seyfried is a beautiful young actress and she was a strong presence in the film - very lively and vivacious. I would recommend this film - it is very upbeat and entertaining."

"donwc1996","7","1","2","10 February 2009"," It's NOT The Sound of Music, That's for Sure!
","Call me silly, but The Sound of Music is still my favorite musical and the film by which I judge all musicals and Mama Mia sure comes up short. All I kept thinking during the movie was why Julie Andrews wasn't the female lead? Meryl Streep? I LOVE Meryl Streep, but not in Mama Mia! She is the miscast of the year in this role and she CANNOT sing! Nor can Pierce Bronsan or anyone else for that matter except the two young leads who are both knock-outs - both to look at and to listen to. Colin Firth, my very favorite male lead, was the only singer who moved me to tears and he can't sing either. I kept thinking why have they made a musical without singers? What am I missing? But there's so much about this film that annoyed me. First of all, the story is the least romantic I have ever come across. The idea that a young woman on the day of her wedding wants the three men her mother hooked up with and one of whom may be her father is not only silly, it's just plain neurotic, hardly the basis for a romantic story. Okay, so the location shooting was fabulous, but the actors paled in comparison, all of them looking terrible except for the two young leads who looked fantastic! Merly Streep especially looked positively gruesome. All I kept thinking was that the director must HATE Meryl Streep to have her photographed so poorly. But the men didn't look any better especially Pierce Bronsan. The choreography was incredible, no doubt about it, but there were way too many songs and entirely too much motion - everyone on Earth got into the act every time there was a song to be sung - people coming from every direction so that it looked like the entire world was dancing, which might not be such a bad idea, but NOT in a movie, especially when you're trying to follow what little there is of the story."
"mullaryn","7","1","2","16 January 2009"," Could be better, but not a total failure either
","I have read many reviews that completely despise this film and I think that that is unfair. This film wasn't great, and it had so much potential that was foolishly squandered, but it was quite nice all the same.<br/><br/>I have heard several people refer to it as a 'girly' piece, and I, for the most part, agree. There seems to be two main characters and their respective story lines: a mother worrying about her daughters wedding and about the three guests, all of whom might be the father (it's a bit hard to explain), and the daughter trying to find out about her father. The mother has two friends (rather well played) who help her out in these situations while engaging in casual fun of their own while staying on the mother's island.<br/><br/>The acting was a mix of great and disappointing. Meryl Streep, contrary to popular opinion, can sing quite well, and her performance of 'The winner takes it all' was quite emotional and apt, albeit slightly mistranslated. The daughter (played by the rather charming Amanda Seyfried) sang quite well and gave across at times the energy of an already active young woman right before her wedding, and her desperation as things go wrong when she is trying to find out who her father is. The singing was actually one of the better parts in the movie, but I think that Pierce Brosnan, while being a fairly good actor, needs singing lessons.<br/><br/>Brosnan's singing was the largest flop in this movie. Apart from that, many would say that the plot is cheesy, the ending lame, and that the entire plot is simply an excuse to sing. I would agree with that, but the only really misplaced song I saw was 'Money, money, money', which was placed out of nowhere and had nothing to do with the plot. The plot is rather cheesy, and the ending was, if not lame, then lacking, but I believe that the movie doesn't need a magnificent plot or a mind-blowing ending. And the ABBA songs were changed quite a lot, but I had no complaints to the changes that were made (although they left out my personal favorite 'One of us'). Oh well.<br/><br/>All in all, a rather nice movie to watch when you have spare time. This is what got me re-interested in ABBA songs. I give Mamma Mia... 7.1. That's a 7."

","Sophie (Seyfried) is about to get married and she wants to surprise her unmarried mother, Donna (Streep), by inviting three men who have courted her mother and one of which is Sophie's father.<br/><br/>The music wins this one as the cast performed ABBA music. I am such a fan of ABBA that even though the cast performed the music I heard only the real ABBA sing. Oh, the cast was okay and if you never heard ABBA music, you could immediately fall in love with it. But, once you hear the real ABBA perform the music, everything else pales no matter how old you grow. Yes, there must have been times when lip syncing was done due to the seaside nature of some shots, but still it was okay. I only heard ABBA perform. <br/><br/>The story was okay but if it weren't for the ABBA music it would have been an ""Oh Hum"" made for TV movie. And, hard to believe that Pierce Brosnan can carry a tune. He did good.<br/><br/>The director let the cast get away with overacting. Yes, a lot of the acting was over-the-top, but maybe they had so much fun with everything that the director let it go. ABBA music can have that effect so they are forgiven. ABBA music can make you go a little crazy. It is that good. For me, you can have your Beatles, Rolling Stones and any other group that you think is the best you have ever heard. Go listen to ABBA and get back to me. There was no group better. Well, Fleetwood Mac and the Bee Gees were pretty good too. Yes, I know there is no accounting for taste(or the lack of it) Got it out of your system? (I think so)<br/><br/>And, you know, I think this would have been a lot better if the music from the real ABBA was in here. The lip syncing would not have been noticed (too much). And, I would have been okay with that. <br/><br/>FYI: I did hear a rumor that ABBA was offered $1-Billion to perform again. They turned it down because they knew they could never, now, sound as good as they did back in the day. Talk about class.I only heard ABBA perform. <br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Sexual Content: Yes."

","Meryl Streep is overacting like shes on a theaterstage, not the silverscreen, there's a lot of forced joyfulness from most of the cast, its just not believable or immersive.<br/><br/>But Seyfried is totally beautiful and sings as well as she looks (even though you can hear it is syntethized at times). She, and the music itself, and Stellan Skarsgard as the adventoures guy lifts this movie. Colin Firth is charming as always, but unfortunately hidden away most of the movie, and Brosnan does a decent job but not better than that.<br/><br/>This all gives me a very uneven experience, sometimes i have this strong positive energy like from ""across the universe"" sometimes i cringe as when i go to my local theater. (and believe me, its crap). I mostly cringe whem Meryl Streep is on the screen. I don't care that she is maybe the most gifted female actress still active today, she does NOT do a good job in this movie, and if she hadnt been famous already, most of you would agree with me.<br/><br/>There is no chemistry between her and her friends, and her friends steal the show every time they are on screen all three of them. They are hilarious and I really enjoy their contributions. Even though I must say I didn't like the suspiciously sexist toy-boy song on the beach.

","It says it all in the title. I rated this movie a 8 because its flaws included being too long and dragging on, and lacking more dialog than songs. I don't go to too many musicals or musical-style movies, and this is why. Although, I shouldn't say it was all bad. It was tasteful, funny, and fun to watch. If I had to recommend my friend or family member to go see it, I'd have to see if they were the musical type first. But I would recommend it to little kids and people who love to go see stuff on Broadway and listen to music. Which is also another reason as to why I liked it, because I love music. So it was really fun because it kept you going and it was almost like it made you sing along."

","The movie version of Mama Mia is almost but not quite a disaster. Despite a cast that was mostly nearly a generation too old, couldn't sing, and couldn't dance, the film mostly succeeded. The brilliant Meryl Streep was a lot of fun and could sing better than adequately, despite her nearly 60 years. The lovely Amanda Seyfreid was young enough and could sing, too. Also Christine Baranski proved that she is as funny as ever and has a nice singing voice.<br/><br/>On to the not so good stuff. Although tasked with important songs, Pierce Brosnan was not up to that task. The guy just can't sing. Oddly, Colin Firth, who had much less to do musically was pretty good. The dancing was awful. It looked like what a group of friends at a bowling alley might try to do after 3 or 4 beers.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings, Mama Mia is a lot of fun and its wonderful old Abba songs were often moving, thanks to a strong screenplay. Seeing the movie made me regret than I didn't have a chance to see the 2001 Broadway production."
"DICK STEEL","10","1","2","12 September 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Mamma Mia!
","I grew up to the songs of Swedish group ABBA (yeah, I was born in the 70s, can?), and yes I'm fan enough to have bought their definitive collection CD and DVD years ago to add to my library, and have it all in my iPod so that I can listen to the evergreens that never fail to put a smile on my face, although some songs actually have really heartbreaking moments in them if you listen carefully.<br/><br/>Hollywood continues to plunder past musicals on stage and previously on screen, to come up with an updated version for celluloid, and it's actually no surprise that they roped in director Phyllida Lloyd, who directed the original Broadway play, to helm the cinematic version of Mamma Mia! which in itself is quite genius to have been able to design a narrative around the songs already published by the pop band. And the result of course is nothing less than a crowd pleaser, especially for a fan like myself.<br/><br/>I guess the trailers would already put in enough hints on what the storyline is about, that plays out like a Greek comedy with a bride to be Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) in wanting to know who her real father is, invited all the potentials from her mother Donna's (Meryl Streep) colorful free loving, hippie past, to attend her wedding with the ultimate aim of course to give her away during the ceremony. So the three of them - Bull Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan) and Harry Bright (Colin Firth) all turn up, leading to a comedy of errors, of reminiscence of a time gone by, of relationships turned sour, or what could have beens.<br/><br/>Playing out over 24 hours at a Greek island where Donna runs a small crumbling hotel, you can tell that everyone of the star studded cast had a field day on set, especially when hamming up their respective characters - you can't get enough of Donna's posse in Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) - and there are enough ABBA songs to go around either for individuals to showcase their singing prowess (or lack thereof!) or to come together as an ensemble group to just let their hair down and have a lot of fun. Some would have deemed Meryl Streep not being able to deliver, but I thought she did well enough, and Amanda Seyfried at certain angles bore some uncanny resemblance to add some believability as her daughter.<br/><br/>Pierce Brosnan on the other hand, you can tell was having a tough time trying to sound and sing convincingly. But that aside, I chuckled at plenty of moments when the hotel employees / Greek island inhabitants join in the chorus, and some infectious dance choreography when everyone chips in just makes this one heck of a pre-wedding celebrations.<br/><br/>And if you need some reaffirmation of why you need to watch a musical in the cinemas, look no further than Mamma Mia!. At first I frowned at the distributors for delaying its premiere here for so long, then now perhaps realized it was a shrewd move on their part (as always), probably to help enhance the cinema going experience. Prints after late August come with lyrics at the bottom of the screen, so yep, we get the Sing Along Edition over here. And boy, the hall I was in - I think I was the only (*ahem* inconsiderate) one initially lending my vocals, whistling and humming to each song - by the time the last few songs came around, EVERYONE was singing along, kickstarted by the very moving song that happened to be my favourite of them all.<br/><br/>So you know what to do, when you hit the cinemas for this. Lead and sing along, since the lyrics are there for all and sundry. And you'll get that fuzzy feeling when everyone else does the same thing. I heart Mamma Mia! and you'll be hard pressed not to too!"

I was not familiar with the play. I wasn't going to see it at all until this co-worker told me she had seen it three times and still didn't have enough. She said it just made her feel happy and good. I concur.<br/><br/>A young girl who lives in a romanticized island in Greece is about to tie the knot with a handsome but forgettable fellow. The one thing she feels lacking in heart is having her father give her away. She doesn't know her father. She lives with her mother, who runs a quaint hotel for vacationing guests. But now she has the solution: she found her Mother's diary and has it narrowed down to 3 candidates. Her plan is to invite all 3 estranged lovers to the wedding festivities. She believes that when she meets her father, she'll just know. It's a preposterous plan, but this movie works. It might not work for men, but it works for me.<br/><br/>Now Mom is confronted with THE ONE from her past. When they met, he had a fiancé, and he never returned.<br/><br/>Along the way, the characters sing ABBA songs with much glee. The setting is gorgeous. The island has a mysterious, romantic gleam. You cannot imagine living there. It is something out of a postcard, although it is supposedly rundown. The beauty of the hotel and the surrounding landscape makes you believe that anything can happen, even magic. I wanted to be there amongst them, enjoying the island sangrias. I can't emphasize enough how happy I felt when I left the theater. You will believe in love again."

So when I saw it on a recent visit to Europe, I decided to go and see it again back home in Japan, this time together with my wife. But accordingly to the release schedule, that's not gonna happen until late March 2009!!! If anyone should ever wonder why the number of cinema-goers in Japan is dwindling, they would not have to go far to find out. Japan regularly pops up near the end of the list of release dates of international releases, and it's beyond me why. This, however, is outrageous by any standards. People in 50 countries will have been able to enjoy the film - and the ABBA hype will probably have died down - by the time it finally comes to cinemas in Japan 7 months from now! It'll make more sense to get the DVD on a next visit abroad. Then we'll still be able to see it months sooner than we would in cinemas here, albeit on the small screen."

","The last movie I had seen was The Dark Knight. I thought it was a masterpiece but it turned me off from movies in theater for a while, because what movie could top that? It was pretty powerful to me. But than I heard those rave reviews for Mama Mia-which is very different movie; I'm not comparing the two at all! At least three people I know and respect in opinions of movies have seen this movie twice in theaters, and yes they are all woman but my dad went with me and LOVED it too. (and he's 60's years old) so it's a movie for everyone.<br/><br/>I wanted to see it because I remember my 14 year old self singing along to Mama Mia and Dancing Queen and as the movie progressed I remembered the lyrics and mouthed with them. I am still singing them in my head ""Mama Mia, here we go again. My, my how did we let you go?"" ""Dancing Queen, young and sweet and only sevevteennnn."" This is a film that never takes itself seriously. The supporting cast was hilarious and very talented. It had been one of the best audience reactions I've had in a long time. All around us people were shrieking with laughter and clapping at the end of the songs and of course with the end of the movie. You can't help but get into the movie when you have an audience like that.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed Meryle's work, and respect her great as an actress. But her voice blew me away! And I was shocked at how good Pierce Brosnan was too. As soon as I saw him I wanted him to sing and he did, more than once mind you! This is not a serious movie like the Dark Knight or other dramas. This is a feel good movie to see with your family and friends, if they like musicals. By the end of the movie I was wanting to sing and dance like they were on the screen and take a dive in that refreshing looking water around them.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the story. The music was great but so was the story. This was not only a great coming of age movie but a great movie for older woman about regrets and letting go and moving on from the past and looking into the future. A great mother daughter film, if you ask me. All ages will enjoy this one. I know my Grandmother will when she finally see it.<br/><br/>Go and experience it in the theater while you still can! If not, rent it as soon as it comes out. I'm going to buy it. And the soundtrack too. You won't regret seeing one of the best movies of the year. It's sure to win a couple of academy awards, for the music and costumes along. It is truly a refreshing summer treat!"

","Mama Mia! is really a film made exclusively for Abba fans, it lacks much depth, the songs work, but the film's plot ultimately fits in to the category of a loosely constructed plot around the music. There have been many other films to do a similar thing much better (Moulin Rouge, for instance). Mama Mia has a few great lines and some funny moments, but ultimately gets lost in it's own rediculousness. The film really felt like an extended youtube lip syncing video with ludicrous choreography.

"Blueghost","Null","1","2","11 August 2008"," ""Mamma Mia"", a dude's perspective on a chick-flick musical.
","Before I dig into this film, let me say this; I enjoyed it for what it was, and to this end I liked it.<br/><br/>Technically the stock was pushed and given a dousing in color saturation, which is helped by both sunny locations and some respectable lighting for the stage sequences. This gives the film an appropriate warm and inviting sensation that effectively marries both interior and exterior sequences. This is partially due to the effective use of green screen, which adds a kind of transitional imagery from the lush Greek exteriors to the brightly lit stage sets that represent the heart of the hotel where the film takes place.<br/><br/>I don't have too much to say about ABBA's music. I liked ABBA's music, and still do, but have never felt the urge nor need to buy any of the albums. I understand the music being used as a basis for a musical, but, like a lot of songs taken from popular music circles and culture, there is a retrofit feel to some of the numbers. I never got the sense that the songs were created for the situations, which is only natural because let's face it, they weren't. But at the same time things feel a bit constructed. Maybe if I saw the stage play my opinion would be different. I don't really know.<br/><br/>The other thing that was somewhat jarring was seeing Pierce Brosnan being dubbed during his singing sequences. Whether he sang and dubbed himself, or someone else dubbed him, I don't know. But either way it seemed unnatural. I know why, but will refrain from espousing on the reasons.<br/><br/>I'll say this, it was refreshing to see a musical on the big screen. After so many action films, sci-fi flicks, sex-comedies, and other popular genres, it felt like a relief to see something striving for cinematic originality in terms of bucking the movie making trend. I can't recall the last time I went to see a musical at the movies. Heck, I think the last time saw one was Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" back in 1969. ""Mama Mia""'s clearly not the only musical to hit the movie houses in the last 30 years, but the musical genre has been sparsely populated in the ensuing decades; ""Xanadu"", ""Grease"", ""Grease 2"", ""Newsies"", ""Popeye"", ""Pennies From Heaven"" ... and I guess you include ""The Guru"" or even the opening sequence of ""Indiana Jones and the Templre of Doom"" to a lesser extent. That verse the musical heyday of the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. In the era of yesteryear we arguably had too many (quite a few of which are laughable), but it can be so counter argued that we have too few today.<br/><br/>Even so, I'm not a tremendous fan of contemporary musicals, largely for the reasons Gene Kelley cited when he worked on ""Xanadu""; ""These people don't know how to shoot a musical."" (or words to that effect). And that's still true. Phyllida Lloyd comes closer than other contemporary efforts (save for Randal Kleiser's translation of ""Grease"" to the big screen), but her film seems more infatuated with the ladies' perspective of how to have fun than a good romantic tale. But this is probably more as a result of test screening by the studio than a genuine artistic bent.<br/><br/>Storywise there isn't a whole lot here. As Ebert commented the plot line is there more for propelling the musical numbers, and not so much meant to deliver a parable, which is what this movie really should have done. To this end it skirts the fringes of being sexist by nearly excluding and delegating the leading and supporting males to the realm of ""objects of affection"", though this was most likely done for marketing purposes.<br/><br/>All in all I found the film entertaining, but too far skewed to be genuinely universally appealing, but nor was I offended by its direction and focus. My personally opinion is that it's probably perfectly timed for a theatre going crowd, but it could stand to be a bit longer and ever so slightly meatier.<br/><br/>A good date film, if you're so inclined."

","Saw this in an older theater that is apparently frequented by seniors aged 60 and above - at least that's my impression based on the attendance when I was there. I was surprised at just how crowded the theater was given the movie's been out a few weeks now. I enjoy much of ABBA's music (a must for anyone seeing this film), and found the movie watchable and mildly amusing throughout, but while I sat there with a slight smile on my face, the older folks would break into raucous laughter regularly. The performances were enjoyable, though I would have liked to have seen someone like Hugh Jackman in Pierce Brosnan's role because I understand Mr. Jackman can actually sing (but I give Mr. Brosnan credit for expanding his boundaries, and he certainly wasn't terrible). The movie is also very colorful, so in general, it's a rather ""happy"" experience all around. Not a film I'll remember for long, but pleasant and relatively innocent, though I will warn that some themes and suggestive words/behaviors will likely offend the most conservative viewers."
"MaxBorg89","7","1","2","30 July 2008"," Meryl Streep is the dancing queen!
","Like most musicals, Mamma Mia! does nothing to hide its blatantly artificial nature: it's a collection of intermittently enjoyable songs by the Swedish pop group ABBA and deliberately ridiculous coreographies, all woven together by a thin yet somehow plausible ""plot"" and carried by a committed cast. It's silliness for its own sake, and most of the time it actually works.<br/><br/>The story unfolds on a Greek island where a young girl, Sophie (the lovely Amanda Seyfried), is about to marry her beloved Sky (Dominic Cooper), her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) and her ""aunts"" (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) being in charge of making everything perfect. Only Sophie's father is missing, and for a very good reason: not even Donna knows who he is! Nevertheless, Sophie manages to retrieve her mother's diary and finds three potential dads thanks to it: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Harry Bright (Colin Firth) and Bill Andersson (Stellan Skarsgård). Not knowing which one to invite, she makes sure all three of them show up. And as the titular song goes, here we go again...<br/><br/>The plot is, of course, utterly ludicrous, its sole function being to act as an introduction for the musical numbers (this has to do with the fact that the original stage version was created around the pre-existing songs). The singing and dancing is the movie's sole reason to exist, and there it has both its strength and its undoing: unlike, say, Chicago, it manages to retain its wild energy during the music-free ""interludes"", but unlike Chicago it also suffers from having set-ups of varying interest. Basically, it boils down to this: whenever Streep, who sings like an angel, or Brosnan, in his best non-Bond role to date, are involved, there is nothing better; otherwise, it's pretty much hit and miss (with more hisses than hits, unfortunately).<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't a movie people will remember with the same fondness as they do Moulin Rouge or The Sound of Music, but its delightful silliness, largely spot-on humor and exhilarating performances are enough to keep everyone entertained for a couple of hours."

","I saw Mamma Mia last Thursday night with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law and we all enjoyed it. The theater was about 2/3 full at 7:30 p.m. on a week night. Everyone was laughing, but I didn't see anyone dancing in the aisles. I did laugh out loud every time Pierce Brosnan sang, but hey, he tried hard. The scenery, costumes, jokes, and music were fun even if the plot was a bit weak. My biggest question is ""Where was the luggage?"" The women who arrived by boat brought nothing with them but their purses. The men, however, were shown pulling their flight bags on wheels across the dock. Now, have you EVER known a woman who went to a Greek island for a wedding with NO luggage? Make sure you stay for the credits because there are some wonderful ""extra"" musical scenes at the end. I will probably buy the DVD of the movie when it's available. Definitely one I would watch again and again just because it's so much fun."
"dmasursky","7","1","2","29 July 2008"," Entertaining but not perfect
","I liked this movie - there were some great moments. But there were also some excruciating ones. Watching Meryl Streep as Donna writhe around in cutoff overalls during the title number just didn't work for me, though when she sang ""The Winner Takes It All,"" I had chills. It's a trade-off, I suppose.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had was that the lead actors are all WAY too old - the daughter is 20 years old, so the mom, Donna, and her three suitors (super sexy at any age Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, and the always watchable Colin Firth) should be what, 40 or 45 at the oldest? Meryl looks fabulous, but she's closer to 60, and the men are all in their 50s - that means their characters went through these youthful indiscretions and rebellions in their late 30s! I have to admit, I found that totally distracting. And why is Pierce Brosnan, who is as Irish as they come, cast as the American? Is there a complete dearth of sexy American men who could play this part? As for the singing, the actress playing the daughter, Amanda Seyfried (probably best known for Mean Girls), has a lovely strong voice, and Meryl is also quite good, but none of the men sing all that well, and they really shouldn't have carried whole musical numbers alone.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Christine Baranski is riveting - her version of ""Does Your Mamma Know"" was one of the high points of the movie. And it was fun seeing Dominic Cooper, who played Willoughby in the latest version of Sense and Sensibility, in a very different (though still adorable) role. And the biggest bonus (SPOILER ALERT) - the truly passionate kiss between Donna (Meryl Streep) and Sam (Pierce Bronson) at the end, instead of some bullshit peck. You so rarely see passion between older characters, so that was refreshing to say the least.<br/><br/>I never saw the stage show, and while musicals are not generally my cup of tea, I was surprised at how well the ABBA songs were fit into the story (some better than others, of course). I mostly remember their dance hits, but several of their lesser known ballads are truly beautiful. The movie gives these all-too-familiar songs a new depth and character, so that listening to them now, they have all new meaning.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw the movie and I've been humming the songs ever since, but it probably could have been better."

","Yes, these are the same old ""Swedish-exchange-student-trying-to-rhyme-in-good-English"" songs. And yes, the plot is the same, old, and admittedly goofy series of romantic encounters.<br/><br/>But, I would submit that the sentiments of the film and the songs somehow ring true and universal. And, the creaky plot is more believable that those of many Academy Award winners, in my opinion. So, this film ends up being a triumphant paradox, full of good and bad, just like life.<br/><br/>Who cannot empathize with the young girl, about to be married, who does not know who her real father is? Who cannot relate with the young dancing queen, only 17, who ""loses control"" and has sexual relations with many males in the era of ""free love?"" But, ""free love"" had undesirable consequences to the next generation, as we have come to see. And paradoxically, hope remains that true love will triumph, after all these years of pain and maturation, due to the child of one of these unions, who is ""slipping through the fingers"" of her parents, who hate to see their little girl mature and grow up and be married. This plot thus takes on a deeper meaning than the surface goofiness, flirtations, whimsicality, and goings-on. Goofy waters sometimes run deep? And, this production is more creative than the Broadway show, in many ways. In particular, I enjoyed the creativity of the dance number of the scuba divers on the pier. I confess that I have never seen a troupe of scuba diver dancers dance so brilliantly. And, Meryl Streep continues to amaze with her almost limitless versatility. Also, Pierce Brosnan is properly dramatic in his speaking roles, although some of his singing needs improvement. So, will the handsome and endearing Mr. Brosnan practice a little more and participate in a forthcoming ""Mamma Mia Returns?"" Please?"

","From the beginning this movie was a blast. It was just out of control fun. There's really no other way to explain it. The crowd I was with was a good one too. There was lots of laughter and even some dancing.<br/><br/>The cast was great. Occasionally, I was a little thrown by who was singing. Thinking, ""wait, what Pierce Brosnan singing...weird,"" but I got used to it and just rolled with it.<br/><br/>Is it cheesy? Insanely so, but honestly, I loved every second of cheese. Hopefully, no one really expects something serious from a plot based on ABBA songs. :) Movies are supposed to entertain and I can't remember the last time I was just plain entertained for every second of a movie. In the end, I really just wanted everyone in the theatre to dance out together to ""Dancing Queen."" Admittedly, I'm coming from a musical/Broadway lover perspective, which is not everyone. However, Mamma Mia! happens to be one that I have not caught on stage yet so I can't comment on comparison."

Sam(Pierce Brosnan) was a surprisingly good singer, in my opinion, and I felt that Bill(Stellan) and Harry(Collin Firth) had a great time with this movie.

","The movie was enjoyable.<br/><br/>There was a trade-off not banking on the music but rather bankable actors, a mistake in my opinion. I saw the Broadway production and traveling show and was thrilled with the music, the movie (musical) was passable. <br/><br/>At the risk of having rocks thrown at me, Merrill Streep was very good but superb in the role, no. Don't get me wrong the movie was not bad and was good, however not something I would see again.<br/><br/>I have the soundtrack from the Broadway production, but thought the film not as good.<br/><br/>The above was intended to be realistic. The movie was a good night out, glad I saw it but the casting a conservative approach rather than focus on talent. Chicago used that formula but the vocal talent was much better."

","The first hour of this movie was okay. Nothing great, but not bad. It was watchable. Some of the moments were funny. And Amanda Seyfried (sorry if I spelled that wrong) was surprisingly good at playing the lead roll.<br/><br/>But past that, things start to go down hill. Particularly during and after the wedding scene where it seems like everything is just flying out of the blue. It doesn't make sense! Where did these feelings come from? What is going on? And then the movie keeps going...and going, and going. It's like they tried to fit as many songs into the last 20 minutes as they possibly could, and it wasn't the good songs either. The movie goes flat and so did my patience with it.<br/><br/>I can't imagine seeing this on stage.

","Greetings again from the darkness. In the interest of full disclosure, I was not fortunate enough to have seen the Broadway version and I know the stage aficionados are not necessarily pleased with the screen version. Judging it strictly as a film musical, I will say it had me laughing out loud, tapping my toes, singing along (in my head) and most importantly ... fully engaged in the story. This is pure entertainment that most adults will really get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>The best place to begin is with the incomparable Meryl Streep. Besides being the best actor and singer in the film, she just knows when to push it and when to let the others have their moment. She is a marvel to behold.<br/><br/>The story is simple (and inherently funny) ... 20 yr old daughter reads mom's diary and discovers she has 3 possible fathers and, without her mother's knowledge, invites all 3 to her wedding in hopes of solving the mystery. The three forced-amigos are all well played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard (very much against his type!). None can sing very well, though Brosnan gives it his all ... twice!.<br/><br/>To balance the influx of men, we are also treated to Streep's two best friends in brilliant performances by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Sure, you can accuse both of over-acting, by I contend the entertainment value is even higher thanks to their willingness to push the envelope.<br/><br/>Streep's daughter is played with extreme bright eyes by Amanda Seyfried, who is just terrific whether singing on the beach or scheming against her unknowing mom. Seyfried's fiancé is played by up and comer Dominic Cooper.<br/><br/>Of course, the ABBA music dominates ... it is after all a full fledged MUSICAL. Don't miss Bjorn Ulraeus as the beach piano player! The sing-along songs are just a blast in this setting. If you go in expecting to have fun, you too will find yourself dancing in your seats and humming ""Take A Chance on Me"", ""Dancing Queen"" or about 6 others."
"automatic4thepeople2004","8","1","2","20 July 2008"," The best worst movie of 2008?
","There is no reason on God's green earth why Mamma Mia should work. The camera work is below par, The editing is clumsy at best and it is mostly embarrassingly camp. Yet somehow Mamma Mia completely transcends it's inherent awfulness into becoming one of the year's most surprisingly entertaining movies. You could attribute it's appeal to the music of ABBA, Which today still holds up as some of the greatest pop songs of all time, But the cast also make the movie what it is. Meryl Streep is shamefully melodramatic, Amanda Seyfried could probably give Wall-E a run for his money in the adorable and cute department and Pierce Brosnan does what does best, Which is being suave and debonair as one of Sophie's possible dads. (Look out for him, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth showing an admirable lack of ego in the final end credits sing-a-long)Despite the movie's all too apparent flaws, Mammia Mia still displays a refreshing lack of self importance that made such modern musicals such as Chicago and Dreamgirls such a chore for this particular reviewer to watch. It obviously doesn't give a hoot for the Oscars. Mamma Mia could well be the first most self aware musical in recent history. It knows how absurd and silly it is and just runs with it. If you want a serious, Well crafted and challenging piece of cinema go watch The Dark Knight (I would actually recommend Christopher Nolan's latest over this anyday)But if you want a utterly insignificant but admittedly entertaining and sometimes very funny 120 minutes, Take a chance on Mamma Mia."

Suffice it to say that for sheer escapism and fun, this film is easily the most entertaining movie I've seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>I can't imagine the film being more perfectly cast than it is. Meryl Streep never ceases to amaze me. Is there no end to this woman's talent? Everyone in the film gives the illusion (if illusion it is) of having the time of their life.

This is a really enjoyable movie that I think a broad spectrum of people would enjoy, even those who normally don't care for musicals or plays.

The cinematography was stunning, the Greek Isles could not be portrayed more Romantically! Amanda Seyfried is the epitome of Sophie, showing great depth and tremendous sex appeal, as does her counterpart Domenic Cooper (Sky).

","Critics have panned this movie pretty badly, but who cares??? I read one critic complain about lack of character development and a cohesive plot. Plot??? Who cares! It's an ABBA musical! That's what you go for. It wasn't made to be an Oscar winning masterpiece. It was made to be fun and on that, it delivers - very well. If you are in the mood for a fun movie with zero violence, low profanity (if any), then this is it. Be warned, there are a few sexual innuendos that might not be suitable for pre-teens, but would fly over the heads of under 8's or so. <br/><br/>Things I liked: * It was just downright fun. It was cheesy as can be, and you just have to go with it, and then you'll have a blast. * The music was great, of course, assuming you like ABBA. * Meryl Streep can flat out sing - I was extremely impressed by her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All"". * All the actors played the over the top campy cheesy style very very well. * Shot in Greece - scenery alone is worth the movie admission. * No violence and I didn't notice any profanity (not that I'm against it - I plan to see Batman next, but it was a refreshing change of pace). * You laugh a lot. Sometimes at the story, which most people will know, sometimes at the movie itself and it's high degree of camp. * The end - it's done exactly like the musical - and it's hilarious. * The entire theater was singing at the end and there was a huge applause - when was that last time you saw that in a movie theater???<br/><br/>What I didn't like: * There is one scene with Meryl Streep driving where the backdrop is clearly a movie - the steering wheel turns don't match the direction of the car so well. * Pierce Brosnan's solos. He was very good in the movie as an actor, and my wife enjoyed the beefcake, but he has very limited singing skills. The director should have worked past this by having him backed up by other men which could have compensated for his lack of skills. * You have to let yourself go. It's totally unbelievable. It's totally campy, and if you can't let yourself go, you won't like it. If you aren't an ABBA fan or didn't enjoy the musical on stage if you saw it, this movie is clearly not for you.<br/><br/>As a closing, I was really impressed with how much fun the actors seemed to be having. I think being on the production crew for that movie would have been a blast. You could tell that the making of the movie was pure fun. They were in an exotic location and it looked like most of them had been drinking all day and night before the shoots, hanging out, and having a good time. That certainly added to its charm."

","To enjoy this film, it helps to leave some expectations at the door. One is that ""ABBA sound."" This isn't it. That sound was created in a studio with a mixing board, etc. Some of that sound was in the stage play and it worked there because the majority of the audience is far enough from the stage to really think that gorgeous sound is coming from just the cast on stage. But when the camera is right in the actor's face, and that face is several stories high, the music must come from the singer.<br/><br/>In that regard, the movie is very good because of that authenticity. Put it this way, you and I would never have a chance to be part of the ABBA sound. But we do have a chance, if we leave our inhibitions behind, to live life to the fullest and just break into song from time to time. The movie works very well at that because of the high level of skill from the actors, the sets and setting and the bright light of the cinematography. (Was Thomas Kinkade ass't DP on this?!) Also suspend your beliefs on monogamous marriage. It's just a movie, church folk...and otherwise it's a feast for the senses. Yes, a little too much estrogen, but mid-life women need their moments. Think of it as Under The Grecian Sun (including the bed jumping scene). Guys, you might want to just download some iTunes of ABBA's hits if you can't be man enough to go with your wife to see this.<br/><br/>And that giant sucking sound you hear is the escalating costs of destination weddings! Who will settle for the little church on the corner (or worse, the Justice of the Peace), after seeing the beauty of the Creation on this location.<br/><br/>Thank you Benny, Bjorn, Frida and Agnetha for bringing this music to my generation.

But after 15 minutes I was convinced: This wasn't any air headed, dumb musical for a middle aged pop-music-loving audience - this was a super cute, funny and joy-able musical for everyone. My boyfriend, which i dragged to the theater because he claimed he hated Abba, laughed out loud and so did I and the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep was a beautiful performer, her whole appearance was powerful (as always) and her singing skills was pretty awesome. Amanda Seyfried was sweet and sang really good! James Bond's, Mr. Darcy's and... well, Stellan Skarsgård's singing skills wasn't in the same league as the leading ladies, but they were entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie you can take your mum, your date or just yourself to and come out happy, and with a new perspective on ABBA's songs."

","This movie isn't terrible, just not that good. <br/><br/>I've never seen this before, but maybe it's happened. A movie musical where all the actors are singing 30 year old pop songs. This is a good idea in that Abba had some truly great songs. This means that the movie musical has mostly great songs in it as opposed to most musicals that have only one or two good songs in them. On the negative side I can't help but compare the singing in the movie to the actual singing by Abba. The singing actors come out a really bad 2nd. The writers of this movie where able to come up with a movie musical doing little or no music writing. If you were to take out the songs I think that this movie would have very little going for it.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to see how most adult males could really enjoy this movie. All of the central characters are female and a light romantic comedy. I find some chick flicks enjoyable, but not this one.<br/><br/>My girlfriend bought the sound track CD to this, was disappointed, then bought the Best of Abba CD by Abba.

","I mainly watched this movie because loads of people were talking about it, and I do like a good number of the songs from ABBA, it became the highest-grossing movie of the 2000s (Avatar came out 2009, made it all its money in 2010), and I can see why now, based on the stage musical. Basically on the Greek island of Kalokairi, young Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) is to be married to boyfriend Sky (Dominic Cooper), and she wants her father at the wedding. She sends invitation letters to the three potential men, without telling her mother Donna (Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep), all three are mentioned in her mother's diary. Architect Sam Carmichael (Razzie winning Pierce Brosnan), banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth) and sailor and travel writer Bill Anderson (Pirates of the Caribbean's Stellan Skarsgård) don't know each other, but all had a relationship with Donna around the same time. Sophie dreams of being given away by her father at her wedding and believes that after she spends time with them she will know which is her father. Donna owns a villa and runs it as an unsuccessful hotel, she is ecstatic to be reunited with her former Dynamos bandmates, Rosie Mulligan (Julie Walters) and Tanya Chesham-Leigh (The Grinch's Christine Baranski). The three men arrive, and Sophie smuggles them into their room, she does not reveal one of them is her father, but she does reveal she is the one that sent the invites. Sophie begs them to hide in order to surprise Donna, but she spies them and is dumbfounded seeing all three of her former lovers. Donna confides in Tanya and Rosie that she has no idea which of them is father to Sophie, while Sophie finds them on Bill's yacht, and they tell stories of Donna's carefree youth. Sophie loses her nerve to tell Sky of her plot when he is abducted for his bachelor party, so Sophie has her bachelorette party, where Donna, Tanya, and Rosie perform. When Sam, Bill and Harry arrive, Sophie decide to talk each of them alone, she assumes Bill is her father and is happy to have him give her away at the wedding, but then Sam and Harry each pull her aside to tell her as her father they will give her away, she is overwhelmed and faints. While Bill and Harry try to tell each other what they have learned, and are interrupted by Rosie, Donna confronts Sophie, believing she wants to stop the wedding, she says all she wants is to avoid the same mistakes her mother made. Sam confronts Donna, concerned about Sophie marrying so young, in their confrontation they realise they still have feelings for each other. While Tanya flirts with Pepper (Philip Michael), Sky's best man, Sophie confesses to Sky and asks for his help, he reacts angrily to her deception. Donna helps Sophie dress for the wedding, they reconcile, Donna reminisces about her daughter's childhood, and she admits that her mother disowned her when she became pregnant, Sophie asks her mother to give her away. As the guests gather in the chapel, Sam intercepts Donna, who reveals the pain she felt over losing him, as when they were together he was engaged to another woman. Sophie and Donna walk down the aisle, Donna tells her daughter that any of Sam, Bill and Harry could be her father, while Sam reveals that he never married the woman he was engaged to, he returned to find Donna with another man. Sam, Bill and Harry decide they do not want their paternity confirmed, agreeing to be one-third of a father to Sophie. Sophie tells Sky they should postpone their wedding so that they can travel the world. Sam proposes to Donna, she accepts, and they get married, at the reception everyone rejoices, Rosie makes a play for Bill, Sam and Donna are happy together, and Sophie and Sky sail away. Also starring ABBA's Benny Andersson as Piano Player on Boat and ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus as Greek God. Featuring the ABBA hits ""I Have A Dream"", ""Money, Money, Money"", ""Mamma Mia"", ""Chiquitita"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Our Last Summer"", ""Lay All Your Love on Me"", ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

"KellyKA","4","2","8","26 July 2008"," Way too old!
","I took my 11-year-old daughter , a fan of the musical and Broadway soundtrack, to see Mamma Mia last week and we were both very disappointed in this movie. With the exception of Colin Firth, all of the principal actors were about 15 years too old for their roles. Ms. Streep looked every bit of her nearly 60 years, which is not a problem by itself but was very jarring in this film because Donna should be in her 40s. Sophie, Donna's daughter, says she's 20 years old. How much sympathy is the audience supposed to feel for a woman who bore a child out of wedlock and was disowned by her family in her late 30s? Sandra Bullock and Cheryl Hines would have been better choices for the roles of Donna and Tanya. I don't know if they can sing but they're the right age. Stars in this age range may not want to admit, or be typecast as, being old enough to be the parents of a 20-year-old in a culture where all women between the ages of 16 and 60 are expected to look 25. But my daughter and I found that our enjoyment of this film greatly suffered because of the terrible casting. We'll go back to the musical when the touring company brings it to town again but I can't recommend the movie."

"HotToastyRag","9","1","3","4 May 2020"," Fun, funny, and flirty
","The wildly popular stage success Mamma Mia! finally took its place on the big screen ten years after Broadway showcased ABBA's most beloved songs. Even if you don't like ABBA-like my mom-you're going to eventually rent this movie. You'll probably end up owning it, like my mom does. It's just so cute! Yes, most of the songs don't have anything to do with the surrounding scenes and are just an excuse to prance around and sing another ABBA tune, but it's fun and funny and flirty. There are a few songs that are very well placed, towards the end, and those moments where the sing-a-long movie turns into a real musical are worth the wait.<br/><br/>If you've seen Postcards from the Edge, you know Meryl Streep can sing the pants off a country song. But she has other styles, too! Taking the leading role, she gets to belt out, ""The Winner Takes It All,"" as well as softly croon, ""Slipping Through My Fingers."" And, since she's Meryl Streep, she doesn't play this as a silly musical comedy. She finds the human aspect in the struggling single mother and shows the audience that the primary motivation of her life has been her daughter. Yes, she prances around during the random ""Dancing Queen"" number, but whenever she's anywhere near her daughter, she's kissing and hugging and wiping away sentimental tears. The point of the movie is not one giant excuse to sing disco songs. It's a daughter's attempt to find herself by meeting her father, unaware that she has such a strong bond with her mother, the rest doesn't really matter. If the mother character doesn't act like a mother, the story doesn't work. No one can play Mother like Meryl Streep can, and when she gazes at her daughter, memories of her childhood are so vivid, the audience can practically see them.<br/><br/>Not many people know this, because the original 1968 screenplay doesn't get any credit, but Mamma Mia! is a musical version of the adorable Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell. I like the original story infinitely better, so if you like the idea of a single mother with three potential fathers to her child, check out Gina Lollobrigida's comedy.<br/><br/>Feel free to laugh at me, but every time I watch Mamma Mia!, I bawl my eyes out. I have two favorite songs in the movie, and one of them was unfortunately cut from the final print. I always make sure to watch ""The Name of the Game"" included in the deleted scenes of my DVD, because it's a wonderfully fitting moment between Amanda Seyfried and one of her potential fathers, Stellan Skarsgard. ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" was not cut from the film, and it never fails to make me cry. As Amanda gets ready for her wedding, Meryl sings a touching tribute to her childhood. Amanda cuts her leg while shaving, and Meryl kisses it better with a Band-Aid. She's still a little girl who needs her mother, and getting married won't ever change that.<br/><br/>Filmed on location in Greece, the sparkling blue waters, beautiful beaches and cliffs will make you want to plan your next vacation. This movie is a lot of fun, and although it's not as good as its predecessor, it's a great choice when you want to relax and watch a bunch of actors and actresses having a blast. It's so obvious that Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, and Colin Firth enjoy every bit of screen time singing, and dancing, and Amanda Seyfried has just as much fun with her two bridesmaids as Meryl Streep has with her two girlfriends, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Whether you watch it for the first or hundredth time, with your mom, your girlfriends, or by yourself, you know you're in for a great evening when you pop in Mamma Mia!<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Meryl Streep goes up on the roof during ""Mamma Mia,"" there's a huge upside-down camera swirl. There's another swirl at the beginning of ""Chiquitita"". And during ""Voulez-Vous"" there are both fluid camera movements and flashing lights that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""
"LeonardKniffel","9","1","3","4 May 2020"," Pop Tunes Make Movie Magic
","A lot of people love to hate this musical, which is based on the totally singable, danceable music of the 1970s Swedish group Abba. Meryl Streep, perhaps the most celebrated actress of her generation, when cast in this film had already showed the world that she could do just about anything-except maybe sing. So here she comes and not only can she sing, she becomes the life force that runs through this movie. The whole key to a performance like this is to look like you're having fun, but it takes a lot of planning to be spontaneous, and there's nothing about this seemingly effortless romp that isn't well choreographed and staged. You have to see this movie to understand how a series of good-natured pop tunes-""Dancing Queen,"" ""Take a Chance on Me,"" ""The Winner Takes It All,"" ""Voulez Vous""--can be turned into movie magic. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013"

","I like ABBA-- a blast from my past, singable pop classics. I love musicals. When I heard they were making a musical around ABBA songs, I questioned it. Usually music is written around a plot, not vice-versa. This is certainly a weak point. but this movie isn't about plot. It's a celebration of ABBA, a girlfriend movie, and I really enjoyed, despite approaching skeptical. The main reason for this is the cast. With an all-star cast, led my MERYL STREEP! leads an all-star cast. Amanda Seyfried is perfect as her daughter. The supporting cast, all recognizable, are also having a blast.

","I am a HUGE fan of musicals and musical movies. I love musical movies like Hairspray, Rent, The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, Oklahoma, Sweeney Todd, etc. There hasn't been one musical movie I haven't liked until now. I've watched this movie twice and tried to be fair, but I honestly can't. Amanda Seyfried's high pitched speaking and singing voice made me cringe. Pierce Bronson was horrible and should have only acted. Half of the cast could NOT sing though I give them credit for trying. The story was just so all over the place and it was just basically a film to see how many ABBA songs we can fit that have no purpose to the plot. It was song after song after song that you have no time to gain any depth or know what was going on. Those 3 stars are for Meryl Streep because she is the ONLY enjoyable person in this movie. Her singing is fantastic and the only songs I liked were ""The Dancing Queen"" & ""The Winner Takes It All."" I tried to like this movie, but I simply couldn't."

"pyrocitor","7","1","3","22 February 2009"," Does not waste its emotion, but delivers an ideal cocktail of bouncy exuberance and self-effacing humour
","For the sake of making things abundantly clear right from the start, those whom generally harbour a dislike or intolerance of the movie musical genre, be forewarned: Mamma Mia! is not the film for you. It is not a film which will change anyone's mind regarding the genre by refuting general criticisms of musicals offering only shallow, superficial spectacle at the expense of content, potentially irritating bouncy exuberance and credibility straining anti-realism. Nor does it intend to be such a film, as Mamma Mia!, rather than attempting to overcome such potential concerns, embraces and exemplifies them with a cheery charm, making otherwise vacuous source material brim with such incessant energy that one cannot help but either be consumed by it or discount it completely.<br/><br/>Yet the fact that Mamma Mia! is content as a film to settle for supremely bouncy entertainment rather than striving for further complexity does not indicate the film remains within a blissfully ignorant bubble of its own froth. Director Phyllida Lloyd is shrewd enough to inject her film with a slyly self-referential sense of humour, never afraid to poke fun at itself or the inherent silliness of the musical genre it is highly aware it fully subscribes to. It would even be an overstatement to say the film offers no deeper thematic complexity whatsoever, as a faintly detectable air of quietly introspective sadness circles around Streep's character and her reflections on aging and past party-filled lifestyle. But for the most part, the film's aim is abundantly clear - to be as silly, upbeat and flat out entertaining as possible, cranking out elaborate dance numbers to the continually thumping beat of absurdly catchy ABBA songs and proving so infectious that even the most skeptical viewers who manage to see the film through will find it exceedingly difficult to avoid singing and dancing along. While the film can hardly be considered a cinematic masterpiece, taking it at face value for all it aimed to be, it can be considered no less than a jovial success. <br/><br/>The majority of the film's merits come from its talented cast, throwing themselves into the fray with unashamed abandon and the sense of fun they appear to be having is undeniably contagious. Meryl Streep alone makes the film worth viewing, belting out songs and performing acrobatic dance feats with the energy, skill and spunk of a woman half her age. But apart from mere musical interlude plaudits, Streep fills the screen with the star presence only she can truly deliver, contributing a wisdom etched sense of dignity and utter plausibility, making her character's embracing of her sillier, more fun loving past all the more triumphantly genuine. Amanda Seyfield also sparkles with appropriate energy and starry eyed enthusiasm as Streep's daughter, aiming to discover which of her mother's three past beaus was her birth father. As said potential parents, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and (delightfully unorthodox piece of casting) Stellen Skarsgard all have a great time embarrassing themselves, making up for their woeful lack of singing capabilities with witty, measured and charismatic performances. Similarly, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are a riot as Streep's fun loving friends, and Dominic Cooper delivers strong vocals and impressively earnest acting talent as Seyfield's free thinking fiancé. <br/><br/>While few films will divide audiences so definitively, Mamma Mia! is commendable for never striving to be anything more than an infectiously bouncy and cheerily entertaining expanse of time, with Lloyd's willingness to poke fun at her own film adding a welcome tinge of upbeat irony. The film is single-minded enough in its purpose that those who will not be able to stand it should know well in advance, and those well versed in such fare should be swept away, having nothing less than a supremely fun time. <br/><br/>-7/10"

"newsgroupmonkey","4","1","3","23 October 2008"," Some Musicals work on the screen and some don't
","Before anyone condemns me for not knowing my stuff, I've been watching a lot of musicals-come-films for many years. Whilst some work, some do not. I am not about open more cans of worms, but in my opinion, Hairspray and Grease work as a film. Chicago and Evita should have stayed on the stage.<br/><br/>As fantastic a work this is, it should also be in the latter group.<br/><br/>Firstly, to start off, the music is fantastic. As a child of the 70s and 80s, I can directly relate to the music. The musical itself is one of the best around (get yourself a ticket if you can!). This will sell like hotcakes around the world.<br/><br/>This film will make you laugh. Wildly. Unfortunately, often not for the best reasons. Discussing this with someone else at work, they agreed adding ""I enjoyed the film immensely because it was so poor"" Unfortunately, this is where the praise ends.<br/><br/>The main problems with this film are as follows: 1. The casting is horrendous. Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan clearly cannot sing. Imagine how popular Seven Brides would have been without an excellent Howard Keel? Or the Sound of Music if Christopher Plummer couldn't sing? Julie Walters (usually fab) is not right for her part. Meryl Streep just about holds her part. Amanda Seyfried is ace.<br/><br/>2. The filming and production is poor. Just poor. Amanda's nipple pops out in the scene where she is being prepared for the wedding. IMO, that's just bad.<br/><br/>3. Some of the storyline has been over-cheesed. Not necessary in a film. This film is just cheesy.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a remake of this done, only with slightly lesser-known actors and more money spent on Production. I mean, we have all these well-known pop stars (who can actually sing) working hard in the West End and Broadway. They're big enough names. Why not use them?"

But like most men at some point in they're life, they will fall for a girl who they like SO much that they will even risk they're sanity to make her happy. And that is how i ended up in a theater watching Mamma Mia. Last time she did this was for the movie Step up, and i nearly lost it(i mean i flipped out on the inside but managed to not bring it to the surface). But this time as soon as the movie started and the singing began, i got some sort of deja vu feeling of something left in me from my childhood, something like me being a child and my mom and sister are singing to Abba and i'm just happy because everyone else is radiating contagious happiness. And that is pretty much how i felt through the whole movie. I'm not going to talk about actors or scenes(just the feel). OK, when i got back to the car and sat down my girlfriend asked me what i thought, stupid i said. I was watching you she said.You were laughing and smiling the whole time. Dammit, she was right.

"kookyclown","9","1","3","1 September 2008"," Don't think about it, just ENJOY it !
","Mamma Mia is a bit of an odd film really. I still cannot work out whether the casting went horribly wrong or was pure genius. At first glance, Meryl Streep in the lead role in a musical, kind of mentally jars and yet, to her credit, she plays it with obvious enthusiasm. Her co star Christine Baranski has some great lines and at least one very good routine whereas Julie Walters feels a little bit sidelined and possibly trying too hard to compensate though her dance routine on the tables to ""Take a Chance"" is well worth it. Seyfried in the lead role is perfectly cast with a fresh faced innocence and a surprisingly good voice. She is also stunningly beautiful ! Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan and Stellan Skarsgard seem to have wandered in from another film and are such an unlikely trio of ex boyfriends. And really, the ONLY on screen chemistry that works is between Seyfried and Streep who actually DO look like daughter and mother. The rest of the cast barely get any time to develop their roles beyond superficial and seem to be there to make up the numbers and look pretty. The dance numbers involving the largest numbers of people come across almost as an afterthought. The plot timeline doesn't hold up to scrutiny - whoever dreamed up the scenario of the 3 ex boyfriends as ex hippy, ex punk and whatever, is clearly confused as to when these music eras took place in reality. And, why doesn't the film explore what Streep saw in each of her ex boyfriends - BUT... you know what ?, the songs of ABBA are so strong and performed well enough with gusto and commitment that it is very easy to suspend all your critical faculties and just ENJOY it !! I came out of the cinema buzzing with joy, having even shed a tear in a couple of scenes. ""Slipping through my fingers"" is guaranteed to bring a lump to the throat of any parents (young or old) and Meryl's version of ""The Winner takes it all"" is breathtaking. Hang on during the credits too to see the trio perform a couple more numbers in true karaoke style and also, a stunning voice (Seyfried) and piano version of ""Thank you for the music"". A little scene of the Greek Gods during the credits features at least one, and possibly both, of the two Bjorns from ABBA (it was over so quick) in a little cameo appearance. I for one will definitely buy the soundtrack and will be dusting off my ABBA collection. ABBA rules OK !"

","This is a musical, This a musical with all the songs of ABBA. Clearly this in not some deep drama with deep meaning. If you expect that you need to see another movie.

Most of the actors sing far better than I was expected, the only one who was truly bad was Pierce Bronson and he made up for it by being the perfect looking man. Meryl Streep and actor playing Sophie had great voices.<br/><br/>Another thing I like is that this film has clearly progressive values, Instead of the young leads ending up married, they give it time and she realize having a dad and a traditional family aren't needed to be happy. I loved all the sub plots and all the humour that was in this movie.<br/><br/>This is sure to be repeat watching."

","I went to see ""Mamma Mia""last night after keeping it on my list of must-see movies. Although the music/dancing scenes were great and very professional and polished the movie itself was a great disappointment to me. I love Meryl Streep. In all of her movies she is a wonderful actress going back to ""Sophie's Choice"" and more recently ""The Devil Wears Prada"",but I just couldn't connect with HER singing and dancing,whether it was really her voice or lip syncing,and even though she was very energetic and did a great acting job,it seemed so incongruous.<br/><br/>And what about Pierce Bronsman? He just seemed ridiculous and could not sing for beans! I also felt there was so much overacting! I did see this movie on TV recently in a Swedish or other Scandanavian version and it was so natural.The performances were not overdone and you felt it flowed so spontaneously. This movie was so loud and so exaggerated that it lost it's effectiveness for me.I would rather have seen it on DVD, and not waste my money.There was no empathy at all with the main characters and no character development so it left me feeling empty even with great music for the most part."

","Okay. It's not the 1936 Show Boat, it's not Footlight Parade, it's not Yankee Doodle Dandy, it's not Stormy Weather, it's not Carmen Jones, it's not Oklahoma, it's not West Side Story, it's not Zorba the Greek, it's not Oliver!, it's not Grease, it's not Chicago, it's not Idlewild - all great Hollywood movie musicals - but after a rocky start, with a story that at first seems hokey to the extreme and brings the movie to the brink of cinematic oblivion, it recovers to become a good, if not great, movie. How does that happen? Almost miraculously, Meryl Streep's performance, which at first is incredibly stale and flat, undergoes a remarkable transformation and becomes great! It is as if someone interceded with her in the middle of the movie, injected her with a large dose of spirit, got her to turn around her performance and saved the movie from taking a cinematic dive. Along with Christine Baranski, Ms. Streep sings, dances, laughs, romps with gusto, and carries the movie. She becomes the star and makes this movie a Meryl Streep vehicle where she gives one of her stronger performances which transcends the corny story, improbable setting, and an ensemble of male actors who are almost laughingly miscast (Pierce Brosnan in a musical? C'mon! This is a movie that needed Anthony Quinn, Howard Keel and Rosanno Brazzi). After struggling to establish itself, the movie becomes an entertaining cinematic experience with catchy songs, snappy dancing, and dynamic performances by the female leads, led by the great, fabulous, beautiful and talented Meryl Streep. <br/><br/>This movie is proof that making a good musical is a daunting task and one best not done if it's not done right. Just like Les Grossman interceding with the director in Tropic Thunder, someone in the front office of this movie must have pulled the director aside and told her ""Look, turn this movie around or this production is history!"" Otherwise, how did this movie make such a dramatic recovery?<br/><br/>The first section of this movie is so bad that it causes one to wonder: why me? The mushy, wishy-washy dialog, the contrived conflicts, the unimpressive Greek scenery (why not set this movie in Long Island?), and dumb characters makes this movie a classic in how not to begin a movie. But a movie can survive a bad start just as long as it has a strong finish, and this movie finishes strong."

I have only ever seen Meryl Streep in the devil wears prada so i had no idea what to expect but she was perfect. and Amana seyfried as the daughter was wonderful. And the 3 possible dads well they were charming! okay pierce may not have the best voice but he made it is own. Colin is gorgeous so that was enough for me! But Julie Walters was definitely the best! she was hilarious! Especially in her song take a chance on me i laughed the whole way through This film had me in hysterics and also tears(slipping through my fingers) I've seen this film twice now and cant wait to see it again...it will definitely get a lot more people to the west end show<br/><br/>Although it was brilliant i was disappointed by the cinema audience! I read other reviews where they said people were dancing in the aisles and i really wanted that to happen where i was...i was just sitting in my seat wanting to jump around and sing but no one else was...ill have to wait till the DVD comes out!!<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","First off, I am a Broadway musical lover. I can't think of one that I disliked. Secondly, I have not seen the stage production of this show.<br/><br/>Having said those two things, I was disappointed in this film version of the musical. After 1/2 hour, I was ready to go home and would have if I had been by myself. Thankfully, the theater was only charging $5 that day so I didn't feel like I wasted my money, only my time. I think they should have re-written some of the script so that there was more dialog and not just moving the story along with one song after another.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing many of my favorite screen & stage stars doing this, but frankly, they need to re-consider doing musical theater. For most of them, it's just not their cup of tea.<br/><br/>I did think Seyfried and Cooper were excellent though--very cute!

Her voice isn't bad either. I love the way she is letting her age show. No plastic for her as far as we could tell. And, her beauty radiates and is ageless. She gives me hope that somehow we can return to graceful naturalness. <br/><br/>Speaking of voices, Pierce Brosnan doesn't have one and I am so glad they didn't voice over him. I liked his ""au natural'"" and when his shirt was riped off -- his voice didn't matter anymore. It's rare that we walk out of a movie talking to everyone and laughing too. But the audience enjoyed this one so much that we all couldn't stop talking about it. We need more positive happy movies like this!!"
"Kristinartist79","9","1","3","9 August 2008"," Great movie
","I loved the movie a lot; the music was great and the acting was great. Although Street acted well in the movie, I did not think she was a great choice. She is a very beautiful actress; however, based on the storyline, I thought they would have wanted a younger mother. Watching the movie and play, I kind of pictured the mother as being young and carefree when she had her child, not an older mother. But she does look great for a woman of almost 60 and her and Seyfried look a lot alike, which could have been a factor in her having the part. But I think maybe Christina Applegate would have been better for the role, as she has played on Broadway and sings well. Street was not the best singer (not bad though). Perhaps Nicole Kidman could have been good for the role; she is sings well and she's great actress; she looks young enough to be a younger mother. Seyfried was great for her role; it was nice seeing her where she played a big role, unlike Meangirls, where she was funny, but she just played a ditsy girl who did not get a lot of lines. She is a beautiful and talented actress! I liked the old ladies who were friends with Street; they were funny! It was nice to see Firth in another movie, as he is talented. All in all, it was a great movie."

","I had seen the stage production and was dancing in the aisles so did not expect too much in the movie production. I had grown up with ABBA music. This movie was so much fun. Streep's rendition of ""Winner Takes It All"" blew me away. Oscar worthy. After the movie, little kids were saying (as we - and we are in our 60's - were saying) they wanted the DVD as soon as it came out. I have to say the cast seemed to be having as much fun filming this as we were watching it. Loved seeing after the film (and before the credits ran) the mini-concert. And yes, we did want to see some more which thankfully they gave us - we didn't want it to end. We plan on seeing it again on the big screen, which I don't think I have ever done in my whole life."

","For the first time ever when I have been to a movie people didn't just stand up and walk out when the movie ended and the after text came up. They sat there, not sure the movie was over. I myself didn't want it to be over. This movie is one of a kind. I have never seen anything like it. I have never laughed so much watching a movie...EVER. But it's not one of the usual comedies, I wouldn't call it a comedy it is....It is Mamma Mia. It is genius. My first impression was ""what the heck is this?"" but then it was just wonderful. I wanna see it again!! Im gonna buy it when it gets out on DVD. I'm in love with this movie. All the actors were great. And the music... Im Swedish so it's kinda the law that I like ABBA but I haven't really listen to them much and now I appreciate them more then ever. <br/><br/>The whole way home from the cinema I was kinda recovering from all the emotions.

"steeped","6","1","3","5 August 2008"," Should of stayed on stage.
","I went to see the stage performance of Mama Mia! a few years back and loved it. The music brings me back and the story was touching, and I left the theater in high spirits.<br/><br/>The movie on the other hand left me with a totally different feeling. The singing was very forced while they tried to fit the music in with the story. Some times I felt the song fit well into the scene, and other times I wondered what the production crew was thinking.<br/><br/>The movie started promptly, as the very cute Amanda Seyfried places three invitations to her three possible fathers in the mailbox. From this one scene, I felt the hair on my arms stand up. This whole movie was so cliché and cheesy, and definitely meant for the female crowd. This upset me because although the play had the exact same plot, I very much enjoyed it and it seemed like it was meant for both genders.<br/><br/>Now Pierce Brosnan. I just don't know where to start with him. Three women sitting behind me were screaming in my ear every time he appeared on screen, and every minute I hear ""OMG he is sooo cute!"" And that may be all he is. I don't think I have seen a person who was ever more miss-casted. He can't sing - or he can but his vocals did not fit the song, and it was very noticeable that his voice was digitally enhanced and fixed up with all the cool technology gadgets they have. I never thought I would ever see James Bong sing.<br/><br/>Why do I give this movie a 6 then? Meryl Streep was absolutely amazing. No, she wasn't pretty in this movie. Her hair was a mess the whole time. I don't even think they put make-up on her, and that is what I liked. Her voice is amazing and her acting was incredible (like always), but most of all, she was a mess! She put so much character into Donna, that it made me feel that this movie was just rotating around her.<br/><br/>In the end credits, they are all singing on a stage. WHY? If I want to see them dancing on stage then I would of went to see the actual play with was much better! Some things are better left on stage.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the film work was beautiful. I loved the cinematography. If you appreciate that kind of stuff then you may appreciate the work put into this movie.<br/><br/>6/10"
"sddavis63","9","1","3","4 August 2008"," Fun And Full Of Energy With Great ABBA Songs
","I've never seen the original stageplay on which this movie is based and so I can't compare the two, but I can't imagine that the movie is any less entertaining than the play. It's fun, full of energy and fast-paced and features some excellent performances. Tops among those must be the performance of Meryl Streep as Donna, a single mom whose wild summer 20 years ago produced a daughter (Sophie, played by Amanda Seyfried) without any knowledge of which one of three possible men is the father. Sophie, about to be married, invites all three to the wedding, assuming she'll know right off who her dad is, but the result is chaos. Streep is a great actress, but in this movie she combined acting with both singing and dancing , and did so brilliantly. Also offering strong performances were Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as the other members of the fictional group the three belonged to. Streep, Baranski and Walters (I would say in that order of descending importance to the movie) overshadowed the three possible dads, played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard.) Their performances were fine, but they couldn't match the women in singing and dancing. Brosnan had most of the singing parts among the men and I just didn't think he captured the essence of the music. This, of course, is not unlike ABBA - whose music is the hub around which the story revolves. The songs featuring Anni-Frid and Agnetha as the lead singers were always better, in my opinion, than those which had Benny and Bjorn as the leads.<br/><br/>If there's a weakness to the story in this movie, it's the very fact that the story is constructed around a series of ABBA songs that were not written to be used as the basis for a script. The result, I thought, was that the story was a bit rough and awkward in places, but the fun and energy of the movie - and the collection of great ABBA songs (of course, that's a selling point only if you're a fan of ABBA) more than make up for the minor weaknesses that pop up. Also worth watching are some hilarious performances by the cast (not part of the story, but apparently just the cast having some fun) as the closing credits are about to begin, complete with the over the top ABBA wardrobe from the '70's. A very enjoyable movie all the way through. 9/10"

","I am an unashamed lover of musicals. Always have been and probably always will be, so I was more than willing to enjoy this piece of classic Friday Night Fluff, mediocre reviews notwithstanding. It's unpretentious and frivolous, modestly entertaining and whilst not brilliant, it's not as bad as many people have suggested.<br/><br/>Musicals come in all shapes and forms, from the dramatic and dark (Sweeney Todd) to the Sixties Rock variety (Hair) to the utterly brilliant (West Side Story) and all points in between. The best musicals don't date, which is why Oklahoma sounds better than Hair these days. Mamma Mia doesn't readily fit into any usual musical category because the story was written long after the songs first saw the light of day, and it was written to fit (and it's not always a perfect fit) around existing songs. I'm old enough to have been an Abba fan when they were at their height, although at the time I doubt I would have admitted it publicly. Very uncool.. I haven't seen the stage show.<br/><br/>Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is very young, pretty and lives with her Mum Donna (Meryl Streep) on a beautiful Greek island. She is about to marry Sky (Dominic Cooper) and arguably anyone who can think seriously about marrying a guy called Sky is obviously far too young to get married. But she wants the works, white wedding, romantic church, all her friends and, most of all, she wants to be given away by her father. But that's the problem, she doesn't know who her father is, although perusal of her mother's pilfered diary, has narrowed the field down to 3 potential studs, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgård). She invites them all to the island, thinking foolishly that as soon as she sets eyes on him, she will instinctively recognize her father, but she doesn't, and the movie follows the trials and tribulations of the following day or two, against the beautiful backdrop of a Greek island. Donna is less than happy to see the 3 old boyfriends, but very happy to be reunited with Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski), her old pals from the days when she sang in a girl group. As this is a musical, people launch into song and dance in ridiculous ways and places, and we, the audience, get to revisit most of Abba's old hits.<br/><br/>Many, many others have already commented on Pierce Brosnan's absence of vocal talent so I won't labour the point, except to say that it really doesn't detract much from the fun, and I think he's quite well cast overall  Brosnan can carry off almost anything these days. Meryl Streep is simply superb. Is there anything this woman can't do? At the age when most female actors are complaining that there are no good roles for women, Streep appears to be having the most fun of her career. She paid her dues with the harrowing roles in her youth (Sophie's Choice, Kramer v Kramer etc), now she has reinvented herself in comedy drama (The Devil Wears Prada) and a musical. I adore her! Whatever you may think overall of Mamma Mia, I challenge anyone not to be gobsmacked by Streep's performance of The Winner Takes It All just before the wedding scene. It's a showstopper. I was also quite surprised to be genuinely moved by Slipping Through My Fingers, as sung pre-wedding by mother and daughter Streep and Seyfried (possibly it resonated because I have a daughter of exactly that age.) And as a middle aged woman, how can I fail to love the sight of Christine Baranski dancing with twenty or so twenty something males on the beach, while belting out Does Your Mother Know? at the top of her lungs! No it won't win any Oscars, but I make no apologies for having loved it! <br/><br/>One thing that struck both my husband and me (yes he came too and hummed along through most of it) was that the younger members of the cast were simply acted off the screen by the old codgers. Seyfried was perhaps a little weak as Sophie, sweet but rather vapid, although she does bear a striking resemblance to Streep, so made a convincing daughter. Cooper was basically a prop for her cuteness. The rest of the younger cast members I have forgotten entirely, although they danced energetically enough. The middle-agers stole the show, which makes a pleasant change.<br/><br/>Not a great movie, but more than adequate. My only real question is what happened to Knowing Me Knowing You, my favorite Abba song? No - on reflection it's probably best that I recall it as my favorite Abba song, rather than listen to Pierce Brosnan strangle it!"

","The film covers a woman's wedding at her mother's modest resort on a Greek island (the movie has nothing to do with Italy, as the title suggests. ""Mamma Mia"" is merely an Abba song) She's never known her father so she read a journal written by her mother and figured her father was one of three men. So, she invited all three men in the hope of ultimately being given away by her father. (a DNA test would have been conclusive, but it was never considered.<br/><br/>Presumably the film is to represent the present (2008, but there is no indication by cars, etc.) But her three possible fathers are each pictured with long hair. If that was the case, they lived in the sixties and are now over sixty years old, but none of them has gray hair or baldness or looks that age.<br/><br/>Numerous Abba songs occurred throughout the film and each presentation was an irritating interruption.

","Set on a gorgeous Greek island this is the tale of a mother Donna ( Meryl Streep ) who has raised her daughter Sophie ( Amanda Seyfried) alone.

There are 3 possible fathers, Bill ( Stellan Skarsgaard) Harry ( Colin Firth) and Sam ( Pierce Brosnan) Sophie invites the 3 possible fathers and the day before she is to be married they arrive! The ( still great ) ABBA songs are fairly natural woven into the very thin storyline. It is such a nice experience to see a great actress like Meryl Streep in such a role. And she really can sing. There is nothing this woman can't do. If you are into really deep movies and hate ABBA, this is not for you. If you are into a very light fun-filled and absolutely entertaining movie, this is the one for you! The ladies do a better job at singing than the men.

I don't remember going to see a musical and getting goosebumps during most of the numbers (yes, even when Pierce Brosnan, whose voice seemed better the second time I saw the film is singing) not only for the songs, but the performances, the choreography, the setting and just the way it was all put together. Julie Walters and Meryl Streep are just fantastic, but the rest of the cast aren't far behind them.

","Abba meets Shakespeare in this movie. The shifts of the scenes, the structure, the approach - everything is in the style of Shakespearian comedy!<br/><br/>This movie is not laugh-out-loud as much as make-you-cringe. Initially you are flabbergasted from these acclaimed actors breaking into happy 70's songs and dancing in outrageous outfits. But then you realize that that i s the point. It's taking the embarrassment you felt as a child when your parents dared dance or give speeches only doubled because you are not embarrassed for yourself but for Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth etc.! <br/><br/>But they, the actors, have obviously been having a hoot making this film and dare to take the pi** out of themselves. It works! (Colin Firth even, quite subtly, makes another wet shirt scene in way that make you cringe! How 'bout that!)<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie has been pushed forward wrong. It's not feel-good as much as toe-curling-awkward. We know the feeling of sadness in movies. And horror, happiness even anger - this one is new! It's embarrassing to the point of petrification."
"FilmPolice","10","1","3","1 August 2008"," My review (some of my comments may be considered spoilers)
","I never got to see the play when it was in town, but I'm glad the director (Phyllida Lloyd) of the original Broadway production also directed the movie version...makes me feel like the project hasn't lost anything in the stage-to-film translation. It definitely is a ""feel good"" movie, as most early reviews said it was... and how could it not be? It's set on a beautiful Greek island, it has a fun story, and it gives us established actors who show us their light and sometimes silly side... and they're good sports enough to do their own singing, even though most of them are not seasoned vocalists. But the musical numbers (all ABBA songs, mostly hits with a few lesser known selections) work, because they help to move the story along, and, except for the ballads, they are so energetic and fun that you'll practically dance in your seat to the familiar tunes. If there's one number that encapsulates the ""feel good"" spirit of this movie, it's ""Dancing Queen"", a scene which starts in a hotel room in which two friends (Christine Baranski, Julie Walters) are trying to cheer up a third (Meryl Streep), and ends with the three friends -- and seemingly every female inhabitant of the island -- singing and dancing toward the water. Some of my other favorite upbeat numbers are ""Lay All Your Love On Me"" in which the young couple who are about to get married (Amanda Seyfried, Dominic Cooper) playfully sing to each other on a secluded beach; ""Does Your Mother Know"", performed by Baranski, as she discourages the advances of a young man who won't take no for an answer; and ""Money Money Money"", in which Streep's character imagines life ""in the rich man's world"". ""SOS"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"" are not exactly upbeat, but are worked nicely into the story, sung by people who are trying to figure out how they can deal with feelings they have for each other, feelings they thought they had put to rest 20 years earlier. If this movie doesn't remind you how much you enjoyed ABBA music, nothing will!"

What about the men? Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård do okay, but Pierce Brosnan definitely needs additional singing lessons  let's be honest, he sings awful (I have never heard such a dreadful edition of ""S.O.S"" in my entire life), he even manages to be worse than Richard Gere in ""Chicago"". Instead he plays his character sublime as always. So do Firth and Skarsgård.<br/><br/>Let's face it, ""Mamma Mia!"" is a blast. So full of energy, sunshine, smiling and laughs that you can't do anything than enjoy it. So park your brain in the wardrobe and find your inner dancing queen.

The casting was perfect--I cannot honestly imagine anyone being replaceable. True, Pierce Brosnan cannot sing, but his looks make up for that. It was nice to see Meryl Streep, after countless Oscar nods and noms for her more serious roles, finally get to just have fun. She has an amazing voice, which she has exhibited in earlier films, but surprisingly this is her first musical. Throughout the entire film, Meryl seems like a giddy schoolgirl; you feel that she didn't really ""work"" at all. Amanda Seyfried, who cracked me up in Mean Girls, shows herself more than capable of taking the lead. All due respect to this star-studded cast, the show belonged to Christine Baranksi. She stole the show as the serial-bride Tanya.

But after seeing the movie and belatedly reading the critics' reviews, I have to agree with those that say the film is disappointing. On the positive side, the scenery is stunning and the songs great fun. Sophie is engaging. But somehow it is more depressing than uplifting to see 50-somethings reving up the hormones and revisiting their elusive dreams of happiness. A youthful quest for family stability slips away. Watching the cast have ""fun"" was more like being a sober guest at a bacchanalian festival. From the morning-after perspective, our aging seekers-after-love have had 20 years to find it, and is anybody happy? . . . But then, there is still hope."

","I love ABBA. I'm a huge fan, having grown up listening to them with my parents. So that automatically makes Mamma Mia a must-see for me. I loved the stage play, it was fabulous. So I guess maybe I went into the movie with expectations that were too high, because I was let down...a little bit. I mean it was a lot of fun, the scenery was gorgeous, but I think they definitely could've got better singers. Amanda Seyfried has a lovely voice, hers was definitely the best in my opinion, and Meryl's was probably the next best I think, but the others left something to be desired. And the Choreography!!! wow. I'm sorry I didn't think it was very good at all. It was a bit, for lack of a better description, all-over-the-place. Overall, it's a feel-good time waster but in my opinion the stage show was definitely better, and anyone who loved the show will probably be a little disappointed."

","Oh what a feel good movie! For anyone who loved ABBA music, this will be so enjoyable that, like me, you're going to want to see it again. How refreshing to watch 3 older actresses have such meaty parts - singing and dancing all over the screen. And who cares that Pierce Brownan hasn't the world's best voice? It was perfect for this movie and his character...which I may add is excellently played. The casting is about as perfect as it could get and frankly, I wouldn't change a single thing in this show. You will leave the theater in an upbeat mood and, like it or not, the ABBA music will be stuck, right there in your head, to be hummed, sung, or even given a little self-conscious dance to (when you think nobody is looking) Gotta love this movie! Thank goodness they are back to making fun movies again. And this surely is one!"
"dtothehammy93","9","1","3","22 July 2008"," Funnest movie of the summer!
","I have seen the Mamma Mia show on Broadway and I loved it. However, I think that the movie was much better! I think that the arrangements of the songs were really cool and the scenery was SOO beautiful! Now I want to go to Greece even more!!! The whole cast was great except for Pierce Brosnan, who can't sing for his life. Amanda Seyfried was the best Sophie I have ever seen and she lit up the screen! Even when things started to go bad (like when Brosnan went on screen), Seyfried cheered me up and made the movie so fun! This movie proves that Meryl Streep is like a goddess and she can do anything--sing really good, dance really good, act really good, etc. She was AMAZING!!! However, there were just some times that I didn't really see a close mother-daughter relationship between Donna and Sophie. I also didn't like how Streep was dancing like a maniac when she was singing Mamma Mia. Christine Baranski and Julie Walters were AMAZING as well and HILARIOUS in every scene they were in! So I guess that Seyfried stole the show, and Baranski and Walters came in second (before Streep). And then we get to the fathers... As I said, Pierce Brosnan cannot sing and should not have been cast. Stellan Skarsgaard was really funny and perfectly cast! Colin Firth was also funny as the gay guy. Another thing I did not like about this movie was that the songs were really rushed into. However, I LOVED this movie and it is so much fun!!! A must see!"

"imthebest_rt","7","1","3","21 July 2008"," It's kind of fun which holly wood generally doesn't offers...
","Being used to the Indian movies makes you a fan of 'song & dance routine' in movies. So a musical is never surprising for us. In fact movies without nice song & dance may seem strange to many of us. For me it has been disappointing mostly, when it comes to Hollywood musicals, especially Chicago which was terrible or even Moulin Rouge. Why the hell they even speak dialogues by singing them, that's stupid (like singing & dancing around trees with changing clothes & all other ridiculous stuff is so sensible & smart, but we are used to it). Somehow the Hollywood musical doesn't seem to work much to me (The Enchanted and Music & Lyrics were nice though) but this was a clear exception.<br/><br/>The movie looks fresh and interesting, the performances are subtle and keeps you hooked having fun while watching. That's what you expect from a musical. The storyline is well known, (hopefully... it was not well known to me though) a girl searching for her real father out of all 3 men her mom has dated earlier. She plans her marriage and invites all 3 men to figure out who is it. And the story goes through twists & turns and lots of SONGS, coming to a happy ending (sounds like bollywood).<br/><br/>I haven't seen the Broadway show but this film is definitely captivating enough to hold the audience. It was interesting to see Mr Ex James Bond singing and dancing on musical tunes. Others looked good as well. Just one suggestion, if you enjoy the movie then don't leave theater immediately after it ends, there is a nice song and dance routine with the end credits (ABBA songs 'Dancing queen' & 'Waterloo'), so ENJOY the Hollywood's bollywoodization!!!<br/><br/>(Read my blog as well... http://iambetterthanthebest.blogspot.com/)"
"jemps918","8","1","3","21 July 2008"," Thankfully funny!
","The promise of seeing Pierce Brosnan in less than debonair digs got me over the icky sensation that I was about to watch a musical. That and finally putting to rest my dad's nonstop haranguing over how hilarious Mamma Mia: The Movie is.<br/><br/>Soon-to-be-married Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in Corsica with her hippie mom Donna (Meryl Streep). She's never met her father, and so when she stumbles upon Donna's diary and discovers her three possible dads (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård), she invites them to her wedding. They all arrive unaware of her designs; rather, they are drawn by fond memories of their relationships with Donna. Hit songs by the '70s Swedish group ABBA provide both the soundtrack and the storyline.<br/><br/>Streep is a surprise with her emotionally charged singing and sprightly steps, especially in bittersweet sequence The Winner Takes It All. Her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) were very able sidekicks and provided most of the laughs. Seyfried was unimpressive at first but either she's the sort of beauty that grows on you or her make-up and wardrobe just kept getting better as the movie progressed. Her character was infectiously optimistic and confidently carefree that it's difficult not to share in her excitement. The talented Dominic Cooper (History Boys) plays Sophie's fiancé, Sky; he stands out despite the tiny role. The rest of the cast were silly and ridiculous, just as tacky as it all should be.<br/><br/>Hearing Brosnan burst into song was v. awkward (God is fair!) but he was perfect for the role of the dashingly handsome architect Sam. Firth is adorable as the head-banging rocker turned staid banker Harry Bright, while Skarsgård was delightfully unpretentious.<br/><br/>The many production numbers were painful to watch but giving in to the kitsch will alleviate the pain. Mamma Mia! will definitely be appreciated by baby boomers."

","Of the choices available this weekend I desperately wanted to see something that would be fun. I cast my vote for this with hopeful expectations based mainly on my impressions from the trailers.<br/><br/>I have to say that the result was I loved this film. I found myself smiling a lot and was very pleasantly serenaded by a number of nearby female voices in the theater singing along with the film; in itself a completely unique experience for me. Of the tens of thousands of films I've seen this spontaneously expressed joy was a first.<br/><br/>I liked the sets and scenery, not spectacular by any means but pleasant. There was one scene that was very beautiful shot in Skopelos, Greece having to do with ... well, you'll just have to see for yourselves. The costumes and makeup were also very complimentary to the film, the makeup being surprisingly sparse but effective. The young female lead, Amanda Seyfried, was stunningly effective in the role of Sophie and seemed to radiate youthful beauty and exuberance at every turn. It was a real pleasure to watch her on screen. The other leads were perhaps the oddest collection of casting I've seen for a musical since Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin in Paint Your Wagon. Pierce Brosnan had the furthest to reach but acquitted himself admirably, giving the right note to the character still pining for Meryl Streep. Stellan Skarsgård, usually in a far more macho environ, was a surprisingly good addition and so was the splendid Julie Walters who stole a lot of scenery when she was in front of the camera. She was fabulous. Colin Firth gave a surprisingly good turn as one of the fathers-elect but he's usually great in whatever he does. Streep was wonderful as usual, making me like the character with ease. But the memorable standout was still Seyfried. Whether she was singing, dancing or just radiating wholesome beauty, she was worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>I suppose one should mention the music but that is anti-climactic considering it's all derived from the incredibly popular work from ABBA. It gave few unreachable challenges to the cast but that was perhaps what enabled such unique casting for a musical.<br/><br/>I can recommend this film unreservedly. It was a lot of fun."
"vertigogirl21","10","1","3","21 July 2008"," Perfect performances - a must see!
","Having read so many unfavourable reviews hammering Mamma Mia! I had some secret fears that any of those might turn out to be relevant when I see the movie myself. I was wrong. This film - whatever is said about the direction - is amazing, but not only as a fresh summer ""let's-laugh-clap-sing-dance-andhavefun""-type piece. Although it's meant to be funny - and it really IS -, the dramatic moments - most of which the movie owes to Meryl Streep - are breathtaking, and around their culmination point in ""The Winner Takes It All"" this movie is everything but only a light summer dessert.<br/><br/>It is the most risky scenes that are perfectly managed by the actors and saved from becoming sentimental or cheesy. Although it is highly comical, the drama totally works as well when it comes to it. Furthermore, the music is fantastic, not only because it is all ABBA songs, but because the competence and energy they are performed with provide them with an atmosphere you cannot escape. Meryl Streep DOES GIVE a professional musical performance, she used to train to be an opera singer so it is a serious understatement to say she would not qualify as a professional singer. She is simply amazing, especially in ""The Winner Takes It All"", as she brings all her acting abilities to it as well and the whole scene becomes a dramatic monologue that glues you to your seat. It is just perfect.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and - of course - Julie Walters all contribute a great deal to the fascinating outcome. I can only recommend it."
"potterbride","7","1","3","21 July 2008"," Feel good movie of the summer
","This summer there have been a lot of really good movies, but I had yet too see one feel good movie, that is until I saw Mamma Mia!<br/><br/>I'll admit, I wasn't really excited about seeing this film, I choose it because I thought my mother would like it. And I was right she did like it and so did I. The singing and dancing was marvelous, the way the songs matched the mood and forwarded the story of the film was great.<br/><br/>There were a couple of times were I was tempted to sing-a-long to the tunes, if a musical makes me do that, in a theater no less, then mission accomplished.<br/><br/>I loved Meryl Streep in this film, but then again she's always wonderful. Amanda Seyfried breaks out of the high school persona she's been known for playing in films such as Mean Girls, she is beautiful, and literally lights up the screen, apart from her looks and acting, I must mention she has an incredible voice, she was made for musicals.<br/><br/>Other great performances were those of Christine Baranski as Tanya, a plastic surgery loving cougar; and the always delightful Julie Walters as Rosie, an unmarried woman who just likes to have fun.<br/><br/>Also Pierce Brosnan, Dominic Cooper, Stellan Skarsgård, and Colin Firth give entertaining performances, but they are out shined by the ladies, who are the ones that really dominate this film.<br/><br/>I must also mention that the sets were great, and the location was gorgeous. I must give kudos to Phyllida Lloyd for directing this entertaining and fun piece of film.<br/><br/>It's not the best film of the summer, but it's definitely worth while. If you like Meryl Streep, Abba, and Greece then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>In the end I give the film a 7/10 stars."
"Michael Fargo","8","1","3","21 July 2008"," Take a chance
","Let me get a few things out of the way: Generally, I don't like musicals, I seriously never liked ABBA (seriously), you couldn't have dragged me to the stage play, and I'd crawl on my knees anywhere to see Meryl Streep....<br/><br/>That aside, I found this a nice surprise. While it's a questionable goal to put Abba songs in some kind of context(they never had a context even when they were first released), there's a plot that isn't jammed to fit the songs (a la ""Across the Universe""), and some genuine talent--and fun--is on display.<br/><br/>The setting steals the show. You could turn the sound off and still be rewarded with gorgeous cinematography of no less than the Greek Isles. Ann Roth's costumes fit right in to the setting and the musical numbers are staged without seeming to take us out of the action. Twyla Tharp first succeeded with this kind of thing in the film of ""Hair,"" and it's pleasant to see these people not try to knock us out with extravagant choreography.<br/><br/>As well, the performances are very winning. I'll skip raving about Streep since she can do no wrong in my opinion (she IS Aphrodite). Colin Firth is game for what could be a weak role, and Amanda Seyfried rivals the scenery here, carrying the movie with her acting and singing.She's just lovely.<br/><br/>Pierce Brosnan doesn't belong in the cast. It would be interesting to know how--and why--he's here. I would have preferred his singing be dubbed, but when he's not singing, he's always easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>I almost missed going to see this, but I wanted something to shake off the dark of ""The Dark KNight."" This did it. And just when am I moving to Greece? Soon, I hope."

","I was in Skopelos a week after filming ended and the whole island was a buzz of Mamma Mia. So, I couldn't wait to see the movie. I saw it and enjoyed it. I think the actors were great; it takes a certain level of confidence to do something different or outside the norm and all the actors went above and beyond their professionalism. The music brought back memories when I was in college and they still are good songs. I think the writers did a great job of tying the songs/lyrics with the scenes, and the Greek island backdrop added to the entertainment. I took the movie for what it was--entertainment, and a chance to get away for 108 minutes. I highly recommend the movie to everyone."
"tamstrat","8","1","3","21 July 2008"," Fun movie but better on stage
","I am a huge fan of Abba (and have been since the 70's!) so I highly anticipated this film. I have to say I enjoyed it very much but after having seen the show on Broadway twice, this isn't as good in my opinion as the live shows. The energy that feeds off the crowd at the live show is amazing and it just wasn't there as much watching it on film. However, the actors did a good job with the songs and the Greek scenery was amazing. As others have stated, Pierce Brosnan was the weakest of all the actors singing, but he gave it a good old college try, and he is very engaging and handsome as usual. Meryl Streep looks great and did a fine job with the singing. And Julie Walters is a hoot as one of Donna's friends who arrive for the nuptials. I would recommend the movie but if you ever get a chance to see the show live it is much, much better."

Meryl-from the Black Lagoon once showed talent in her film choices (Ironweed, Manhattan, The Deer Hunter), as of the last two decades she continually surfs on her ""name recognition"" and not much in the ""talent"" department. H'wood is prone to give flak to Faye Dunaway and the like for becoming caricatures of past film roles, but study Meryl-Cruella de Ville's role choices and she wins hands down the first place award (her favorite ""word"") for the poster-child opening of rapidly fading, talent-less actresses who plays a variation of ""monster"" and nothing else.""<br/><br/>I now humbly beg forgiveness to Ms. Streep and her fans.

Just watching it and enjoying the singing and fun is what it was made for, and that's clearly what was happening during filming. Amanda Seyfried is amazing, as is Meryl, Julie Walters, Christine Baranski, Stellan, and the rest. The soundtrack as well captures the emotions just as good as, and in several cases, better, than the originals from ABBA. Standouts are Christine Baranski's ""Does Your Mother Know"" and Julie Walters/Stellan Skarsgard's ""Take A Chance on Me"", as well as anything from Meryl or Amanda. Pierce's ""When All is Said and Done"" is surprisingly great, and grows on me more every time I hear it! <br/><br/>It is a great movie!

","I hated this movie from the first scene. As a trio of young women, lead by Amanda Seyfried's remarkably stupid character, giggled and sang, I felt like I was being bludgeoned by stupid sticks, or smothered in pillows made of idiocy. I should have stopped watching immediately, but like a car accident, I just had to get a closer look.<br/><br/>After further establishing its remarkably moronic plot (a scheme as dumb as that in The Parent Trap; Seyfried's stupidity would make more sense were she 12 years old), the movie introduces a second trio of giggly women, only this time middle-aged, who also run and jump and romp and make funny faces.<br/><br/>There are a lot of issues with this movie, from being a musical beset by a casting process where singing ability was irrelevant (it seems purely accidental that Christine Baranski and Seyfried have decent voices) to having a terrible story, but I think this might have worked, or at least been tolerable, if not for the terrible, terrible direction. While I'm sure the goal was to create something bubbly and fun, the constant running and jumping and dancing and face-making feels frenetic and often borders on hysteria. It is like being seated in a restaurant next to a large group of drunk women laughing and getting drunker.<br/><br/>I made it through about forty minutes, and while, to be fair, nothing was as agonizing as the first 10 minutes, nothing was worth watching.<br/><br/>If you want to have mindless fun, listen to an ABBA album.

","I really wanted to see Mamma Mia! as I love Meryl Streep, I love Julie Walters, I love musicals and I love ABBA. The film does have some very good things, but there were some disappointments as well.<br/><br/>Cinematography/Visuals: I loved the look of Mamma Mia! The cinematography was beautiful and the Greek locations were stunning, colourful and wondrous. The costumes with the exception of the horrible ones Meryl, Julie and Christine Baranski had to wear as they sang over the end credits are lovely as well.<br/><br/>Music: Nothing to complain about here. All the songs are great, especially ""The Winner Takes it All"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Money Money Money"", ""Waterloo"" and ""I Have a Dream"". Then again, it's ABBA.<br/><br/>Story/Writing: I think the story and writing in my personal opinion were the biggest failings of the film. The writing is very clichéd at times, and the story while it has its sweet moments does have its ridiculous moments as well and lacked a sense of structure.<br/><br/>Direction/Choreography: The direction from Phyllida Lloyd was nothing to rave about but it was good. I actually liked the choreography in general, not so much for ""Waterloo"" but yes for ""Money Money Money"".<br/><br/>Acting/Vocals: I had mixed feelings here. Starting with the good, Amanda Seyfried was lovely beyond words as Sophie. She had allure and acted with real charm, and her vocals were very lightweight and tuneful. Meryl Streep, I actually liked her. I did worry that her singing was too low in ""Money Money Money"" but she really emotes in ""The Winner Takes it All"" and she looks gorgeous in the sunlight. However, I have to concur with those who didn't like Pierce Brosnan's singing, it had a decent tone at times but it was flat and lacked support particularly in the infamously bad rendition of ""S.O.S"". Julie Walters was also a disappointment. I don't hate Walters, far from it, I think she is amazing, however she isn't given as much to do, and her singing I found on the shouty side.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed, but for the Greek locations and the music I guess it is worth seeing. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","It must have been fun to make this film. It was certainly fun to watch it.<br/><br/>The story is easily summed up. A young woman is about to get married and wants her father to give her away at the wedding. Trouble is, given her mother's colorful past, she does not know who he is and, having secretly read her mother's diary, she invites the three most likely candidates to the Greek island where she helps her unsuspecting mom run a hotel and where the wedding is to take place. High jinks ensue!<br/><br/>This is a simple story, of course, but more than adequate for its main function  to act as a framework for a selection of ABBA's songs to be performed by a cast not known for its singing prowess.<br/><br/>The performances are mostly fine. The female leads and two of the males make a decent stab at singing. The exception is Pierce Brosnan. Him, they really should have dubbed. The choreography ranges from exciting to hilarious (in a good way), with the ""Voulez Vous"" and ""Does Your Mother Know?"" numbers deserving special mention. The setting is great.<br/><br/>For people of my age then (don't ask!), this is a thoroughly enjoyable nostalgia trip.

The plot evolves round how Donna had kept a diary of whilst she was pregnant with her daughter Sophie Sheridan played by Amanda Seyfried and Sophie finding out she has 3 potential dad's.

It was great to see Meryl play such a fun loving character.<br/><br/>Christine Baranski can steal a scene every time she is on camera. She is one amazing actress. Julie Walters was a hoot.

I did, however, go in with some fear and trepidation as I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to movie viewing (according to my husband who likes it all). <br/><br/>It took about half an hour before I didn't start to cringe at the beginning of a song. I wondered about the choreography in certain parts (didn't seem to fit). It was painfully obvious that the story-line was an often times awkward attempt to fit a bunch of ABBA songs together. The editing seemed odd at times. Some of the acting was a bit over-the-top.<br/><br/>All that said, I ended up liking the movie. A lot. Much to my own surprise. Maybe it's because I enjoy Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, and Julie Waters so much. The ""Dancing Queen"" number by itself was reason to see the film. <br/><br/>It was refreshing to see a lead actress (Streep) actually look her age (over 50). One would normally expect Hollywood to go for the leading lady with the most plastic surgery and not the most talent. Meryl Streep gets big kudos for having the guts to do this movie, even if it fails in some instances."
"jcolyer1229","10","1","4","1 August 2008"," Mamma Mia!
","The world's biggest stage musical became a major motion picture produced by Tom Hanks. It was released July 18, and features the songs of ABBA. The plot is thin yet relevant to the songs. Sophie is getting married and wants to know who her father is. She gets into her mother's diary and narrows it down to three men. She invites all three to the Greek island where the wedding is taking place. Sophie's mother is played by Meryl Streep. Streep never quite got over Sam who is played by Pierce Brosnan. The singing is adequate. Mamma Mia! is ultimately another excuse for reviving the ABBA catalog. The reason the soundtrack is so good is that Benny Andersson used the original musicians who played with ABBA: Lasse Wellander and Rutgar Gunnarsson."
"bettesbaby","10","1","4","1 August 2008"," It is very good, excellent, saw the play twice, this compares and translates to the big screen nicely
","The spoiler, I will say this first. When I saw the play, it had a sequence where between voulez vous and her waking up the next morning she had a nightmare. It is missing the nightmare. The nightmare was done to the song Under Attack. Had they put the song in it I think it would have contained the ONLY word considered as a swear word.<br/><br/>The movie was excellent. It really was. It is schmaltzy, sure, it is a little over sweet, yeah, but it is one of the few movies I have seen, in a long, LONG, time that I didn't feel the need to say Hail Marys or take a long hot shower after because the humor was filthy. The theater was packed. This being a week after it opened in USA that I saw it. <br/><br/>If you don't like ABBA music don't see it. <br/><br/>It is a family movie that you can easily take the whole family to and not have to worry much, aside from Christine's occasional naughty physical humor. That is about the only thing really dirty or adult about it."
"jesperbexkens","7","1","4","30 July 2008"," Singing is an art too
","To begin with they should have fired the casting directors here. Is it too much to find a cast that is able to act (though mostly on that point it's okay) but also to sing!!! I wonder how ABBA could have given permission for this horror for the ears. Especially Pierce Brosnan is off key. This is also the worst I've ever seen of Meryl Streep, someone else should have been better. But Amanda Seyfried is charming and a reasonable singer and the Dynamos are hilarious by times. And it's exactly this kind of enthusiasm that saves the movie. Don't complain and go with the flow of enthusiasm on screen and the great ABBA melodies. Then you will have a fun night. Nothing more, but surely nothing less."
"folsominc2","8","1","4","28 July 2008"," Mama Mia! Makes a Splash!
","The movie version of Mama Mia! released on Friday night, July 19 to a resounding success of fun, entertainment and Music with a capital ""M."" Despite the obvious plot similarities to Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell, from 1968 with Gina Lollobrigida, Phil Silvers, Peter Lawford, and Telly Savalas, Mama Mia! explodes on the screen with unadulterated enthusiasm from the first note. ABBA's amazing pop rock and passion was displayed in every scene by the talented character actors.<br/><br/>A young twenty-year old girl, hoping to find closure in her life, invites three men to her wedding on the Greek island where she grew up. She learned that one of the men could possibly be her father from reading her mother's diary of the summer when she was conceived. Her mother, portrayed by Meryl Streep, has no indication that they are invited until finding them unexpectedly and bursting into the title's song, Mama Mia! The plot tends to be thin and the conflict between characters wanders depending on the musical interlude, however, the zeal in which the players depict their roles easily rewards the viewers while they sing along with 1970s-1980s hit tunes.<br/><br/>One of the more prominent issues with the movie was the casting of Streep whose obviously aged appearance was more fitted to be the heroine's grandmother rather than her mother. The long and drawn out solo, The Winner Takes It All was perhaps the heaviest yawn in the entire movie where the entire plot comes to a screeching halt after over an hour of action as Streep emotes over her first lover's perfidy.<br/><br/>Another real thumbs-down was the lack of vocal talents displayed by Pierce Brosnan. Good looking he might be, but unfortunately, his voice was rather weak and strained during his singing. Colin Firth, on the other hand, has a rather enchanting and sweet voice which fit his songs perfectly. Regrettably, Firth's role was narrowed so extensively that it sometimes became apparent that Harry Bright was an afterthought.<br/><br/>Firth's character was interesting and fun; however, in a bitter aftertaste, if he continues to play the homosexual role in films, no matter how casually, despite his wife and three children, people are going to believe he has those tendencies. Frankly, I would like to see him in more hunky roles with wit, charm and character depth as he excels in a heterosexual romance.<br/><br/>However, earlier in the film as the lively song, Dancing Queen is heralded across the screen adding more and more characters, the audience becomes thoroughly enraptured with the performance so that when a little old lady throws off her burden and joins in the revelry, enthusiastic applause breaks out in the theater. This personal association to the moment was similar to the Match Race interruptive win in the movie Seabiscuit released in 2003.<br/><br/>The wedding makes a rather strange and modernistic alteration. The heroine, played by Amanda Seyfried, decides that although she and her finance love each other and plan to spend their lives together, they would prefer not to get married. Then her mother and one potential father, Pierce Brosnan, unrealistically choose to marry after a twenty-year absence. Many elements are set for a prospective sequel.<br/><br/>However, the final surprise was presented by the lead characters performing more musical ensembles while the credits rolled. Since the audience was virtually immobile, the producers initiated a strike of ingenuity which will probably be seen again in future movie adaptations.<br/><br/>Some parts rather risqué and not for children's viewing but a lot of fun throughout!"
"Danielle31","9","1","4","27 July 2008"," A little hysterical, yes, but all in all a great film.
","I saw this at the theater on opening day and although we went to the midnight showing, the theater was 3/4 full. I saw the musical about five years ago and it was excellent. I was really hoping this would live up to the incredibly high standards of the stage show.<br/><br/>And I must say that it did. There was a plus also. While the stage version had cartoonish looking sets, the movie shows you the real deal--breathtaking shots of an actual Greek isle. It was so gorgeous that I wanted to jump into the screen and be there.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple and revolves around Abba songs. A girl who has never known her father sneaks a peek into her mother's diary and sends invites to her upcoming wedding to the three men her mother slept with approximately nine months before she was born--without her mother's consent. I'm a huge Abba fan, and it probably does help to love Abba's music. But I think you don't have to be a fan to love this movie. My husband hates disco music; Abba is basically the only disco act he'll listen to and he adored the musical and loved the movie. As long as you don't hate Abba you'll probably enjoy it.<br/><br/>I was worried with the stage play that the performers wouldn't do the songs justice. I didn't think anyone could top Agnetha and Frida. Well, the performers' version was pitch perfect. When I heard the movie was coming out last year, I worried if Meryl, Amanda & Pierce and the rest of the gang would do the songs justice. I had no idea if any one of them ever sang before. Well, after watching the movie, I was really impressed with how well everyone performed the songs. Amanda was the best singer, and although Pierce isn't exactly Pavarotti, I didn't think he was an American Idol reject either. Let's just say he was just good enough to pass muster.<br/><br/>I've read some of the negative reviews and I do have to agree on a few things. If giddiness and pure joy to the point of hysteria make you want to jump off a cliff, then I wouldn't recommend this movie. Meryl's character Donna and her daughter Sophie are very excitable people. For some reason I didn't notice it in the stage play but I did here, though. But basically it's part and parcel of the musical genre, and I didn't think it detracted from the movie that much.<br/><br/>The scenery looks very beautiful, but all the people in the movie look awful. In most movies, everybody looks flawless and thin. Not here. I don't think anyone had any makeup on, it was obvious a lot of the actors were sweating profusely, and some of them had gained a few pounds. It was sort of refreshing to see and most of the younger actors looked gorgeous nonetheless, but it did make it hard to believe that Meryl was supposed to be in her early forties. Meryl is 58 years old and she definitely looks it in this movie. Pierce, who was always so suave as James Bond, looks even older, like he could be in his sixties. I think it was the biggest detraction for me and why I didn't give it 10 stars. Also, the time line is a little messed up, it seems like it was set in the present, but two of the possible fathers were hippies. My guess is that it was set about ten years ago, when the musical first came out, but even that is pushing it.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I really enjoyed the movie and I think it is just as good as the musical on stage. It definitely lived up to the hype and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. I think anyone who likes musicals and having a good time will definitely enjoy this movie."
"lola_star324","6","1","4","26 July 2008"," Buy the Original Cast recording and use your imagination...
","Let me preface this by stating that I am both a fan of the original musical play and ABBA in general. In addition, I am a fan of musicals in general. I also would like to add that in normal circumstances I am a fan of Meryl Streep. I believe that she is very talented actress.<br/><br/>The plot line is fairly simple (most musicals are): Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), the daughter of Donna (Meryl Streep), is about the get married. The only thing missing is her father. So, she invites her three possible dads in the hopes of finding her one true father.<br/><br/>The acting is decent all around. I think that Colin Firth and Julie Walters shine in their comedic roles. And, Christine Baranski and Amanda Seyfried give both solid acting and vocal performances.<br/><br/>However, not everyone was meant to sing and dance, and our two leads are prime examples. Meryl Streep, who is far too old to be the 38 year-old Donna of the stage show, overacts in every song, flailing about with some odd interpretive dance moves. And, her singing can be described as amateur at best. Pierce Brosnan should have stayed the strong, silent type. His acting is uneven at best, and his singing is cringe-worthy. One patron in my theater could not stop laughing during Streep and Brosnan's mini duet during ""SOS."" Brosnan's usually debonair voice becomes high and airy during his songs. Every time he opened his mouth, I prayed Streep's own mediocre pipes would take over.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the original musical and ABBA, then check it out. However, if you are unfamiliar with the show and songs, I would stay away. Unless that is, if you want to laugh at Streep and Brosnan showcasing their aging bodies and talentless singing."
"actsmart29","8","1","4","26 July 2008"," Mamma Mia Review--I'm a theatre person, so it's kinda mean.
","I had the pleasure of seeing the new film based on the musical Mamma Mia, sharing it's name. From my first sentence you can clearly tell I went in having prior knowledge of the stage musical and so, similar to reading a novel prior to a film, I was let down by the variations in plot and characters as well as my favorite comic relief moments from the play. <br/><br/>I know, I'm a theatre snob, so stop reading now if you hate that, because I'm totally one of those who thinks musicals should be made into movies if they keep the script exactly the same and have good actors and actresses playing the roles. <br/><br/>***SOME SPOILERS*** Speaking of which, the cast in the film was good at best. The actress who portrayed Sophie was wonderful, I enjoyed her pure voice that was one of few that didn't sound computer generated, and her acting was sincere and adorable. Meryl Streep on the other hand; I did not care for her. <br/><br/>The role of Donna is much to young to be played by a 60-year-old looking Streep. Donna was supposed to have had Sophie when she was young (obvious by the diary entries and such) and Sophie is only supposed to be about 20. Therefore Donna Should at most look 40. Streep looked every day of her real age, however and it threw off the plot for me. Additionally, she was incredibly stiff and I do not know whether it was the choreography or her lack of ability to perform it that i disliked, but I never found pleasure watching her sing because her movements were mechanical at best. <br/><br/>Plus, because Donna's age seemed upped a bit, her suitors were older as well. This was actually not too bad, because you can see her having a thing for older men possibly, however, the pictures they show of their ""hippie days"" make them appear older. AND! If Donna was a young mom in the 60's (hippies), her daughter would be 40. The whole point of the show, is to have her big in the 80's (ABBA's generation). <br/><br/>Either way, back to her suitors played by Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnin, and the Australian guy. I thoroughly enjoyed Colin Firth, his voice was very clear and beautiful, definitely what I wanted to see. The song ""Our Last Summer"" was my favorite thanks to him. However, the primary suitor, Sam (Brosnin's character), seemed a little off to me. The acting was great! As is any movie acting, however this was a musical. Brosnin's voice was not horrible, actually it was pretty good, but like Meryl Streep's I could not focus on his voice because he looked almost uncomfortable when he was singing. He normally plays such a sexy mature man and when he sings he just can't hold on to that. <br/><br/>The other roles such as the aunts and Sky were played very well. I wouldn't say to perfection, but they were done correctly. However, yet again because Streep's age difference, her friends were older as well. Yet, they appeared much more similar to those in the play than any other of the movie character. Sky was definitely attractive, sincere, and sweet and his voice was captivating. However, I don't completely remember if there was this resolution in the stage show, but I feel like we needed to see why Sky forgave Sophie; he just shows up at the wedding when the last thing they did was fight. I wanted some sort of small thing for him. <br/><br/>Now to the movie itself; as compared to the play, it was mediocre (it cut my favorite bits: Head banger and Take a Chance on Me in the Chapel); however, as strictly a movie musical, it was very good. I disliked a good portion of the choreography because there wasn't much and it was all sexually suggestive or stiff or just nothing special. The music was great, it sounded a little computer-y at parts, but was primarily good. <br/><br/>All in all, it was a good film, but I definitely suggest the play more. And it's casting does bring me back to my belief that musicals should be cast for talent in all 3 major areas (singing, dancing, acting) not on their marketable ability or place in the celebrity hierarchy; I believe that's why the character of Sophie was so well played- because she was cast for ability not because of her fame *cough* *cough* streep.... I do suggest it more than any other musical based film, but as I said, I still like the play more."
"alveeno6","5","1","4","17 July 2008"," Not so bad.... not so good either
","I know it was adapted from theater and I was expecting over the top acting and a lot of choreographed dancing. But there wasn't really excitement. Everything was so joyous, that the supposedly sad or serious scenes didn't seem to change the mood, it just bored me.<br/><br/>Most of the time that I was sitting there, watching the film, all I can think about is Greece and how wonderful it would be to spend the beautiful days and nights in that country overlooking the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>I do enjoy musicals. It is because words can be said through poetry and mood can be hummed with its melody. That is why most musicals compose original music for the production. ""Across the Universe"", however, did an awesome job of timing the songs to the situations and not feeling that came out of nowhere. ""Mamma Mia"", didn't do its best in this department most of the time. I'm not saying they are bad at it, maybe it's because Abba had less selection of songs compared to the Beatles.<br/><br/>Sad part is, my favorite part of the film is the part that i saw on E-News. Yes, it is ""The Winner Takes It All"". It was a beautiful shot of the island and the sea and it was well sung by Meryl Streep. But after the first minute, she was still singing the song, I somehow felt smothered by it.<br/><br/>A lot of straight guys wouldn't see this movie because of the singing and dancing and Abba. But it is something worth seeing, especially with your mothers. Though, the 'wet scene' is a little over the top. (you'll see what i mean)"

I think fun is underrated and this is pure fun, yet including some classical drama plots, worthy of a Greek myth (as it is said in a movie - it's very Greek!) and a classy entertainment. On the top of it all the singing is done by actors, which makes it very authentic and real, the lyrics are fitted in movie brilliantly and it is not taking it self too seriously at all. Especially funny are little turns and subtle jokes, there's a lot of care for detail. I can also see that it is done by a women and it is truly great to see it with your girlfriends, especially for the first time! But every man that have seen it has enjoyed it to, because it is not cheesy, it is very romantic but still the plot is life-like. Especially for a musical!"
"Theo Robertson","6","1","5","7 July 2013"," Will Certainly Appeal To Dancing Queens
","I put off seeing this film simply because ... well it's MAMMA MIA isn't it ? A musical based on the stage play and centered around the music of Swedish legends Abba a band I'm old enough to remember and a pop group still held in high regard by heterosexual women and gay men of a certain age but I certainly was never a fan and it was the main selling point of the film . You can point out that it contains some cinematic star power big hitters but if the same cast appeared in a film with the song and dance numbers provided by The Beta Band would it have the same box office appeal ? <br/><br/>Talking of box office in 2013 it still remains the 75th highest grossing film unadjusted for inflation . I'm guessing much of the world box office is down to the nations of Sweden and Britain making a big contribution to the film's profits ? That said despite never making number one at the US box office it did remain in the top 10 weekly box office for two months . It seems to have been a film that captured the hearts of the international market . Maybe it does have something going for it after all and I was being prejudiced ? <br/><br/>Any prejudice is quickly met . It is very camp kitsch guilty pleasure material . No attempt is made to portray Greek Islands with any reality , no attempt is made to make MAMMA MIA the greatest film since CITIZEN KANE . Everything is constructed around the show stopping song and dance numbers and after a while even a hetrosexist male who can remember these songs almost gets caught up in the sway of things . It's camp nonsense of course but relatively enjoyable camp nonsense , a sort of low brow Derek Jarman does MGM musical . That's entertainment ? Yes to a degree . It's not a film that will be remembered with any great affection by the critics but does what it sets out to do relatively well"

Granted, Pierce Brosnan's singing is painful, but he looks the part (hey, you can't have everything!). Meryl Streep is good, as everyone else is. This is now one of those movies that you pop in, life is crap, PMS, and the only thing that will save you is Fried Green Tomatoes and Steel Magnolias....now add to the list, Mama Mia. Not only do you have the drama, but you have the music to accompany it. And when you're in the car, driving on a gloomy day, you hear ""Super Trooper"" and instantly become happy again. Perfection."

The finale with that song is phenomenal and the fact that they made a movie out of it is more of an insult to the movie than to the song, because seeing Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce dance to that beauty is more awe-inspiring than any lame-ass drama-comedy could ever hope to be.

","What can one say about this film that perhaps has not already been said? I'm not sure but we shall give it a good old go. First things first though. Mamma Mia! is based off the long-running musical of the same name, which was written by the English writer Catherine Johnson. What is not oft known is that this stage musical was actually adapted from a 1968 Italian/American film called Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell which starred the wonderful Gina Lollobrigida and Shelley Winters along with a host of other top stars for the time.<br/><br/>Some variances do exist between the stage musical and the film with regard to the soundtrack. Certain tracks like Chiquitita and Knowing Me, Knowing You do not appear and some songs appear in the movie and not the musical. Regardless, if you are an ABBA fan you will be pleased with what is in as most of the big hits are covered. And let's be honest here, you are probably unlikely to be watching this anyway if you are not a fan of the 70's super-group (if anyone like that actually exists) so you will be more than happy. Benny and Bjorn even make cameos. What more could you ask for other than the lovely Agnetha perhaps.<br/><br/>To the actual story, Sophie (Seyfried) is due to be married on a Greek island on which her mother Donna (a fantastic Streep) owns a small rundown and rather ramshackle hotel. Unbeknownst to her mother, Sophie has been trying to find out more information about her father and has been reading her mothers diaries. She finds out that her father could be one of three different men, so in her desperation to know who her father is and have him walk her down the isle at her wedding, she invites all three of them to the island without her mothers knowledge. It is at this point that the film really takes off in earnest.<br/><br/>Sam (a ridiculously funny Brosnan), Bill (Skarsgård) and Harry (Firth) all arrive at the hotel unaware of who the others actually are. Meanwhile Donna has also invited her best friends, Rosie (Walters) and the tenacious Tanya (brilliantly played by Barabski) and thus fun ensues as soon as Donna finds out they are on the island. Cue lots of comedy moments and music thrown in. Now I must confess, with the exception being The King and I, I personally cannot stand musicals. So I was dubious about watching this one. I should not have been concerned as this is perhaps the best musical put onto celluloid (well digital these days I guess) and a rockingly good film all round.<br/><br/>Everyone plays their part wonderfully (though I felt the part of Sophie's betrothed, played by Dominic Cooper was a very weak) and you can really tell that everyone is just having a blast making this film. It really shines through in their performances. Streep along with Walters and Baranski are brilliant as old friends reminiscing about old times and trying to fix the problem of the three possible fathers. As for the potential fathers, they all play off each other brilliantly and to see Brosnan send himself up is hilarious. He is actually quite a funny guy and certainly up for a laugh, even if that is at his own expense. You have to see it to believe it, even more so given he signed onto the project just because of Streep and had no knowledge of what it was about.<br/><br/>Even the extras looked like they were literally having the time of their lives. Structured similar to a Greek comedy, all the extras in the village on the island and Donna's staff act as a chorus, all appropriately dressed to match what is happening when the mood of the film requires yet another blasting of an ABBA classic. All brilliantly well done stuff. Phyllida Lloyd's (who also directed the original Broadway play) direction is spot on here and she really gets the best performances out of her cast. Is it full of cheese at times? It sure as hell is and it is all the more engaging, comedic and watchable for it.<br/><br/>A hundred other films are referenced and made fun off along the way and it can be fun to try and catch them all before a new setting is in front of your eyes and a new dance sequence starts off. The script can be a little flaky in places but otherwise is great. As previously stated, acting all round is pretty good even though there is a serious lack of chemistry from any of the people supposed to be madly in love with each other. Some of the singing (the men are not the greatest in all honesty) is mostly excellent and Pierce Brosnan is just a joy to behold and truly hilariously bad. I defy you to keep a straight face, I'm pretty sure non of the cast did.<br/><br/>If you like your musicals, hell, even if you don't like your musicals, I think pretty much everyone loves ABBA. I recently watched this again with someone who somehow seemed to have missed most of ABBA's career and they absolutely loved it. Good company, good wine and fantastic music go to make a great night and this film will not disappoint. A very solid 4 stars for us.<br/><br/>

Amanda Seyfried was also spectacular and she just seemed like she belongs in this setting. There wasn't one bad actor in this entire musical. Movies like this don't come along very often, but when they do you can just feel how special they are and they make a lasting impression on the viewers.

","A reviewer has pointed out that previous musicals composed music and songs to fit a story. Here, however, the story has been invented to fit the songs already created. The result, if you are bothered by it, is odd; but who cares ? Who gives a dam ? The only tragedy is that the story doesn't include the As from ABBA. So does it matter if some of the stars can't sing ? Read instead the legion of comments on you tube about: ""the Mozart of popular music"". ABBA are unique, the greatest pop group that has ever existed, or ever will. Forget the rest, and everyone following Halley's Comet, like the little sissies and the revolving rocks. Sadly, on this site there are a number of mentally impaired, tone deaf, and denigrating wet blankets, who may safely be ignored, but who have managed to lower the vote. I admit that I was greatly surprised to see Harry (Colin Firth) transformed into a dancing quean. Especially since one of the great attractions of ABBA is that they are everyday straight, normal, untattooed, unrebellious, totally social, totally human."
"tarantino_feet_pics","5","0","1","2 March 2020"," Thoughts on Mamma Mia!
","I'll start with the things I liked. Firstly I liked Amanda Seyfried, she's gorgeous and pretty good in this. All the potential fathers were pretty good. The setting and wedding location is beautiful. There were a few musical highlights, those being; ""dancing queen"", ""slipping through my fingers"" and ""Mamma Mia."" Only slipping through my fingers and Mamma Mia actually servicing the plot. The slipping through my fingers scene was a nice heartfelt moment. The song ""honey honey"" is a creative way of conveying whats said in Donna's diary. The scene were Bill and Harry are conversing on the boat and Bill comes to the conclusion that Harry is gay is comical.<br/><br/>A musical lives and dies by its music. Moments were characters break into song and dance are meant to be a break from reality and represent what the characters are feeling and whats happening in the story. In the case of Mamma Mia many of the musical segments don't further the plot at all or are of no importance. Some of these are; ""money, money, money"", ""dancing queen"", ""Chiquitita"", ""does your mother know"" and ""Voulez-Vous."" Also in regards to the music, Pierce Brosnan really can not sing. There are far too many musical segments. A lot of the musical segments seem to exist only to pad out the run time. Maybe that's because they focused on having a story that fits the songs instead of starting with a story and writing songs that fit it. Donna's friends are shrill, obnoxious and annoying. The duo are also given there own subplots that are presented and resolved in a matter of minutes. These subplots are just nothing and don't serve the story at all.<br/><br/>If you want a chick flick with the occasional fun musical segment this might be for you. There's nothing wrong if you enjoy Mamma Mia, its just not for me.

","When SATC ended in 2004, I, like everyone else felt the insane need for a little more Carrie, a little more Samantha, a little more Charlotte and a little more Miranda. 2008, Michael Patrick King and the cast and crew of Sex and the City delivered a film that not only filled in the gap of four years away from our screens, they told us the story of what came next.<br/><br/>The film itself is LONG, surprisingly long, and with this extended edition we're talking about an extra 10-15 minutes of unseen footage. The additional footage makes perfect sense for hardcore fans, these additional scenes are not only at times funny but they extend an offering of extra ""hope"" and sometimes ""explanation"" of scenes that were previously concluded.<br/><br/>The TWO disc special edition is a perfect trade in for anyone who rushed out to purchase the film when it released in stores. On your second disc you will find an amazing conversation between show Creator Michael Patrick King and Executive producer / Star, Sarah Jessica Parker. Together they discuss everything from the process of character development - to fashion decisions with Pat Field. You will also find three additional scenes that did NOT make it into the extended cut of the film which are alternate takes on what you DID see make the final cut.<br/><br/>Overall I rated this product ***** stars because it is a collector's DREAM to carry this film as a personal memento of appreciation, fandom and hope. Without plot give away - I will simply say this .... Once you find love, and once you think you've settled your dreams, does the ""dream"" always amount to reality? and when challenges arise in our personal lives, are we truly willing to accept what has been handed to us through circumstance, choice and history?.@kraynu @renukantam @nitingovind"

Considering the greatly entertaining story in the film and my circumstances, I can honestly say I had one of the best times of my life watching it.<br/><br/>The story is filled with tiny details of humor and unexpected surprises, so at no point during the film it hits a ""low"". I consider it enjoyable from beginning to end even for people who don't like musicals. They created a rich story in which the songs by ABBA blend perfectly, so unlike in many musical films in which you just wonder why characters started singing, the continuity between the story and the songs makes the viewer enjoy every scene.<br/><br/>The goal doesn't seem to be to make the audience laugh, but to have a great time, I would call this a ""feel good"" film. However very fine humor is present in the film by the unexpected decisions taken by the characters during the film.

Why would the editors and producers allow that to be in the final cut? If the scene can't be rescued then why not just dub it with even a runner up from American Idol? Yikes. I recommend turning down the sound when he starts up ""SOS"". Oh, and look away as well because his face contorts as if he's constipated. Other than that 5 minutes do enjoy - it is pure fun.

","This jukebox musical featuring the songs of ABBA is set on a small Greek island where twenty year old Sophie wants her father to give her away at her wedding. There is just one problem; she doesn't know who he is. She has narrowed it down to three men thanks to a nose through her mother's diaries. She thinks that if she meets the men she will be able to figure out which one is her father so invites all three of them without telling her mother. When they arrive she realises that she has no idea; any one of them could be her father. When her mother learns that they are there she worries that they will spoil the wedding. When the men realise why Sophie invited them they each think they are her father and expect to be the one to walk her down the aisle it will certainly be an interesting wedding.<br/><br/>I must admit that this isn't the sort of film I usually watch but I was curious about what it would be like due to its popularity and some positive reviews. The story isn't very deep but that isn't a problem as it is effectively there to provide reasons for the cast to sing many of ABBA's greatest hits and it is the cast singing not just miming to the songs. The cast is clearly having a good time and that sense of fun is infectious; the fact that not all of them are particularly good singers makes the characters feel more real. Amanda Seyfried does a good job as Sophie and Meryl Streep is a delight as her mother. Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth impress as the three potential fathers. The Greek location looks great and adds to the fun of the film; I don't think it would have been half as enjoyable if it wasn't set such a beautiful and sunny location. Overall this was a lot more enjoyable than I expected and anybody who enjoys the songs of ABBA should love it."

","James Bond is a good choice for Mamma Mia! why? Because you don't expect to see to Pierce Brosnan, singing the songs of ABBA, and falling in love for Meryl Streep. He did not sang with the desired quality. Much more, his vocal efforts are almost laughable. Perfect! because he is not the invincible macho-hero who kick asses in Russia or third world countries. In this movie he characterizes as an architect who seek for her lost daughter, and the woman of his dreams. He's not so invincible now: Music, the great songs of ABBA, and the storyline have the power. Yes, he sang out of tune, and thats fits to be a common human male. Pierce Brosnan has played various roles in his career, and it's unfair frame him only as James Bond. In fact, I think that the performer of James Bond gets humanized, a character who is known for being a Sledgehammer. And on the other hand and no less important, the wonderful chemistry, the click, achieved between Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, just spread through the movie to fulfill the storyline and to make a perfect ending when they appear on scene, wearing a sort of ABBA style outfits, matching 1970's glam-rock and singing ""Waterloo""."

","OK, I have to start off by saying that if the wedding took place at the far end of the island and you had to walk to get there from where Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan had their confrontation, I think they'd still be walking, 'cause down the hill, up the hill, and it ain't as close as it looks. But that is minor, because the music of Abba and the gorgeous Greek scenery is what makes this movie so special. Not much has changed in the movie from its stage origins with the exception of the fact that film opens the story up to be so much larger, so much more gorgeous. It's a simple story, basically the same plot line as ""Buona Sera Mrs Campbell"" with songs (already having been musicalized as the short-lived ""Sarava"") with a young girl inviting three men to her wedding with the assumption that one of them is her father. Meryl Streep, her hard-working mother, left a diary behind that gave the bride to be (Amanda Seyfried) the clues to pop's possible identity.<br/><br/>Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, total opposites if there ever were total opposites, are Streep's two long-time best friends. While Baranski's character seems to be a duplicate of her ""Cybil"" sidekick character Mary Anne, she makes her much more well rounded, giving a compassion, zest for life and even a bigger lust for young men, flirting ""innocently"" with the groom's sexy black pal (Philip Michael) who is obviously a cougar chaser. Walters is hysterically funny as a best selling cookbook author who gets her chance to shine by chasing after one of the possible three dads (Stellan Skarsgård) in the delightfully witty version of ""Take a Chance on Me"". Streep, who has already established herself as the biggest living legend in film's today, had already sung on screen (""Postcards From the Edge"", ""Death Becomes Her"") and this seems to have led her into becoming the first choice for movie versions of hit Broadway musicals. (Up next possibly, ""Follies"" I hear...)<br/><br/>Of course, there's a lot of people who admitted to laughing every time that Pierce Brosnan attempted to sing, but do you expect James Bond to sing like Howard Keel? Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård do better with their singing parts, while the younger actors are obviously trained as singers. It seems like every time you blink, somebody is breaking into an Abba song, and while some of the songs seem sort of forced into the plot, for the most part it works. There are also moments when the music becomes so passionate that pure joy takes over and this literally explodes on screen when the weakened structure of Streep's gorgeous inn explodes with a watery fountain from the sea beneath. It's ironic that the biggest hit musicals of Broaday shows are the light-hearted comedies, and ""Mamma Mia!"" deserves its place as one of the best of the past 20 years."

","Mamma Mia (2008): Dir: Phyllida Lloyd / Cast: Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stllan Skarsgard: Stunning musical dedicated to mothers that will likely be a bonding piece for mothers and daughters. Amanda Seyfried stars as a daughter about to be married but doesn't know who her real father is so she sends invitations to three males based on a journal she found of her mother's. Funny idea full of laughter and magic but an ending that really answers nothing. Director Phyllida Lloyd is backed by the music of ABBA, which is highlighted throughout the entire film. Seyfried brings out the innocence of someone on the next stage of life but wishes to know where she came from. Meryl Streep is fantastic as her mother who is approached and swept off her feet by all three males but surprisingly only one will win her heart. The suitors are played with comic appeal by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard who will raise more questions than answers. Much has been said of Brosnan's poor singing talent but he brings comic disposition and results that bring out good in a different manner. Firth is only hindered by a tasteless explanation regarding preference. The fact that the screenplay presents no answers shouldn't keep viewers from enjoying its visions. It is a musical celebration of family and a wayward view of marriage. Score: 8 / 10"

Meryl Streep carries this entire movie, I wasn't a big fan of Amanda Seyfried, i think the main poster should have Meryl on the front, because she's the star, not Amanda, she takes a BIG backseat to Meryl in this. Meryl just has so much charisma in her singing and dancing here! And i also loved Christina Baranski, favorite scene with her, ""does your mother know?"" She has a lot of energy in this movie! I really think Amanda was a poor casting choice though, she seemed pretty dull in my opinion. But thankfully Meryl and others stole most of the screen time! The set was beautiful, with the Greek islands, loved that! The ending was clever, I sorta expected it, but kinda not if that makes sense, all i'll say it it ended really happily and sweetly! 8/10 to a fun clever musical, mainly thanks to Mery Streep!"

","I am not the biggest ABBA fan in the world, although I do like the songs ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Mamma Mia."" This is the film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, and I think it is a product of mixed results. The story is paper thin and poorly executed, and that is evident during the non-singing scenes. However on the flip side, there is no denying how campy and fun the film can be. The singing is actually not bad, and there are powerful renditions of the hit ABBA songs to be had, especially ""Dancing Queen."" <br/><br/>Phyllis Lloyd's film is about a girl named Sophie who lives on a Greek island and is about to be married. However before the ceremony, she offers invites to three possible fathers that she may have never met, much to the chagrin of her mother, Donna. Now it's up to Sophie to find out who is her real father and try to improve relations between her mother and these men.<br/><br/>This film does have an incredibly stocked cast. Meryl Streep is the goddess of all actresses, and she can do anything. She even has a good singing voice. She also looks very good for her age as of 2008. Amanda Seyfreid also does a good job and just like in Les Miserables, she delivers a strong singing performance. Whoever thought Pierce Brosnan would star in a film like this and do well. I think he was able to hold his own. We also have good performances by Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgaard. Finally, I did not like Julie Walter's performance. She was just so annoying.<br/><br/>Overall, Mamma Mia! could have and should have been a much worse adaptation that we got. I was pleasantly surprised, but the film is still a little mediocre. The story itself has big issues, but the songs and the characters are above average and everyone seems like they are having a good time. To be honest, this movie could have been much worse if we did not have Meryl Streep. Not a great film, nor a bad film. But it's entertaining enough. I rate this film 7/10."

","I love this movie. Sure, there are people who say that this is fluff, and I wholeheartedly agree. But it's enjoyable fluff, and as long as I enjoy a movie, it is good entertainment. Right from the beginning(""and... dot, dot, dot!""), this film makes it clear that this is not going to be Broadway or West End, not going to feature awesome cinematography, nor is it going to feature a mind-teasing, Inception- esque plot. <br/><br/>And yes, the actors are not great singers. This is especially true for the males, although it didn't bother me at all. Meryl's performance is great as usual, and although I did notice slight straining of her voice in certain songs, I thought it fit well with her character and the kind of emotion that she is trying to portray. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast was good too, and I especially loved Donna's lovely sidekicks(Julie Walters and Christine Baranski). They were absolutely adorable and had great pipes to boot! They left me much deeper impressions than the male group, and this is saying a lot for someone who had no prior knowledge of any actors in the older demographic except for Pierce Brosnan(I am guilty of not recognising Mrs Weasley). Amanda Seyfried's acting is good as well, and her pipes did not disappoint. <br/><br/>Before I end, this movie is great for watching on a plane. I watched it en route to an overseas vacation and it really got me into the holidaying mood!"

","When going into Mamma Mia I didn't know what to expect, I wasn't a big fan of musicals and had only briefly heard of Julie Walters and Pierce Brosnan before. So when I watched it finally I thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.<br/><br/>The music was brilliant (yes even Pierce Brosnan) and acting was superb. I had never seen a film with Meryl Streep in it before but as soon as I watched Mamma Mia I was amazed and she is now my favourite actress, her ability to be able to perform the splits during Dancing Queen was sublime and the endless energy from all the cast left me speechless.<br/><br/>My only fault throughout the film was Amanda Seyfried, although her singing was very good and she kept a good pitch and most of all did ABBA justice, I feel that her acting could have been done a lot better as her emotions were far too extreme for the film (even though it is supposed to be dramatised as it is a musical).<br/><br/>The ultimate climax of the movie itself had to be Streep's breathtaking rendition of 'The Winner Takes it All', I went to the cinema 24 times to watch this film and each time it reduced me to tears, and it does whenever I watch the film, the on screen chemistry with Pierce, Amanda, Julie and Christine was to a tee obviously proving she was meant to portray the role of Donna Sheridan.<br/><br/>Christine Baranski and Julie Walters played the hilarious duo of friends and it was very believable everything that was going on, the humour was very good and it never fails to make me chuckle.<br/><br/>Mamma Mia is the best film I have ever seen and I would recommend it to anyone who asked, my favourite movie, mainly thanks to Streep and Brosnan, who were both incredible, a must watch film!!!!!"

Musicals aren't for everyone but everyone has a secret love for ABBA so the two are linked.There are some great musical numbers that look like they have been lifted straight out of Broadway.<br/><br/>A great stand alone film that captured the publics affections when it was released.

","My mother-in-law bought me this movie this past Christmas. I only opened it last night, because I generally hate her taste (I'm closer to ""films"" rather than ""movies"", else kung-fu if I want it ""dumb fun""), though Abba fan for similar reasons to this review. I get made fun of at painting sessions for it, but I get the best art off Abba.<br/><br/>Happily surprised; the DORK in me LOVED it! I don't care half of them can't sing or dance; more like watching your best friends (since all-star cast) in karaoke. Absolutely FUN.<br/><br/>15 minutes in, nearly shut it off (mostly my pre-conceived ""I'm going to hate this""). Glad I waited. Delicious! I gave three standing-Os in my own living room for how train-wreck but awesome at same time some of the numbers were.<br/><br/>I'm not a Meryl Street worshiper (always LIKE her), but she won me over, completely. I couldn't take my eyes off her. I love it when she does ""comedy"", and wish Hollywood let her do more. She's deep, charming, silly, absolutely mesmerizing, and does carry the movie. Her supporting cast is excellent and just as fun to watch.<br/><br/>Point off for not letting the worst singers sing. I was annoyed by dub/dub-over; I'd rather they just trash the song, but still their own voices. And off for what my husband also called ""the Duran Duran pier scene""; would have been more ridiculously awful and funny with no view jumps, just standing and walk off.<br/><br/>Otherwise, just beat Showgirls for my new all-time trash-movie love.

"ArdentViewer","6","0","2","17 January 2010"," Entertaining But Lacking Depth
","This movie was enjoyable to watch in terms of the entertainment value (singing, dancing, musical numbers) but I found myself wanting more throughout the experience. For much of the movie I held the impression that the songs were placed merely to utilize yet another ABBA song, and did nothing to move the plot along (e.g., Christine Baranski's number on the beach, a few of the male character's numbers, the group numbers with Meryl Streep and the other two women). For example, although I love the song ""Dancing Queen"" it seemed very contrived to have it performed by the three women in the hotel. Don't get me wrong - I liked the singing and the movie was quite visually appealing. Amanda Seyfried in particular was charismatic and had a beautiful voice. She was by far the musical star and I wished there were more numbers with her and not as many with the other characters. Meryl Streep did okay but she is ultimately not a singer and she was overshadowed by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters in the group numbers. One of her solo numbers ""Winner Takes it All"" was painful to listen to. She does not have a very strong voice on her own, especially not in the softer ballads. Pierce Brosnan's attempts were quite unimpressive and somewhat comical. It would have been better if they had selected more actors that could actually sing, rather than selecting them for their name and reputation. Even so, I did like most of the songs and found myself considering purchasing the soundtrack or at least trying to track down the original versions.<br/><br/>However, when I watch a movie, even a musical, I expect more than minimal scenes and character development to occur in between the numbers, such as what occurred in older musicals like ""Singing in the Rain."" Even a more modern tale like ""Grease"" is better-developed because all of the songs fit with the same theme and the same characters and work to advance the story. In ""Mamma Mia"" it was obvious to me that some of the songs were used just to be used but didn't necessarily fit. I don't know ABBA songs well enough to be able to tell you which ones these were, but it seemed like the script was loosely connected to incorporate much of ABBA'S repertoire, and many of the numbers were superfluous and didn't work with the storyline. I wanted to learn more about Sophie and Donna and didn't care as much about the peripheral characters, yet they performed many of the songs in the movie. I really wanted to see more of Amanda Seyfried, since she shined, but she wasn't on screen or singing enough for my taste.<br/><br/>As another note, there were parts of the movie that didn't make much sense to me, possibly because there was not enough plot development (as I mentioned earlier) or else too many scenes ended up on the cutting room floor to make room for the musical numbers. At the end of the movie, when Rosie (Julie Walters' character) sings to Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), I was confused. Where in the world did this come from? I'm sure she was infatuated by him but the fact that she would put herself out there like that seemed to come out of nowhere. In addition, when Sam (Pierce Brosnan) spontaneously proposes to Donna (Meryl Streep), I was once again caught off guard. I understand they had this deep passionate affair, but how are we to believe that he would have held a candle for her all these years? All we are told is that she was in love with him and he said he was in love with her, but he was engaged, and he left to get married, and broke her heart. The singing scenes between to two of them prior to this point didn't do enough for me to make this believable.<br/><br/>I realize that my opinion may differ from many others who watch this movie. I may be in the minority in that I had not seen the Broadway version and was not familiar with the songs and the story. Maybe I was harder to please because I didn't have a previous attachment to it. This movie may work better as a stage musical because you want everything to be fast-moving and entertaining and the actual story in between may not matter as much. When people go to see a Broadway Musical, they go for the music, and the story may be a distant second. But with films, they should still be movies along with musicals. This is my point of view. The movie musicals I most enjoy not only have great musical performances, but also have good acting, plot, and character development. That makes a well-rounded story. No, I don't expect every movie I watch to be Oscar caliber. I am perfectly content to be entertained by action movies or thrillers or comedies that may not emotionally touch you. However, in order to fully enjoy a movie and want to see it again, I find that I need to have some kind of connection with the characters and the story. In this case I am more likely to listen to the music than watch the film again, because, despite the major names and players, that's essentially what is was for me – great musical numbers with a little bit of film in between."

","If you feel sad and lonely and it's raining outside, this movie will do wonders for your mood just in the first thirty seconds. That's what it took to get me hooked and make me want to see it till the end. <br/><br/>Movies like these show that a straight male can enjoy films that don't involve people shooting at one another in the face. OK, when I saw James Bond I thought for a second that a speedboat chase could be in store for the ending. <br/><br/>But no, he just sang and dance like the rest of the crew, still keeping his 007 cool while swearing eternal love to Meryl with his hands in his pockets.<br/><br/>Of course a little campy and tacky, but what did you expect given the flashy style of the 70's band whose music it's based on?<br/><br/>Definitely recommendable.<br/><br/>8/10"

","MAMMA MIA! is a joyous musical romp, the film version of the long running Broadway musical based on the music of 70's pop group Abba. The film stars Meryl Streep as Donna, the lusty and free spirited innkeeper who runs a broken down hotel in the Greek Islands, who is rocked by the arrival of three former suitors (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard)in Greece for the wedding of Donna's daughter, Sophie, not knowing that one of them is really Sophie's father, though Donna is not sure which one is the real Daddy. This paper-thin plot line serves as the basis for an amusing and spirited musical journey exploring Donna's regrets about her past and Sophie's search for a future identity through knowing who her real father is. Filmed on location in the Greek Islands, the film is visually stunning and should really be experienced on a big screen. Streep, as always, commands the screen as Donna, giving a rich performance that almost makes you forget you're watching a musical. Amanda Seyfried is charming as Sophie offering an impressive turn in her first real leading role. There are also a pair of razor sharp supporting performances from Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's best friends, also in town for the wedding. The film features beautiful location photography and some very inventive staging of musical numbers, which include ""Dancing Queen"", "" In a Rich Man's World"", ""The Winner Takes it All"", ""Our Last Summer"", ""Take a Chance on Me"", and of course, the title tune. Not for all tastes, but for fans of musicals and Streep, a must."

","I really do love a great musical but I'm ashamed to say I've never seen Mama Mia on stage but I certainly would! However with amazing musicals in the past few years on the big screen like Rent, and Hairspray I really wanted to see Mama Mia. I especially enjoyed the idea that the cast were great actors but not necessarily who you might see singing on stage. The music is always classic and I had heard nothing but rave reviews for the musical so thought this would be a blast. When all is said and done Mama Mia is the most fun you'll have at a musical this year. It has the spunk and spirit of Hairspray (which was brilliant), a breath taking beautiful setting, Hollywood stars, an amazing 70's pop soundtrack that everyone can sing along too and it just looks like the cast is having a great time. The story (while just a whole lot of fun) isn't really deep. It doesn't tackle any political, social or hidden agenda, it's just feel good and fun and it has to be taken as just that. I think given Mama Mia's appeal on stage that the movie was almost certain to be a hit and its likely one of the most well known musicals of the modern age.<br/><br/>I always felt that Meryl Streep was one of the most over rated actors in history. Slowly my opinions on her are changing since I've seen her in Devil Wears Prada, Doubt and now this. She is incredibly versatile and she definitely has a screen presence to be reckoned with. That is exactly what she flaunts in Mama Mia. She isn't a brilliant singer (although she is pretty good) but she is terrific as the high spirited mother of the bride. Amanda Seyfried steals the show as determined engaged Sophie. She is brilliant and lovely and really just fun to watch and her and Streep have terrific mother daughter chemistry. Stellan Skarsgård, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are just terrific as the three potential fathers. None of them really strike you as musical leading men which makes them perfect. They all have distinct personalities and you will find your favorite but they are terrific. Together they are electric and the chemistry is awesome. Three Hollywood hunks that will keep you riveted in the quest for Sophie's real Dad. Honorable mention to the amazing Christine Baranski who has a small role but adds to the fun in a big way.<br/><br/>Romance, laughter, heart break and just a riot will make you feel like you are a part of the wedding and a part of the family. It doesn't exactly move you like some musicals I have seen but it is simply fun. I think perhaps the film makers might have been taking a risk giving the helm of the film to Phyllida Lloyd mostly because she has had little experience on the big screen. However, apparently she knows musical theater like none other and with a film of this type that's all that matters because although I have never seen the stage version, Mama Mia translates to the big screen brilliantly. What can I really say about the music? Its the Bee Gees with some of the most beloved music that the film fits into perfectly. I think its sheer brilliance that the play was written to the music and not the other way around. Mama Mia might not change the face of musicals but it is well worth seeing again and again and is certain to be a classic!! 8.5/10"

This reminded me of the better days of the studios when downers were the exception and entertainment the key. I have no issue with movies that send a message, that contain themes for a better world or moralize but mea culpa, there are a lot of times I'd like to just laugh and join in the fun.

When Donna sees them, it rocks her world.<br/><br/>The stellar cast also includes Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's best friends, who sang with her back in the day.<br/><br/>My only problems with this film were - first, it's been a hit show for so long that the ages of the women no longer work unless you state upfront that it takes place in 1998 or thereabouts, as the women are supposed to be 50 year-old ex-hippies, placing them and their bell-bottoms in the '60s and early '70s, not the late '70s and '80s.<br/><br/>My second problem, which I'm sure many people have commented on, is the godawful singing of Pierce Brosnan. Surely they could have done some mixing in the sound studio instead of inflicting that on a paying audience.<br/><br/>Other than that, wonderful entertainment."

","I saw the musical late in its run and thought it was a lot of good fun - nothing spectacular, but highly enjoyable. I enjoyed ABBA music though the group was never in my top 5. In that context, if you are looking for a movie with hilarious ABBA music send-ups and weddings, I would highly recommend the late 90's Australian satire Muriel's Wedding that helped springboard Toni Colette and Rachel Griffiths to well-deserved international stardom.<br/><br/>That said, I enjoyed the movie Mamma Mia as an enjoyable way to spend 110 minutes.<br/><br/>In contrast to the show, the movie gave us almost no interaction with two of the three potential fathers having dismissed them to her friends as flings. Hence, the heart-string tugs from the play were absent and it also spoiled any dramatic build-up to Sam stepping up to the plate at the end. I seem to be alone in thinking that Brosnan did a fantastic acting job of melting into the character of Sam rather than being Pierce Brosnan for a change. Given how little he was given to do, it probably wasn't worth it, but I thought it was worth noting. Colin Firth also, as usual, got the most out of Harry Headbanger despite his reduced air time. On the other hand, the choice of the balding and paunchy Swedish actor from the Intruders and Good Will Hunting as Bill was totally bewildering to me. He seemed totally miscast in the role and half a sleep in the little we dis see of him, mostly in his number with the irrepressible Julie Walters.<br/><br/>This brings us to what to watch and enjoy about Mamma Mia. All the scenes with Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are hysterically funny, wonderfully choreographed, and joys to behold. Streep has marvelous chemistry with them that is sorely lacking with any of the three gentlemen. Streep was certainly interesting here, often going from heartbroken and disconsolate to joyful and exuberant in a blink of an eye. It was almost like watching an acting class exercise set to music. And after all, who could possibly do it better? Sophie was well portrayed and the fellow playing was better treated by the screenplay than any other male in the film and took more-than-adequate advantage of it. Normally, I'm not a fan of overblown and surreal production numbers but the literal Greek Chorus made the musical cast of hundreds in the background into good fun.<br/><br/>So, enjoy Mamma Mia for what it is if you are so inclined. If you are under 30, male, and can't stand ABBA music, go see Transformers 3 instead."

","M.I.A. ... missing in action, adequately describes the father(s) in this sweet story. As always, Meryl Streep gives an awe-inspiring performance, with her acting and singing, and her ""Winner Takes It All"" outdoors is just as good as anything that has been performed on the silver screen.<br/><br/>This movie is the adaptation of the stage play which simply is a tribute to the ABBA songs. To tie it all together is an improbable, but sweet, romantic story. It works!<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is Donna Sheridan who has been on this picturesque Greek island for 21 years, since her mother told the pregnant Donna to never come back home. So she stayed there, had her baby, and has been operating a run-down hotel for all those years.<br/><br/>Cute 21-year-old Amanda Seyfried is her daughter, Sophie, and the event at hand is her marriage. Sophie finds her mom's diary from all those years ago and figures out that she had been romantically involved with 3 men during the time she became pregnant, so without her mom's knowledge Sophie sends wedding invitations to all three men, on the chance that one of them is her real father, whom she has never met.<br/><br/>One of the ""fathers"" is Pierce Brosnan as Sam Carmichael. Another is Colin Firth as Harry Bright. And the third is carefree sailor Stellan Skarsgård as Bill Anderson. As good script writing would have it, all three of them appear at the same time and, in fact, all make the short trip from mainland to the island on Bill's sailboat after the other two barely miss the ferry.<br/><br/>The movie is a musical. Everyone sings. Most of them had never sung outside the shower before. And it works! The DVD has very interesting ""extra"" features that show how much musical work was done to get all the actors to the point that they could do justice to the ABBA songs.<br/><br/>Joining Streep were Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. They were old friends who returned for the wedding, and provided the harmony voices for the songs.<br/><br/>I like music and singing and I like this movie. It is totally funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>Update May 2013: Just saw it again after almost 5 years and enjoyed it as much as I did the first time."
"joestank15","6","0","1","19 December 2008"," Cute, bubbly. Lacking substance.
","Mamma Mia! - Based on the hit Broadway musical, Mamma Mia! Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) invites three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) her mother slept with 20 years ago to try and find which one is her dad. Why a paternity test or even just a sit down talk to with them and her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) could not have resolved this issue is completely ridiculous *obviously*. Your tolerance of Mamma Mia! is conditional on your liking musicals, acceptance of ABBA, and stamina for cheeriness.<br/><br/>First off, Meryl Streep can sing quite well and does ""The Winner Takes it All"" quite well. Amanda Seyfried can also sing well. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski can sing but very few of these actresses are given songs that show their voices at their best. Consequently the musical numbers are uneven, if catchy. Some are decent. Some are quite fun in fact, but some fall flat through poor staging. I'm fine with people singing in a film, though it is a little insipid when villagers pipe in here and there with no clue as to what's going on. It's far too cornball.<br/><br/>Several actors are given songs where there's no way they should be singing them. I often felt really bad for Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan. Neither has any talent for singing, yet Brosnan given 5 songs. You can see them giving it their best shot and trying to have fun. All the guys here look terribly uncomfortable, not unlike guys pulled into the women's wear at a JCPenney by their girlfriends. It's a hens party through and through.<br/><br/>I think America has a real musical phobia going on. We seem repulsed by Broadway, and the only way musicals get to the silver screen is if the music was done by some known band. In Across the Universe it was The Beatles. Now it's ABBA. The double edged sword is that the songs, as was the case in Across the Universe, often have very little to do with the proceedings. In most musicals the music is there to advance the plot and tie in with what is happening. In Mamma Mia!, Characters do not actually get to have discussions, but merely have brief interactions until the next unrelated musical number comes in.<br/><br/>When the movie doesn't try so damn hard, it's fun. Alas, everyone runs around too much, laughs too hard, and it sometimes feels forced. I don't even have to have seen the stage show to know it was better. The film is cute and often fun, but it's like a cloud. It's light and wispy and completely lacking in substance. In many respects it's a fine holiday film for when you're stranded in your house with nowhere to go. Just don't go in asking for anything solid. Mama Mia! gets a B-"

The movie had a very good star cast and most important thing in the movie was the beautiful and time less classics from ABBA which keeps the watcher jolly and singing along the movie. To tell the truth I found the character of Meryl Streep remind me of Eric Cartman's mother in the Comic series ""South Park"". She is kind of slutty lady in the movie. I feel the actors are not exploited to the fullest in the movie. This movie boast of some of the big names in the industry still I feel they were not exploited to their fullest. Actors like Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård could have done much better, but the script did not allow them so. Amanda Seyfried played a very cute role.

","Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married very soon on the Greek Island where she and her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) run an aging hotel. She is crazy about her intended and the feeling is mutual. However, Sophie's major problem is that she has never known her father and there is no one to give her away at her wedding. Finding her mother's long lost journal, Sophie is astounded to learn that her mother was involved with three men at the moment of Sophie's, er, conception. One was Sam (Pierce Brosnan), who left Donna in tears to go back to his fiancé in New York City. After that, for comfort, Donna became entangled with Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgaard) in the following weeks. But, who then, is the real father? Desperate to learn her genetic heritage, Sophie sends secret wedding invitations to all three former suitors, without her mother's knowledge. As Donna's best friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) arrive on the island for the nuptials, so do the three former flames. How will Donna handle the reunion and is Sophie, despite being in love, ready to get married in the face of such complications? This film is so much fun and its songs by Abba are so infectious that I am kicking myself repeatedly for waiting so long to see it. Naturally, the cast plays a big role in the movie's success, for the performers are all charming and they can sing, too. Streep is very humorous as the mother of the bride and she belts out her numbers with ease and talent. Seyfried, too, is most beautiful and touching as the young lady on the verge of marriage and her voice is stunning. As for Brosnan, Firth, Baranski, Skarsgaard, and Walters, they are a hoot and a holler, making the most of every line and every song. Then, too, the setting in Greece is knock-out gorgeous, the costumes are fetching, the script is great fun and the direction snappy and sound. Also, Abba's legendary songs are so catchy and great that who will be able to stop singing them in the shower, in the car or wherever, after a showing? No one. In short, this melodious, super-soaking blast of entertainment should be on everyone's gift list. Any misfortunes, from stubbed toes to root canal to parking tickets, will be totally forgotten as this flick's sunny nature can permeate the most discontented person's soul and bring instant relief."

","This was a fun movie to watch, and entertaining for anybody who is an ABBA fan. The casting, however, left me lacking. Meryl Streep, as much as I love her as an actress, was MUCH too old to play this role. This was a story about a teenage fling that ended in a pregnancy. When turned out by her mother, the teen stays on the island where the fling occurred. Twenty years later, she faces a ""crisis"" when her now 20 year old daughter wants to get married. The actress playing Streep's role, then, should be at most 40 years old. Streep does not pull it off, and in my opinion it detracted from the movie to see her try. The same could be said for her costars, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski."

","The crowd-pleasing stage musical featuring the music of ABBA is brought to effervescent cinematic life here by the original director. Streep plays a single mother, operating a crumbling hotel built atop a Greek island and preparing for her daughter Seyfried's impending wedding and reception. Unbeknownst to her, Seyfried has written letters to the three men who could possibly be her father and has invited them to the wedding! Streep, who already has her hands full with the preparations and with the arrival of her two best pals and former back-up singers when she was a performer, is flabbergasted to come upon the men holed up in an old goat barn. While Seyfried tries to figure out which of the men is her biological father, Streep confronts long-buried feelings and expresses them (along with practically everyone on the island) in song. It may finally be official that Streep can play anything or anyone. While she is certainly guilty of overacting and playing with her hair far too much here, it matters not when she can provide the type of balls-out, ebullient, tuneful performance she grants the film. She, like many of the other participants, is a bit manic and over-expressive, but she's also contagiously energetic and delightful. Seyfried is excellent as well. Not only is she lovely to look at, but she also has an impressive voice and an appealing presence. The potential fathers are played by Brosnan, Firth and Skarsgard, each providing his own brand of charm. Brosnan was raked over the coals for his singing, but really its more the jarring sound of his singing voice versus what's expected rather than him being off-key. It's not a voice particularly suited to this type of music. He also overemphasizes his expressions during playback. Apart from that, he's handsome and likable. Firth is adorable, though he isn't given a great deal to do. Neither is Skarsgard, though he does the best with what he's given. As Streep's friends, Walters and Baranski are over-the-top, but like most others, they win the audience over with their antics and musical contributions. Cooper plays the handsome, young fiancé and is well suited to Seyfried. Rounding out the primary cast are newcomers McDowall and Lilley who play Seyfried's two best friends, echoing the relationship Streep has with her own pals. A (literal!) Greek chorus of villagers pops up throughout to either observe or take part in all the delirium. Director Lloyd does an excellent job of bringing the songs and characters to life. It's an unfortunate side effect that some of the hamminess wasn't reined in just a tad, but most viewers won't mind it that much. Hardcore fans of ABBA may not love seeing a (slight, to say the least!) storyline wrapped around the many famous songs, but most casual fans of the music will delight in seeing them performed with so much gusto and enthusiasm (and, in many cases, surprising skill.) It's either a concept that one is game for or is not. Those in the mood for a lighthearted and colorful fantasy (which does include some heart-tugging sentiment as well) should eat it up like candy. Grinches who expect a little more meat with their movies or who are allergic to froth will likely want to steer clear."

The cast well Meryl Streep shows that she can do it and fills the role brilliantly with gusto and some singing ability. Pierce as has been said is the weakest and Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are comic ladies par excellence, Julie Walters reminding me much of her role in Calendar Girls. We all laughed and the funny items and quiet at the reminiscing points of the film as well. The finale with Meryl was a hoot with the titles starting to flow, felt like you were at at pop concert. Yes sometimes it was a little disjointed but there was a nice piece of ad libbing that shows that it did not need to be sidelined to the DVD extras although I bet there will be loads of hilarious moments. In fact there was for me only one item that let me down and that was the final major scene and the pairing off situation for Colin Firth. They just did the man man thing but was this really the right thing to do. Anyway, this is really a minor thing so if you need to have a laugh to get away from all the frustrations this is really a great film to chill out to. Enjoy."

","My Take: ABBA's music is irresistible... And so is this movie. <br/><br/>(May I just remind the reader than I wasn't really an ABBA fan, and have I seen the stage musical, nor was I aware there even was one).<br/><br/>I was lucky to have seen MAMMA MIA! before it was pushed out of the limelight by bigger blockbusters. Beaten by THE DARK KNIGHT and cleared to make way for other must-see blockbusters including the new MUMMY movie, the long-anticipated X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE or the up and coming animated STAR WARS film, MAMMA MIA! has gone past its prime. I was lucky, later thankful, to have seen it. For not only is MAMMA MIA! a great time, it may be one of the best films I have seen this year since I walked into the new DARK KNIGHT. But while the new Batman movie riveted me and kept me on the edge of my seat, MAMMA MIA! had me joyously entertained and never wiped that smile off my face. Had I overlooked this film, I would have missed one of the best times I had in a theater this year so far.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one: American island girl Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married to her boyfriend Sky (Dominic Cooper). Everything is ready, set before her by her loving and spunky mother Donna (Meryl Streep, brilliant as always), save one thing: Sophie wants her long-lost father to walk her up the isle. Trouble is, she doesn't know who he is. So she finds her mom's diary, looking up who dear ol' daddy could be. Turns out, her mom has date three guys in her young life. Unknown which one could be his father, he invites all three of them to her beautiful scenic island home (a wonderful setting by the way) to attend the wedding. Once Donna, who left those vigorous and spunky teenage life, discovers that her ex's (Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgaard and Colin Firth, respectively) are on the island, sheer delight ensues. While still pretty close with the Brosnan character, there's still no telling who the real dad is.<br/><br/>But who cares! The plot is endearing and simple, but it's the musical numbers of the highest order that keeps me smiling all throughout. From Ms. Streep not seemingly uttering a flaw in her performance of the title song to the film's most energetic number: Streep and co-stars Christine Baranski and Julie Walters performing ""Dancing Queen"". Agreed, not everyone one of the casts can sing as great as the last one. Basically, there's Pierce Brosnan, who's James Bond charisma is simply flawed here once we hear him finally sings to the rhythms of ""SOS"". He's not bad, but needs more singing lessons. But I think that pretty much sums up the very few flaws I had with MAMMA MIA!, and that's hardly a big deal. It's these movies that I recommend anyone to see (even for the PG-13 rating, this film's pretty harmless and always joyous). It's a date flick, could pass as a family flick, but to simply sum it up, it's an entertaining flick. The performances (be it musical or acting) are especially superb. Streep, as always, is a reliable actress who gives yet another stand-out performance, this time demanding more spunk, and she doesn't slip it. Blooming star Amanda Seyfried is one of the best singers throughout the picture, and she has the makings to become a fine actress. Male co-stars Brosnan, Firth, Skarsgaard are especially good and delightful (while not the best singers in the film), but most of all, there's co-stars Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, providing excellent and energetic support as Donna's posse'.<br/><br/>MAMMA MIA! is a great film I enjoyed to have seen before it struts away behind other bigger blockbusters (which in think, expect for THE DARK KNIGHT, are easily topped by this film). It's pleasant, often clever, tuneful and dot, dot, dot! <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Wnt to see Mamma Mia thinking no matter what the producing was like those ABBA songs would soar above any wrong with the film. The stage production of Mamma Mia was fantastic and put all those snobby critics in their place who said it was rubbish.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep was amazing she really threw herself into the part. And that's what makes this film work so well. Everyone is the having fun and don't care what they look like or sound like. Meryll sings ""The winner takes it all"" . The audience got into the swing of th film cheering and clapping something you don't normally see. The great idea of the musical and the film is the way they twist so many songs into the film reaching for Any ideas that will pull them in.The Greek setting was a great idea as the landscape became part of the action too.<br/><br/>This film doesn't take itself seriously. When you hear Pierce Brosnan sing you can see why this has to be light hearted. This is the film oft the summer. Can't see The Dark Knight matching this was shear fun"

","Well this movie overall wasn't bad. The cast was overall very good and there were parts that made me laugh and want to sing.<br/><br/>Pros: Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, and just about everyone else that is part of the main cast have a good voice and can sing and pull it off.<br/><br/>Cons: Pierce Brosnan can not sing at all! The movie is filled with funny parts, colorful scenes to go with the musical numbers throughout the film, and great costumes. The movie is a great movie for people to go to with your family, friends or just a movie that you want to go to because you have nothing better to do. If you like the play then I promise you that you will enjoy this film. Of course some of the musical numbers in the play are missing in the movie. But that is the same for any movie adaption of a play. Good Movie!"

","Mama Mia falls a bit short for me. Meryl Streep is not a believable 40 something. Nor is Pierce, Boranski, her friend or the blond. All are too old for the part. It is a musical. One would hope they could sing and dance a bit. Especially since Meryl was supposed to have been a rock singer. Meryl could just sing. No range. No power. No musical art. Pierce has a poor voice...when measured against pros....Ahh the possibilities.<br/><br/>The story is not low brow. More of a Greek/Shakespearian comedy. People are drawn to island to witness or participate in a wedding and to resolve the bride's parentage issues in order to achieve a standard, white wedding, parental blessing. The Greek Gods (possibly the fairy king?) seem to intercede to confuse a simple plan into a comedy of errors as each player has a separate take on the auspiciousness of such a revelation. Personally, I think the various characters could have been crafted far more artfully and with much greater humor. Ultimately the story reveals a true tragedy of ill starred love....Albeit not nearly as well as Shakespeare would have....Only to have...Aphrodite?.... unleash her well spring of love (and not a little forgiveness) for the benefit of those that have suffered long enough without it. What a wonderful opportunity to do something great...missed."
