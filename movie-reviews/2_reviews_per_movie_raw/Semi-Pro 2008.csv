","I always find that Will Ferrell's films can be a little hit and miss. He's either funny, or he tries a little too hard to be funny. Luckily, in the case of 'Semi-Pro,' he's the former. The film is clearly his vehicle, so whether it works or not is largely down to him. Here he plays Jackie Moon – the owner, coach and player of a low league basketball team who are about to get disbanded, unless they can scrape fourth place in the league.<br/><br/>For a start, you don't have to know or like basketball. I know nothing about it, but I enjoyed the film anyway. Yes, Ferrell is a little over the top here and there, but his performance never really borders on 'annoying.' It's not a long film, only an hour and a half, and most of it is packed with gags (all pretty adult in nature) and the majority of those work.<br/><br/>There are minor plot lines, but they're all secondary to Ferrell. Most other characters are only there to tee up Ferrell for him to deliver the punch line. Woody Harrelson is about the second most important character and he has a little more screen time. He's totally functional too, but Semi-Pro is still Ferrell's baby.<br/><br/>Basically, Semi-Pro won't win any awards. It's daft, loud and dumb, but ultimately very watchable if you're in the mood for a film like that.<br/><br/>Just beware of escaped bears!"

","This movie hinges on one simple fact: do you or do you not just enjoy Will Ferrel? <br/><br/>If the answer to that is yes, then you will enjoy this a lot. Because there's not much new doing here: it's Ferell as another idiotic, self-loving, loud and beef-headed, dim-witted professional...insert obscure profession or athlete. This is just ""Anchorman"", ""Ricky Bobby"", ""Blades of Glory"", or what have you, except in basketball. If you enjoy those movies, and Will Ferrel's shameless antics (I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying I want to see him try something else now and then) then here's one for you.<br/><br/>But I also give kudos to the supporting players (like Woody Harrelson, who in a stroke of brilliance, is acting like he's in a real drama and not a spoof), the inspired 70's soundtracks and references. 6/10"

","One of the joys of being a university student is getting invited to free sneak previews. I went to one last night, where the front half of the theater was packed with students while the back was filled with members of the writing team, taking careful notes on which jokes we did and did not laugh at. For the most part, the reaction was positive, and the jokes that failed miserably will probably get edited out by the time the movie officially opens.<br/><br/>The movie was pretty sports-comedy formulaic, with the down-and-out lovable losers getting a big chance, then introducing a new character who will inspire them, and a few montages later, the big finale. The R-rating was used mainly on adding in lots of cuss-words, with mixed humorous results. There was a really funny joke about masturbation. I was hoping for a little more basketball craziness, but oh well. <br/><br/>The highlight, of course, was Will Ferrel meeting the 70s. I myself was not alive in the 70s, so I only know about the culture through the disco-funk lens of caricature cinema. Ferrel is one funky mofo so he thrives. I would say this was one of his better efforts, topping Taladega nights, Elf, and the ice skating one. It's not as good as Anchorman, mainly because it's just not as quotable. <br/><br/>In short, if you like Will Ferrel, or 70s funk (the soundtrack is hella dope), see this movie."
"Liz8675309","5","65","96","1 March 2008"," Not bad, not great - like most of Ferrell's recent efforts
","I went to this movie with low expectations - I think that helped.<br/><br/>I love Will Ferrell - his deadpan moments, his crazy moments, his flat shouting - so will see pretty much anything he does.<br/><br/>Unlike Anchorman, this movie suffers from lack of inspiration. The film itself is pretty much several short films / skits held together by the premise of an ABA (semi-pro) team's hope to join the NBA.<br/><br/>Some of Ferrell's regular cohorts rejoin him - Will Arnett (Blades of Glory), Andy Richter (Elf), David Koechner (a standout in Anchorman) - and all do good jobs, but no one really shines.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie? Andre Benjamin. As an Atlanta girl, I grew up loving Outkast. He proved his acting prowess in Four Brothers, and he flexes his comedic muscles as the team's star, Coffee Black, and steals every scene he's in. With his giant afro and '70's funk, he is the most convincing and likable character in the movie. (With the possible exception of Dewey the bear.) I'll still see any movie that Will Ferrell does, but now I'll also see any of Andre Benjamin's. <br/><br/>If you like Ferrell or just want a pleasant diversion (it is rated R for lots of language), Semi-Pro is worth a look. But be forewarned: this is far more Blades of Glory mediocrity than Anchorman delectable satire."
"lucas_mrz","8","5","5","7 August 2019"," A damn good comedy.
","When you watch a comedy -at least when I do- you want to laugh. If the movie doesn't make you laugh then is a bad comedy. If it does, then is a good one, even if it doesn't have any sense. This is the case, a good comedy, really funny, and yes, totally stupid but in a good way."

","I really can't stand the site of Will Farrell, and I usually find him anything but funny. I hated Ron Burgundy and thought Elf was trite, but i have to say I pretty much laughed my way throughout this entire movie.<br/><br/>It was made as a comedy, which it excels at being, but it is also a really good period piece on the 70's (love the fro's). The story was also really good, a bit predictable but well done - I found myself caring about the characters and the out come of the story.<br/><br/>I was entertained throughout this entire movie, and i would add this movie amongst other American comedy classics such as Family Vacation, Uncle Buck or even Planes, Trains and Automobiles... all very different movies, but ones that made us laugh and kept us smiling."

","Semi-pro will not go down in the anals of great comedies. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a plot synopsis, well this movie is not for you. It's pretty short on story and pretty high on funny bits.<br/><br/>The one thing I will say is that the film is not overpowered by Will Ferrell silliness. Oh don't mistake me there is some silliness but it is only part of a greater picture. <br/><br/>It has 4-5 hilarious scenes and many lines that will be quotable for a long time. I left the theatre laughing and repeating line with my friends. And really what more are you asking for in a Will Ferrell Comedy???"
"mm-39","8","8","10","13 March 2008"," Funy movie
","Read the old ABA web page and find out how much of the movie is true. Semi pro has many influences from the ABA. The slam dunk style, bear wrestling, and cow milking contests were some of the funny material which made a great movie. Real life is funnier than fiction. Semi pro has great material too work with. A goofy movie with a no better goofy actor than Will Ferrell. Ferrell pulls off a hard acting job of a fly by the seat of his pants owner/coach/manager and player etc ABA operator. The acting and directing is great but the true star which shines is the script, which is influenced by real life. Low ball humor, not for the whole family. 8 out of 10. My buddy Dax and his wife enjoyed the movie. What does the Tropics have to do with Flint, Michigan? I think the team moved from Florida. Funny the Nuggets almost went to the final in their first year with the NBA. I guess that is why the NHL stripped the WHA Jets of their team before they merged. Just an after thought."
"Shattered_Wake","6","16","24","29 February 2008"," Funny enough at times, but contains way too many random moments
","Will Ferrell returns (like he ever left) with another slapstick comedy. . . 'Semi-Pro,' the story of an ABA basketball team, the Flint Tropics, fighting to be accepted into the NBA.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic. . . Woody Harrelson plays the newly traded point guard Monix, André Benjamin of Outkast plays the star of the team Clarence 'Coffee' Black, and Will Ferrell plays the coach, owner, promoter, power forward, and choreographer Jackie Moon. Also making an appearance are Maura Tierney (ER) as the former love interest of Monix; Will Arnett (Arrested Development) as the colour commentator; Andy Richter (Late Night with Conan O'Brien) as. . . Jackie's son-friend; Ed Helms (The Office) as Turtleneck; and David Koechner (Anchorman) as the Commissioner.<br/><br/>The film itself, however. . . well, there are some problems. Many scenes (including one about vomit, one with a burnt out hippie winning $10,000, etc.) seem unnecessary and out of place seeing as most of them have almost no 'bear'ing (you'll get it later) on the plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>Also, while I have nothing against swearing and am completely against censourship. . . the 'foul language' in this film just seems forced and only added to give itself an R rating. Other than a brief (and non-nude) sex scene, there's nothing else at all that would've warranted its R rating. Maybe it was a marketing move (thinking an R would get them more in the box office after all the hate for PG-13 ), or maybe it's just annoying writing by Scot Armstrong whose only PG-13 films (School for Scoundrels and Starsky and Hutch) are pretty awful. Either way, it didn't seem worth it.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film itself is entertaining, but unoriginal. There's nothing really special about it, but it's still a funny comedy worth checking out if that's what you're in the mood for.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 6/10.<br/><br/>Postscript: No. . . as some people are saying about this. . . the 'alley oop' bit at the end. . . it's not true.<br/><br/>-AP3-"
"stewiefan201","7","26","44","20 March 2008"," Semi-Pro is only semi-funny, but Will Ferrell is still at the top of his game.
","Semi-Pro takes place in the 1970s and is all about a small time basketball team named the Flint Michigan Tropics. The head coach, owner, and promoter is Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) and he and his team dream of expanding to be part of the big time NBA. However Jackie is told that in order to actually have a chance at getting into the NBA, the Tropics have to get at least 2000 fans in their stadium by deadlines. The problem is that the Tropics do a little more dancing, fighting, and flailing around the court than actually playing the game. So Jackie hires a new team player named Monix (Woody Harrelson) who actually used to play for the NBA. From there on in it's up to Jackie, Monix, and the whole team to fire up some wild and crazy events for the crowd and actually learn to play the sport properly for once in order to reach their dreams.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell has made a bunch of funny movies already. Whether it be Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, and Old School. I haven't seen all of them but I heard they were all funny, mostly because of Will Ferrell's comedic brilliance. Semi-Pro is a funny film but it's really only semi-funny, whereas the rest of Ferrell's movies were hilarious romps. Semi-Pro seems undercooked in the hilarious gag department offering a few very funny moments, but the rest of the movie only has little jokes that usually only offer giggles. My favorite moment in Semi-Pro is when Jackie Moon gets called on a foul by the ref (Also the church priest), and Jackie yells in his face an obscenity and ""I'll kill your family!"" Another scene that will end up a Will Ferrell classic is when he wrestles a bear, and it ends up attacking him and then getting loose in the stadium.<br/><br/>The music in Semi-Pro is awesome with its funky 70s soundtrack. There's also a song played through the movie sung by Jackie Moon called ""Love Me Sexy"", and it is as funny a song as Will Ferrell can bring. The rest of the cast includes Outkast's talented Andre Benjamin, Maura Tierney, and Will Arnett and Andrew Daly as two hilarious TV show hosts and broadcasters for the Tropics. Woody Harrelson does a fine job in Semi-Pro but he's never funny, all because the script makes his character Monix serious instead of funny. Maura Tierney really just sits around without much to really do, and even Andre Benjamin's character is made too serious to give us any laughs. I just don't understand why so many of the characters in Semi-Pro were so serious. This is a Will Ferrell comedy, everyone should have some funny moments. This problem is what makes Semi-Pro a mixed bag because only half the movie is really very funny, the rest of the movie is pulled down by far too much seriousness.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell and the musical soundtrack are what elevate Semi-Pro to the point where I can recommend it. Will Ferrell is still a very funny guy and I'm sure he has a lot more hilarious comedies on the way in the mere future. But Semi-Pro pretty much gives Ferrell all the funny moments, when his other movies like Anchorman gave the other characters classic moments as well. I give Semi-Pro a 2.5 out of 4, and a recommendation. It has its moments but is dragged down by far too many unfunny characters."
"velcrohead","7","27","46","21 March 2008"," Silly movie...but what did you expect?
","I never for a moment believed that this movie would be earth-shattering or mind-blowing. I expected it to be along the lines of ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Kicking & Screaming,"" and it was. There were a few laugh out loud moments, and a few mildly amusing stretches, and then there were parts that just weren't funny at all.<br/><br/>But the overall experience wasn't that bad, considering I was just looking for a movie that would make me laugh and pass the night away on those rare date nights with my wife.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I had about it was the language. I thought some of the profanity was a bit excessive, especially considering past Will Ferrell movies. And that's really all the R rating is there for."
"mrtimlarabee","5","17","28","28 March 2008"," Hate to rehash the reviews, but it is indeed only semi funny
","Semi Pro is half good. It starts off great. We are introduced with Jackie Moon's big hit ""Love Me Sexy"" and learn that his team, The Flint Tropics team isn't that good and Moon spent his money for the team really for his love of basketball.<br/><br/>The first half is great, as it applies a usual Will Ferrel formula - have a very basic plot to allow Will Ferrel and co to display their antics with really little attention to the plot. We go to see Ferrel display his antics after all. The best display of this is when Jackie Moon and some of his friends are playing a poker game. It has some of the fun ad libbed dialogue Ferrel's movies are known for and is one of those scenes you know will have outtakes on the DVD.<br/><br/>The film's failure is it's plot. In a Will Ferrel movie, Ferrel should be the center of attention, yet as the plot moves forward, that honor seems to pass to Woody Harrleson, who's good in his role, but doesn't supply the necessary humor the film needs. Meanwhile, Ferrel is left with little to do except for some of the wacky bits like Ferrel wrestling a bear.<br/><br/>So as the film progresses, there is a feeling of the usual basketball film, where the rag tag team tries their best to be successful. In all this, the humor seems to be dissipating, and the Ferrel machine seems to be running out of gas. Really a shame, because the promotional materials for this movie were hilarious."
"m-rugen","10","39","75","29 February 2008"," People forget that Will Ferrell's movies are randomness.
","So far I am the fourth person to rate this movie; and I honestly don't agree with anybody else here. I really only rate movies I truly enjoyed, and this is one of them. I don't think anybody that has seen Will's movies and disliked them should be commenting on here.<br/><br/>This movie, along with Anchorman and Talladega Nights, is just a whole bunch of funny, cruel, and vulgar jokes thrown into a 90-minute story line...and it's awesome.<br/><br/>Also, the fact that it's loosely based upon a real merger between the ABA and NBA fits the movie. Sports movies with fake teams and cities is getting overly boring.<br/><br/>As many people will tell you, the unrated versions of Anchorman and Talladega Nights blow the original PG-13 rating out of the water. And for this, is why the writers had to make this movie rated R to begin with.<br/><br/>The movie was designed for Will Ferrell. Granted, it's another sports movie with him, but he pulls it off again. Wrestling a bear, performing dance, and singing a song called 'Love Me Sexy' has absolutely nothing to do with basketball, but it works. Like I said, all his movies are a bunch of random jokes thrown together to fit a storyline.<br/><br/>This movie, to me, is better than Talladega Nights. If you like Will Ferrell, you will LOVE this movie. If you don't like Will Ferrell, you need to get yourself checked out."
"chi-cerca-trova","3","60","121","7 April 2008"," Proof of Ferrel's weakness
","This movie is a perfect example of why Will Ferrel needs to find his purpose quick before he becomes irrelevant.<br/><br/>After sitting through this movie, I began to ponder why I did not like it. It had all the Ferrel-isms of movies past. Ron Burgandy, Chad Michael Michaels, Ricky Bobby, etc. all made an appearance. So, why had a classic formula failed so miserably here? And then it hit me. It's because Will Ferrel CANNOT carry a movie on his own. He is a great catalyst for the actions with in a movie, however he cannot be a movie. True, Ron Burgandy was a hilarious character, but what about his news crew? How many lines are quoted from this quartet of idiots? Or Chad Michael Michaels? Will Ferrel needs to remember his strength lies in a strong comedic ensemble. While he has demonstrated some actual acting talent, he still will never be able to carry a film on his own."

","Take the cutting room jokes in Anchor Man, A not funny Woody Harrelson and the inability to take jokes far enough to make them funny and you have semi-pro.<br/><br/>A few cheap laughs here and there and a bare chested Will Ferrill weren't enough to keep me awake during this poorly written failure of a comedy. Co-non stars weren't funny and the direction reminded me of one of my 1st college films.<br/><br/>When the openings credits started to the 70's sexual funk sung by Ferrill I thought I was in for a good time. 10 minutes later I was looking at my watch hoping for a phone call to have an excuse to relieve myself of this dull, thrown together, forgettable flick. With so much material to reference to - Short shorts, Afros, mustaches, and over the top announcers you would think there would be more comedy than a few masturbation jokes.<br/><br/>Save this one for a rental when you have time to consume plenty of alcohol before viewing."

","Figured the holiday was a great time to catch this movie, which I wasn't overly excited about, but thought it would be something to do on a lazy afternoon.<br/><br/>Got to the cinema a tad early and sat down and played some golf on my phone. About 10 mins in and I was the only one there. Awesome. Sadly about 5mins later two losers with no friends walked in, making it a cosy cinema of 3.<br/><br/>The film starts with a pre-game intro of the Flint Tropics, a struggling team in the former ABA basketball league. We learn from the get go that Jackie Moon (Ferrell, in a role not much of a stretch for him) is the team owner, promoter, coach as well as a player. Jackie brought the team on the back of his one-hit wonder ""Love Me Sexy"" and is in it just for the fame and fun. Before too long Jackie finds out his team will absorbed by the ABA-NBA merger...unless he can get them in the Top 4 teams. Jackie goes out and signs (from a trade for a washing machine) Monix, played by formerly good actor Woody Harrelson in a minor attempt to tun things around. Soon he makes some other changes, such as agreeing to let Monix become coach to get his team into the NBA. Will it work......? See it to find out.<br/><br/>There's some more good quirky Ferrell humour, but this isn't a classic. The story had a lot more potential but in some circumstances went too oddball and weird and missed some good opportunities, probably largely due to the extra screen time given to Ferrell. Give him a few better support comedians and this could have been a classic. They missed some great opportunities with the basketball action too. One of the early scenes was gold.....but then after that very little was paid attention to."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","2","26","53","2 March 2008"," Will Ferrell can hold a 15 minute skit, not an hour and a half movie
","I work in a movie theater part time and we got Semi-Pro, now I hate Will Ferrell with a passion, I don't get how people love his movies, some of them are funny, but it's more of his side characters that get the laughs from me. But I figured, I needed a laugh after work and I decided to just go ahead and see the movie, it might have a few good laughs, I saw it for fee and even that was too much for what this film was. I'm very much not kidding, this movie, the theater was about 75% full and there was only two people who laughed, even that was just a chuckle. I don't get what is so funny about making Will Ferrell puke, in fact let's play on that joke quite a bit so it becomes more awkward. Let's also put in jokes that refer to ""the future"" since it's set in the 70's, that'll be a blast. And also, let's put in some extremely uncomfortable shots of Will Ferrell's crotch, yeah, that was so funny, that I wanted to puke.<br/><br/>Jackie Moon is a one hit wonder in the 70's, but with the money he made off that, he buys the Flint Tropical's, a team that once was great, but now stink. They have an opportunity though to go to the NBA if they can be one of the top four teams to win the games. With the help of a former champion basketball player, Monix, who has lost it basically, they'll try to achieve the best, by getting fourth place. Jackie comes up with some stupid publicity stunts to get an audience as well.<br/><br/>Semi-Pro is seriously, just stupid, I'm not saying that because of Will Ferrell, I just mean this film is very unfunny and the only part that made me laugh was the bear attacking Will Ferrell, sad, huh? I'm really not trying to be a hater on this film, but how do people laugh at this junk? Will Ferrell plays the same character in each of his films, doesn't anyone catch on? The characters in this film are not likable at all because they're not explained well.

"jon.h.ochiai","7","15","29","2 March 2008"," Could have been...
","In the opening of Director Kent Alterman's ""Semi-Pro"" Will Ferrell as 70's One Hit Wonder Jackie Moon provides his musical stylings of his song ""Do Me Sexy"". Will Ferrell sings his disco song straight up in character and is hysterical. Although given the promising start Alterman and Writer Scot Armstrong's movie really falls flat, despite some big laughs. I particularly cracked up at the halftime bit where Jackie dressed as 'Mr. Sun' and the rest of his Tropics teammates are dressed as sea creatures. Some of the supporting performances are pretty good including Woody Harrelson playing a quasi-realistic Monix and Andre Benjamin as Tropics leading scorer Clarence Black. Will Ferrell is at his best playing obtuse, lovable, and arrogant Jackie. However, the problem with ""Semi-Pro"" over the long haul (all 90 minutes) is that it is not smart stupidit is stupid stupid. I was really a fan of ""Blades of Glory"" and ""Talladega Nights"". ""Semi-Pro"" is not nearly as funny as either. Understandably, if you are not a fan of Big Will, then disregard the previous, and pretty much most of this comment. The ending of ""Semi-Pro"" is incongruously bittersweet. This seems so out of place. Then again, arguing for context in ""Semi-Pro"" is futile.<br/><br/>The premise of ""Semi-Pro"" is actually funny. Realize I am referring to the premise, only. 70's disco star Jackie Moon (Ferrell) scores with his number one smash ""Do Me Sexy"". He parlays his new found wealth by buying ABA Basketball Teamthe Flint Tropics. This vanity project also includes Jackie being the Tropics Player-Coach. Having no basketball acumen as player or coach, the Tropics reign the cellar of the division. Then the ABA Commissioner (funny David Koechner) announces that 4 ABA teams would merge with the NBA. Unfortunately, that does not include the Tropics. However, natural promoter Jackie convinces the ABA Commission that the 4 teams with the best records should be allowed to merge. Still the Tropics are not among the top 4 teams, yet. In an edgy move Jackie trades the Team's ice machine for retired NBA player Monix (solid Woody Harrelson). Monix had won an NBA Championship with the Celtics, although he spent his time on the bench during the playoff run. Minor detail. All the narrative elements are poised. However, ""Semi-Pro"" misfires on all cylinders. Granted there is a hilarious gag that runs a little long with Jackie wrestling a bear. One hysterical bit has Jackie conflicted as his Tropics lead an opponent; however, if they score more than 125 points, it's free corn dog night. And Jackie doesn't have the corn dogs.<br/><br/>It's too bad that ""Semi-Pro"" is not completely hysterical. Perhaps, the Will Ferrell sports' farces have run their course. Maybe next time Will fares better with X-Games or Extreme Fighting? Maybe."

Only the top four teams chosen in this league will survive so Jackie hires a ready to retire pro named Monix ( Woody Harrelson) to lift his team.<br/><br/>The level of humour is not particular strong in this film and Will's comedy style gets a bit tedious. Non the less Will and Woody lift an otherwise struggling comedy to some worthwhile entertainment.<br/><br/>This is no where as good as ""Blades of Glory"" but good light entertainment and the audience were laughing right through it."
"jack-penrose","7","2","2","3 July 2008"," Entertaining, but not the stuff of his heyday.
","As a student, I have always enjoyed Will Ferrell films. In fact I have walked out of some films still in stitches. I have really enjoyed Old School, Anchorman and Kicking and Screaming as well as his Saturday Night Live DVDs. He does tend to play either the arrogant tool (Ron Burgundy) or the angry idiot (Frank The Tank) and he has done this well. I also enjoyed his other cameo roles in Zoolander and Wedding Crashers. However, it seems that he is getting more disappointing nowadays, which is a shame (Talladega Nights a prime example).<br/><br/>I watched Semi-Pro on a plane and I have to say it was funny (I remember waking up four people laughing at the puke scene so much) but I struggled to find any storyline to it. However I have never required a storyline with a Ferrell movie before.<br/><br/>Set in the 70s, Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, a cross between Burgundy and Frank the Tank (although not brilliant). He takes control of the Flint Tropics, an all-show basketball team. He becomes coach, owner, choreographer and power-forward for his own team! When he discovers that only 4 teams will be merged into the NBA, he decides that he is going to try and improve his teams fortunes to ensure they get into the NBA. Moon's only talent is promoting, as seen by his ""corn dog night"" and when he wrestles a bear to increase struggling ticket prices. To get his team to the NBA from bottom of the ABA, he enlists Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson) who tries to give some structure back to his team while rekindling an old flame.<br/><br/>That is pretty much the story, it doesn't really move as a plot, but it is simply hilarious in parts. The funny parts include when Jackie Moon wrestles a bear, an impromptu poker game between Jackie and his friends (irrelevent to the plot, but still funny!) and plenty of decent one-liners.<br/><br/>The main comic attraction is not Ferrell's anger or arrogance in character (Like in previous movies) but in the commentators of the game, where Lou Redwood (Will Arnett) and Dick Pepperfield (Andrew Daly) are simply hilarious as a satire of sports commentators, Redwood being the colourful claims-he-was-in-Vietnam tyro, with lines such as ""I like to smoke when I drink"" after Pepperfield asks him if he wouldn't mind putting his cigarette out while supposedly commentating on a game. Pepperfield is the old-school, reassuring nice guy of commentating, and nearly all the funny jokes are about his wife! Harrelson is good in his role of resurgent former great, and brings a good edge to the film, and Andre Benjamin is good as Clarence, the only decent player for the Tropics. He is funny in places too.<br/><br/>To summarise, Semi-Pro is very funny in certain places, vaguely interesting at points, but is quite crude, non-purposeful nor thought-provoking. But I really enjoyed it, it brightened my flight anyways! It is a shame that the only thing I can say about this is that it is funny and entertaining, but I have come to expect that except for Blades of Glory, this is the latest in a less enjoyable category of Ferrell films. I hope he creates something very good in the future, but I wouldn't bet on it.<br/><br/>If you like Will Ferrell you will like this, if not, make sure you have your pillow ready and are seated comfortably - It's going to be a long flight."

I just got back from seeing it, and I have to say that it was what we fans of Ferrell dream about: a funny movie with Will Ferrell in a ridiculously over the top role where anything goes.

"Bettlejuice","4","6","10","3 September 2008"," Will Ferrel plays another sport
","It can be said that any Will Ferrell movie can be summed up by the following Mad Lib: Will Ferrel plays (character name). He plays (sport) and is the best in the world until (problem) causes him to fall from grace. Watch as he works back to the top of his game. He even sings (title of a song) and says the line ""I will (do something uncomfortable) to your face."" Watch for a cameo from (other member of the frat pack).<br/><br/>As far as the Will Ferrell plays sports genre goes, Simi Pro falls on the lower end of the scale. This time the sport is basket ball and the movie is set in the 70s to give Ferrel an excuse to have his hair big and his shorts small. If you loved Blades of Glory and Talladega Nights then you will probably have a good idea of what this movie is willing to offer. However, even then you might want to be prepared for disappointment.<br/><br/>At this point even Ferrell sees to realize that he seems to be making the same movie over and over again and wonders whats the point here when they could just go watch Talladega Nights again. At least then Ferrell looked dedicated to the character. Even the movie seems to forget that he is the main character every now and then, focusing instead on Woody Harrelson, who seems to not realize that he is in a comedy, as he pines for an old flame.<br/><br/>Ferrell still says lines that will probably end up on T-shirts, (If You have a small child use it as a shield)and is willing to have the camera pointed directly at his crotch, but the movie will probably end up in a Best of Will Ferrell collection a few years down the road and you can wait until then."

","I am a Will Ferrell fan. I've liked all of his movies and I own them all. Whether it's fair or not, this movie will be regarded as a blemish on his career. Was it good? No. All of his other movies can be watched over and over, but if you watch this one once, you won't care to watch it again, and if you're like me, you'll be upset that you just lost an hour and a half of your life that you can never get back. I don't think this is Will Ferrell's fault though, unless he wrote the script. I also happen to be a fan of Woody Harrelson. I think it takes an exceptional hunk-of-crap script to wreck a movie with these two established comedic actors.<br/><br/>To whoever greenlit this crapwagon - what the frig were you thinking? Will Ferrell already fought a bear in Anchorman. And has the underdog basketball team theme not been used 97 FRIGGING TIMES already?

"Buddy-51","3","6","10","2 July 2008"," ""Semi-Pro"" is All-Bad
","""Semi-Pro"" is an aggressively unfunny dumb-jock comedy that marks a possible low point in the careers of Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney (although the latter, lucky for her, is not really in the movie long enough to do her reputation permanent damage).<br/><br/>It's the 1970's and the short-lived American Basketball Association (1967-1976) is getting ready to close its doors due to a lack of money and little interest on the part of the three major networks in televising its games. However, four of the league's top-ranking teams will remain intact and be absorbed into the more successful NBA. That means that the Tropics, the fictitious team from Flint, Michigan, will soon be disbanding, unless the players can get their act together and reverse their current losing streak. Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, who doubles as both the head coach and one of the key players on the Tropics. As such, it's his job to whip the players into shape if the team is to have any hope of becoming one of the chosen four.<br/><br/>Here is a movie in which literally nothing works - not the concept, not the performances and certainly not the writing. Indeed, the makers of ""Semi-Pro"" seem to think that merely throwing the decidedly doughy Ferrell into a basketball uniform and having him shooting hoops with a bunch of equally dweeby knuckleheads would be just too hilarious for words. It isn't. In fact, in this movie virtually every joke, pratfall and sight gag lands on the court with a resounding thud, despite the best efforts of its hapless cast. I guess the one lesson to be gleaned from all this is that funky fashions and quaint '70's references alone are not enough to carry a movie, especially when one is stuck with a script as devoid of taste, imagination and humor as the one Scot Armstrong has come up with here.<br/><br/>And, of course, as appears to be the case with all the worst comedies, ""Semi-Pro"" finds it necessary to end with an outtake blooper reel, on the bizarre assumption that if we didn't laugh at any of the bits that DID make it into the final product, then we will somehow fall on the floor in hysterics at all the ones that DIDN'T. Sorry, fellas, but I believe I gave my all by sitting through the actual movie to be still hanging around seeing what I missed.<br/><br/>Dopey and depressing."
"iamsam8989","3","6","10","31 May 2008"," A Dismal Movie for Ferrell
","I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell, so I already had low expectations for Semi-Pro, but when I watched the movie I couldn't believe I'd actually be disappointed even further! Nothing captured my attention and Ferrell's role seemed to follow suit with every other character he has ever played: haughty, stupid, and somehow, in a role of leadership. At least Anchorman was able to spin some actually comedy, although i feel Ferrel's supporting cast helped out tremendously. With Semi-Pro, however, I lost interest about fifteen, twenty minutes into the movie and let it play on simply for background noise.<br/><br/>Way to disappoint."
"portnoys_disciple","5","6","10","11 March 2008"," And I thought it was actually going to be funny.
","For the most part, I like Will Ferrell's comedy. I really do. I loved Talladega Nights, to be honest. I laughed throughout the whole thing. I had expected this to be a good bounce-back from Blades of Glory. I prayed that Mr. Ferrell just happened to make a flop and was back to making good movies. I was wrong.<br/><br/>I felt the plot itself was solid--I really like it as a non-comedic movie. But it insists on itself--it just begs to be laughed at. The problem with that is that it insists in all the wrong ways. For example, Shaun of the Dead is one of my all-time favorites, mostly because of the fact that it is a rather serious subject with scenes that could be seen as horrific and yet maintains to be laugh-out-loud hilarious every time I watch it. It insists on being a good movie, not on getting you to laugh at cheap jokes. That's where Semi-Pro went wrong. You have to either be ridiculous with a handful of serious elements (ala The Big Lebowski) or serious with a handful of comedic elements (ala Shaun of the Dead). Semi-Pro doesn't fit into either, because it's not good enough in either one of those categories.<br/><br/>I probably only laughed out loud maybe three or four times throughout the whole movie, and more out of a response to pure nonsense than actual comedic value. Like, ""....what?!"" rather than a response to pure hilarity. I am reminded of the ""I'm on fire!"" scene from Talladega Nights--hilarity. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous--you just couldn't NOT laugh at it. This movie attempts to achieve the same ludicrous hilarity that Talladega Nights had...and fails miserably.<br/><br/>If you're a huge fan of Will Ferrell's comedy, or just Will Ferrell in general, then you may like this. Again, don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible movie, but don't expect anything epic. Unless, of course, you expect an epic fail, in which case you may be pleased.<br/><br/>So overall: decent movie, good storyline, great cast, horrible jokes and even worse comedic value lands it a 5 out of 10."

It's certainly ridiculous and over the top but i think added to how funny it was. All I know is that I was laughing pretty hard most of the way through.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is a favorite of mine, i grew up with him on SNL and I've loved most of his movies.

It is very obvious they forced this rating up to 'R' with the addition of as many F bombs as possible, making the dialog choppy and reminiscent of junior high. I typically don't mind language if it's funny or appropriate, but this was neither. I give it one extra star because of maybe a couple chuckles.<br/><br/>All in all, don't bring your kids, don't even bring yourself.

"ryansbabygirl0804","3","9","18","8 March 2008"," Another Huge Disappointment
","I would like to first say that the only reason I give this film 3 stars is because I am usually a major Will Ferrell fan. I normally find him hilarious and would be quoting lines from his films for months along with my husband. Well with his last movie ""Blades of Glory"" I received no lines to quote. It was awful. So when we were invited by friends last night to see Will Ferrell's latest ""Semi-Pro"", I thought I might be in for some big laughs. I was VERY disappointed. <br/><br/>The start of the film is very promising and almost gives you a false sense of security that this film won't be as bad as ""Blades"". Unfortunately for anyone who has the misguided notion to pay to see this movie, It was worse! It's almost as if Will Ferrell has run out of funny things to do. It's like he's sitting around thinking of careers that he can somehow make funny with the same old boring jokes time and time again. It's like he took his ""Anchorman"" character Ron Burgundy and turned him into Ricky Bobby, Chazz Michael Michaels, and Jackie Moon simply by changing their hair and clothes. It's the exact SAME character, no real acting required. And even though that was absolutely hilarious at first, it's getting just 'A LOT' tiring. Not to mention that some of his usual group of friends that appear with him in his movies, had no funny lines in this movie. They almost all played serious characters which made Ferrell look like even more of an idiot. Woody Harrelson's character was brought into this movie for God knows what reason because he was almost useless to the plot. Including his subplot with Lynn (Maura Tierney). I couldn't help but be embarrassed for her to be such an insignificant character in such a horrible film.<br/><br/>""Semi-Pro"" doesn't move past it's promising beginning, instead it falls completely flat. Usually the lack of plot and point to Will Ferrell's movies is actually part of their charm, in his latest films including this one, it isn't. He really needs to step it up for the next one because he is in danger of losing his fan base. We'll all be sitting around watching ""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"", and ""Elf"" on DVD."

","Semi-Pro was such a funny movie. The whole movie was extremely funny. It's not easy to make me laugh in movies either so when it does it has to mean it is a funny movie. Will Farrell was very good and did everything perfect for this part. Woody Harrelson also brought a lot to this movie. Andre Benjamin keeps shining in each and every movie he plays in. He will only get better and better as the more movies he plays in. The thing that made the movie even better than it was is because it is rated R. It had a lot of adult humor and lots of stuff for teens. They talked a lot about sex and some very dirty things. It was still done it very good taste despite it being rated R and the dirty humor. It also taught us to be able to play are hearts out and give it everything we got even if we don't have anything to play for. From the very start of this movie till the end it was hilarious. I laughed my butt off at a few different scenes. It will most likely have you laughing hard. That is if you like comedy movies with lots of funny sex related humor. If you can't handle some sex related talks then this is not a good movie for you. One main reason I ended up seeing this movie was because it was about basketball. The whole story pretty much revolved around basketball in one aspect or another. It was about Jackie Moon trying to save his ABA team from being terminated by the end of the year. The NBA is going to take four of the best teams from the ABA to go to the NBA at the end of the season. Jackie Moon is trying to get his team to be one of those four teams. It was cool how the movie had a 70's or 80's story to it. It made it even better taking place in the older days. In those years they didn't even no what an alley-oop was which was very funny. Overall I thought this movie was laugh out loud funny. It should be seen by anyone who likes comedy movies."
"DICK STEEL","6","6","11","23 March 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Semi-Pro
","Will Ferrell continues with sports theme comedies with Semi-Pro, a throwback to the 70s where the American Basketball Association (ABA) is merged in part with the National Basketball Association (NBA) which we are all quite familiar with. With his Talladega Nights on Nascar racing and Blades of Glory on ice figure skating, if I were to rank his latest effort amongst the three, unfortunately it will be ranked the last.<br/><br/>Talladega Nights really cracked me up, and there were many moments where I laughed until my tears became uncontrollable - that's the personal gauge I use for comedies just in case you want to know. With Blades of Glory, it gets a little tired with his selfish character trying to go one up against his closest rival, which sort of degenerated into dramatic fare of brotherhood and friendship. With Semi-Pro, he continues with this character trait of cockiness (yes, it does get very tired after a while) as owner-coach-player of a fictional ABA team known as the Flint Tropics.<br/><br/>As the story goes, the ABA is into its final season because of the impending merger with the NBA, and the top 4 teams will get absorbed into the NBA, while the rest will have to be dissolved. So it's up to Ferrell's Jackie Moon to motivate his team, and to wheel and deal with the operational aspects of the game like boosting dwindling attendances and designing gimmicks, to keep their hopes alive. Having an incompetent team, save for star player Clarence ""Coffee"" Black (Andre Benjamin from Outkast), means that realistically they're no- hopers for the top 4 spots, at least not until Jackie trades a washing machine (don't ask) for an NBA player Monix (Woody Harrelson), who comes in to impart some of his elite knowledge of the game, despite being unpopular at first, and even causing a <br/><br/>Actually, I thought that comedy was quite secondary in Semi-Pro. What it did have however are attention to detail on the differences between the ABA and the NBA leagues, starting with the multi-colored ball used. Half-time entertainment, courtesy of Jackie Moon, seemed very tired, with the best bits already included in the trailer. Other than that, the movie's quite bogged down by Harrelson's role in holding a candle for an ex-flame, which unfortunately didn't get past the censors scissors.<br/><br/>But credit be given though to 2 things in the movie. One, a scene where the major players are seated around a table gambling, and involving a revolver, which does take a heck of its own sweet time to get to the point and deliver its punchline which somewhat fizzled. The other, is the totally inane song Love Me Sexy. Without these two elements, Semi-Pro really deserves to be relegated."
"the-movie-guy","3","27","71","27 February 2008"," Movie filled with sight-gags and very little meat
","(Synopsis) Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) is the owner, promoter, coach, and star player of the Flint Michigan Tropics of the American Basketball Association (ABA). In 1976 before the ABA collapses, the National Basketball Association (NBA) plans to merge with the best teams of the ABA at the end of the season. Only the top four teams will make the move and the worst teams will fold. The Tropics are the worst team in the league and if they want to make it to the NBA, Jackie Moon must rally his team and start winning. The only problem with that scenario is the fact that Jackie Moon is not really the coach and star basketball player he thinks he is. He was able to buy the Tropics franchise with proceeds that he had earned from his hit song ""Love Me Sexy"". To keep his team from oblivion and leave his mark in the city, Jackie Moon must inspire his team to win fourth place in the playoffs. Jackie trades a washing machine to another team for a former NBA benchwarmer, Monix (Woody Harrelson) to reach his goal. This was Monix's last season before he retires, and he wants to go out in a blaze of glory.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The premise of this sports-comedy movie is loosely based on spoofing the old ABA basketball league. The story tells how the worst team in the ABA with a bench of down and out losers is given a second chance at winning the big game. Will Ferrell's character is the one who must inspire the team to reach inside themselves and go for the gold with the help of Woody Harrelson. Now this is the only part of the movie that tried to be above all the craziness and silliness of the rest of the movie. I knew from the movie trailers that this movie was not going to tax my brain, and I was right. You will find yourself laughing at a number of comedy sight-gag skits. There is a scene at the poker table where someone is called Jive Turkey, and a gun it passed around, and it's so funny, because you just know that someone must dodge a bullet. Then there's the basketball court brawl, during the TV commercial, which is hilarious because it ends when they came back on the air! Don't go into the theater thinking you will see a great comedy, because it is not, but it is entertaining and that is all. There are some scenes that were put in for shock value that really didn't add anything and didn't need to be there. If you like Will Ferrell, then it is OK to go see this movie; if not, see something else. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:30, Rated R)(3/10)"
"zardoz-13","6","7","14","5 March 2008"," Just Another Sports Comedy with Too Little of Will Ferrell
","Will Ferrell's fourth and latest sports spoof comedy ""Semi-Pro"" (**1/2 stars out of ****) is semi-delusional. For the record, it's not in the same league with his NASCAR comedy ""Talladega Nights."" The former Saturday Night Live comedian stars here as one-shot disco music singer Jackie Moon who bought his hometown basketball team with the bucks that he earned from his Barry White-style, one hit wonder, chart-topping single ""Love Me Sexy."" Not only does Jackie own the Tropics of Flint, Michigan, but he also plays on, coaches, and promotes the team! ""Semi-Pro"" takes place in the nonconformist 1970s, and the fictional Tropics compete in the former real-life American Baseball Association (1967-1976) with its trademark red, white, & blue basketball and its 3-point shot. Clearly, this nostalgic, occasionally amusing basketball farce aspired to be for hoops movies what the legendary Paul Newman classic ""Slapshot"" was for ice hockey and the Tom Berenger farce ""Major League"" was for baseball. Mind you, the pranks, the pratfalls, and the humor are quintessential Will Ferrell when he is front and center, but Ferrell isn't always front and center, and the movie lacks the non-stop, over-the-top comic buffoonery of ""Talladega Nights."" <br/><br/>""Semi-Pro"" devotes more time to sincerity than frivolity. Half of this dribbling comedy focuses on straight man Woody Harrelson. An aged NBA, Boston Celtics champ, Monix (Woody Harrelson of ""White Men Can't Jump"") joins the team after Jackie trades the Tropics' ailing washing machine for him. As it turns out, the ABA is tottering on its last legs, and ABA Commissioner (David Koechner of the far funnier sports spoof ""The Comebacks"") and the other team owners have struck a lucrative deal to have four of their teams absorbed into the NBA. The remaining teams, including Jackie's Tropics, are scheduled to disband. Jackie goes ballistic at this dire prospect. Somehow, our hero with an Afro hairstyle convinces his fellow owners that only the best four teams should be absorbed. Actually, this happened in real-life. Unfortunately, Jackie later learns that each team must attract at least two thousand spectators for each home game. In an effort to improve the Tropics, Jackie trades for Monix. Monix spent his championship season with the Celtics, but he warmed the bench more often than shot hoops. Nevertheless, Monix sincerely wants to turn the Tropics around and make them into winners. Anybody remember the warm-hearting Gene Hackman movie ""The Hoosiers?"" Ultimately, this last hurrah for the underdogs that must win a championship game is standard, second-rate stuff that has been done too many times. Indeed, ""Semi-Pro"" surpasses ""Kicking and Screaming,"" ""Melinda and Melinda,"" and ""Bewitched,"" but that provides little consolation.<br/><br/>An executive producer on ""Balls of Fury"" and ""Mr. Woodcock,"" freshman director Ken Alterman and ""Old School"" scenarist Scot Armstrong slum for laughs in their raunchy, foul-mouthed, R-rated, 93 minute, boys-night-out bash. They have intrepid Jackie Moon pulling an idiotic Evel Knievel-style ramp jump with roller skaters over his team's foxy string of cheerleaders strung out head-to-toe on their backs across the court. Since the players cannot fight on the court during the game, Jackie has his guys slug it out with the other team during commercial breaks. At one point, Jackie promises to feed everybody at a home game a Corndog if the Tropics score over 125 points. They do and Jackie bails. Ultimately, in an effort to sell out his stadium, Jackie wrestles with a brown bear. Although the bear escapes, the woodland beast becomes ""Semi-Pro's"" best running joke as it strikes without warning.<br/><br/>Sadly, Alterman and Armstrong treat Ferrell as if he were a guest star. ""Semi-Pro"" relies more on half-hearted sight gags and the suspenseful but formulaic big-game-to-win showdown than the inspired lunacy that is Will Ferrell. Unfortunately, Ferrell shares the spotlight with Harrelson, and Harrelson gets a subplot with an old girlfriend and a romance. Surprisingly, ""Semi-Pro"" doesn't stoop to the standard kick in the groin for chuckles or any examples of juvenile bowel humor. The dumbest scene has Monix teaching the Tropics how to run a play until they puke. Incredibly, Jackie has never puked in his entire life. Monix punches him in the belly, and Jackie chucks everything, but not on camera. Altogether, this lukewarm sports comedy scores more chuckles than sensational, side-splitting laughs. Sure, you'll smile and sputter, but you won't be roaring at anything fresh or original."

Big time producer, first time director Kent Alterman and ""Old School"" writer Scot Anderson team up with Ferrell and for some reason play it safe. Very safe. So safe that there are only a few chuckles here and not a single laugh out loud moment.<br/><br/>This movie is just not funny. And it has nothing to do with Ferrell going for another sport-based flick. The ABA and the 70's offer a vast array of topics and targets. Sadly most of those are ignored here. As Jackie Moon, the one hit wonder from the music biz, Ferrell acts as the owner, coach, player, ring-leader and promotional face of the Flint Tropics ... the worst team in the ABA. Sadly, none of this matters because there are just no funny bits here.<br/><br/>Andre Benjamin, Woody Harrelson, Maura Tierney and David Koechner all go through the motions of their lame dialogue. Will Arnett and Andrew Daly as the team radio announcers had my hopes up initially, but alas, turned out to be another one-trick pony. I felt most sorry for Patti LaBelle and Jackie Earle Haley who had to be humiliated to even read their lines.<br/><br/>Nothing is more difficult than comedy and nothing is more pathetic than an unfunny comedy. The weak attempts at drama are always overshadowed by an over the top moment that falls flat ... a bear loose in the arena, a tantrum in the league office, disco dancing, team dancers, etc. The best two moments are the throw-away line about Henry Ford and the introduction of the Alley Oop ... straight from heaven.<br/><br/>As if all this wasn't distressing enough, before the film started we were ""treated"" to the trailer of Ferrell's next movie ... a reteaming with John C. Riley. When a comedy trailer has no laughs, the hopes for the movie are extremely low. Maybe it is time for Ferrell to grow up and play other people's stuff ... he was great in ""Stranger Than Fiction"". The money train is tough to jump from, but one's dignity has to be worth something."

This is more of a middle-of-the-week type of movie instead of a weekend type movie. The romantic plot line seemed obscure and unrelated to the movie but I think it was added for all the females dragged by their significant others. During the movie it was as if the cast was following their script and Will F. was improvising his comedy into the movie. This part was genius and funny.

I would definitely say that was worth a mention.<br/><br/>For more than its worth the chemistry was in it. Basically what I'm trying to say is that there was some interference in the direction due to the producer in the main sequence but I wouldn't hold that against the movie. <br/><br/>I will look forward to more of the same mentionable in the sequence, there it be had. No I do not think there was any, but who's to say there should have been? Thats pretty much what I'm saying WHERE WAS THE FRAGRANCE THEN?? Nowhere to be found thats where its in.

Will Ferrell, ABA basketball, the 70s, humor, all take a back seat to the real story line and exhausting punch-line: people from blue-collar backgrounds with ambitions and aspirations beyond the world they are suppose to know are foolish idiots for thinking their hopes and dreams are tenable. <br/><br/>It's so bad, you can't help wondering how and why this movie got green-lighted. It's almost as if Hollywood studio execs got together after Michael Moore's famous Oscar acceptance speech to draw straws to determine which studio would sacrifice its reputation in order to undermine and discredit Moore's upbringing and world-view once and for all. Then it was simply a matter of employing the most sinister and subversive weapon in their arsenal: frat- boy comedy aimed at 18- to 35-year old suburban white males. <br/><br/>It's not like we're ever going to see an action-packed historical epic about the Flint Sit-Down Strikes coming out of Hollywood. No no. Can't have working class pride getting in the way of the upper crust's efforts to justify their false superiority and the manner in which they treat the people who actually do the work that generates the wealth that butters their bread.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes, everyone who worked on Semi-Pro is a Semi-Scab."

","Before I say this, I want everyone to know that I love Will Ferrel. I think he is a great actor, and totally funny. That being said, this movie was absolutely horrible. For most of the movie, I felt like I was getting repeatedly beaten with a dumb stick with every horrible joke that was told. I was not expecting Shakespearian wit, but even with a stupid movie, there is a certain kind of stupid that is funny and a kind that is not. A movie like Dumb and Dumber is stupid in a fun and witty way. Semi-Pro is the kind of stupid that makes you wish you were simultaneously deaf and blind. I seriously wanted to gauge out my eyes with an ice pick so that the suffering would end. The only funny characters in that whole movie were the announcers, and they barely had any lines! This movie is absolutely horrible and Will Farrel should ashamed for even acting in it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"

","The Tropics are an unsuccessful basketball team in the ABA who are mainly kept afloat by the deep pockets and shameless self-promotion of their owner-player-coach Jackie Moon. However the team looks to be coming to an end as the league is collapsing and has agreed to a merger with the much more popular NBA - although only four teams will go through. After forcing a vote in the ABA committee, Jackie gets the pre-selected four teams changed to be the top four teams of that season - a victory only of sorts as his beloved Tropics are far from that lofty league position. So the race begins for Jackie to get his team winning and hit the other requirements to become a NBA team.<br/><br/>Semi-Pro did not really appeal to me when it was advertised because, in so many ways, I felt I had seen the plot, the jokes and the characters before in many other ""wacky"" sports movies. When it would come to me on DVD instead of me going to it though I decided to give it a try and waited for a time when I was in a simple mood so I could enjoy it. Sadly it turned out to be worse than I thought and the whole film feels like everyone going through a tick list and doing things without a great deal of inspiration or energy. It has its silly moments that some will enjoy but mostly the gags are not that good and it came across like the writer was reliant on the cast to make it sparkle in a way that he hadn't on paper. Outside of the gags we have subplots that don't work and moments of semi-seriousness that only serve to bore the viewer rather than engage - for example I am not sure why I was supposed to care about Monix and Lynn or why so much time was given over to their relationship.<br/><br/>Fans of this type of film may still enjoy this but for the majority of people it will be a case of too much doing too little and the stuff that does show potential not being that well delivered. A lot of the fault rests with the writer Armstrong, a man whose recent work is less than inspiring but lets share the blame to include the directing debut of Alterman, someone who clearly has clout enough to make this happen without anyone suggesting he might not be up to it. His direction does not suit the material and he cannot draw the comedy out. I assume that he too must have been hoping that the right cast will make it fly, but it doesn't happen. Ferrell himself is not to blame as he does his best with what he has and indeed his Jackie Moon character is a good enough one by his standards. The problem comes from the material as it doesn't rise to meet him - a problem that abandons him but leaves others bogged down. Harrelson is the worst victim as he has to carry a character and subplot that nobody cares for - likewise Tierney is wasted. Benjamin and the other players are OK but Arnett and Daly are only sporadically funny in roles that were infinitely funnier in Dodgeball.<br/><br/>Semi-Pro is not a terrible film and it certainly will have some viewers in stitches but for me personally it was tiresome in too many ways. Whole parts of it just didn't work within the requirements of the genre and too many sequences just seemed reliant on the cast pulling something out by their mere presence. The end result is uninspiring at best and there are many other films that are just like this one that are better than this tired effort."
"whosyourdrummer1","4","4","7","23 July 2008"," Don't waste your time
","This movie to me was just another Will Ferrel movie where he tries to carry the whole thing and it falls..hard. I only laughed at one part in this entire movie, and the rest me and my girlfriend just watched in amazement at how truly stupid a movie can be. The reason I gave it a 4 was because it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen but I wouldn't even give it a mediocre rating. Will Ferell was trying way to hard in this movie to be funny just like he has in the past..and 4/5 it comes to bite him in the butt. This movie really did have the potential to be decent but the storyline, comedic elements, and f word got old really quick for me and my girlfriend and I regretted watching the movie after many of my friends told me not to watch it I went along with it on instinct and lost money and fun time to spend with my girlfriend."
"MartinHafer","5","4","7","15 June 2008"," Very little of the magic of TALLADEGA NIGHTS is evident here.
","In SEMI-PRO, Will Farrell is the owner-manager-player for the fictional ABA franchise Flint Tropics. For those of you too young to remember the ABA (American Basketball Association), it was a rival league to the NBA that really suffered due to lack of fan support as well as having teams in amazingly small markets in many cases. Unfortunately, even for an ABA team, attendance is lousy and the players are mostly untalented losers. However, when it's announced that the league is folding and four of its premier teams are moving to the NBA, Farrell is excited when it's agreed that the four teams that have the best record will become NBA franchises. This motivates him and his hapless players into finally playing like a team and it's rather predictable that they manage to pull it all together leading up to the final ""big game"".<br/><br/>In many ways, the script is quite formulaic and you know what's going to happen, but there are a few cute moments that keep it interesting. SEMI-PRO is in some ways like TALLADEGA NIGHTS and SLAPSHOT rolled into one with one major exception--it doesn't come close to either of these movies in quality or especially laughs. This really surprised me, as I was expecting a sense of humor like TALLADEGA NIGHTS, but sadly there were only a few small moments like this--scenes Will Ferrell was doing promotions for his basketball team. The best of these insane promotions was probably the bear wrestling scene. I think the biggest problem was that in TALLADEGA NIGHTS, the races weren't really that important--the humor was. In SEMI-PRO, the film seemed to bog down when they actually were playing basketball--especially since, within the rules, you can't do anything THAT crazy. I really think the film would have been better served with either less basketball or by simply throwing reality out the window during these ballgame scenes. Plus, while it sure looked like SLAPSHOT at times because of some of the fighting and a team's efforts to avoid folding, it never really went far enough regarding social commentary or the likable humor of SLAPSHOT.<br/><br/>In addition to not quite succeeding like these other two films, SEMI-PRO was extremely vulgar--and often not in a funny way. Too many testicle jokes, crude language and vomiting references--and these were supposed to be the funny moments in the film. Sadly, the crude humor didn't work and really make this a film that is NOT child-friendly.<br/><br/>If you are a Will Farrell fan, there's enough to this film that you'll like, so give it a shot. If you are not a Farrell fan, then this film will do nothing to convince you otherwise. My advice is see TALLADEGA NIGHTS and STRANGER THAN FICTION--two exceptional films that show Farrell has some depth and can make a real crowd-pleasing film. SEMI-PRO is a bit of a dud.<br/><br/>FYI--Check out the trivia section on IMDb about this film. Apparently, only a short time after this film the bear used in the fighting scene actually killed someone!"
"BlockHead76","1","4","7","12 June 2008"," Horrible waste of time
","This movie confirms that will ferrell cannot carry a movie without strong support. I didn't even chuckle once the whole film. The bear wrestling was worth a smile at least. nice nod to ""Kingpin"" with twiggy's real name being Munson. that's the most interesting thing I can say about this drivel. I'm done with Ferrell as far as theatre fare. he's relegated to free on cable with commercials for me. This seems like a vehicle for Andre ""3000"" Benjamin's career and a poor one at that. Disappointed all the way around. On one positive note Rob Cordry stood out as one funny character in this resounding turd of a movie as a super-fan and a cuckold."
"raypdaley182","3","4","7","26 May 2008"," One of Ferralls better films
","Take Kingpin, The Mighty Ducks, Dodgeball then add Will Ferrall & Basketball. Doesn't sound like much of a recipe for success? That's because it isn't. This is a movie all about celebrating failure. Not success, failure. This team don't win the league. They don't get promoted into the NBA.<br/><br/>The only reason they even win a trophy is they created it in the 1st place. The language is beyond course. The sexual references equally so. This really should be a 15 rating. NOT an R!.<br/><br/>Ferrall as usual isn't funny, it's the minor characters that make this movie. The film drops you into the teams problems pretty deep right from the start of the movie (which is a very bad idea as it'd be a better movie for knowing how they got that bad in the 1st place).<br/><br/>This only really gets going once the idea of becoming an NBA team is mooted more than a third of the way into the movie. If I wanted to see a movie about someone who bought his way into a sporting team I'd go watch Brewster's Millions as it's a much funnier movie, has a much better cast & script and also has much better sport in it.<br/><br/>Ferrall is just about bearable as Jackie Moon, Woody Harrelson as Monix is the much better character and better actor. Even Andre Benjamin manages to make Ferrall look bad here. Just being set in the 70's and using a lot of 70's hair, fashion & cultural references doesn't make for a good idea.<br/><br/>The whole idea of Ferrall's slutty wife never goes anywhere, likewise the story of Monix getting back with his ex. Even the plot of the team not getting promoted despite winning 4th place even manages to never go anywhere as the movie actually has no ending at all. It seems they just ran out of ideas and decided to end the movie on the fans trashing the whole town.<br/><br/>There are some funny scenes and some very funny lines but that doesn't make for a movie. I thought they were going to use the hippy who made the freethrow but that never went anywhere (the tiny scene during the credits attempted to resolve that plot but still didn't).<br/><br/>Also the idea that Coffee can be on the bench for the opposing team then go back to playing for his old team during the game? Never going to happen as he'd be unable to play due to not being selected for his team pre-game.<br/><br/>The film attempts some lame humour with things like jumping the cheerleaders on skates and fighting a bear (neither scene really ended up ever going anywhere even if the bear did keep popping up afterwards) which was never a good idea and not ended well either (if at all).<br/><br/>The film just doesn't have enough cohesive ideas to be any good. If it had gone with a better ending (the team taking its case for promotion to court and winning) then it might have achieved the ""feel good"" factor it was looking for. As it was, it fell far short of the mark.<br/><br/>At least in all the films I named at the start the underdogs did eventually win their championships or titles. This team only managed 4th place. Never anything to shout about or celebrate.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend watching this unless your drunk or high."
"PWNYCNY","6","4","7","17 March 2008"," Not that bad, but not that good either.
","Not a great movie but not that bad either, which isn't saying much because there is not much to say about this movie. It's not offensive, it has its funny moments, but it's not going to become part of the pantheon of great Hollywood classics. The best word to describe this movie is ""cute."" That's it. Nothing more. There are no memorable performances. The movie waivers between being a comedy and drama. Strong performances are nonexistent in this movie but the none of the performances were all that bad. Entertaining, yes! Inspirational? No. A masterpiece? Definitely not. One other point: this movie is supposed to be a period (1970s) but everything about the movie seems to be 2008, a discrepancy that further weakens an already teetering story.<br/><br/>One other point. Even in a tepid movie such as this, Woody Harrelson once again gives a commendable performance, again showing that he is a great actor. If the movie was as good as his performance then this movie would have been great."

","I haven't been to the movies for a while a literally took a huge dump in my pants when 3 med pop corns and 3 medium cokes cost me $30. This is a typical Ferrel movie with dumb if not funny moments written into a wacky concept nobody though about. This movie is NOT as good as Talladega OR Blades - there is not one phrase he uses that my kids are running around the house repeating ad nauseum, his other movies contain at least one. He even steals the same jokes from Talladega. The bear bit was presumptuous and got old fast, the roller skating bit was confusing you never see how it ends and ALL of Woody Harrelson's character's part was EASILY predictable - again the laugh was watching something being acted out when people have only read about or heard stories told about something. The only thing I could not understand, and this is because I played basketball, at the end they have a point guard scoring points the way the center or a forward would have. I guess the producers owed Andre 3000 more screen time. FINALLY, I saw a funny clip with Ferrel and Bill Walton on court with Bill in makeup - if you are going to this movie to see Walton don't bother, his ENTIRE character wound up on the editing room floor."

","I hated the woody harrelson story line, his plot with the girl was like from another movie except for that funny bit about her husband coming in on them.Will Ferrell does the best he can, feels like a waste of actors, Andy could of been used much more effectively, also the team wasn't used very well they didn't say much. The two announcers stole the show for me, they were hilarious, Daly was by far the most quotable ""they are doing just a horrible job at supporting his spine"" or ""id like a guarantee"" it was a decent movie, wish they would of cut a few things with woodys character and that stupid costume dance thing was terrible, as was the puking. Wills best scenes have to be when hes introducing the characters and at the end with his speech (friend son) Wish they had spent more time with written jokes instead of stupid over the top dance numbers and forced drama story lines (leading player doubting woody and his ring). I hope someone cuts all of dalys great lines and posts them on youtube. There is 15 minutes of pure genius in this movie, 30 minutes of laughs and the rest is sorta dumb or wasted. Jive turkey..."

","Very sad; it must be the worst, or nearly so, film I've ever tried to watch  of course I could not possibly sit till the end. ""Why chicken crossed the street?"". I let you guess the answer. This, taken as a metaphor, will aptly describe this film. Will Farrow probably have no self respect  or, perhaps, he stopped evolving in 5th grade, and he probably never got any grade above the C. Suffice it to say that I will never consider watching anything where he is present. Disgusting, tasteless, trash! It is even sadder that some reviewers voted 6 and even 7 stars. Because of such generosity trash like this is still being, and will continue to be made."
"dfranzen70","7","5","10","2 March 2008"," Mostly Alley, little Oop
","Look! It's another comedy starring Will Ferrell as a man-child in a strange haircut! Will it be funny? Yes, because of two things: First, it's set in the 1970s, which was the funniest decade (to laugh at) ever, and second, it's a sports movie, and those are almost always awesome. It has wacky characters in improbable scenarios, and it has scantily clad women and profanity. It's a can't-lose comedy.<br/><br/>It's 1976, and Jackie Moon's Flint, Michigan Tropics are part of the American Basketball Association (ABA), which has just announced plans to merge with the more-popular National Basketball Association. Trouble is, only the top four teams will be assimilated, and the Tropics are pretty awful. About all they have going for them is the attitude of Moon, their owner/coach/player, and the play of their best player, Clarence ""Coffee"" Black (Andre Benjamin). The Tropics have acquired a seasoned veteran named Monix (Woody Harrelson), who has a championship ring from his time with the Boston Celtics in hopes of making it up to fourth place. Can they do it? Minor-league sports have long been ripe for parody; see Slap Shot or Bull Durham. But there's something doubly appealing about the wild and woolly lower-level pro leagues combined with the zany, colorful atmosphere of the 1970s. I mean, look at the fashions! The hairstyles! The sheer loudness! Semi-Pro is reminiscent (and perhaps a little derivative) of Slap Shot more than anything else, and that's a compliment. Slap Shot more or less set the standard for lowbrow sports comedies (Bull Durham was much more sophisticated), and it included elements that made their way into Semi-Pro as well, such as the walking-cliché sportscasters and the bed-hopping chicanery - there's just no plot thread that has Ferrell hooking up with the ex-wife of one of his players, like Paul Newman in Slap Shot. But that's okay; in fact, Moon actually makes note of his lack of sexual prowess in a talk to the ball girls - ""Some of you I wanted to sleep with, but I never got around to it...Mama always said I procrastinate too much..."" The movie works also because Moon, like many of Will Ferrell's goofy characters, never takes himself seriously. He's just a showman in a showy lower-level league. He's immensely popular in Flint, but more as a promoter of his team and the city than of an actual player or coach. In truth, he can't play OR coach, but somehow the Tropics will do okay regardless.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is a lot of fun, too. Somewhere along the line, Woody Harrelson (North Country, No Country for Old Men) has turned into a very good character actor. Love his Dutch Boy haircut here - or is it a Dorothy Hamill? Or maybe it's Mike Patterson's wife Deanna from the comic strip For Better or for Worse. Regardless, his Monix is fantastic, excelling in the athletic scenes as well as the slower dramatic scenes. (It's his second basketball movie, following 1992's White Men Can't Jump.) Maura Tierney as his ex-lover, Andrew Daly as a buttoned-down broadcaster, and Andy Richter as Jackie's ""son-friend"" are all great as well.<br/><br/>I think it goes without saying that if you like Will Ferrell movies, you'll like this one. It's got plenty for your inner frat boy to love, from lewd comments to a plethora of profanity. No nudity, though, so you skin aficionados can relax. Or get irate, whatever. But the script is punchy and a lot of fun, and Ferrell brings it all together.<br/><br/>***"

I can deal with the crude humor, but someone funny needs to deliver it. It would have been fairly easy to cut down on the vulgarity also and get a PG-13 rating rather than R.<br/><br/>With the money they spent, you'd think they would have gotten better acting support.<br/><br/>I now put Farrell on my ""D"" list with Bo Derick."

","Will Ferrell stars as Jackie Moon in basketball movie Semi-Pro. Jackie Moon is the owner, coach, and star player of an ABA (American Basketball Association) team, the Flint (Michigan) Tropics.<br/><br/>The ABA is about to go bankrupt so they decide to merge with the National Basketball Association, but there is only room for the top four teams to move to the NBA, and all of the other teams will fold. The Tropics are the worst team in the ABA so Jackie decides (so that he will still have a team) to rally his team to start winning some games. But Jackie is not a good leader and not even close to a ""star player"", in fact he only plays because he owns the team, which he bought with the money he earned from recording a fluke hit song. He decides to bring in a washed-up NBA player (Woody Harrelson) to hopefully help his team make it into the playoffs and finish fourth.<br/><br/>It sounds like a good premise and I'm a big Will Ferrell movie fan so I was expecting a lot but this movie didn't deliver. There are a couple of good jokes and typical Will Ferrell physical comedy but overall it was flat and disappointing. If you're a big Ferrell fan it's still worth seeing but I wouldn't recommend paying for it."

Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, a has been singer whom now owns a basketball team. Not only is he the owner, he is also a player and the coach. Of course, he really doesn't know much about coaching except showing his players how to dance in animal costumes. The commissioner tells them that 4 teams from the league will be added to the NBA, and Moon's Tropics aren't one of them. But Moon insists that they should play the season out and the top 4 teams get to go to the NBA. So, now there is the stereotypical ""bad news bears"" team that all of a sudden starts winning and only needs one more win to reach the goal.<br/><br/>Some jokes used are a bear fight, a hippie who wins a 10000 dollar shot but never gets paid, the alley-oop, etc....

"jaredmobarak","4","24","80","26 February 2008"," Softest hands in the worldSemi-Pro
","Will Ferrell has done it again. He got my butt in the seat based off a funny trailer and funnier spoof premise despite the fact I knew I would end up hating the film. Yes, I did not like it much at all. Probably more entertaining than its predecessors, I found myself laughing big at more scenes, rather than just laughs in one or two sequences. I credit this fact to it not trying to be a movie, but instead relying on its strung together skits as just that. Sure it is all loosely tied together for somewhat of an arc in the absurd fantasy world that the Flint Tropics would ever have a shot at becoming an NBA team, but for its own good, Semi-Pro never took itself seriously and I was able to enjoy that fact even though I would have no real interest in ever seeing it again.<br/><br/>Barely making the 90 minutes mark, (if it does at all), this is a very short film. I would actually say that is a compliment because the jokes don't have quite the breathing room to get as stale as they could have easily become. What the length does detract from is the screen time of the multitude of side characters. When a joke prop played by Jackie Earle Haley, (the absolute best thing in this film), gets more face time than a tried and true actress like Maura Tierney, you know no one is going to get ample minutes to work with. Tierney is the romantic love interest here, usually that role would be given second billing, but the funny thing here is that she is the love interest for the right-hand man, not the star. Ferrell's Jackie Moon doesn't need a love interest because he is already too in love with himself.<br/><br/>I do need to applaud Ferrell for not hijacking this as he customarily does. Yes he is on screen for almost 100% of the movie, but he allows those around him to run free and enhance rather than just be fodder for his own loud, obnoxious shenanigans. Some of the set pieces are perfect for the whole group to really shine at his expense, a very welcome change to the horrid string of ""everyman"" bio-spoofs he has been churning out. Scenes like at the poker table, (Jive Turkey); the during commercial brawl on the court, (a priceless ending when they come back on air); and in full Broadway/Sesame Street costumes during a pivotal scene of a power shift, (when they all try to hide from what they are saying by covering their faces with giant foam hands you realize the absurdity of the situation was intentional for those expressions to payoff as funny), really stick out and bring enough laughs to overcome their randomness.<br/><br/>We are still given the requisite moments of emotion as though what these players are going through is real life. When they make decisions for the better of the team instead of their own individual self, you think to yourself that a tear might come to your eye due to the excruciating pain of sitting through those moments. I know you need some weight in order to invest in the story, but really I just came to laugh; make me laugh and don't try to be like you're a serious film. They also rely on skits that have been done better before in previous comedies like Andrew Daly and the great Will Arnett doing their best impersonations of the Dodgeball commentators. You can't help think of that superior film and the fact that this is just a poor facsimile.<br/><br/>There is still a lot to enjoy during the mess, however. André Benjamin is great as Clarence ""Coffee"" Black. He has the comic chops to do some supporting role damage in the industry, but roles like he has had in ""The Shield"" show that he could be doing so much better than this hokey fare. Woody Harrelson does well as the professional coming in to save the dayalthough his character's true payoff is with Rod Corddry being totally excited that his girlfriend was falling for Woody, his sports hero. There are a lot of cameos from ""Daily Show"" (Steve Carrell is absent) and ""Upright Citizen Brigade"" alums and each brings a smirk at some point.<br/><br/>Is it great? Absolutely not. Does it have some big laughs? For sure. Would I recommend it? No. Saying that doesn't mean a thing, though, because if you are a fan of Ferrell's previous work in this ""genre"" you will be going anyway. Besides that, I am a self-proclaimed detractor of his starring work, (I do enjoy him in smaller roles and more subdued ones), so no one will listen to my opinion. Either way, for what it's worth, I had more fun with this than his others. Maybe I was just in a better mood or maybe I just didn't take it as serious as the others because, thankfully, it didn't take itself that way either."

"PoisonKeyblade","5","2","3","12 March 2008"," Semi-crap... and semi-amusing
","Will Ferrell has a very interesting career with all sorts of ups and downs and twists and turns. Some of his movies scream comedic brilliance while others make you shake your head in shame. Ferrell's last film, Blades of Glory, was 'kind of' funny, but definitely didn't stand up to repeated viewings. Semi-Pro was all sorts of promising. With a sensational cast and plenty of material to build off of, it was almost guaranteed that this movie would be the next Anchorman or Talladega Nights. Semi-Pro stars Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, Will Arnett, and Andy Richter. The film is directed by Kent Alterman and written by Scot Armstrong.<br/><br/>Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) is the semi-pathetic singer/owner/player/coach of the Flint Michigan Tropics, a basketball team known for its absolutely horrible games. When the ABA merges with the NBA, Jackie Moon decides that he'll do anything it takes to get his team on the fast-track to becoming NBA all-stars.<br/><br/>The movie was promising, no doubt about it, but the fact of the matter is that all of these jokes feel like recycled material from a trashy '70s picture. Will Ferrell, for once, isn't absolutely hysterical in his role as Jackie Moon. His other roles were at least semi-believable, especially his best one in Anchorman as Ron Burgundy. Woody Harrelson actually comes off as kind of annoying, and the whole film felt way too long. The only role that actually made me laugh occasionally was Will Arnett's Lou Redwood. Then again, he can take any hideous role and transform it into something magical; we all saw The Brothers Solomon. Or wait, actually no one did.<br/><br/>There are several laugh-out-loud sequences in Semi-Pro, but for some reason, none of these have anything to do with basketball. It's all like one big skit, throwing gag after gag toward the audience and hoping that something sticks. ""Love Me Sexy"", Jackie Moon's hit song, is probably the single funniest thing in the entire film, followed closely by a bear-wrestling scene and a 'jive turkey' argument while playing cards. The movie isn't all terrible, it just wasn't as great as anticipated. It was repetitive, stale, and kind of boring, but it definitely had some shining moments.<br/><br/>Semi-Pro is the perfect title for a semi-likable movie. It was semi-funny, semi-stupid, and semi-entertaining. Will Ferrell has finally made a bad movie, one which he definitely won't be remembered for. You would think that the R-rating could finally give Ferrell the chance he needed to have complete and total freedom over the content and jokes. For some strange reason, it has the opposite effect; it brings the movie down into a pit from which it is never able to rise. This one is worth skipping, unless you prefer your movies to be semi-enjoyable."

","I always find that Will Ferrell's films can be a little hit and miss. He's either funny, or he tries a little too hard to be funny. Luckily, in the case of 'Semi-Pro,' he's the former. The film is clearly his vehicle, so whether it works or not is largely down to him. Here he plays Jackie Moon - the owner, coach and even player of a low league seventies basketball team who are about to get disbanded, unless they can scrape fourth place in the league.<br/><br/>For a start, you don't have to know or like basketball. I know nothing about it, but I enjoyed the film anyway. Yes, Ferrell is a little over the top here and there, but his performance never really borders on 'annoying.' This is largely because, as insufferable as he could be perceived, he's actually got his team's best interests at heart and, despite his minor fame and fortunes, he's quite a flawed and insecure character. Also, 'Semi-Pro' isn't a long film (only an hour and a half) and most of it is packed with gags (all pretty adult in nature) and the majority of those work.<br/><br/>There are minor plotlines, but they're all secondary to Ferrell. Most other characters are only there to tee up Ferrell for him to deliver the punch line. Woody Harrelson is about the second most important character and he has a little more screen time and, whereas Ferrell provides the laughs, Harrelson's character actually has something in the way of 'character development.' But, despite him being the 'heart' of the story, Harrelson is more of a 'functional' part of the tale and 'Semi-Pro' remains Ferrell's baby. David Koechner and Jackie Earle Haley are also on the cast list, but both of them - although always enjoyable in anything they do - are merely there as kind of 'extended cameos.'<br/><br/>Basically, Semi-Pro won't win any awards. It's daft, loud and dumb, but ultimately very watchable if you're in the mood for a film like that. Even though it's probably never going to be considered as good/funny as 'Anchorman' it could be thought that 'Semi-Pro' could be set in the 'same universe' (if we're talking in Marvel Shared Universe terms!).<br/><br/>Sit back, enjoy and just beware of escaped bears!"

","Semi-Pro (2008): Dir: Kent Alterman / Cast: Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, Andre Benjamin, Maura Tierney, Will Arnett: Hilarious sports comedy starring Will Ferrell as promoter Jackie Moon who's basketball team sucks. Washed up player Ed Monix shows up to help them. As with Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Semi-Pro counters formula by creating interesting characters. The results are very funny with director Kent Alterman doing a terrific job with the pop culture references. This is Alterman's first film as director and he is backed by fine comic performances. Ferrell plays a show boat who desperately wishes to regain the spotlight he once had. He will stoop to wrestling a bear to gain an audience. Woody Harrelson is well cast as Monix who isn't satisfied with his past but will assist Ferrell and his team as if to correct his problem by solving another. Andre Benjamin portrays the one player worth his salt but he is sought after by another major team. Maura Tierney plays Monix's ex-girlfriend whose husband enjoys being a cuckold. Will Arnett steals scenes as an alcoholic colour commentator. The one big flaw is that the outcome is predictable. We know that Ferrell will score, Harrelson will mend, Benjamin will return, Arnett will drink while calling the event, and Tierney will be the cheating married woman. Rewarding comedy that scores big on it's 70's sports references. Score: 9 / 10"

","Semi-Pro, another Will Ferrell vehicle, is actually much better than all these reviews would suggest. It's not perfect and it's a pretty formulaic sports comedy, but there are many hilarious scenes and Will Ferrell is funny as ever. I'm disappointed it bombed at the box office, but he did redeem himself later that year with the hilarious Step Brothers. Some of the funniest scenes involved bear wrestling and painful eyeliner.<br/><br/>Kent Alterman's film is about a rundown team, the Flint Tropics who are near the end of their existence. When the commissioner tells the owner and main player, Jackie Moon that four teams in their league will merge, Jackie gets his team ready to win.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is really hilarious as Jackie Moon. He's a great singer too as he showed with ""Love Me Sexy."" Woody Harrelson makes a nice addition to the cast and while this may not be his best role, he was still really effective.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an underrated sports comedy. While it does follow the sports formula to the book, it has some very funny, R-rated jokes. It is great when Ferrell makes R-rated films because he can be even more funny than he is. I rate this film 9/10."

","If anyone like me is a huge of Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, then there's no doubt that this is an excellent film choice for you, I loved it!<br/><br/>Another sports comedy for Ferrell this time, after Talladega Nights (2005) and Blades of Glory (2007), once again proving itself winning formula with hilarious results.<br/><br/>The film sees outspoken basketball franchise owner Jackie Moon who desperately tries to coach, play for and motivate his team when they hear the news that they will be dropped from the league.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is obviously brilliant playing the eccentric and overwhelming Jackie Moon, but is also supported by a great cast including Woody Harrelson, who takes well to his comedic role, Andre Benjamin (previously of Outkast fame) who looks a promising newcomer as a comedy actor and old favourites of Ferrell's movies including Andy Richter, Will Arnett and David Koechner.<br/><br/>Full of snappy one liners that you'll be quoting for hours afterwards, and some truly outrageous scenes including Jackie wrestling a bear, and an on-court altercation with a priest! The highlight of this movie in my opinion is the poker game, I won't spoil it for you, but it's definitely not one to be missed it's side splittingly funny.<br/><br/>Obviously, this movie is by no means perfect and the reason I've given it such a high rating is because I love these types of comedy and find Ferrell one of, if not the best in his field. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but if you're looking for a good laugh with your friends and something not at all serious for your movie night then give 'Semi Pro' a chance it won't let you down!"

","Sports entertainment has never been so funny. Semi-Pro written by Scott Armstrong has the same satire comedy that you would expect from any other lead-based acting that Will Ferrell takes place in. Jackie Moon (played by Will Ferrell) is responsible for bringing his struggling franchise back up to relevance both competitively on the court and financially off of it. Joined by fellow actors Woody Harrelson and Andre Benjamin, Jackie Moon starts to incorporate wild and unseen promotions to encourage more fans to visit their games, all awhile the team starts to move up in the standings. Based in the 70's, this is one of the funniest sports comedies that I've ever seen. I would recommend for any sports fan or Will Ferrell fan to see this film."

","I have never heard of this film until a few months ago when it was exhibited on TV. Actually it was a large campaign over this movie but still I didn't wanted to watch for some odd reason. But one Sunday afternoon after I got bored while watching the first 10 minutes of ""Gengis Khan"" (1969) I switched channels and found out this movie and started watching. As a result I discovered that this was a surprisingly funny movie and very delightful to watch. By that I mean that I was really laughing because it was very funny and saved the day. <br/><br/>""Semi-Pro"" is an sports related comedy staring Will Ferrell as Jackie Moon, an singer who has used the profits from his one hit single ""Love Me Sexy"", to buy a basketball team in Flint, Michigan becoming the owner, head coach, and starting power forward. Facing the fear of have his team dissolved because of the poor results, and under the menace that the team might not enter in the National League (only four teams will be selected to join NBA), Jackie hires Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson), a former player winner of a big championship in order to elevate the team's result. Monix not only is gonna be player but also he's gonna coach the team. <br/><br/>The real fun things about this movie is the way Jackie promotes his team by using a bear as an attraction, the strange uniforms and the dances the players have to do. The movie also puts focus in the sports newscasters (something I always pay attention in sports themed films). Here they are played by Will Arnett (as Lou Redwood) and Andrew Daly (as Dick Pepperfield). Their punchlines are one of the best things in the movie, sometimes fighting with each other and other times agreeing with the opinions.<br/><br/>The basketball games are nice and fun to watch (special the last match with the creation of the Alley Oop). But the funniest scene in the movie is a discussion between Lou and one of the players of the team while playing cards. In this moment, Lou is angered with something that this player said and pulls a gun threatening him. When it's revealed later that the gun was unloaded, everybody who were playing cards start to joke with each other saying disrespectful things to one another and pointing the gun to themselves and pulling the trigger was hilarious. This scene could went in the wrong way, and turn out to be a tasteless and unfunny thing, but the way that it ended was very good, very funny and very well made. <br/><br/>This is a movie to sit back, watch it and enjoy it. If you don't be too demanding you're probably gonna like it. 10/10"

","Recap: A one hit wonder artist uses his new found fame to buy the local basket club Tropics in Flint. He takes over as coach, but also as a player. Fortune and public interest fade, but at long last he might be able to fulfill his dream, to bring his team to the NBA. To do that he only has to make his partying ego centered players into a team and bring the audience back. No easy feat.<br/><br/>Comments: Another day at the job, that was what it felt like. It's uninspired and mostly pointless. A few bright jokes lift the movie but it has a far way to go to even compare to other Ferrell comedies. Ferrell himself is surprisingly uninspired. He that is a master on comedies like these and able to carry them by himself seem tired and uninterested. He doesn't stand out at all. Instead it is only Woody Harrelson that seem to care, and seem to invest anything in his character. Most other seem to do it by routine only.<br/><br/>Saved by a few fragments of bright, actually really funny jokes. Otherwise my rating would have been much lower. But too many other supposedly funny scenes jokes is only pointless and incomplete. Also, in a comedy so dependent on the actors it need much more from them.<br/><br/>I think everyone involved can do much better, and this can hopefully be forgotten as a lone mistake.<br/><br/>5/10"

I watched the whole thing with two college students and we were mostly shaking our heads over how crude and unfunny most of it was. We all know that men, and maybe especially professional sports stars, often gather and discuss women and sex in rather crude ways, but do we need to see that in a movie? Fictional characters talking about various sex acts in graphic terms, just to try to be funny? No, I don't appreciate that kind of attempt at humor, and this movie is full of it.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is Jackie Moon, owner, coach and nominal star of a very mediocre basketball team in the old ABA, set in the year that a few of the ABA teams were to be invited to join the NBA. Moon's team is poor, but they hope that they will be one of the 4 teams chosen if they can finish the season in 4th place or better.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson is Monix, a guard, who they get in a trade for a washing machine. (That was actually the funniest joke of the movie.) Monix is a no-nonsense guy who becomes the defacto coach and whips the team into shape to start winning.<br/><br/>But the one bright spot for me was Jackie Earle Haley (little guy of early 'Breaking Away' fame as a 'cutter') as Dukes, who in very unlikely fashion wins a half-time full-court basket toss for $10,000. Unfortunately the team didn't have $10,000 so Dukes is given the standard poster-sized check which he is unable to cash. He is told, ""Try a bigger bank.""

I laughed plenty, and I'd give it a moderate recommendation. Ferrell fans should definitely take it in. They won't be sorry they did. But there just aren't enough great jokes to make it a must-see comedy. And you know that when there aren't a ton of great jokes 90% of the good ones you've already seen in the commercials. There's a lot of half-baked material, too. I think, for instance, that Will Arnet's character was particularly hilarious, but they just don't give him enough to do.

It's gotta be soul-sucking to do that, but making the money and ""being somebody"" must suffice. Then there's the low-talent supporting cast membersKoechner, Richter (I mean, really, they are mediocrity defined, latching on to Ferrell's descending star). What's really weird is that actual talent like Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis are relegated to bits, but maybe they haven't yet worked their way up high enough in the ex-SNL pecking order, which probably says a ton about the good-ol'-boy mindset that put this drivel into motion.

The high point of the film was in the scene where they were all shooting an apparently empty gun at one another. I have to admit I laughed pretty hard in that scene and in a couple more moments. Will Ferrell always manages to get a couple of laughs out of me, but this movie was just too dumb and stupid ( well most of his films are and that is what makes them funny, but this was just a little too repetitive). Woody Harrelson and Andre Benjamin were pretty funny and it was good to see them working with Ferrell.

But after it came out on cable (On-Demand/PPV), I took the plunge and rented it--and now I'm going to the store to buy it. Sure, it's a bit raunchy in some scenes (think 40 Year Old Virgin in the language department). And other scenes are downright awful and hopefully were edited from the big screen(i.e. the gun). But it's still a quick, fast movie that had me rolling on the floor near tears. And be sure to watch it with the captioning on--you can't miss the lyrics to ""Love Me Sexy"", which you'll be singing around your house for 2 days. And check out some of the key one-liners, especially court scenes. We've got another handful of quotes to add to the ""It's Shake and Bake"" list. Will did it again!!!"
"mr_popcorn","7","2","4","22 May 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""Semi-Pro""
","Will Ferrell is one of the funniest man in Hollywood and his latest film Semi Pro is a funny film despite what the critics say. I still consider it funny as hell. There were a bunch laugh out loud scenes. It was all outrageous and his character Jackie Moon is the epitome of idiocy.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson was a nice touch. Its good to see him in comedic roles, I think I last saw him in the Coen's gritty ""No Country"". Its a breath of fresh air for him.<br/><br/>The funniest scene is the ""Jive Turkey"" thing. I might not have understood the joke but the way it was delivered, man it will make you laugh.<br/><br/>7."

","The American Basketball Association is on the verge of collapse, and when a former NBA benchwarmer returns to his hometown of Flint, MI, to whip his former team into shape for the playoffs, redemption is just a free throw away in this period sports comedy starring Will Ferrell and Woody Harrelson. Penned by Old School scribe Scot Armstrong, Semi-Pro tells the tale of a 1970s-era basketball player who doesn't have much luck in the NBA, but vows to leave his mark on the sport by coaching the Flint Tropics. When the upstart ABA league agrees to be absorbed by the NBA, only four teams will be allowed in. Jackie Moon (Ferrell) must orchestrate a successful season both on the court, and financially off the court with the help of many odd promotional events, in order to remain in the sport he loves."

","First of all, and one may not know that, but the premise of the movie, the merger of the ABA and the NBA, is actually is a real fact. If you are a basketball fan, you will be pleasantly surprised by that side of the story.<br/><br/>The 70's universe is very refined: looks, clothes, etc., and a special attention has been given to the soundtrack. Esthetically, Alterman met the challenge.<br/><br/>The script is very classic with no real surprise. Everything unfolds smoothly but in a false rhythm that struggles to fully catch the attention of the viewer.<br/><br/>The humour is very uneven and most of the gags fall flat.

I find Will Ferrell funny most of the time, but this time it's like someone sucked the funny out of him. I was 11 when I saw this, so I didn't know who Woody Harrelson was, but even he couldn't save this film. I'm glad he redeemed himself in Zombieland. I didn't even watch the whole thing. I stopped watched after Woody Harrelson punched Will Ferrell in the stomach and threw up. Blades of Glory is an overrated film IMO, but even that had a couple of funny parts. This had no funny parts. It also had too much swearing. I never minded swearing in movies, but it was just there for the sake of a R rating. Adding swear words in the script does not make it funny. This review seems to be getting long, so I will just say that this is not just the worst Will Ferrell movie I've seen, but it's also the worst movie I've seen."

","1st watched 7/28/2011 – 3 out of 10(Dir-Kent Alterman): Silly comedy about a fictitious ABA basketball team out of Flint, Michigan and their quest to be merged into the NBA. This merger actually happened in real life back in the 70's but the ABA wasn't considered semi-pro but was equal to the NBA. The movie contains many un-truth's concerning this actual event(but for comedy's sake they get away with it). Will Ferrell, plays the owner, coach, announcer, player, promoter and motivator for the team that isn't doing well statistically or financially. They bring in a new point guard(whom they get in a trade for a washing machine for the Kentucky Colonels), played by Woody Harrelson, who is washed-up as far as a player, but knows the game and eventually takes over the coaching duties. There are funny bits in the movie but they are too few and far-between, and the movie ends up just playing out like a silly cliché-driven underdog sports movie that we've seen too many of. I personally wish they wouldn't have used the ABA because too many of us know the truth's about the league, which wasn't nearly as bad as the movie portrays it being. And please!! – Will Farrell starting on a professional basketball team?? He should have considered getting a little more in shape before taking on this role then maybe we would have believed him in the role a little more. But back to what the movie was supposed to be, a comedy – well, all-in-all the movie just wasn't that funny and therefore I definitely don't recommend it."

","This movie is a pretty good venture for Will Ferrell and his cast of well- known actors playing somewhat comedic roles. The main element of comedy in the movie is the stupidity of Ferrell's character, Jackie Moon, an independent basketball team owner/coach and former music one-hit-wonder with his song ""Love Me Sexy."" His sports-themed movies are pretty much all the same, and this being the fourth sports movie he's done, it didn't really add anything to what has been done in his past movies. I think the funniest part in the movie was when he thought it would be a good idea for his team to wear eye shadow to freak out the other team and the craziness that ensues. For the most part, I liked the movie, but if it were in my DVD collection, I'd probably overlook it most of the time.

It doesn't compare to Will Ferrell's other sports comedies such as Blades of Glory or Talladega Nights. Ferrell does a fine job, but he has done much better than this. I think if the story was a little more focused on the team and a little less focused on Ferrell or the league merger, this movie would have been better.

","Kent Alterman's ""Semi-Pro,"" is a semi-true historical account of the Flint Tropics, from Flint, Michigan. The movie is actually quite funny. I watched it with my friend and his younger brother. I laughed, and so did they. And considering I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell, ""Semi-Pro"" is much funnier than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Set in 1976, Ferrell is Jackie Moon, a flamboyant singer/songwriter whose hit song was enough of a success for him to become owner of the Flint Tropics and also become its star player. He's a motivational leader, if nothing else. Fan attendance has been on the decline for some time now, and the Tropics have yet to win a game.<br/><br/>Things get worse for Jackie Moon when his corporate sponsors announce a merger with the NBA, which threatens the future of his Semi-Pro team. However, he manages to strike a deal that if his team finishes the end of the season within the top-four, the Tropics won't be disbanded and his players won't be forced to go back to meaningless, boring jobs in their ramshackle hometown. The team gets a leg-up when washed-up pro Ed Modix (Woody Harrelson) is traded to the team and eventually becomes the head coach.<br/><br/>""Semi-Pro"" is a funny movie, considering the talents of leading funny-man Will Ferrell. He manages to keep this project afloat, despite my initial doubts about his acting talents, but he works, giving his scenes with enough leadership and witty one-liners to be a truly leading funny-man. Another surprise was Andre Benjamin as Clarence, the team hot-shot. Most surprising about his performance was that rather than him being a ball-hog, instead he's a human being who is capable of recognizing his own faults and actually being a team player.<br/><br/>""Semi-Pro"" proved to be a solidly entertaining sports comedy, despite the fact I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell. I liked this movie. I think that because I saw the film in its unrated format, I got to see in all its comedic vulgarity. I guess that with the proper material, Ferrell is capable of being a lead performer and funny-man; he proved it with ""Stranger Than Fiction."" Ultimately, though, I think ""Semi-Pro"" will be relegated to the usual comedic fodder that's coming out of Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>7/10"

And it's nice to see Woody Harrelson as Monix (he should be in films more often). And some of the humor was hit or miss.

Unlike his Blades of Glory, his Jackie Moon is a lot more tamer than his Chaz Michael Michaels character. There is a scene with Patti LaBelle but I won't spoil it for you. Apart from the language and the surprised PG-13 rating, this film is a lot tamer about the American Basketball Association dissolving and only taking four teams to the National Basketball Association. Will the Flint Tropics be one of the lucky teams, you will have to watch and see.

","""Semi-Pro"" is the story of a team in the old ABA. The ABA was a basketball league formed in the 60s to be a competition for the NBA. The league existed from 1967 to 1976 until they could no longer exist and they had to merge with the NBA. Now we have a movie not about the league or its history but about a movie about a team in the waning days of the league. But basically it's just a sport movie and not even a very good one.<br/><br/>Outright the movie tries to elicit laughter by having the team we're supposed to follow be called the 'Tropics' from cold northern Flint, Michigan. The team is owned and coach by one of the players Jackie Moon (Wil Ferrell). The 'Tropics' are a miserable team and Jackie is a miserable coach. He would stop play in the middle of the game to chastise a fan for bringing his own food into the stadium. What he is is a great promoter or better yet a great self- promoter. He opens the game singing his one hit song. He's also a deluded guy who thinks that he can take his team to the NBA when the two leagues merge. <br/><br/>The movie really doesn't even try to be a real sport movie instead it tend to be a showcase for Jackie Moon's idiocy. In other words it show case Wil Ferrell doing idiotic stuff and call it comedy. When the teams are told that they are going to need to increase their attendance in order to be considered for the merger. Jackie comes up with all kind of crazy things including wrestling a bear for halftime entertainment. It's like in some other Wil Ferrell films, the film stop the regular narrative and watch him do things that are supposed to be funny. I'm going to say it, HE ISN'T. He's just like all the other Saturday Night Live actors, they're not very good actors and I find most of their presence in movies a bit of a mockery.<br/><br/>The one good thing about this movie is the Woody Harrelson character. He's an old pro who has been to the NBA and actually have a championship ring. Not only does he teach the team how to play the game properly and actually start winning, he has a decent romance with his ex-wife (Maura Tierney). but then this part of the movie has that done that been there feeling. But it's still better than the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Personally I think the ABA deserves a better treatment than what it got from this film. In some ways it revolutionized Pro Basketball. They came up with the 3 point shot, they allowed the freewheeling streetball style offense, (back in the day an NBA player showboating is going to get chastised by the coach, the ABA just let it go). If women's baseball can get ""A League of Their Own"" why does the ABA have to be stuck with this?"
"nti10099","Null","1","2","19 September 2008"," Movie Review: Semi-Pro
","There's a point in Will Ferrell's new sports movieyes, another one in which he plays a flabby, goofy guy oblivious to his own monumental dysfunctionwhen the comedian achieves pure cinematic brilliance.<br/><br/>I am talking, of course, about the scene in which his crotch is displayedin slow motion, no lessthrough the slits of his 1970's basketball Daisy Dukes.<br/><br/>Okay, so maybe ""Semi-Pro"" isn't the most clever or original of Ferrell's films. It reaches nowhere near the laugh-out-loud hilarity of ""Old School,"" ""Elf,"" ""Anchorman"" or ""Talladega Nights,"" but I'd be lying if I said it didn't crack me up at least a little bit. While ""Semi-Pro"" doesn't aim to be much more than it isan excuse for Ferrell to be more over-the-top and obscene than ever, knee-high socks and curly afro in allFerrell proves that there's still some juice left in this type of sports film, despite the fact that it contains about as much substance as a rice cake.<br/><br/>Ferrell's Jackie Moon is the owner, coach, promoter and star of the Flint Tropics, an underperforming down-market American Basketball Association franchise Jackie acquired after his lewd funk song ""Love Me Sexy"" made him a one-hit wonder. But Jackie doesn't know the first thing about basketball. A self-professed enemy of X's and O's, he instead focuses on planning crazy promotional events and halftime entertainment for league games, like free corndog night if his team scores over 125 points (he has no corndogs) or roller-skating off a ramp over eight Tropics cheerleaders. This is where the film has the most fun and separates itself from other run-of-the-mill sports comedies. Watching Jackie wrestle a bear named Dewey or scream ""No!"" after a stoned hippie nails a full-court shot for $10,000 proves that nobody can do loud, dumb humor like Ferrell.<br/><br/>When word gets out that the ABA is planning to merge with the NBA, an initially exuberant Jackie is told that his team must finish at least fourth in the league and average 2,000 spectators a game to survive the union. Desperate to improve, the Tropics trade for the washed up Monix (Woody Harrelson), a former Boston Celtics benchwarmer who whips his team into shape. Soon, Jackie's team (surprise, surprise) realizes they can play, and slowly become the darling of Flint, Mich. As a result, the Tropics make a run at the seemingly impossiblefourth place glory.<br/><br/>There are plenty of laughs to be had, mostly at Jackie's expense, but Scot Armstrong's script throws up a few lazy, obvious bricks from time to time. Ferrell doesn't receive the great comedic support he had with Vince Vaughn, Steve Carell and John C. Reilly on his best films, and several times he comes off as simply trying too hard to be funny.<br/><br/>Harrelson has proved with movies like ""White Men Can't Jump"" and ""Kingpin"" that he has legitimate comedy chops, and he fits into the whole Ferrell universe very nicely. However, as the film goes on, Monix gets more and more bogged down by dramatic subplotsincluding a romantic angle involving an old flame (Maura Tierney)that feel very flat. Having Harrelson and Ferrell play off one another a bit more could have made for a more memorable film.<br/><br/>Instead of utilizing a tired underdog story with less than subtle humor, first-time director Kent Alterman could have developed the premise's potential for ripe satire of professional athletics and feel-good sports movies. The film is a big dumb mess, and it's absolutely content with that.<br/><br/>But ""Semi-Pro"" has a certain charm to it, undoubtedly enhanced by the R-rating that allows Ferrell to lace his rants with an incredible amount of curse words. Andrew Daly and Will Arnett are hilarious as the perpetually square Dick Pepperfield and the alcoholic Lou Redwood, providing very funny commentary as the Tropics' radio broadcast team. Jackie Earle Haley is also great in a bit part as a dirty hippie.<br/><br/>Alderman has a great eye for period details, particularly involving the hair, man-scarves and basketball uniforms that perfectly capture a 1970s retro vibe.<br/><br/>While ""Semi-Pro"" doesn't rank at the top of Will Ferrell's comedy canon, there's still some funny stuff here. Just don't expect anything fresh from Mr. Ferrell on this go-round. Maybe this summer's ""Step Brothers"" (July 25) will help the comedian regain his versatility.<br/><br/>**.5 out of ****"
"michaeljharvey","6","1","2","31 August 2008"," Never brilliant, but consistently funny throughout
","This is another solid movie from Will Ferrell. While Semi-Pro is never on par with his best efforts (Old School and Anchorman), it doesn't disappoint either.<br/><br/>As usual, the film is just a bunch of Will Ferrell skits thrown together. The story of the ABA's Flint Tropics trying to make the big-time in the NBA is purely secondary to Ferrell's comic ideas. There are a few lulls, but for the most part Semi-Pro delivers with consistent laughs. Yes, it's a stupid, silly story. If you don't have a sense of goofy fun, you should avoid this movie. As a sports comedy, it fits very much in the same genre as Dodgeball and The Waterboy. There are the standard inspirational speeches about teamwork, the intense big game against a key rival, the bizarre play-by-play announcers... we've seen this all before. Despite the clichéd sports aspect, the sight of Will Ferrell trying to play basketball (or do anything athletic) is somehow always hysterical.<br/><br/>So why does this movie fall short of Will Ferrell's best effort, Anchorman? In Anchorman the entire cast contributed. Everyone had a chance to get in on the act and this lead to some unforgettable scenes. In Semi-Pro, there's a sense that Will Ferrell is doing his own thing and everyone else is just along for the ride.<br/><br/>While not a masterpiece, the movie received some unfairly harsh reviews from critics. If you're a Will Ferrell fan, it's definitely worth watching."
"freebyrd528","7","1","2","29 August 2008"," Low expectations!
","I'm really glad most people regard humor as a subjective thing. Anyone who was looking for something deeper than sketch comedy in this one, was deluding themselves! I am old enough to remember, and have an affinity for the ABA. Just like I do for the AFL. There are enough good scenes and sketches, to get a laugh from almost anyone. A real laugh, but having wrinkles on your brain is probably a prerequisite. I'm not trying to be condescending, but my expectations were low, and I was pleasantly surprised. Check it out-If u aren't a film Nazi, or wrapped to tight!!!!!!!! Yes, a certain level of inebriation enhances(almost any film), and the characters, for the most part, are kinda thin. But are people so discerning about what makes them laugh?"
"Boba_Fett1138","5","1","2","16 August 2008"," Watchable but just not among the best recent sport comedies.
","Sport comedies recently really have become popular again, with movies such as ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"", ""Blades of Glory"", ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and ""Balls of Fury"". Some of them are great while others are just pretty lame. I'm afraid this movie is one of the latter ones.<br/><br/>It's so easy to make fun of the '70's in comedies. This movie uses basically all of the clichés existing regarding the '70's. The movie comically only mainly purely relies on the fact that it is being set on the '70's. It relies a bit too much on it, since it alone just not enough to make a good and funny comedy with. It's also getting a bit old, comedies that are making fun of the '70's. Writer Scot Armstrong also already did it before for the movie ""Starsky & Hutch"", which worked out still much better. Yes, of course it has some moments but it's one of those movies that has more misses than hits comedy-wise.<br/><br/>But a bigger problem is perhaps the movie its story. It's such a simplistic, weak and formulaic written movie. It's also as if the story is being completely forgotten at times and the movie only serves as a medium for Will Ferrell to deliver as many funny moments as possible. Perhaps this is also due to the fact that Kent Alterman is still unexperienced as a director and this was actually his first directing job for a motion picture. He used to work before with Ferrell as an executive producer on the movie ""Elf"".<br/><br/>Still it's Will Ferrell who keeps the movie watchable and mostly fun to watch. This is a real Will Ferrell movie, which however also means that all of the other characters and actors are being pushed completely to the background. Even actors such as Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney. Yes, they are in the movie but the movie basically would had been just as good with other, less known, actors in their roles, since this movie really basically is all about Will Ferrell. What's even the point of their roles really? So in a way Ferrell is both a strong as well as a weak point of the movie. Still of course the movie remains perfectly watchable for the fans of him.<br/><br/>It has entertainment value but not really a sport comedy I would recommend.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"yourmotheratemydog715","4","1","2","8 July 2008"," A Step Down From ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights""
","""Semi-Pro"" is essentially the same thing as his other recent movies (""Blades of Glory"", ""Talladega Nights"", ""Anchorman"") but didn't make me laugh near as much.<br/><br/>""Semi-Pro"" is about Jackie Moon, a singer, who owns, coaches and plays on the Flint Michigan Tropics, a team in the ABA who aren't very good. It's 1976, and the ABA is about to merge with the NBA, but only the 4 best teams will make it into the NBA. Jackie Moon must lead the Tropics into one of the top 4 spots to save his team.<br/><br/>So, you know, basically the synopsis for every sports movie ever made. Team sucks, a guy comes in to motivate the team, the team doesn't suck. Wow, that plot line hasn't been done before. I would love a sports comedy where the main team just ends up losing. But that's not the point here. Is the movie funny? Yes and no. It's basically the same exact movie as last year's ""Blades of Glory"". And 2006's ""Talladega Nights"". ""Anchorman"" was a little different, but it's the same sort of thing. If you've seen those three movies, you've basically seen this movie. But wait, you say, this one's rated R. That must make a difference. No, not really. It just adds in a lot more f-bombs and sex jokes. (neither of which make the film more funny) There are a few good jokes here and there, but overall, I didn't laugh as much as I did, in say, ""Anchorman"". I don't know what it was. Maybe it was the fact that the other movies had a strong supporting cast, while this one had the guy from Outkast. Maybe it was the fact that I just got tired of the same old jokes every time. I guess I don't know what didn't make it as funny, it just wasn't as funny.<br/><br/>A lot of the humor just seemed forced and thrown in there for no real reason. Not many of the supporting players are that funny (Will Arnett didn't even make me laugh) and that is part of the reason that it's a step down from ""Anchorman"", which has a great supporting cast with Paul Rudd and Steve Carell.<br/><br/>I guess I really don't have much to say about ""Semi-Pro"", other than it just didn't make me laugh. Who knows, you may like it, if you want another Will Ferrell sports comedy. But I was, for the most part, disappointed. The laughs were too few and far between for me to like it.<br/><br/>I say to SKIP ""Semi-Pro"", and give it a below average 5 out of 10. Hey, I made it the whole review without calling the movie ""semi-good"" or ""Semi-bad"". That's an accomplishment."
"fegorleo-1","3","1","2","13 June 2008"," no thanks, no more Ferrell !
","I was pretty hilarious when they started shooting all around with that loaded gun. But that was it. I absolutely disliked the whole cheap and not so funky - thing. It is a big disappointment because I like Will so much -especially older Night at the Roxbury and Blades of Glory. And there... well, it wasn't so much fun after all. Tarantino would have made it look more gloomy, Ben Stiller dirtier, Sean Penn more moralistic for sure, but there... oh my ! Will Ferrell really didn't work on this one, I can't believe this ! Is there even a script ? I mean, it looks like a bad joke : a movie about losers hiring a former champ who's not even one, is actually a movie with losers in it -no actor can really play basketball except that black dude, right?- casting a 'real'actor -the same Harrelson- who must have felt pretty bored the whole time. What a shame, Will ! Never again !"
"angelsfang","Null","1","2","6 June 2008"," I gotta be honest here, it's one of Farrell's worst, but still made me laugh!
","I can't bare to see it below 6.0 but I can't give it 7, it's one of Ferrell's worst by far. Wedding Crashers, Talladega Nights (literally made me vomit with laughter, it was so OTT), Old School, and of course the classic Anchorman are all twice or even ten times better. But Semi-Pro was still funny in short spurts, so it's a decent watch ONLY if you don't have too much expectations.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell's unique comedy style is very much in-your-face, sometimes even forced toilet humor so he's the kind of guy you either enjoy or hate with a passion. I think he's alright, he doesn't make me cringe as much as some other comedians, and sometimes he really hits it on the nail. He has a great supporting cast here to assist him and they have some great lines. If you like the 70's you will enjoy Semi-Pro. Watch out for the Hippie as well, he's a riot in his two or three scenes! And the two announcers have some great lines between each other.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Woody Harrelson is very much wasted here. Like Ferrell, he also has a quirky style and I was looking forward to both of them goofing off of each other, but he plays a serious role this time, he's the only guy on the team of semi-pros to have ever played in the NBA, and his storyline just sucks. Most of the character development sucks in Semi-Pro, this is one of the weakest areas of the film. You don't really care much for them, so you're only watching it for the funny lines and Ferrell's idiocy. I'm a fan of Woody so I was disappointed they cast him for this, let's hope he and Ferrell can work together in the future and create some more laughs. Definitely a rental for me, unless you're a Ferrell fan then by all means go see it immediately."
"SonicStuart","7","1","3","13 October 2008"," Hilarious But The Same Stuff
","Semi-Pro<br/><br/>Starring: Will Ferrell, Andre Benjamin, Woody Harrelson, Rob Corddry, Andy Richter, Maura Tierney, David Koechner and Will Arnett<br/><br/>Genre: Comedy<br/><br/>Rated: R<br/><br/>Will Ferrell stars in his fourth sports movie, Semi-Pro. Will Ferrell plays singer Jackie Moon who buys the ABA team, the Flint Tropics from the profits of his hit song, ""Love Me Sexy"". Jackie Moon is a player, owner and coach of the Flint Tropics as well. The ABA Commissioner (David Koechner) announces that the American Basketball Association would merge with the NBA (which did happen back in the 1970's in real life but it's not based off that entirely) but only four teams would go and now Jackie Moon must try to get his team to average over to 2,000 fans in order to get his team into the NBA merge with the help of acquiring Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson). The movie is hilarious even though most of it is basically recycled stuff from Will Ferrell's other sports movies and Anchorman. But I would assume that this is Will Ferrell's last sports comedy movie since he plays the exact same character as in ""Kicking & Screaming"", ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Blades of Glory"". I didn't like how the basketball game scene shots were too tight when they could've been a little wider. Pretty hilarious but I don't think I can see Will Ferrell doing another sports movie."
"barrys82","7","1","3","15 September 2008"," Unbelievable but it was good enough for me
","Semi Pro's maybe not the best movie of Will Ferrell or even not in his top 5 but believe it or not it worked for me. Yeah it could be better directed and produced, it could be funnier or maybe being a basketball related movie on the 70's decade, they could invite some pro players of the era so it could be more realistic but I think that the movie couldn't give up for more. The movie has the typical Will Ferrell humor, with lots of physical comedy and sex jokes, not all the jokes and gags are funny but it has some moments like the one with the bear fight and when they're performing the halftime show that takes you off a real and sincere laugh. The cast is good, Will Ferrell funny as always although its not his best performance, Woody Harrelson is convincing enough but I just felt him a little forced, Maura Tierney was good but not great and Andre Benjamin as Clarence delivers a very good acting job. In conclusion, this movie only purpose is to entertain and I think he barely accomplishes it. So if you wanna see this movie turn off your brain, relax and enjoy."
"DarthVoorhees","8","1","3","9 June 2008"," There are only so many things Will Ferrel can do with this ""Character""
","For much of his career Will Ferrel has only played one character, the cocky, flamboyant and loud idiot who generates all his laughs by whoring himself out. It worked once in Anchorman and for some reason it worked here. Semi-Pro is unlike the other Will Ferrel comedies in the fact that it exists in a semi-serious world. Will Ferrel's Jackie Moon is surrounded by real characters instead of sidekicks like John C Reilly. Wooody Harrelson is probably the key to why I actually enjoyed this movie. His character Ed Monix is the straight man to Will Ferrel's clown and that is just what the clown needed to be funny again but there are scenes when this character Will loves to play looks simply pathetic.<br/><br/>The plot of Semi-Pro actually plays off of the interesting merger between the ABA and the NBA during the 70's. Jackie Moon owns and plays for an unsuccessful ABA team called the Flint Michigan Tropics. The Tropics have horrible attendance and an even worse record. Moon wants his team to make the NBA but he is informed that only the teams that are actually successful will be included in the merger. Moon is able to get a deal that states that the teams who have the best records will be allowed to go to the NBA. This plot is actually better than that of Anchorman or Talladega Nights. This variation of the character isn't successful to begin with and his cockiness doesn't stem from him being on top, it stems from a delusional reality. Eventually Moon has to admit that he has nothing going for himself and it is one of the best scenes in the movie. Moon brings veteran player Ed Monix to Flint to play for his Tropics. Monix agrees to the deal because his old love lives in the area. Monix is probably the best character in the film because he is an actual basketball player and not a cardboard cut out of one. Jackie brings in his nude wife to the locker room during halftime and Monix snaps yelling that shoving tits in someone's face won't win basketball games. I was surprised because Monix was saying what I as an audience member was thinking. The team soon recruits Monix to be their new coach much to Jackie's displeasure. They begin winning games and improving their attendance due to funny promotions(I Jackie Moon will wrestle a Bear) Their efforts are in vain though because the NBA says they will not take the Flint Tropics. With nothing to play for in their last regular season game, the team decides they have to play for pride in an ending that is more satisfactory than anything WIll Ferrel has allowed his character to do before.<br/><br/>I hated Ricky Bobby, and Chazz Michael Michaels but for some reason I liked Jackie Moon. Jackie never had the success those characters had and he is truly a pathetic piece of existence but for some reason I felt for him and found his punchlines funny. He is cocky but he does care about his team and he is a competitor who has to fight for what he wants unlike those other sports characters. <br/><br/>Semi-Pro is funny and hopefully this character will be retired on a high note"
"aaronjamesmaximus","3","0","5","23 January 2016"," This movie is a ripoff
","I can't believe no one here has made a comparison between this and the 1977 movie Slap Shot starring Paul Newman. Anyway I first watched this movie as a kid and loved it for the violence, the weird humor, and what I though was an original story. However; Semi Pro is not original in the slightest it stole everything from a little movie from the 70's called Slap Shot.<br/><br/>Semi Pro like Slap Shot has a plot which features an underdog team who are going to be disbanded at the end of the season because of their losing streak and poor track record who then decide to start improving their game, but also start fights between their rival teams which makes no sense because they were playing basketball not a sport known for it's overly violent behavior between rival players. But I digress, and besides, when I first watched it, I knew almost nothing about professional basketball.<br/><br/>Anyway, they get a new player or players and he or they help the team drastically improve their game and consequently also get more fans. Things start to look up for the protagonists but then then the coach takes a visit to the team's owner or whatever and finds their team will be disbanded regardless of if they win or not. Then as the cards seem to tipped against them, but things turn around they win the game gets the trophy and become a new team. Which is the exact same plot as Slap Shot with some minor differences. Now Semi-Pro may try to add in more humor like fighting a grizzly bear or the team dressing up as fruity sea creatures and other failed attempts at humor. While Slap Shot on the other is a little more subtle with its humor, though you'd be hard pressed to call anything in slap shot, subtle, though it is when you examine it and it produces some honestly funny moments where most people find themselves laughing and not just spaced out stoners and nimrods who find Dane Cook and that puppet guy funny.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie fooled me as a kid, but don't let it fool you it's a cheap ripoff of another infinitely better movie made to make money."
"SnoopyStyle","7","0","2","28 February 2015"," love the stupidity of Ferrell
","It's 1976. Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) is a bombastic incompetent owner and player of the Flint Tropics, a last place ABA team. Clarence Withers (AndrÃ© Benjamin) is their best player who hogs the ball. The NBA is merging with ABA taking only 4 teams. Moon proposes the 4 teams should have the best records. He trades away the team's washing machine for aging point guard Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson). He's looking to get back with his old girlfriend Lynn. The team also needs 2000 fans every home game to qualify for the merger.<br/><br/>The reason I like this movie is that I like these characters and Ferrell is a hilarious idiot. He's ridiculous and stupid. That's why it's funny. His stupidity keeps rolling and he gets a few really big laughs. One has to be willing to enjoy the idiocy. It's not quite all the way to being a spoof which probably cause some confusion to some. I think it's interesting to have a mix so that Ferrell's comedy doesn't wear out."
