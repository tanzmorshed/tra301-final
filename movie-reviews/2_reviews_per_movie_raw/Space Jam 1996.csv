","This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect."

","Film unmissable. MJ and Bugs Bunny together in a fun and film unique: the films of my childhood. Despite the years watching Space Jam is always nice, because there are few films that can merge reality with the 'animation. Moreover, the presence of a legend sports like Michael Jordan makes this movie a must for any basketball fan, also the film is full of quotations and sports references that make it a real gem. The story is very simple but well managed: a group of aliens to steal players NBA their talent, by doing so challenge mj and looney tunes in Basketball: at stake is the freedom of the animated characters and Legend of the Chicago Bulls."

","If you're looking for intelligent, high-brow comedy...what is WRONG with you, this is a LOONEY TUNES MOVIE!  Sheesh...this film is nothing outstanding, but it is simply fun.  I'm sure that Michael Jordan enjoyed star billing, but as is usually the case when your co-star is a cartoon rabbit with more than 50 years of experience behind him (and one of the best catch phrases in cinema), he is up-staged by Bugs Bunny.  Oh, not to say that Jordan turned in a poor performance.  Thank goodness this guy at least seems to have a good sense of humor.But there's some simple, pure enjoyment in watching this film.  I got a kick out of the big basketball game, and found the sequence with Bugs and Daffy retrieving Michael's lucky boxers to be a riot.  Yea, the plot is pretty hare-brained ('scuse me, Bugs...duck-brained;D), but it's nothing unworthy of Looney Tunes.  Don't ever forget that-this is a Looney Tunes film.  They got away with using anything for a plot, and this movie is in the same tradition.  It's like asking a movie about Beavis and Butthead to be artful and dramatic.  Looney Tunes represent the goofy side of animation, and this film adheres well to that philosophy.  I recommend this for any fan of Looney Tunes...oh yea, if your a sports fan, you should enjoy it too.  I, a mild basketball fan, really enjoyed myself."

","One of my earliest inspirations was Bugs Bunny and the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes.  This movie brings back all the favorites.  And not just Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the other stars.  This movie features every character that ever appeared in a Warner Bros. cartoon.  Your eyes are certainly kept busy looking for each one!  Pairing the animation with Michael Jordan's athletic abilities may seem a little mismatched.  But the game just becomes that much more enjoyable."

","Space Jam is a very enjoyable movie featuring probably the most popular cartoon characters ever. The plot may seem rather weak to you and me, but let's not forget that this movie was made for children. Space Jam has all the humor of the classic shorts that made us love Bugs, Daffy and all the rest. Michael Jordan actually wasn't that bad in this movie, considering he is not a professional actor. Bill Murray was very hilarious. Thumbs up on this one.<br/><br/>""That's all folks!"""

","Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie. <br/><br/>Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over. <br/><br/>This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about. <br/><br/>In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed."
"kayla-moore","9","40","52","2 October 2005"," A good movie.
","This movie was intended to be a kid's movie! And all of us MJ fans alike respect the movie simply because he was in it. The acting wasn't bad -- it was just on a children's level... of which it was intended! I really liked Space Jam when I was younger, I still like the movie from time to time, even. So saying it is like a Muppets movie is absurd! I do agree that Marvin the Martian should have been the villain, mainly because DeVito's character got on my nerves. I LOVE the fact that they brought a girl character... and presented her as the best ball player (aside from Jordan). During this time, we were all about political correction! I think this movie suits its own time and appeals to its intended audience."

","I saw ""Space Jam"" the first day it was released in November of '96. I was eight years old, and of course like any child, I loved it.  I thought Michael Jordan's acting was great and the film was a masterpiece.  Fast forward to 2003, and I still love it.  Jordan's acting ain't that great but nonetheless I can still sit down and watch the whole movie, and love every minute of it.  What upsets me about this movie is that it is hard to find on DVD.  I've been trying to look for it for years, but I just heard that it will be released on a special edition DVD. When I get it, I'll probably watch it everyday.         <br/><br/>This is a must for children and those Jordan freaks (like myself)<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","God only knows how many times I have seen this movie when I was a kid. To this day in 2015, Space Jam is commonly aired on the Rock & Roll Picture Show on VH1. A very quotable movie that every person like me growing up in the 90's loved. <br/><br/>""We need your HEEEELLP!!!"" and ""Don't every call me...doll."" and ""Your secret stuff.""<br/><br/>It's perfect all ages. I loved watching this movie when I was only 3 years old when it came out. Toddlers will enjoy the cartoony characters coming to life and everything is bright and colorful.<br/><br/>I seriously can't think of one bad flaw about this movie. <br/><br/>Nothing is subjective or offensive. There's no lame farting or waffle jokes (looking at you Teen Titans Go) and nothing is dumb-downed for adults to get sick of. And I think that's part of the reason why people still casually watch it 20 years later.<br/><br/>I'll explain my 10 star rating. How many sports movies out there do you know are marketed for kids?<br/><br/>I loved this movie back in 1997 and I still love it in 2015.<br/><br/>Ignore the haters. This movie is fantastic."

The introduction about Michael Jordan's skills is epic as well as the final match.I really liked the soundtrack but not so much the graphic. <br/><br/>It sucks that this movie and Looney Tunes have been forgotten; 5.9 out 10 is just to low for this great movie, it must be rated and reviewed with the eyes of a child."
"preppy-3","7","24","32","2 April 2008"," Silly but hard to dislike
","Movie about Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Roadrunner etc etc). An evil animated monster runs Moron Mountain--a planet with an amusement park. They need a new ride so he sends five helpers to Earth to kidnap the Looney Tunes characters. Then they can be used as a new act at the amusement park. Bugs and the others agree--IF they play them in a basketball game and win. Bugs and the others convince Michael Jordan to help them--but the aliens have evil plans up their sleeve.<br/><br/>Michael Jordan meets the Looney Tunes. Sounds like a sure recipe for disaster. I was positive this film was going to be a bomb when it was released (with HEAVY publicity) in 1996. Yes--it's silly but if you love Looney Tunes (like I do) you'll probably love this. The characters are treated (more or less) respectfully and during the climatic basketball game the stands are full of every Warner Bros. cartoon character ever made. One small mouse character who talks nonstop I remembered from childhood and I literally broke up laughing when he appeared! The animation is just great, the merging of live action with cartoon figures works and the script is fun. There are groaners and stupid lines but, all in all, it was pretty amusing.<br/><br/>The debits: Michael Jordan just can't act. I'm sure he was a wonderful basketball player but his acting was as wooden as a basketball court. Also various other sports figures pop up and prove they're worse actors than Jordan! Bill Murray (who can be good) is just lousy in a supporting role. And Wayne Knight is just SO annoying. Also I could have lived without seeing the Warner Bros. logo popping up everywhere. At one point it's on Daffy Duck's butt...and he kisses it! And there's a brief take-off on ""Pulp Fiction"" which isn't as funny now as it was in 1996. So, these things lessen the movie but don't destroy it. Worth catching if you're a Warner Bros. animation fan. Kids will love it. I give it a 7."

"Desertman84","10","9","11","29 March 2013"," Great Combo Of Basketball And Animation
","Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters.In the movie, Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan, if they win, is to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.Also starring Academy Award-nominee Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. It was directed by Joe Pytka with Tony Cervone and Bruce W. Smith directing the animation. <br/><br/>After Jordan announces his retirement from the game, he follows in his father's footsteps and turns to a career in baseball. Meanwhile, a group of criminal aliens called 'The Nerdlucks', led by their boss Mister Swackhammer plot to capture the Looney Tunes characters, who really exist in a secret animated world called Tune Land, and make them their newest attractions at Moron Mountain, a failing amusement park. Swackhammer believes enslaving the Tunes in this way will bring in more customers and save Moron Mountain from foreclosure. They arrive in Tune Land, and, seeing how short the aliens are, the Tunes, aided by a new arrival named Lola Bunny, bargain for their freedom by challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the Talent of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, who are rendered incapable of playing basketball as a result. The Nerdlucks use the stolen Talent to transform into gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat, re-naming themselves the Monstars in the process. To help them win, the Tunes choose and recruit Michael, and he reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. At the game's climax, The TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Michael to score the winning point. Extending his arm to superhuman lengths with the power of toon physics, Michael makes the basket and wins the game. He helps the Monstars realize that they're bigger than Mister Swackhammer, who confronts them for losing. Fed up with their abusive boss, the Monstars tie him up and send him to the moon. At Michael's request, they return the stolen Talent to the other players by transferring them to a basketball. This reverts the Monstars back to the tiny Nerdlucks. Refusing to return to Moron Mountain to endure humiliation from their former boss, the Nerdlucks decide to stay with the Looney Tunes, who only agree if the Nerdlucks can prove themselves to be 'Looney', which they arguably complete on the spot. Afterwards, Michael returns to Earth in the Nerdlucks' spaceship, where he makes a dramatic appearance at a baseball game to the cheers of the audience, despite being late. The next day, Michael gives the stolen Talent back to the NBA players, who immediately regain their lost skills. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback in 1996.<br/><br/>Simpler and cruder in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam. Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics is a must-see for adults, kids, teenagers, women, men, boys, girls, old folks, young folks, Jordan fans, Bill Murray fans, Wayne Knight fans and every Looney Tunes lover who wants to revel in Bugs Bunny and his pals at their looney tuniest. A great combination of basketball and animation."

"StevePulaski","8","6","7","7 February 2016"," Authentic fun on everyone's behalf
","NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" <br/><br/>Living in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan's unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan's legacy didn't stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.<br/><br/>If we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan's versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan's departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from ""Moron Mountain"" to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.<br/><br/>The Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the ""Monstars"" of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.<br/><br/>As an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray's interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.<br/><br/>Because both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would've seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don't try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clichéd underdog element.<br/><br/>Starring: Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, and Larry Bird. Directed by: Joe Pytka."

","I notice a lot of people have very few kind words to say about SPACE JAM . I must admit that being a Scot I have little interest in basketball and know very little of the career of Michael Jordan ( Who's Michael Jordan ? ) but I still found this movie to be fair entertainment . I guess a lot of people dislike this movie because Mr Jordan played for such and such a basketball team <br/><br/>A bunch of evil aliens invade Looney Tunes World and cast the cartoon characters into slavery and it's left to a sports legend to save them ! Come on guys , plots don't come anymore original than that so what's there to dislike ? We also have a subplot of the aliens interfering with other basketball players which did cause some amusement to this audience member . Also very enjoyable were the number of cameos that crept up through the movie , most notably Bill Murray <br/><br/>Okay I wouldn't say SPACE JAM is as great as WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT but it's still an entertaining family movie regardless of how you feel about sport . With this in mind I'm totally puzzled why my local ITV station decided to broadcast it at 1.10 am !"
"bob the moo","Null","19","29","30 December 2002"," Good cartoon with plenty for adults  more than just selling products
","A group of aliens arrive in Loony Tune world and challenge the inhabitants to a battle for the ownership of that world.  Seeing the aliens are tiny, Bugs Bunny decides a game of basketball should be easily won.  However the aliens steal the talent from several NBA players and look set to win easily. However Bugs and Daffy kidnap Michael Jordan and ask for his help.<br/><br/>At the time of release I must admit that I wasn't keen on seeing this film as the whole merchandising thing had left me with a sour taste in my mouth, putting me off the film.  Happy Meals and such were everywhere!  Later I saw it on TV, away from all the hype and found it enjoyable but not great.  The plot is silly, but who cares  it's a cartoon.  The comedy is good and has plenty for kids with the cartoon characters doing cartoon things, but also for adults.  The film is full of in-jokes for adults ranging from a 3 second spoof of Pulp Fiction to some really funny lines  `oh great, no one told me Dan Aykroyd was in this film' when Bill Murray makes an appearance, was my favourite.  Also as a big basketball (and Knick) fan it was fun to have tonnes of basketball stars make fun of themselves as well.<br/><br/>However it is a cartoon at heart and I imagine that those who don't like pratfalls etc and aren't basketball fans won't be laughing all the time. Also, surprisingly for Jordan's first film, the basketball action is pretty poor.  I know it didn't have to be realistic but the great man is amazing enough in action without giving him amazing rubber arms etc with special effects.<br/><br/>Jordan is good and is a better actor than others I've seen, but he is only playing himself and not that naturally either!  The support cast is where the money is and they all work well.  Whether it be the cartoon characters or adults they all do what they have to.  De Vito is funny and Randle is sexy but as usual Murray steals each and every scene he is in!<br/><br/>Overall this manages to be more than a sales drive for Happy Meals (although the McDonalds product placement is a bit tasteless  hey! Just like the burgers!) and is an enjoyable film.  The kids will be happy with the cartoon element and most adults will like the in-jokes and the NBA players making jokes at their expense."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","30","52","25 May 2007"," The Good & Bad Of 'Space Jam'
","GOOD - Simply an enjoyable movie; lots of fun to watch and highlighted by a humorous Basketball game. Also, the surround sound is very good, the colors are beautiful, the cartoon effects well done and funny. Some of the humor is laugh-out-loud variety. As with a many good animated movies, there is so much to see and hear it would take many viewings to catch all the gags. With each viewing, you'll laugh at things you never noticed before. <br/><br/>As far as ""live"" actors working with cartoon figures, this was much better done than the earlier ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" so progress has been made in that area. While there is a lot going on, there are enough lulls to give viewers periodic breaks. The basketball action is fun to watch and I was surprised how well real-life stars Larry Bird and Michael Jordan acted.<br/><br/>BAD - The story gets a little too juvenile in spots. The PC-minded female character (rabbit) is overly feminist, to the point of irritation and the occult gets far too much credibility in this story. Also, there are a few sexual innuendos in here that adults would catch but, hopefully, not little kids.<br/><br/>OVERALL, a movie that appeals to adults and kids. Basketball fans will really enjoy it."

"Stampsfightclub","8","3","3","13 November 2008"," why the negativity?
","Michael Jordan is sucked into Looney Tune land to help Bugs Bunny and co win a basketball game against 5 aliens who will make them slaves if they lose.<br/><br/>The Looney Tunes are a great creation. The wackiness and imagination behind each character is a simple bliss. And each character is brought to the big screen in this sports comedy which has received disappointing reviews. It is a wonder why this film is looked at negatively considering that it is funny and is ultimately light hearted entertainment.<br/><br/>With one of the best positive songs to ever open a film, Space Jam dives deep into one of basketball's all time greats in Michael Jordan.<br/><br/>As the title song by Quad City DJ pounds out ""Welcome to the Space Jam, alright!"" we are immediately uplifted and shown numerous pictures from Jordan's life as a basketball player, giving the audience a reflection on the passage to stardom. Sweet, if somewhat cliché inspirational.<br/><br/>After Jordan declares he is to leave basketball to become a baseball player we are taken to a typically evil setting, a theme park run by Danny De Vito's Mr Swackhammer, that ugly looking animated evil genius.<br/><br/>And then the real fun begins as we see comparisons from real life to fantasy and a charm and sweetness about the extraordinary is encoded to give a feel of light-heartedness.<br/><br/>Ultimately Space Jam is actually really funny because it is so silly. There is little realism with just in time situations and how humans actually get into Looney Tune land, but is this a film to give explanation to anything? No. This 1996 Pytka picture is about entertaining the whole family and it does just that.<br/><br/>This is a film anyone from the family can sit back and enjoy. The likability of the Looney Tunes will make children laugh, especially the slapstick humour. The basketball players who lose their talents are great viewing for the elder viewers, pure real life styled comedy.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone, especially Jordan is poor. Bill Murray (Lost in Translation) is in a small role and as always is great to watch.<br/><br/>The music from this picture is outstanding, perfectly fitting to the narrative. From the opening song to Seal's ""Fly like an eagle"" we are given perfect harmony. Not to forget R Kelly's I believe I can fly which speaks for itself.<br/><br/>The plot is always entertaining and equally predictable. However the comedy, the likability and relaxation of the film is good enough reason to sit back and enjoy"

","For the first time in his illustrious career, Michael ""Air"" Jordan shares the court and the spotlight with some of the most intimidating players in basketball...most of which have fur and feathers.<br/><br/>""Space Jam"" melds real-life and cartoon-life as well as in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and with about the same result.  No one can say that they skimped on the FX, or the story - which yields some mighty big laughs.<br/><br/>Seems that Looney Tune Land is under threat from aliens from an other-worldly amusement park and the only way Bugs, Daffy, Porky and Tweety can save themselves from intergalactic slavery is by challenging them to a basketball game.  But when the aliens in question acquire powers from Earth's best b-ball players (Ewing, Barkley, Bogues, etc.) and become Mon-Stars, Bugs and company acquire the newly-retired Jordan to help them get game.<br/><br/>Jordan is comfortable in front of the camera, even when surrounded by cartoon characters and Bill Murray (!), so he proves he has even a future as a movie star, especially in movies like this.  And as if there were ever a doubt, Bugs Bunny shows he still has what it takes after all these years.<br/><br/>I love this movie; I've always been a fan of animation and ""Space Jam"" doesn't disappoint.  Every figure, shadow and shade of skin is perfect and shares screen time with real people so seamlessly that, sure, it looks real enough that we could be surprised that this kind of thing doesn't happen every day.<br/><br/>Anyway, you have to love a movie where Murray's big entrance is heralded by someone shouting ""I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture!""<br/><br/>Ten stars and a pair of Nikes for ""Space Jam"".  <br/><br/>Now, how about a sequel with Joe Montana?"

I love this movie i love this soundtrack i love space jam.<br/><br/>A fantastic soundtrack, great nineties cult and a brilliant well-done fun children's film."

","""Space Jam"" is one of those movies that is part of my childhood aside from the ""Star Wars"" movies; ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;"" ""The Wizard of Oz;"" and many other movies that I grew up with. Now, by looking back it today, it still holds up and it does bring a lot memories back to my childhood. However, is it up there with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""? No. But I still think this is a fun movie for kids and adults to enjoy. ""Space Jam"" tells a story in a fictional way that Michael Jordan has retired from being a famous basketball player to become a baseball player like what his father want him to play. When the evil Swackhammer send his Nerdlucks to capture Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes to make them part of their attractions at an amusement park place called Moron Mountain. So Bugs and the rest of the gang decide to challenge them for playing basketball, the Nerdlucks stole Charles Barkley and the other famous NBA player's talents to become the Monstars which it all leads to the Looney Tunes to recruit Jordan to come back playing basketball and to beat the Monstars. I got to say that Michael Jordan's acting isn't that bad as what others say about him. I thought he did well as he is only playing himself, and playing natural as an everyday guy that plays sports and has a family on his own. So, in my opinion, I thought he did good job for not only playing himself, but able to do his own stunts when he is playing basketball. I don't have much thoughts on Wayne Knight's performance, but I thought he did fine. Bill Murray is also fun to watch as he is like Jordan playing himself. Forgot to mention, Danny DeVito was also fun for voicing Swackhammer. Billy West and Dee Bradley Baker both nail their voice acting really well for playing Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Same goes to other voice actor. Although they are not on par with Mel Blanc, but they were able to remain true on what their voices are suppose to sound like. Of course I got to mention Lola Bunny, I thought she was a great addition to the other Looney Tunes; I know some others reacted negatively that they want her to be like what the Looney Tunes do, but I appreciate her from being different and I do think that she is a perfect love interest to Bugs Bunny. I never saw what ""The Looney Tunes Show"" did with her character differently, and not sure how I will feel about that. I thought the special effects in this movie are just as good as what ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" did for its mixture of animation and live action. The basketball court is CGI, but it did not bothered me because I thought it kind of looks like an actual court if it was really there. The bad ones that I know are CG is the Monstars made Michael Jordan look like a basketball, and Wayne Knight's character to be inflated like a balloon until he returns back to his normal size. Aside from the bad ones, most of the special effects are really good. I thought the basketball scene in the last act of the movie is well done. James Newton Howard's score for the film is also well done as well as the film's soundtrack. I love Seal's ""Fly Like an Eagle;"" R.Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly;"" Quad City DJ's ""Space Jam"" theme song, and some others. Joe Pytka's direction in this movie was absolutely great, and I thought he handle the basketball scenes as he knows where to point the camera at and how it should be edit. On a side note, I like to mention that Ivan Reitman produce this movie, and Bill Murray makes a joke about how he got to the cartoon world where he mentions a producer that he is friends with and sent a Teamster to drop him off. Nothing important, but I had to bring that up in case if you didn't know about. Anyway, ""Space Jam"" is a fun movie and I still enjoy it! I give it a 9 out of 10."
"lesleyharris30","8","2","2","12 July 2010"," Simple Looney Tunes Fun,
","Space Jam is a great movie with a well written plot, a great cast and immensely talented voice cast. This movie is certainly nothing fantastic, the story is far fetched even for Looney Tunes standards and it does not deliver any memorable lines like we've seen in many of their well known cartoons. However, I have seen this many times and still love it to this day, it was a big movie from my childhood and it is certainly great nostalgia. The movie does hold up pretty well as a great family film, obviously people of all ages love the Looney Tunes, I find it impossible to not feel joy when Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck are onscreen, and watching them play basketball with the surprisingly good actor and professional basketball player Michael Jordan, who has a great presence on screen, against a group of aliens is fun and enjoyable from start to finish. Comedic actors such Bill Murray and Wayne Knight are more fun for adults and provide some great one liners. Watch it with the whole family and just forget about real life for 90 minutes, the whole house will get a great kick out of Space Jam. <br/><br/>Michael Jordan plays a basketball game with Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes against a group of aliens that are looking to keep them as slaves for their theme park. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Jordan"
"dolite91","8","2","2","25 August 2007"," Enter the great story of Space Jam!
","I was not surprised that many people criticized the movie. I myself agree that this movie had destroyed our beloved Looney Tunes characters' personalities. Other than that, Space Jam featured the first appearance of Bugs' love interest, Lola Bunny, who is very seductive. However, I still enjoyed it. This movie may only be for young children and is underrated. But to me, it is something new. Space Jam had moved our Looney Tunes characters into a basketball game against the Monstars that would decide their fate. Moveover, it also featured many real-life basketball players such as Michael Jordon and Larry Johnson. However, it is a pity that this movie seemed to receive more criticism from movie critics. But remember this: CRITICS MAY SOMETIMES BE WRONG. See what happened to Space Jam instead? It became a box office success, grossing over 90 million in America alone Lastly, I laughed a lot of time when I was watching the whole movie. I would say that it is better than the 2003 Looney Tunes: Back In Action. Looney Tunes: Back In Action seemed to be a serious movie with less comical scenes than Space Jam but I still enjoyed because it is an adventure film. Space Jam is great. Long Live Space Jam. Highly recommend. My Rating:8/10"
"dy158","8","2","2","16 July 2006"," Loony Tunes meets basketball...fun!
","I had so know about the Loony Tunes. I mean, Bugs Bunny and gang are among the ones which I grew up watching those cartoons which feature them.<br/><br/>Add in NBA star Michael Jordan, and one gets a movie about a bunch of animated characters playing basketball. I remembered I saw this when my teacher showed it once in class. I forgot when was it, but it was some time back already.<br/><br/>Winning over evil can be a little cliché at times, but who cares when this makes up those crazy Loony Tunes characters and Michael Jordan at the same time? <br/><br/>Great for anyone who is young and young at heart."

","I first saw this movie back when I was 7. I had just got it for my birthday. I could not wait to watch it and when I did I loved it. It is a very good movie for anyone at any age (though it does have some language in it) especially if you are a looney tunes fan. It has great laughs and gestures, has everybody's favorite looney tune characters(like Bugs, Daffy, Porky, and Elmer), it also stars the famous basketball player Michal Jordan and some other basketball players like Charles Barkly, and it even introduces a new female character,Lola Bunny(who acts as Bug's new girlfriend), with a little sex-appeal. Space Jam is a very good movie for anyone, especially for loony tune fans or kids who love cartoons."
"tastyhotdogs","6","2","2","19 February 2006"," A movie I'll make my kid watch so he subliminally decides to get into basketball
","I saw this at the cinemas when it came out with a bunch of my homies...a scary thought.<br/><br/>The movie (I'm reviewing this as if it was an ordinary movie) revolves around the pending basketball match between the Looney Tunes characters (Daffy Duck, Road Runner, Tweety Bird etc) and the characters from Moron Mountain. You see Moron Mounatin, located in outer space, is struggling for patrons, so the boss decides to try to kidnap the Looney Tunes guys. In a shrewd move, Bugs Bunny manages to stave off the kidnapping by getting them to agree to a basketball match to decide their fate. If his squad loses, the Looney Tunes characters move to Moron Mountain as entertainers forever. If they win, they are free. Sounds fair. But then the Moron Mountain squad decides to play dirty and goes and steals the talents of some of the NBA elite. The Looney Tunes manage a coup of their own, signing up the greatest player ever, Michael Jordan. The teams train and prepare for the biggest games of their lives. What will be the Looney Tunes fate? See it and find out! Entertaining enough, but pretty cheesy. Some good cameos from some NBA stars (Barkley,Ewing etc) and some entertainment greats. Confusing a bit for kids, but they'll get it in the end."
"andy-227","Null","2","2","9 June 1999"," Cute, colorful, and funny, but so what?
","Honestly, what is there to this movie, other than Michael Jordan making lots of money with the help of the Looney Tunes?  I've seen Looney Tunes cartoons that had more to them than this!  This movie is enjoyable, yes, with lots of laughs and colorful animation, but so what?  What's the point?  Is there one?  And howcome I'm the only person on the IMDB who doesn't seriously like this movie?  It's entertaining, but where's the plot?  The old Looney Tunes had Elmer Fudd hunting for wabbits.  Those cartoons had more than this movie does.  It's a brainless, plotless, potentially pointless event that has all of the Looney Tunes helping Michael Jordan play basketball against aliens from outer space.  Catchy idea for a Looney Tunes short, but not a whole movie!  ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America"" had more to it than this!  What amazes me the most is that the critics loved it.  I don't get it.  It was entertaining, but that's it!  Nothing else involved or achieved.  After this, Michael Jordan literally lived on all of the commercials with Looney Tunes in them.  The network TV premiere ads called this a ""one-time, unforgettable, major event"".  What?!  This a major event?!  It just amazes me that people go to the movies, simply to turn their minds off and watch meaningless and pointless box-office glitter!  I guess this was made for kids, but I've seen children's movies that made more sense than this!  Or they probably made it to make Michael Jordan an extra bag of money(not that he doesn't already have enough money).  Oh well, ""Space Jam"" is out there, proving to the world that if you have Michael Jordan, the Looney Tunes, and no plot, you can actually channel it onto celluloid and make tons of money off of it!"
"Mickey Knox","6","2","2","3 January 2001"," pleasant watch
","Space Jam is a good entertaining movie. I am a huge basketball fan so there was no way i could have missed this film. Still i expected much more from it. The story is probably known by everyone who got to read this. Bugs, Daffy and the other Looney Tunes, together with Michael Jordan, have to play a match against some aliens that steal the talent of 5 NBA players.<br/><br/>It's funny many times, and the idea of mixing real-life and cartoons is very good. If you start watching this, you won't quit til the end, that's for sure. The presence of so many NBA stars is welcomed and adored by all NBA fans out there. Michael is good for his first role and i am convinced that with a little bit of work he could easily become a professional actor. The other NBA stars used in the film are funny, especially Pat Ewing and Charles Barkley, after they lose their talent. Also you'll get to see plaing themselves other stars like Mugsey Bogues, Larry Bird, Bill Murray (funny as he always is - definetely one of my fav comedians nowadays). The soundtrack is also great, especially R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Amazing song.<br/><br/>Well these are the good parts. What went wrong with the movie? Some of the scenes are just not funny. I was convinced i'll laugh alot, but i didn't, just because some gags don't work. They're either weak or they have been seen again. The voices of some cartoon characters are not the real ones, which is bad for the movie. And after all it's just a simple comedy.<br/><br/>Definetely worth to watch, still can't give it more than a 6 out of 10."

Nobody played the game of basketball better than he did. And I thought he did a good job acting in ""Space Jam"". You have to admit, Jordan did a much better job acting in a major motion picture than Shaquille O'Neal did in ""Kazaam"". Here, Jordan's main co-stars are the Bugs Bunny characters. Also, you get cameo appearances from some of Jordan's friends which include Bill Murray, and former and present NBA stars. ""Space Jam"" isn't a great film, but it's good, silly fun.

"K-Slicer","7","5","8","13 July 2003"," A Popcorn Flick...nothing more
","I first saw this film upon release back seven years ago. It was good for a popcorn flick but not if you were looking for something with a little more psychological bite (like Fargo, released in the same year). Here are my reasons (spoilers herein): (1) I love the Looney Tunes and I will always be a fan of them no matter how inept and lame the next movie they make is. (2) Michael Jordan's performance is OK for a first attempt. (3) The special effects are well-done. (4) The entire sequence where the players try to figure out how they lost their talent almost had me on the floor laughing. (5) Charles Barkley uttered the line ""I'll never go out with Madonna again"" while praying to God is the single best adult-oriented line in the movie. (6) They couldn't resist taking a shot at Disney as well. (7) The best performance in the movie goes to Bill Murray.  He is relentless when he is on screen and it pays off.  Murray's cameo is one of his better roles pre-Rushmore and one of the best cameos of all time.  Seven reasons give a score of seven.<br/><br/>As for the downsides: (1) Not much was given to plot development but there wasn't much to begin with in the first place. (2) Creepiest performance goes to Wayne Knight as Stan.  He was like Wormtail in the Harry Potter series. (3) Those little aliens are really annoying and whiny.  I prefer the villains to have a bit of a backbone even if they are puny.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Space Jam"" is just another popcorn flick that is perfect to kill a weekend afternoon with.  Michael Jordan should stick to his day job which isn't ironically playing basketball anymore.  As for mixing cartoon characters and real-life characters into movies, thankfully these films are few and far between.  I suggest other titles like ""Rushmore"" and ""Fargo"" among others and this should be picked out as a last resort.<br/><br/>Here ends my rant!"
"lukem-52760","8","3","4","16 February 2020"," WOW!!! WHAT A LOVELY 90'S GEM
","I love ""Space Jam"" & remember fondly how big this movie was back in 1996, it was a massive blockbuster hit movie & i had some of the Awesome Action figures & remember buying ""Space Jam"" the day it was released to buy on home video from the Blockbuster video store, i miss that place & those days so much!!! I loved the 90's & this movie is an absolute product of that lovely time period, when the legendary Michael Jordan was a Basketball super star & to put him at the height of his superstardom in a kids animated fantasy adventure was pure genius.
Everybody has always loved the Looney Tunes characters & here Michael Jordan is brought to the tunes animated universe to help save their world from an evil group of Monsters that wanna take over, the great Danny DeVito does the excellent voice work of the evil mastermind ""Swackhammer"" & his group of colourful monster/alien things magically steal some professional NBA players talents & challenge the Looney tunes to a Basketball game & the prize is if they win is to keep their world!!!
Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duff mission it to the human world & seek out the greatest player ""Michael Jordan"" for help, that's the plot & it's a blast of amazing animation & hilarious antics but all feelgood family fun.<br/><br/>""Space Jam"" is a wonderful fantasy adventure that is just a joy to watch & is buzzing with energy & a sense of Fun. The music is sweet & nice & this Classic is produced by the great IVAN REITMAN, the genius who made both Ghostbusters films, Kindergarten Cop, Evolution, Twins & Junior, so this man knows great fantasy comedy.
We also gets an Awesome & hilarious little role from comic genius BILL MURRAY!!! There's also the big funny guy, Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park) & famous faces from the NBA.<br/><br/>All in all ""Space Jam"" is a Comedy CLASSIC from the 90's that i have a big soft spot for & have always loved.
Big Nostalgia Love."
"byson5186","9","3","4","20 June 2015"," Fun/Entertaining
","This is one of the movies I would watch as a kid. It seems like a lot of the people on these IMDb message boards and reviews for this movie Space Jam are around the same age I am and remember watching this movie when we were younger. My parents still have this movie on VHS, and I remember giving it to my older sister for her 17th Birthday, but I don't think she ever really watched it, or maybe once. Whenever I watch this movie, it's a trip down Memory Lane. I still remember it pretty well from when the movie was new and when I was a kid watching it on VHS.<br/><br/>Here is what makes this movie interesting. Well, there are lots of sports movies including certain sports movies for kids. From what the internet tells us, this movie is still the highest grossing basketball movie to date, and keep in mind this movie is almost 20-years old. In this movie, we get to see real basketball players who play themselves. Obviously, the main one Michael Jordan. We also have Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Mugsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, and Shawn Bradley. We also have Bill Murray in this movie who plays a character with the same name, but not supposed to be the same person.<br/><br/>What makes this movie entertaining. Well, Michael Jordan was talked about more in the '90s. He doesn't seem talked about so much anymore. But, I think that was nice of him to star in a fun entertaining movie where the target audience was kids. Kids being able to see their hero in an entertaining 1.5 hour movie. This movie wasn't a documentary featuring him or a movie about his life, but a movie for entertainment. Yeah, it's a movie featuring Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes. We've all seen the Looney Tunes cartoons, Merry Melodies and those cartoons are from decades ago, but we still remember the characters and the sound effects including the sound effects where a character like Wile. E. Coyote falls off a cliff. That sound effect sounds like a bomb being dropped from a military plane. It's just cool seeing a plot involving Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, and the movie will definitely keep us entertained and our eyes on the screen.<br/><br/>So, I enjoy watching this movie. It still entertains me as an adult. With sports movies that have been made and ones that will be eventually make for kids, we can ask which one will come out next? I believe there is a Space Jam 2 in the works. But, if they could make a certain sports movie for kids, this is one I'd love to see becoming a film even though I doubt it will become one. The funniest book I've read in my entire life is a 1993 book called, The Toilet Paper Tigers by Gordon Korman. I crack up while reading it and in terms of reading I'd recommend it for you if you like reading. With coming up with new ideas for sports films, that would be awesome if they did a well done version of that book into a movie.<br/><br/>To conclude, if you want to relive your childhood days, or the days when Michael Jordan was a bigger athlete, you can watch this film. You most likely will consider it Fun/Entertaining!!"
"DaveDaveTor","8","3","4","16 January 2015"," It's good mixing real characters and cartoons creatures
","I've recorded it so often in the past and even now. I remember the first time I've watched this, and saw one of favorite idols like Michael Jordan taking part in a mixture between cartoon world and real world. TODAY I still like this movie made from a qualified crew which arranged so good the two mixed cinematic visions. Some producer can do that too as plan and organize everything in a similar mode. THE WAY M. Jordan also does the actor makes me more fair of him than before. One of the best entertaining and sport movies of the '90s watched. Also fine the interaction between cartoons and human characters and well organized and overlapped, considering the relevance of Looneu Tunes. I recommend this movie for the families and the sport lovers !"

","The setup: Basketball icon Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes play a basketball game versus alien slavers to determine their freedom.<br/><br/>The verdict: I am aware of much of the criticism around this movie, claiming it is awful and not worth seeing. To all those who have said these things, I just have to ask: What movie were you watching? With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from 1996. I laughed and was moved and all of that good stuff. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining blockbuster, so 7/10."
"lisafordeay","7","3","4","30 April 2014"," I actually liked this as a kid and I still do even though I didn't see it in a long time.
","Space Jam combines animation and live action and tells the story of a basketball player named Micheal Jordan(who plays himself here)who is on the verge of retiring. But when he gets sucked into a golf course while playing golf he ends up in the Looney Tunes world and is accompanied with Bugs Bunny who wants Micheal Jordan to play basketball with him and his other Looney Tune companions as a bunch of aliens(one voiced by Danny De Vito) who stole Micheal Jordan's teammates abilities by using a magical basketball and the aliens become bigger and stronger than the Looney Tunes. So can they win the basketball game and Jordan can go back to the real world again and give back his teammates abilities again?<br/><br/>Overall this movie you can say its sort of a life story of Micheal Jordan's life as a basketball player as you see real life photos of him as a kid and his playing basketball with his father as a kid(played by some young actor) at the beginning of the movie before you hear the Space Jam intro. <br/><br/>Final Verdict I really liked this movie as a kid I never seen it in a very long time so apologies for my review as I just remembered it now and I had to do a review on it. The movie has a great soundtrack from Seal to R Kelly's I believe I can fly. I liked it as a kid and if I ever got the DVD of it I will definitely buy it and watch it again.<br/><br/>Overall im giving it a 7."
"johnnyboyz","6","3","4","4 February 2013"," Falling in the shadow of what preceded it and relying on its heightened USP to drive its shoddy narrative, Space Jam just abouts gets by on novelty and energy.
","It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball.<br/><br/>Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just ""heard of"", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele – in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up.<br/><br/>Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this ""character's"" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business.<br/><br/>So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the ""talents"" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet.<br/><br/>The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only ""winner"" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: ""sports"") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it."
"japamo","8","3","4","17 July 2012"," Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's ""Harlem Globetrotters"" has the right ""Secret Stuff""
","As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's ""Harlem Globetrotters"" would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team.<br/><br/>""Space Jam"" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? <br/><br/>After the critical/popular triumph of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with ""Roger Rabbit"", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray (""I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!"") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars.<br/><br/>SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some ""Jordan's Secret Stuff"", a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the ""Secret Stuff"" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!).<br/><br/>SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time."
"KUAlum26","8","3","4","1 December 2007"," Judge it on its own merit and it's quite good
","Some of the complaints of this film,if I recall correctly,was that it seemed to skimp on the Looney Tunes characters,added characters that weren't of any great likability or memorability and seemed to make Michael Jordan into a sort of caricature/parody of himself. And while I suppose this movie doesn't seem particularly true to either the element of animation or to MJ(though,I'd say,between the two,Jordan comes away as the winner and I'll explain why),this still is a perfectly good piece of entertainment for the whole family.<br/><br/>Aliens come to earth seeming innocuous enough(they measure in inches) but they have a less-than honorable mission:they want to take the Looney Tunes characters back to their planet and make them into something just above slaves for their entertainment. Bugs Buny,infinitely confident,challenges the critters to a game of basketball. They respond by siphoning the talents of five of the top players of the day(PAtrick Ewing,Tyrone ""Mugsy""Bogues,Charles BArkley,Shawn Bradley and Larry Johnson. What?! No Scottie Pippen??). To counterbalance this,Bugs and company turn to his old Nike commercial-making days,and the battle is on.<br/><br/>To me,this movie succeeds on it's own merit,and this could be no better demonstrated than by the co-star himself. Jordan plays nobody but himself,and his un-forced sense reaction to the situations actually works well to balance the zaniness around him. An almost un-credited cameo by Bill Murray just about steals the movie. All the familiar characters from the universe of WArner Toons are along for the ride,plus some new ones(a sexy,girl cager rabbit name Lola,as well as the globby aliens,led by a cigar-chomping boss voiced by Danny DeVito)to lend their various talents(Daffy Duck's neuroses are particularly enjoyable)and while this is hardly the best work of animation here(Mel Blanc's invaluable voice is missed,of course),this still works. THe live-action characters seem to be compromised some--THeresa Randle as Michael's wife and Wayne KNight as his harried manager come to mind--but that seems to be a fairly minor crime for a film that aims to be as big,bold,fanciful and childlike as possible. I don't think you need to be a fan of Looney Tunes or necessarily know that much about pro basketball(in fact,it might help!)to enjoy this film,just an ability to appreciate this rarefied blend of familiar animation with commercial savvy."
"paulowdl","9","3","4","1 September 2005"," Underrated
","After reading reviews of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flint"", I feel compelled to comment on ""Space Jam"". The reason is this - Bob Hoskins received praise for his work in ""Roger Rabbit"" and one of the reasons many reviewers gave was that he had to interact with cartoon characters. On the other hand - Courtney Love was praised for her ability to play a character who, according to some reviews, was similar in her past and personality to Ms. Love herself. How difficult, they said, to basically play yourself.<br/><br/>Here is Michael Jordan, playing opposite cartoons, AND playing himself - not a character similar to himself - but his honest-to-goodness own self. He does so with insight and self-deprecating humor. Witness the scene where he is playing baseball in the minor leagues. Everybody is so anxious to see him succeed that even the opposing catcher is going to let him know what pitch is coming and where it's going to be. Mr. Jordan, the actor, handles this scene beautifully, a look of resignation, disgust, and then determination NOT to be used in this manner. Is that not brilliant acting? To appreciate the comparison to Bob Hoskins, watch the scenes where Jordan is transported into cartoon land and is treated with slapstick hilarity worthy of all the old WB cartoons. In my opinion, this is as good as Hoskins slipping and sliding his way out of a desperate situation in ""Roger Rabbit"".<br/><br/>For students of literature and film I feel the need to point out what I've regarded as a metaphor or analogy (I never did learn the difference). Are the Mon-Stars and their evil leader (Danny DeVito) a metaphor for the influence of gambling in sports? Something to ponder.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall, a very entertaining movie for kids, fans of WB cartoons, and especially for basketball fans and Michael Jordan fans in particular. I highly recommend it and have rated this movie 9 out of 10."

"ElMaruecan82","7","4","6","23 January 2020"," Space Gem...
","To put it simply, ""Space Jam"" is the twice successful revival of Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny's career.<br/><br/>At 33, Jordan was past his prime and his controversial retirement following the death of his father, for a baseball reconversion, prompted Warner Bros studios to find a new vehicle to a necessary come-back. Meanwhile, the Looney Tunes were a milestone of TV and pop culture, but in the 90s, Bart and Homer Simpson had stolen a big chunk of their thunder, they had to deal with 3D competition, not to mention the eternal rivalry with Disney. Warner Bros studios never had their Renaissance and they never really mastered the world of animated feature to begin with.<br/><br/>It's interesting that we're comparing one real character, who was perhaps the greatest and most iconic Michael of the 90s, after Jackson, and animated characters, but who would reduce Bugs Bunny to ink and paint? (And Daffy too) The legendary stinker and wisecracker (who was drawn that way) was the animated embodiment of Groucho Marx with a cooler look, perhaps the animated hero with the most personality before Bart. As a matter of fact, he's so good that if the film had been about Bugs visiting the human world, it would have worked as well. But then we wouldn't have Porky, Daffy, Tweety and all the gang and that would have been a shame because say what you want about Disney, zaniness isn't its strongest suit.<br/><br/>And when you see how animation can ruin even the best animated characters, take the ""Tom and Jerry"" movies for instances, one should applaud the way the film respects the spirit of these old cartoons whose ""Merrie Melodies"" theme have been one of the most instantly identifiable music for all generations, a real hymn to the Golden Age of animation and beyond. Even as a kid who grew up with MGM and Disney, I found an odd little charm in the Looney Tunes and if I preferred Donald over Daffy, between Mickey and Bugs, there was no contest. Remember when the two titan rodents met in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", equal screen time but who got the best line? Bugs!<br/><br/>""Space Jam"" is no ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" however, but not every animation and live action crossover film has this pretension. Directed officially by Joe Pytka (Ivan Reitman is credited as producer), ""Space Jam"" is pretty straightforward in its marketing and since it decided to have a basketball player for the main role, it's obvious it didn't mean to sweep acting awards. But if Jordan is an amateur, his work is far beyond amateurish and the way he plays himself in a role that floats between two universes is remarkable. Working in a green screen and pretending to have interactions with some of the most beloved characters is a feat and his choice to play it straightforward as if he was mildly surprised is the right one, acting surprised might have put him in the way of his ""character"" and be a total distraction.<br/><br/>Once Michael gets in Looney Tunes' land, he faces the deal and learns he must coach the Toons to win a game against the Monstars, previously known as the (far less intimidating) Nerdlocks, small creatures who took their height and talent from other basketball icons: Patrick Ewing, Shawn Bradley, Charles Parker and Muggsy Bogues. So, there's not just Jordan's freedom at stakes but the career of four players and the whole future of the NBA jeopardized by an animated crook named Swackhammer and voiced by Danny De Vito. The plot is spiced up by two other characters who'd have nothing to do: Wayne Knight as an obsessed (almost enamored) publicist and Bill Murray playing himself as a guy who wants to have a shot at the game. That these characters end up serving purpose is a joke, but there's nothing better than a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, it's all a matter of pay-offs.<br/><br/>And that's the spirit of the cartoon. The animation looks like something borrowed from an ad for Sprite of Nike but the film has no pretension either to hide its marketing value, there's even a scene where Daffy reminds that they are property of Warner Bros and a few other comments involving copyrights and ""take that"" nods to Disney. The film makes money through sponsors with the same wit than ""Wayne's World"" product placement but that's because everything is a product placement when you have characters not with names but brand names. But Jordan brings life to what could have been a dull and average performance and instead of showing off as the player with skills, he only becomes the guy who has fun playing with toons, avenges Tweety, act like a coach or a toon. Anyway, he's having fun and so are we.<br/><br/>The film has an enthusiasm that is communicative and catching and reminds of these times when everything was simpler even in its corniness, Jordan may not be the best actor but he's a presence as valuable as the other giant and he doesn't even try to overdo it, and it works, everyone plays his part perfectly and that goes for Bill Murray too. There's no message, no patronizing statement, though the human story carries a few drama elements and one can't ignore how magic and transporting ""I Believe I Can Fly"" works. Another 90s gem at a time where R. Kelly was still popular.<br/><br/>Still, even if the film grossed a quarter billion dollar, it didn't have the same lasting success like a Disney blockbuster or its obvious counterpart ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", maybe that's the limit of the marketed silliness, at the end, it lacks the universal touch, the timeless value, the fairy dust. Even the character of Lola Bunny was an interesting addition but a Jessica Rabbit she wasn't. It's certainly a pure product of the 90s, an era I'll forever cherish, my teen years, but it's a product nonetheless.<br/><br/>That's all, folks!"
"ironhorse_iv","6","4","6","21 May 2017"," Yes, I know this movie has some bugs, but it's still my Jam! It's a guilty pleasure of mine!
","There's been a lot of variations of the classic Looney Tunes characters over the years, but the 1990s reincarnation has caused the most controversy, due to its bloated use of commercialism marketing. There is no bigger example of that, than 1996's 'Space Jam' directed by Joe Pytka; a giant glorified marketing ploy to sell Looney Tunes toys and Air Jordans. It was no surprise that the feature-length movie was like that, seeing how a series of Nike commercials starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny in the early 1990s, was the source that spark the idea for this movie. Despite that, I still kinda like this movie. I didn't mind the commercialism style as much as others, maybe, because this obviously produce placement film did had somewhat of interesting story. Don't get me wrong, on the surface level, Michael Jordan teaming up with the Looney Tunes to face cartoony aliens in a basketball game, in order to save them from slavery in an intergalactic amusement park is indeed ridiculous & somewhat stupid. However, there seem to be, some thought provoking, undercurrents themes, running through this fictional film that could had been great. Let's start with father & son dramatics that the beginning of the film established! It was very heartfelt. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do anything with that, as the relationship with his father is never brought up, again. I think the movie could be better, if the film explore their relationship more, because we know from real life, that Jordan retired from the NBA to pursue the dream of his late father who was murdered in 1993, who had always envisioned his son as a baseball player. Sadly, the film doesn't give that exposition, making the baseball subplot, more out of the blue. Just think if they did, there would be a great conflict for his character, as Jordan tries to honor his late father's wishes, despite, not being any good in the sport, while also trying to fight the urge to play basketball, again, so that he can make a living for his family due to financial problems. I guess, mentioning Jordan father's death was too dark for this 1990s kid movie, but just think, if this film had a little more 'balls'. It would give this film, a little more stakes. Also, I wish, the movie gave a better reason, why Jordan was helping the Tunes, besides the villains bullying the tunes and him. Honestly, the movie could had intermixed, Jordan's children, a lot better with the Looney Tunes basketball plot, by having them, be abducted by the aliens and taken to Moron Mountain after Bugs seek his help. It would add some really needed stakes. Yes, I know, the kidnapped plot would be clichés, but it's better than the pointless scene, that we got of them, helping Bugs Bunny (Voiced by Billy West) & Daffy Duck (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), search for basketball shorts. All of these ideas, would help make Jordan, feel less drywall than he is, in this movie. Without it, Jordan's bad acting is more noticeable, due to his limitedly. I would rather see him, attempt being dramatic, than seeing him, such a square in this film. Despite that, I have to say, the animation department at Warner Bros did a great job, making it seem like Jordan was really interacting with the Looney Tunes. In the field of animation, the film is almost in par, with 1988's 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Still, I wish the humor in this film could be, a little bit better. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some funny moments, but there's some off-color humor, that didn't need to be there. Also, some of the slapstick jokes, during the game were a little too childish for Looney Tunes. In the end, I just wish, the movie could had play more on the satire part of the cartoon series, more. One miss opportunity was making fun of the concept of Moron Mountain. It would had been entertaining to see the Looney Tunes poke fun at the idea of selling their souls out for an amusement park. It could had a Six Flags/Marriot Park vibe to it. Regardless of the lack of satire humor, Looney Tunes characters were amusing. However, I wish the filmmaker gave new character, Lola Bunny (Voiced by Kath Soucie), a little more personality, than being a token objectified hot rabbit. She seem a bit one-dimensional. Anyways, I have to say, the voice acting for the tunes, is pretty damn accurate to the original voice actors. As for the live acting actors; Bill Murray's cameo was indeed a highlight. The deadpan, don't give an f*ck attitude to the animated madness going on around him provide some of the biggest laughs, toward the end. However, surprising, it was the other professional basketball players that takes the cake for best jokes. Seeing the players going through series of embarrassing moments was pretty hilarious. I can't say, the same with Wayne Knight as Stan Podolak, whom comes across, as too annoying for his own good. The numerous close shots with him, made me, want to turn off the movie. As for the number of NBA stock footage, quickly being flash during the credits. I didn't mind it, but I can understand, if somebody get really ill. That sequence was indeed, seizure epilepsy due to how photosensitive, it was. Still, that upbeat rap by Quad City DJ that came with it, was pretty awesome. The other songs in the soundtrack like 'I Believe I can Fly' by R. Kelly & ""Fly like An Eagle' By Seal was equally as extraordinary. I hope the rumor sequel with LeBron James has songs, just as memorable as the original. Overall: Even with its flaws, Space Jam, for better or for worse, is just so outrageous, you can't help, being drawn to it. I just can't help, loving it. It's just one of those movies."

But Jordan sure can play ball.  The basketball moments are what this film's about.

","During the year 1994, Michael Jordan was set to retire from the game of basketball, when he got the idea of going on to play professional baseball.  One year later, he was given the opportunity to act in front of the camera (as himself, of course) and retain his marksmanship of playing the game of B-Ball.  The 1996 animated/live-action release of ""Space Jam"" shows a bit of both.<br/><br/>Who would of thought that his supporting actors would be the most recognizable, brilliant and crazy co-stars Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes themselves?  Ivan Reitman can, since the director of ""Ghost Busters"" produced the family feature at a cost of $100 million dollars plus, almost three times the amount it cost to create the walt Disney masterpiece, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" which ""Space Jam"" tried to compare to, but received lukewarm results.<br/><br/>It's really interesting to see for the first time that the entire Looney Tunes bunch come to the big screen in a while, especially now when the use of digital effects for the film by Kodak's Cinesite Studios (U.S. and U.K.) make it fun to see.  But few of the cartoon gags, jokes and pranks (perfectionized by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson and others during the heyday of Warner Bros. cartoons in the 40's and 50's) are rarely seen in the film.  Plus the weak dialogue the Mon-Stars talk out with (the script penned by Leo Benvenuti, Steve Rudnick, Tim Harris and Herschel Weingrod) can't compare well to thew wit and humor exemplified by Jeffery S. Price and Peter Seaman in ""Roger Rabbit"" in 1988, which makes the outcome seem disappointing. But the addition to the cute, sexy and dazzling Lola Bunny to the Looney Tunes roster, who can now be seen on almost every detail of merchandise you see in stores with Bugs and company, and hopefully in feature cartoons, still makes it all the more fun to look at.<br/><br/>The fact that `Space Jam' was based on the successful 1991 Nike commercial pairing Air Jordan and the wabbit together, somehow make up the reason that the movie only earned $90 million nationwide out of its $100 milion budget, (it did, however, exceed $225 million worldwide altogether, so that helps.)  Nonetheless, Space Jam is worth seeing, if you don't mind that it's an attempt to score the winning basket, be it a winning franchise, that is.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 5<br/><br/>NOTE: The Two-Disc Special Edition DVD of the 1996 release of Warner Bros.

","Way, WAY back in high school, I took an animation class over the summer, and everyone in the class, myself included, were huge fans of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons.  They were, essentially, the very reason we were all into animation in the first place, and we were all a bit upset about the current sneaker commercials that featured the characters playing second-fiddle to athletes.  So, as you might imagine, when one student mentioned that he had heard a rumor that they were going to make a *movie* based on the commercials, we took the news in the same way lots of people reacted to the ""Star Wars Episode II"" rumor that Boba Fett may turn out to be JarJar Binks in disguise.<br/><br/>I could totally rip this movie apart, but I don't happen to have the energy. Just know that, indeed, the classic Bugs Bunny we all know and adore would need *NO* help in defeating the (ergh) ""Mean Team"".  (OH, hahaha!  I get it! Oh, brilliance!  Oh rapturous laughter such a pun hath generated!)  I can also sum up, in two words, the gut-wrenching, toe-curling, fan-pooping-on badness of this *thing*:  Lola Bunny.  Yes, even the once totally anarchic Looney Tunes must bow to (cringes) Political Correctness and have a Strong Female Character retrofitted into their world.

"Spleen","2","13","33","6 February 2000"," So whose stupid idea was this?
","The result of this unholy exhumation of Warner Brothers has-beens is even worse than could have been expected: one of the vilest films ever produced in the United States.  It's unique among bad films in the way it starts at the bottom and digs DOWN.  I mean, it's bad enough that it's a basketball movie - the one thing in the world worse than a baseball movie (although baseball finds its way into the plot as well).  It's bad enough that it's one big Michael Jordan publicity still.  Isn't Jordan just the greatest guy in the world! seems to be the only point behind the opening scenes, especially those honey-covered ones with his family.  (Not his real family.)<br/><br/>But then we meet the cartoon characters ...  Whoever's responsible for the animation has evidently mistaken motion for life, because we have all the frenetic running around, squashing, stretching and camera-swerving of the world's most over-produced computer game - all in vain.  Consider `The Rabbit of Seville', with its staid camera work and underplayed Bugs Bunny. It had less than a third of the motion on display in `Space Jam' - and more than four times as much energy.<br/><br/>But it gets worse.  Oh, believe me, does it get worse!  I don't know why they made Bugs Bunny the star - he is NOT the most successful creation of Warner Brothers, not by a long shot.  Indeed he's scarcely a character at all.  He's whatever a talented director makes of him.  There's the anarchic Bugs of Tex Avery; the innocent, childlike Bugs of Chuck Jones; the (it must be said) dull, vulgar Bugs of Friz Freleng; and the (sorry) just plain dull Bugs of Robert McKimson.  This Bugs is worse than any of them.  All the inconsistenies have been added together, and new ones added.  Remember what a signal failure the modern-day Mickey Mouse of Disney's `Runaway Brain' was?  You ain't seen nothing yet.<br/><br/>I have not yet begun to describe what's wrong with the cartoon bits.  Every second of animation is manic but serves no purpose any of the writers might have had, economic motives aside.  The art direction is just terrible  It's all painfully unfunny.  And remember what happened when the Warner Brothers cartoons began to die in the first place, in the 1960s?  They were no longer fresh, and writers desperately tried to jolly things along by casting more and more characters alongside each other, with predictable results.  Too many zany characters cancel each other out.  Well, `Space Jam' combines EVERY SINGLE Warner Brothers character in the one work, and they all do their zany schtick at once - you can imagine how counter-productive this is. No, on second thoughts, you probably I can't.  It's worse than you can imagine.<br/><br/>And it CONTINUES to get worse.  We're introduced to a new Warner Brothers star (star? hah!) - a `sexy' female rabbit, a feisty basketball player who blows back her ears and says, `Don't call me doll.'  Some rap music worms its way into the soundtrack.  The climactic basketball game is even more ineptly staged than the earlier scenes would have led us to expect. Possibly worst of all, the slender and soulless plot is laden with enough contrived sentiment to make us scream, `Oh, come ON!  No-one in the WORLD is so easily manipulated!'<br/><br/>One final note - something that pleases me.  `Space Jam' received its first outing on Australian television only because a cricket game which the network had expected to take place, didn't.  THAT puts the movie in its place.  Basketball, too."
"Maziun","3","6","13","2 October 2013"," I loved it as a kid ...
","Michael Jordan . Bugs Bunny . Together in one movie . Which kid could resist that ? I still remember how I laughed as a kid , when I was watching this movie for the first time. I did watch it at least a couple of times and I still have good memories regarding it . So , I was surprised not in a positive way when I saw the not too good rating (5.9) of ""Space jam"" here on IMDb. Also while surfing the web I often found not too many pleasant comments from other people about this movie . It gave me motivation to find some free time to watch ""SJ"" and confront my childhood's memories with reality. After all many things that we've liked as kids aren't that good when we look at them from the point of view of adult.<br/><br/>So , I've seen the movie for the first time since childhood . And you know what ? The film itself lacks either the energy or the visual invention that the Chuck Jones originals had. For visual humour, it tends to substitute one-liners and lame pop culture in-jokes.<br/><br/>""Space jam"" not only has Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny in it , but also Wayne Knight (""Jurassic park"") , Bill Murray (""Ghostbusters"") , famous basketball players ( Larry Johnson , Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing ) and all the Looney tunes characters . <br/><br/>""Space jam"" also introduces original characters to the audience – the aliens ( Moonstars) and Lola . I must say that I love Lola . She's a great original Looney Tunes character . She's a wonderful partner for Bugs , yet she has her own personality. I wish that Warner Bros would use her in the future , especially if the will make new Looney Tunes cartoons. The aliens are also nice . Moonstars look funny as the caricatures of famous basketball players . The certainly are memorable villains , just like their boss.<br/><br/>The animation looks alright to me . Only the CGI alien amusement park has dated badly . Joe Pytka directs the movie like a normal movie with some cartoon elements in it instead of choosing Joe Dante way in ""Looney tunes back in action"" and making it a live action cartoon. <br/><br/>In terms of acting Bugs and team are the best . Murray and Knight give a fun performance . Jordan and others are OK since they basically playing themselves.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is good with great songs like : R. Kelly "" I believe I can fly "" , Seal ""Fly like eagle "" , Coolio , LL Cool J and Method Man ""Beat them up"".<br/><br/>""Space Jam"" is a feature-length expansion of a Pepsi commercial that paired Bugs Bunny and NBA star Michael Jordan. It'sa disappointment. I give it 3/10."

","Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: Bugs Bunny would not need ANYONE's help in defeating a bunch of goofy basketball playing aliens.  Bugs Bunny could take on the entire universe with one hand behind his back and win...without Michael Jordan's help.<br/><br/>God, how I hate this movie.  How I loathe and despise it.  It somehow manages to get the spirit of the classic WB characters totally wrong with animation that lacks any of the charm and style the the classics had.  It manages to spend 90 minutes making Bugs, Daffy and the rest lest interesting and less compelling than they were in a 6-minute short 50 years ago.<br/><br/>Michael Jordan, at the very least, is an entertaining, engaging screen presence.  I can't exactly call him an ""actor,"" as he doesn't really play a role...but he is entertaining.  It's just too bad that he's surrounded by such aimless, annoying dreck."

","This movie was really bad.  The only saving graces are Bill Murray and Larry Bird's all to brief appearances.  We have definitely found something Jordan can't do and that is act.  That is kind of bad considering he is playing himself in this one.  Though most of his costars weren't there, so it might have been difficult.  At least he stopped after this one unlike Shaq who made four or five pictures...Thank God Phil Jackson came along and refocused him.  As for the plot being like a Muppets movie it is.  A few appearances here and there from a surprise celebrity, the whole working with live actors.  It just did not seem to be a Looney tunes movie.  Though they stopped being Looney a long time ago.  I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now.  It just doesn't feel right.  All the Looney Tunes on one team, some being life long enemies...and what is the point of introducing the bad guy voiced by I think Danny DeVito. The Martian has always been trying to take over the world, why not just let it be him.  Also, what is up with the girl bunny?  Why introduce a new character?  I guess we just had to be politically correct.  Well this one may be good for the kiddies, but most of us are going to recognize it for what it is...one long commercial.  I saw a clip from the next Looney Tunes movie and it is even more Muppet looking than this one"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","3","12","32","29 May 2004"," Big Macs for life
","How any critic can call Looney Tunes: Back in Action an exercise in franchise promotion but not puke at the 80-minute commercial that is Space Jam is beyond me.<br/><br/>Our plot has Danny Devito play the voice of an evil, monster type businessman who's theme park is failing. In desperation he sends 5 little creatures to capture the Looney Tunes and bring them back as the new attraction.<br/><br/>So...where is Looney Tune land? Apparently it's underground. And digging up any golf ball hole will eventually lead to it. When the Looney Tunes challenge the would-be kidnappers to a basketball game they kidnap Michael Jordan to be on their team.<br/><br/>The quality of the film nosedives from here on. Jordan's acting is so wooden it's mahogany. He expresses no confusion, joy or surprise at being yanked into Looney Tune land and confronted by all the toons. 'Bugs Bunny you're a cartoon you're not real', he says in the most flat, boring and dullest way (missing commas intended as he doesn't use them).<br/><br/>And then the big game follows. Once it's over, and there's no reason left to continue watching, the film goes on for another 10 minutes (to beef the running time up 'feature length') with the basketball/Jordan story. It's rubbish.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that the film is directed by Joe Pytka (he's NOT Joe Dante that's for sure), a man who has never done any other features but over a 1000 TV ads, or something. Space Jam is nowt but 100% proof Warner whored out their most famous creation to make a few quick, and cheap, bucks. It's heartbreaking, heinous stuff.<br/><br/>Casting Michael Jordan alongside the Looney Tunes is not inspired and imaginative. It's crass and desperate. Now they can attract sports fans AND kiddies. And Michael Jordan of all people! He's not a good actor and his fame outside of the U.S. is minimal to say the least. Moreso today.<br/><br/>The only part of the film that comes (very, very remotely) close to the true spirit of the Looney Tunes is the score. James Newton Howard (a truly bizarre choice, how about Jerry Goldsmith, Bruce Broughton or even Danny Elfman) recognizes the classic Looney Tunes themes and uses them appropriately in certain moments but the rest of the score is generic and uninspired.<br/><br/>Back in Action was intelligent, witty and satirical. Space Jam is corny, cheap and classless. It's an absolute travesty. How can we honestly take seriously a movie that has every cast member awe at Michael Jordan, has not too subtle product placement for McDonalds and has the Looney Tunes (one of the most ingenious creations in history) exploited in the most shameless and guilt free manner. With Space Jam, Warner showed that they'd cash in the Looney Tunes at a pawn shop for $5 if they could. A total lack of respect for Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson.<br/><br/>And they don't even act Looney. The only laughs come from Bugs and Daffy. And it's sporadic and inconsistent. Producer Ivan Reitman (who has no experience and no business with this franchise) managed to convince Bill Murray to appear in this drek (for about 10 minutes) so the trailer could boast an ACTUAL star other than Jordan. Murray's performance is the bare minimum and has a let's-get-this-over-with feel (though Murray working below-par is still miles ahead of many other actors at the top of their game). His appearance in the film is massively oversold.<br/><br/>It's just not fair that THIS is a big hit while Back In Action flopped horribly. I consider it the biggest miscarriage in justice ever. I still blame the marketing for Back in Action. It was bad, REAL bad. But still has some sort of quiet dignity about it when compared to the McDonalds promoted, in your face junk that was Space Jam's marketing. Is it any wonder Joe Dante had Back In Action nicknamed 'The Anti-Space Jam movie'?<br/><br/>And just what the hell is a Space Jam anyway? It's not even set in Space!!!<br/><br/>It took Warner 3 tries but the finally released the movie in its original aspect ratio. The DVD presents the film is 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with pretty active Dolby 5.1 sound. There are loads of features but they are all fluff. Some 80's Looney Tunes shorts are included too."

","Space Jam has become sort of a cult film for kids now and many of them probably only know Michael Jordan from this film and not for all his real life achievements as a sports star.<br/><br/>No this film is not a classic in the same way that Groundhog Day is and will never be sent to the Smithsonian for prosperity but it is a mildly amusing film that is bright and colourful for kids. For adults there are some nice jokes that will go over the kids heads and i'm sure many a person will have a laugh at the level of Jordan's acting.<br/><br/>It's Looney Tunes on the big screen and that's not such a bad thing. Go and check out this film if you have a chance. You'll find yourself singing ""I believe i can fly"" in no time."
"MovieAddict2016","Null","2","3","26 October 2003"," It's a Jam. (What does that mean, anyway?)
","There's a great scene far into ""Space Jam,"" when comedian Bill Murray makes an unbilled appearence at a basketball game with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes. An alien creature (voiced by Danny DeVito) says, ""Hey! I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture!"" Bill Murray helps out the Looney Tunes team and then leaves the scene. But he comes back later again at the end when Larry Byrd takes a seat next to Bill, who, watching Michael Jordan dribbling the ball on court, says, ""That coulda been me.""<br/><br/>Humor like that comes in abundance during ""Space Jam,"" a fun family film that has been ridiculed by critics and audiences alike for, as far as I can see it, no purpose whatsoever. Roger Ebert saw the side of the movie that I saw in ""Space Jam,"" and that is an energetic motion picture that is fun for both the adults and kids in the audience.<br/><br/>I saw ""Space Jam"" in the theater when it was released. I think it was a good choice. There was a lot of laughter and a lot of joy in the cinema--kids were laughing at certain physical gags and adults were laughing at in-jokes referencing such subjects as Michael Jordan's sports career to political humor to Bill Murray humor like mentioned above.<br/><br/>Daffy Duck has always been my favorite Looney Tune, and he's given the usual treatment here. Take the scene when his team is introduced. Claps echo from the stadium until he walks out into the court. You can hear a pin drop it's so silent. People accuse this of being a cheap film made to boost Michael Jordan's career (which would end and then spark again in the years to come).<br/><br/>""Space Jam"" opens with Michael Jordan as a young boy shooting hoops outside his home in North Carolina. We skip forward years later and, during the opening credits, see flashes of him soaring through the air in pairs of Air Jordans. Then the movie really starts: Michael has retired from basketball, taking up a career in baseball. Needless to say, he's not too great at baseball--and we're given good proof of that.<br/><br/>Then Bugs Bunny drops in for a visit from the cartoon world. A pack of aliens has challenged the Tunes to a basketball game, and if they lose, something catastrophic happens (don't blame me for not remembering, folks). Little did the Tunes know when they agreed to the bet that the space creatures would steal the talent from NBA players and morph into huge, skilled b-ball players.<br/><br/>So Michael Jordan strikes a bet with the aliens in Tune World. If they lose, they have to give their powers back to his NBA friends. If he loses, he is their slave for eternity. (Or until he dies in the next forty years.)<br/><br/>Fun comes in big doses for this film. I understand how some people could be turned off by the way Michael Jordan is treated as a god and becomes the highlight of the entire motion picture, as if he is the primary star and the Tunes are just there for comedy relief. But, folks, that really is the point of this movie. The Looney Tunes are getting their own movie soon with Brendan Fraser. But in ""Space Jam,"" they are merely sidekicks to Michael Jordan--co-stars, if you wish to say. But they do provide some great comic relief, as does Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. And Michael Jordan playing basketball in a cartoon world with no limits? No way!<br/><br/>The Tunes' world is brought to life through great animation, and as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" contributed to the animation genre, ""Space Jam"" adds its own touch, too. I liked this flick. Michael Jordan is in it a bit too much--who cares? After all, there's a reason he's on all the posters.<br/><br/>And Daffy Duck is still better than Bugs Bunny. <br/><br/>4/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

Beside probably every Warner animated character and Michael Jordan, there are few more NBA players and genius comedians Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. From today's perspective, the film is technically rather outdated, but even if you are not able to look at it from the perspective of the time in which it originated, its speed, humor and a lot of interesting details and references (which you have no chance to catch all during a single viewing) leave you no time to bother with technical shortcomings. I also particularly liked the music (Seal, R. Kelly, Salt-N-Pepa, Technotronic, 2 Unlimited), which objectively might not be that great, but in me, who grew up in nineties, it woke up some nostalgia and its specific atmosphere put me in the right mood to enjoy this wacky film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"CalvinValjean","7","1","1","24 August 2017"," A Looney Corporate Product
","My review of SPACE JAM has always been the same: if you go into this expecting the definitive cinematic adaptation of the classic LOONEY TUNES shorts and everything that made them great, especially the work of the great Chuck Jones, you will be disappointed. But if you go into this accepting it for what it is, a family-themed sports-fantasy movie that just happens to feature the LOONEY TUNES characters in it, then you'll be adequately satisfied. This isn't a great movie, but it does give you exactly what you pay for.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Joe Pytka, who'd mostly directed music videos and commercials, including several Super Bowl TV spots (which, pre-YouTube, was considered the golden timeslot for the highest quality commercials you'd see all year). And that's exactly what this movie really is: one feature-length commercial. A commercial for LOONEY TUNES, the NBA, and hip hop music, all rolled up into one movie filled with corporate logos.<br/><br/>The plot: aliens invade and threaten to enslave the LOONEY TUNES characters and make them attractions on their planet's theme park. So Bugs, Daffy, Porky, and the gang must come up with a plan and eventually decide to...challenge the aliens to a basketball game? Really? As pretty much every critic pointed out, these are characters known for such zany hijinks and slapstick-filled adventures that break the laws of physics. That they would pick something as mundane as a basketball game feels out of character. Chuck Jones disliked the movie and said his version of Bugs Bunny would have outsmarted the aliens in about seven minutes and not needed anyone's help to do so.<br/><br/>The movie is aware that it has a flimsy premise, but it needs it in order for the gimmick to happen: Bugs has to recruit Michael Jordan from our world to help the gang. Jordan coaches our heroes and they play in the big game, filled with CGI and-then groundbreaking FX. He has a dorky sidekick Stan (Wayne Knight) and a surprise ally in Bill Murray. Murray is actually the best thing in the movie, as his trademark ad-libbed, wink at the audience, ""What the hell am I doing in this movie?"" schtick plays well in a movie this self-aware.<br/><br/>The live-action portions of the movie are its weakest element. Which is a shame as there's some good acting by Jordan, Knight, Murray, and cameos by other NBA players (Charles Barkley and Larry Bird), as well as Patricia Heaton and Dan Castellaneta. But they are blandly- directed and feel like a collection of sketches with lame jokes, basically what you would expect from a director of commercials working with a cast of mostly athletes with little acting experience. And get ready to see tons of basketball-playing footage and shot-after- fetishistic-shot of baskets being dunked and Jordan making every jumpshot in slow-motion with graceful precision; in other words, what you've seen in countless athletic commercials before.<br/><br/>The animated portions of the movie are much stronger, featuring more colorful visuals, fun cutaway gags, and the usual mayhem and slapstick we've come to expect from these characters. Bugs Bunny is voiced by Billy West, and while he can never measure up to the legendary Mel Blanc, he does a great job giving us more or less what we expect this iconic prankster to be. Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester, Taz and Elmer are all there as well and each one manages to get in a few of their classic quips and gags. None of it ever lives up to the humor of the classic shorts of Chuck Jones and his contemporaries, but it generally works.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain what a sensation this movie was at the time. To any kid growing up in the early '90's, Michael Jordan was a God. He was the biggest athlete in the world who appeared in countless commercials and, while maybe not a professional actor, definitely had charisma and screen presence that matched his family-friendly persona. Even if you were a kid who didn't follow sports (like me), you heard about Michael Jordan on a daily basis: I still remember the entire school talking when this mythic figure announced he was leaving basketball to attempt a career in baseball, and his eventual return to basketball. I would argue there hasn't been a professional athlete since who has had the global popularity Jordan had in his prime. If you were a studio exec in 1996 and had to greenlight a film to serve as a starring vehicle for Jordan, having him act opposite a bunch of cartoon characters was probably the best option.<br/><br/>And on that note, everything about SPACE JAM is very mid-'90's: the hip hop soundtrack, the aggressive sense of humor, the attempts to give the cartoon characters edgy dialog and a ""hip"" attitude, the emphasis on athleticism and cast consisting mostly of NBA all-stars, and the pop culture references, right down to PULP FICTION.<br/><br/>SPACE JAM is junk food, filled with corporate logos, created for the sake of making money. But as a piece of nostalgia intended for kids, it's harmless fun. What else can I say but: that's all, folks!"

","After years of growing up, I saw this in theaters for an anniversary screening, and not only do I think it's good, I think it's great. It's an under-appreciated Warner Bros. Animated Movie. It's funny, intense, and catchy. All in all, it's entertaining. My only nitpick is the Animaniacs Characters aren't in there, and that could've made the movie a lot funnier, but then again, this is really nit picky, it's a great movie for 90's kids, and it's a good movie for all sports fans all around the world. The animation has definitely aged well, it's well detailed, and while it may not be as good as that iconic image of Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody flying in the sky, Space Jam is still a classic."

","The film's twenty years old already, man, how time does fly by. I grew up watching the Looney Tunes characters back in the Fifties, so for me, that's what kids cartoons are all about. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck were my favorites, and they have prominent roles here, so that was cool. Having been away so long from the shows I watched as a kid, the presence of Lola Bunny was a bit of a surprise, I had never seen her before, or at least the iteration of her here wasn't familiar to me. Because all of the original voice artists are gone, folks like Mel Blanc and Chuck Jones, the Warner Brothers characters sounded just the slightest bit off to me, but that's a minor nuisance. Teaming up the cartoon characters with professional basketball players was a uniquely creative concept, though I would have liked to see some of the other players like Barkley and Ewing in the Monstar game themselves. But no matter, this is a colorful flick with decent animation and humor, with cool appearances by Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. Murray was effective doing his type of character from ""Groundhog Day"", a slovenly but decent guy who can make you laugh just by looking at him."

The Movie stars Michael Jordan as Himself, Wayne Knight as Stan Podolak, Bill West as Bugs Bunny, Dee Bradley Baker as Daffy Duck, Danny Devito Mr Swackhammer, and Bill Murray as Himself. This Movie came out the year 1996 which was the year I was Born. Anyway this also the first of Lola Bunny in the Looney Tunes Franchise. The Movie has a cameo from Bill Murray. Anyway I do like Space Jam. Anyway I give Space Jam a 10/10 stars. Anyway See Guys Later"

","This is a great film aimed at children, but adults will love it too, especially if you like Loony Tunes and basketball. It combines action and cartoons, like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and both films are equally good. Aliens arrive on Earth, zap the talents of real-life basketball stars like Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing so they can beat Bugs Buuny and the Loony Tunes gang at SOMETHING, and Bugs and the gang recruit Michael Jordan so they can have a fighting chance.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are the basketball game showdown (that's hilarious! watch for the ""men in black"" reference), the golf scene where they ""recruit"" MJ, and Jordan's baseball scene. Everything about this movie is thoroughly enjoyable, and everyone will love it. Guaranteed. i loved Bill Murray, Wayne Knight, and Larry Bird in it! *** 1/2 out of ****"

","This film is one I truly enjoy watching over and over again, that is something I rarely say about a film.<br/><br/>I first watched this film when I was 6 after realising that the sequel was in fact a sequel, I enjoyed the acting of Basketball players, usually when someone plays themselves in a movie, in a main role, they do a poor job, but the acting in this film felt genuine.<br/><br/>This film despite being a comedy still has an inspirational feel, this is most evident when Michael Jordan is training in one of the most serious moments in Looney toon's history.<br/><br/>This film is one of the greatest I've ever seen, and deserves more reconnection for the many aspects and it's great blend of comedy and drama."

","Space Jam is a very good movie for children who love sports. This movie stars Michael Jordan who is an NBA star at the beginning and then converts into a Major League Baseball player in the Chicago White Sox farm system. But soon after becoming a baseball player like his dad, many of the NBA's greatest get their talents stolen by aliens from another planet. When Michael finds out he soon is alerted and goes after these aliens to get the stars their talents back. While he's golfing in an instant he finds himself slipping through a small golf hole. When he comes out the other end of the hole he finds himself in looney toon land. He sees Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny and all the looney toon characters you can think of. This movie teaches kids to keep thriving for what they want and never give up. It's telling them no matter how tall people are, how tough people are, never give up because of some disadvantages. When Michael is challenged by the aliens who stole the stars talents Michael takes the challenge to face them. But they made a deal. If Michael won the stars would get their talents back, and if the aliens won Michael had to stay in looney toon land forever. The aliens had accepted the challenge. Halfway through the game Bill Murray shows up and helps Michael. When Michael gets the help from Bill, they come from behind and win. The stars get their talents back and Michael gets to go home. The moral of this story is to always keep thriving and never give up."
"forrest9996","Null","1","1","24 February 2014"," Space Jam
","What can be said about the one and only, Space Jam? Directed by Joe Pytka, it was released on November 15, 1996 in theatres worldwide. This mix of an animated and non-animated movie was a huge success, which can be proved by its box office success, grossing a total of $90,443,603 (""Space Jam""). But, what makes this movie so great? What makes this movie different from all the other movies out there? The creators of Space Jam craftily combined actors, different audience appeals, and parallelism with reality into a movie adored by critics and the public alike. The actor choice in Space Jam is not something to overlook. Everyone knows and loves Michael Jordan, who played for the University of North Carolina in college and the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards in the NBA (""Michael Jordan Bio.""). Besides the great ""Air Jordan,"" there are other famous basketball players in the movie, including Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Shawn Bradley, and the great Larry Bird. Moving away from basketball stars, this film also features Wayne Knight, who played Newman on Seinfeld, and Theresa Randle, who also starred in films Bad Boys and Beverly Hills Cop II. And of course, who can forget the Looney Tunes. Every character from the show appears in this movie, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, the Tasmanian Devil, and introducing Lola Bunny, Bugs' sweetheart (""Space Jam."" IMDb). All of these characters are vital in feeding audience's attraction to this movie. The child appeal for this movie is pretty obvious. First off, most kids are going to want to prefer animation in a film than no animation at all. And of course, you have the Looney Tunes. Although they were around more prevalently from 1970s through the 1990s than now, all the kids during 1996 knew who they were because of The Looney Tunes Show. The antics they pull in this movie are hilarious, anywhere from the cleaning the gym with spit to Daffy showing off his curves in a mini fashion show. Although a lot of Space Jam's content is geared toward the young, adults definitely do not have a hard time sitting down with their kids to watch it. Although it is cartoon, adults truly do appreciate Space Jam. The actors, especially the NBA players, are very familiar to the adult audience of the time. Plus, there is a sense of happiness watching MJ, whether he is acting or playing basketball in a cartoon gym. Some adult humor is also present in the movie, like the reference to Ghostbusters, Charles Barkley's relations with Madonna, and a therapist asking Patrick Ewing about being unable to perform in other areas in his life. These small things go unnoticed by kids, but the movie's funny comments and the true parts of MJ's life keep the adults entertained. Like in the classic movie Forrest Gump, Space Jam has real history events embedded in its plot. In the opening credits, highlights of Jordan's years playing for UNC and the Bulls are shown. Then, during the movie, he retired from the NBA and went on to play baseball. This all took place, playing for the Tar Heels from 1981 to 1984, the Bulls from '84-'94, and baseball during the '94-'95 season (""Michael Jordan Bio.""). During the entire movie, he plays baseball, which he is terrible at, just like in real life. At the end of the movie, MJ decides to come back to basketball with the Bulls once again. Because of the parallelism with reality, I think that one of goals of Space Jam was to make a story about how playing for the Tune Squad motivated Jordan to quit baseball and play basketball once again. Critically speaking, Space Jam got positive reviews by credible movie reviewers. Peper Stack, a Chronicle Staff Critic, said that ""Space Jam"" is littered with laughs, partly owing to the interplay among Murray, Bird (Larry, not Tweety) and Jordan, and a giddy on-court pacing that brings brain function to a halt. Bugs has some great lines; inspired jokes take swipes at Warner Bros. rival Disney as well as humans who don't really have a clue about toon life"" (""Shooting Hoops""). Even the famous Roger Ebert called it ""delightful."" He said he thought the movie was funny, especially how it takes a jab at Disney (""Space Jam""). Even though the movie can be cheesy sometimes, the critics seemed to have really enjoyed it. The creators of Space Jam were geniuses. They took famous basketball players and the classic Looney Tunes characters and put them into an 88-minute film with a great American sport (""Space Jam""). Honestly, if you have never seen this movie, you are really missing out. The actors, audience appeal, and parallelism with reality intricately combine into the classic movie Space Jam, a timeless classic that you and the critics will want to watch over and over.<br/><br/>Works Cited Ebert, Roger.

"D_Burke","9","1","1","25 August 2010"," An Energetic, Enjoyable, Altogether Fun Movie With Great Animation
","This may sound pathetic, but of all the films I have seen (and I have seen many), ""Space Jam"" holds a special place in my heart. It's actually the first film I saw by myself at the movie theaters. I liked it when I was 14, but I always make sure when I write a review that I see a movie more recently. Movies as I remember them are not always what they are.<br/><br/>Fourteen years later, even though Michael Jordan has retired and CGI animation reigns supreme, ""Space Jam"" still stands up. Critics may label it a kid's movie, but its dialogue is funny and far from intelligence insulting. Plus, I thought the overall story was creative and inventive, although a little weird and out there sometimes. But hey, aren't all Looney Tunes a little weird and out there? Aren't those characteristics what has made them relevant throughout many generations?<br/><br/>I loved the fact that this movie could have been a vanity piece for Michael Jordan, but it wasn't. The temptation must have been there to make a movie similar to Muhammad Ali's mediocre ""The Greatest"" (1977). After all, Jordan was at the height of his popularity at the time this movie was released, and the Chicago Bulls had just won the NBA Finals that year (with two more championship wins to come).<br/><br/>With the Looney Tunes added into the mix, you get a far more creative premise. I really liked how the movie took place circa 1993-1995, from when Jordan retired from the NBA to his notorious stint playing minor league baseball for the Birmingham Barons (a farm team for the Chicago White Sox) to his triumphant return to the Bulls. I would really like to know how the premise came about to have the Looney Tunes characters persuade Jordan to take up basketball again. It doesn't matter who came up with it or how. It was just weaved into the real life story very creatively.<br/><br/>As random a plot as it is, the Looney Tunes live in a cartoon community underneath the Earth, and puny aliens from a failing intergalactic amusement park called Moron Mountain come to abduct the cartoon characters for their next attraction. These aliens are not very smart, prompting the clever Bugs Bunny to convince them to challenge the Looney Tunes to a basketball game instead of immediately kidnapping them. The aliens agree, except they also apparently have the ability to steal basketball playing ability (or talent) from real NBA players. Each of the five aliens gets into the brains of Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, and steal their talent. Apparently, this also gives the aliens the ability to shape shift and become large monsters, or ""MonSTARS"", as they are known here.<br/><br/>If you really try to insert logic into this plot, you're going to hate this movie. Looney Tunes cartoons were never logical, so why should this plot be? They were always funny and entertaining, and so is this movie.<br/><br/>Once Michael Jordan enters their cartoon world, it's amazing how well he interacts with the characters. Perhaps the best scene is when Bugs Bunny kisses Jordan, and the reaction from him that follows. Jordan's not a great actor, obviously, but you really forget while you're watching this movie that he is actually in front of a green screen not talking to anyone. This is by far the best live action and animation combination since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988).<br/><br/>There's really little to fault this movie on. It's funny both in animation and real life. Wayne Knight as pushy publicist Stan Podolak was very funny, and Bill Murray (as himself) was especially hilarious, particularly when he joins the Tune Squad. I still love how Daffy Duck asked him how he got to the cartoon world, and he says (in typical Bill Murray style), ""Oh, the producer's a friend of mine. I had one of the teamster's drop me off."" It gets me every time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Space Jam"". It is one of the best kids movies ever made, its story is random, but solid, and its a highly enjoyable film, not to mention a fitting tribute to the Looney Tunes and the NBA glory days of the 1990's. And this movie managed to pull this off without letting product placement or short term endorsements get in the way. That feat is still incredible."

","Honestly, I just think many people who hate this movie take their favorite cartoon characters a bit too seriously and need to chill. This has been favorite of mine since I first saw it at age 9. It was just a fun movie to lose yourself in. Just take it for what it is; don't whine about how Michael Jordan can't act (yeah, and Marlon Brando probably couldn't dunk; what's your point?), how it ruins the Tunes' personalities (they're freaking ink and paint; get over it), the ""PC-ness"" of Lola Bunny (yeah, because God forbid they try to add a female touch to the all-male Looney Tunes crowd), and all of the other related complaints. Just take Space Jam for what it is: a fun escape."

","Looney Tunes battling the forces of Monstars enlist the help of Michael Jordan just to beat them in a basketball match.  So what's the deal?  I don't get this movie, it's just to peck some fun with dumb Looney Tunes playing basketball.  How about we challenge you to a game of NFL Blitz, you win we go, we win we stay?  If I had a penny for every movie I've seen, it'd be more better to see ""Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might"" or some other techno, violent, neo-quasi-futuristic anime movie like that only different. It just make me wonder what people you use to write the script.  But it's average."

They also had to cater to kids short attention spans by devising a simple plot.

","Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from ""Space Jam.""<br/><br/>Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and ""kidnap"" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the ""Monstars."" Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group.<br/><br/>The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with."

","You probably remember the very clever mix of live action and cartoon animation in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, this is another quite good example of that. Basically basketball player Michael Jordan has retired from basketball and starts baseball. Meanwhile, far away in another part of the galaxy Mr. Swackhammer (Danny DeVito) plans to kidnap the Looney Tunes to be an attraction at his hardly popular theme park. When the five little aliens get there, the Looney Tunes lead by Bugs Bunny (Billy West) think its fair that they get a chance to defend themselves in a game of basketball. Soon enough however these little aliens turn into the giant Monstars. So the Looney Tunes get Michael Jordan to help them. Also starring Wayne Knight as Stan Podolak, Bill Murray, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig, Tazmanian Devil, Sylvester and Tweety, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe Le Pew and Lola Bunny. Featuring fantastic songs, including Seal's ""Fly Like An Eagle"", Monica's ""For You I Will"", and of course, R. Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly"". Pepe Le Pew was number 73, Foghorn Leghorn number 61, Daffy Duck number 30, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies number 20 and Bugs Bunny number 10 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Good!"

Nothing they say or do in this film gives me reason to believe that the writers have ever watched a cartoon featuring any of them. These _are_ characters with histories, not just walking corporate properties.  Have some respect for your source material, people."
"catradhtem","4","4","10","9 July 2001"," Sheer ugliness
","This is a terrible movie, and the fact that Leonard Maltin likes it makes me wonder what happened to his brain cells since he introduced the Golden Jubilee series of Looney Tunes videos in 1985.  If you want a good Looney Tunes film, check out any of the compilation flicks like ""The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie.""<br/><br/>To start the movie off, we're treated to a supposed-to-be-heartwarming scene in which a young Michael (you know, that classic Looney Tunes character Michael Jordan) is playing basketball outside and tells his dad about all the things he wants to do when he grows up.  Yeah, like we need to know why a tall, bald, black guy is playing basketball thirty years later.  It's definitely not the nine zillion he makes annually, but because it's his boyhood dream.  Besides, one line of adult Michael's slushy-voiced dialogue reveals that he's probably not qualified for too many other professions.<br/><br/>After the obligatory scene in which the bad guys plot their evil scheme (and oh boy, someone got Danny DeVito to do the voice of the leader Swackhammer...I guess Tim Curry was unavailable), we're finally introduced to the Looney Tunes characters.  Bugs Bunny acts like the annoying kid in the classroom with ADD and sounds like Stimpy (great, Billy West does some of the voices, like I needed another reason to hate this movie!) and is for some reason intimidated by these little alien creatures that Tweety would have no trouble kicking the behinds of.  Anyway, Bugs & Co. challenge the aliens to a game of basketball, drag Michael to (shudder) ""Looney Tunes Land"" (shudder), and they win.  Yay-freakin'-ay.<br/><br/>First, the special effects of combining Bugs and Michael are just passable but not great.  There is no sense of wonder or real interaction like in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""  Perhaps the writers weren't very imaginative on how the characters could be more physical with each other, but Bugs looked more alive next to human co-stars in the 1948 movie ""My Dream is Yours.""<br/><br/>The Looney Tunes characters are pale imitations of their actual selves.  A new unnecessary female rabbit named Lola is introduced (I guess the writers forgot about Honey Bunny, whom I would have loved to see turned into a main character for this flick).  She is nothing more than a placeholder for the ""token female"" spot.  And I'm sure Ivan Reitman thought the ""Don't ever call me 'doll'"" line was going to be springing from the lips of every young girl out there who didn't leave the theater in disgust at this point.  Instead, it's just a stupid built-in merchandise slogan.  Give me ""Beep Beep"" any day over that.<br/><br/>Daffy's in it, Porky's in it, Foghorn's in it, Sylvester's in it, and Elmer's in it (really, practically no other characters were given dialogue). They look ugly, they sound ugly, and their personalities have all been reduced to expansions on their vocal traits.  Are we positive Disney wasn't secretly involved in hopes to ruin these great characters?<br/><br/>Then there is a very disturbing long sequence in which several Looney Tunes get hurt during the basketball game, followed by a long shot of some minor characters in various states of dying.  Did someone actually think this is FUNNY??  I've never considered any cartoon violence as ""gratuitous,"" but this is most certainly an ugly, witless scene of just pain.  And this movie comes from the same man who did the fun, harmless ""Ghostbusters??""<br/><br/>This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  It's a ninety-minute Nike commercial.  There's even a line of dialogue in which the sometimes-funny Wayne Knight tells Michael to support all of his endorsements (""Put on your Hanes(TM), we'll grab a Big Mac(TM)...,"" etc.).  It's supposed to be disguised as self-parody, but comes off as pompousness.  I guess promoting ninety different companies was also part of young Michael's boyhood dream. I would seriously doubt being in a second-rate Looney Tunes movie was, too."

","Making a movie that mixes characters cartoons with actors in the flesh is a good idea so long as the plot must be interesting enough to sustain the interest. For ""Space jam"", we're far from the result. With the exception of quite successful special effects and a plain performance of Michael Jordan, the movie is absolutely devoid of interest. It consists on a flat and trite story, a convenient and predictable screenplay. Moreover, Bugs Bunny and his friends are the kings of third-rate acting and make hardly the spectator laugh.

As a kid who was obsessed with the NBA and was a WB toons fan this had to be a treat. <br/><br/>When I first watched it, I couldn't really pinpoint what really bothered me. I didn't sit right with me and I remember regretting forcing my parents to buy the VHS. I know I was disappointed with the way basketball was depicted... it had absolutely no foul or any sort of rules for that matter. Naturally, no one should expect realistic basketball from this movie, but I still had hoped they would've managed to keep some rules in some way, while still delivering the looney exaggerations.<br/><br/>But as an adult I have to say that this is the least of the movies problems. At the time as a kid, I didn't notice that I didn't laugh... or better yet, I've noticed it - I just didn't want to admit it to myself. This is really weak humor, especially compared to the old, classic WB cartoons. It's uninspired, toned-down to the bare minimum and in some instances really annoyed me, because it tried to be ""cool"" at the same time. And that is the main problem I'm having with this one - it's not funny to me, at all, both as a kid and adult. <br/><br/>The acting is bad, but that's rather forgiving considering that NBA players aren't professional actors to begin with. The animation and artwork is good, great actually, but by far not enough to save it. It's just a heartless commercial for all the merchandise.

There were attempts at making the characters look more 3D using an airbrushing effect that had the effect of making them look like they had the bevel effect applied in Photoshop. Despite coming out a whole eight years after Who Framed Roger Rabbit it somehow were much worse at integrating live actors with the animation. Heck, I think Mary Poppins probably did a better job in the sixties.<br/><br/>The Mel Blanc impressions were incredibly jarring, with dialogue that made Chuck Jones cringe. Not Billy West's proudest moment I must say. The movie takes itself way too seriously, and the product placement is so clumsy one scene is literally just a character reading out sponsors. There's no punchline, no self-referential wink and it doesn't even go on for long enough to make it a joke.<br/><br/>At least these days, the 90s hip hop and R&B soundtrack has a certain charm where at the time it was meant to capitalise on what the cool kids were listening to at the time.<br/><br/>Not sure how could manage to make Looney Tunes so soulsuckingly dreary and unfunny, but there you have it: The worst product of cynical marketing towards kids.

The story is set around real life (as Michael is playing baseball) and it has some good characters. Wayne Knight (best known for playing Newman in Seinfeld and Dennis Nerdy in Jurassic Park) plays Stanley Podolak, who serves as one of the comic reliefs of the movie, and the film would be the one to introduce Lola Bunny, a female bunny who Bugs would have a crush on. Also, NBA players Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Shawn Bradley, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues, who were NBA greats at the time of the film, star as the players who get their talent stolen, and even Bill Murray and Larry Bird are in this.<br/><br/>For voice work, Billy West (best known to some as the voice of Phillip J. Fry in Futurama as well as the red M&M) voices Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, with Kath Souric voicing Lola. Danny DeVito voices the film's villain, Swackhammer.

This really is NOT a slam against the film...I am sure a lot of younger folks would enjoy it and the film made a lot of money (especially abroad). For me, it just didn't resonate and if I want to see a film that integrates cartoons with real life, I'd rather see ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""."

","Most people consider ""Toy Story"" to be the animated movie that bridged the ""playful kiddie stuff"" with ""sophisticated adult appeal"" to produce a product that all could enjoy. However, I think that sometimes this quirky little gem is overlooked in the pantheon of animated fare as it shares many of those same ""Toy Story"" traits.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Space Jam"" sees ""former"" (during his ""baseball years"") NBA great Michael Jordan (played by himself, of course!) join forces with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other Looney Tunes gang to play a b-ball games against the evil minions of Swackhammer of Moron Mountain in Toon Land.<br/><br/>The reason this film works so well is two-fold:<br/><br/>First, it is just a great kid's movie. I mean, what kid doesn't like the Looney Tunes, right?! There are enough crazy antics to keep most kids entertained for the runtime.<br/><br/>The true hallmark of the film, though, is how well it stands up to ""nostalgia viewers"" like myself, or those who saw it ""live"" back in 1996. ""Space Jam"" took full advantage of Michael Jordan's mystique (back when the NBA was relevant to everyone and still fighting the NFL for popularity), added some great music, and even capitalized on Jordan's retirement by making it a plot point.<br/><br/>Simply put, ""Space Jam"" may be somewhat of a forgotten effort due to basketball's waning popularity, the time gone by after Jordan, and the fact that even the Looney Tunes themselves are no longer as popular as they once were. However, the cultural significance of this movie (for those who ""lived it"") cannot be ignored. When Jordan is flying around the court and ""I Believe I Can Fly"" is crooning in the background, this is pure magic for the nostalgic set."

","Michael Jordan and assorted Looney Tunes cartoon characters play against aliens in a game of basketball. Adapted from an unpublished Shakespeare play, I believe. Surprisingly, Jordan's acting is pretty good. It's all the more impressive considering he's acting opposite nothing but green screen most of the time. Bill Murray is great in his small part but that's no surprise. As for the Looney Tunes characters: as with most modern versions of them, they are pretty lame. They lack the edge and humor of the classics. Not to mention the voices are weak. The addition of a new politically correct character, Lola Bunny, is insulting on several levels. Cynicism and nitpicks aside, it's an innocuous and enjoyable little bit of fluff. A couple of nice songs, too."

","It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings.<br/><br/>Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves ""The Monstars"" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as ""Moron Mountain"".<br/><br/>The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best.<br/><br/>Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist.<br/><br/>Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film. <br/><br/>Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable."

Just sit back and enjoy the crazy antics of the Looney Tunes and if you're a Jordan fan that is just icing on the cake. Jordan did a great job of acting and seemed to be having fun doing the movie. The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults."
"derick8895","9","2","4","28 November 2011"," Top Notch Acting or Basketball?
","The 1996 smash hit, Space Jam, received as much adoration from its young fans as it did receive criticism from its adult viewers. Directed by Joe Pytka, it stars NBA legend Michael Jordan, as he teams up with the Looney Tunes, to play in the ""Ultimate Game"" that decides the fate of these cartoon characters. It (the film) also features other NBA stars like Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and so on. This was a Live- Action/Animated film, unique among its kind, following the other famous Live-Action/Animated film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?.<br/><br/>Although it received widespread acclaim from its younger viewers, people ultimately came to see Michael Jordan play basketball with the Looney Tunes, not to see him act. The real live athletes/actors, especially Jordan, were at best good, if not decent. These guys make their living playing sports, not reading scripts. To say, when it came to acting, they wouldn't win an Oscar. However, there is no doubt in anyone one's mind that the only person meant to play the hero in this movie would be none other than Michael Jordan. He doesn't possess the proper acting skills that a hero should have but his personality and the fact that he is who he is suits him best to the action of the film. Some critics claimed that MJ would eventually be featured in a full length film, this being ""the one."" Michael Jordan, at the time, possessed a certain aura, deeming him to be the best basketball player at the time, if not in history.<br/><br/>In the same way people wanted to see MJ play basketball with the Looney Tunes, people wanted to see how the Looney Tunes would fare in a full feature length film. Scenes involving them spared no detail, as the personalities that we have come to know and love like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are marvelously created and adapted to this movie. At certain points of the movie, the acting of the characters, especially the dialogue that went on with, was whimsical and clever at the same time. The personality and the acting of the Looney Tunes were best suited for the film, being that these characters would easily adapt to the plot of the film better than those of the Disney Brand. In one scene, there was a reference to Pulp Fiction and another scene where they made jest of Disney. In comparison to their famous short length cartoons, the Looney Tunes characters had to stretch out a bit more of their talent. New jokes and references were made, as they had a lot more screen time than they are accustomed to. The Looney Tunes had rougher acting than the real live actors because there was the demand the children put on them. Though there were references that were only understood by older audiences, the cartoon characters were put there to capture the attention and hearts of the children. Although they've included some of the classic acts of the characters, more had to be done because of the longer screen time they had.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was great for younger audiences and, at the time, a technological marvel, as it combined the use of live action and animation to act as one. As a result, when it came to acting, it wasn't Oscar-winning material, but it sure captured the love of many children. I'd say that the athletes and characters gave the movie a bit more hype than it should have. I rate the film an 8.5 out of 10. Sorry, Mike, You couldn't get the perfect score like in the dunk contest!"

","Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny team up to create a master piece of galactic preportions. The mix of real life and cartoon is flawless, and Michael Jordan's kids are cute. The Looney Tunes team is the perfect comedic relief needed for the oppression of the Monstars. Bill Murray is definitely good, he sweats a lot as well which is good, as well. Michael Jordan's epic slam dunk at the end when he stretches his arm across the entire basketball court in the cartoon world against the Monstars is definitely his best slam dunk ever...even beating the classic Air Jordan...and he's a bad baseball player, that's why he returns to basketball. Muggsy Bogues, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and Shawn Bradley are good. Larry Bird is an impressive golfer.

It's a movie where you get to see many of your favourite characters: Barnyard Dawg, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn, Lola Bunny, Marvin the Martian, Porky Pig, Sylvester, Tasmanian Devil, Tweety, Yosemite Sam etc. There were so many of them, and only this movie, Space Jam, is able to show you them. I liked them all (characters), but my favourite ones are Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. I think both of them make a good rivalry, but they have to work together as a team/unit, and take on a character called Swackhammer who forms his own team known as Monstars. The Looney Tunes call themselves as the 'Tune Squad'. The character, Swackhammer, was played by none other than Danny DeVito (to my surprise), and he was excellent in the movie. He even kind of looks like the character he played which I found very funny. I like the title for this movie, Space Jam, and think it's such a cool name. This is a good movie about Basketball; it's a movie which can get you to like the sport. Let's not forget the other sports shown in this movie - Baseball and Golf. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world, and has the greatest Basketball player ever in ""Space Jam"" called Michael Jordan. He was great in this movie, and was the difference between the two teams. Can the 'Looney Tunes' do it? Can they win? Can they defeat them? You have to see it to find out. I remember how popular this movie was when it first came out. I use to own this on video, and use to watch it several times. I like the soundtracks in Space Jam. The most popular one was called ""I Believe I Can Fly"". Space Jam was a good movie. This is the movie where the ""Looney Tunes"" or ""Tune Squad"" are in action!"

","Space Jam is good. Not outstanding, not perfect, definetly won't make you laugh out loud throughout but acceptable and entertaining at points. I like its meta humor, Michael Jordon's character and his story was researched and well-done, the animation and live-action sandwich is pretty fluid, and I can appreciate the premise.<br/><br/>Where does it lack you may ask? Well, for having the Looney Tunes, they really aren't that funny. They're kinda loud and obnoxious but not unbearable characters. They're at least somewhat in character. Also the writing is pretty mediocre, especially for a premise that sounds pretty dang cool on paper and CAN work with the right people. But, I fell as if they kinda went halfway and stopped when they could've really dived for a deeper, funnier script. A few moments made me cringe, a few bad jokes just made me stare blankly at the screen in disapproval. But not bad.<br/><br/>Whatever, at least its not boring. What really carries this movie for me, though, is the basketball scenes. They're fast-paced and pretty fun to watch. You could ignore some of this movie's flaws just for these scenes alone. They don't save the entire thing, but it was just enough to make me enjoy myself.<br/><br/>Overall Space Jam is a pretty neat 90s flick that not everyone will be down with, but just enough will think its the slam dunk they've been waiting for. If you want to see it, I say go ahead but if you don't, your better off with about 90 minutes of classic looney tunes than this film. Thanks for reading."

I mean come on, you've got Michael Jordon helping the Looney Tunes in a basketball game to save them from being enslaved by aliens for their amusement park, it is an unbelievable thing to see in film, but hey, Hollywood will green-light anything. This is a movie I've seen as a little kid on VHS, and I simply fell in love with it, and since then it has become a guilty pleasure of mine.<br/><br/>I wasn't put off by Jordon's acting, I thought he did... okay. Not Oscar-worthy, but I believe he did better than Shaq. I also enjoy the other famous b-ball players playing themselves in this, especially Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing. And you've got Bill Murray basically playing his nonchalant self. *Spoilers:* There's one moment when the villain first sees Murray, he says, ""I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture."" Love that. XD The animation with the Looney Tunes was really good for its time, aside from the basketball court which looks really fake, but, eh. And it's also good to see ALL of the Tunes in this, a majority of them attending the b-ball game.<br/><br/>The one thing one can't deny is the amazing soundtrack featured in the film, especially the title song, Fly Like an Eagle, I Believe I Can Fly, Basketball Jones, For You I Will, etc. I even always sit through the entire end credits just to listen to the songs in it. It's astounding this one film has so many great singers on its soundtrack.<br/><br/>Also, check out the DVD audio commentary to this film, it's actually hilarious, it has voice actors Billy West (Bugs Bunny) and Dee Bradley Baker (Daffy Duck) interacting with Bugs and Daffy, the latter two who steal the show. And it's always a bit funny to hear director Joe Pitka literally walk in and out of the commentary by hearing his footsteps and door closing.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I couldn't be the only one who truly likes this film. It's certainly better than Looney Tunes: Back in Action, that's for sure. If you (or your kid) likes Looney Tunes, then give this one a shot, you may find some form on entertainment out of it. Not a masterpiece, but certainly not as bad as the Rotten Tomatoes rating makes it out."

He chooses the Looney Tunes, and sends his minions the nerdlucks to earth so they can capture them. The nerdlucks change into giant monsters and kick the Looney Tunes's butts in basketball, so Bugs Bunny and the gang find Michael Jordan to help them.<br/><br/>Due to Michael Jordan's HUGE popularity in the '90s, there was obviously a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it came out back in 1996, but just because it has big names doesn't mean it's a good movie, and that is the case with ""Space Jam"". This movie is pretty much an insult to Looney Tunes and the Looney Tunes fans. For one thing this movie introduces Lola Bunny. A pointless character whose only purpose in the franchise is to give Bugs a love interest. Also instead of the physical comedy and battles of wits that made these characters famous, we get overly violent, crude and mean-spirited humor.<br/><br/>Other flaws include Jordan's uninspired and overall boring acting performance, the obnoxious and irritating characters that are the nerdlucks, and for the film being just a giant advertisement for Michael Jordan and all of his sponsors.<br/><br/>The only good things about this movie are the animation and the voice acting, which are both outstanding, and there a few mildly funny jokes here and there, but overall this movie sucks.<br/><br/>Not recommended for hard-core Looney Tunes fans, or people who have been exposed to some actually well made animated movies. If you want to see a good animation/live-action hybrid film, just watch ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" instead, or this film's sequel ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"".

","Space Jam is a film directed by Joe Pytka that stars Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight and the Looney tunes in which the Monstars challenge the Looney Tunes to a game of basketball who in turn recruit the now retired Michael Jordan for help. Space Jam is something of a cult classic is most film circles and while I can see the appeal it has at least from a pop culture standpoint, I can't see that appeal from a filmmaking standpoint. The plot doesn't really have character development beyond Michael Jordan at least as characters mature through their issues really just because the script says they do. Speaking of the script, it is littered with repetitive dialogue, product placement and one-dimensional and obnoxious characters both human and animated. I really feel that these Looney Tunes work better in a quick 15 minute or half an hour show because their humor doesn't wear out in that time frame the way it does over the length of a film. Now on a more positive note, I have to say that I do enjoy the music in the film and when the tunes are at their looniest the animation is stellar but even the animation led itself to some pretty awful editing during the third act. The third and first acts of this film felt incredibly short as well as the second act dragged on and on and while this film was an hour and a half long it felt like two hours and fifteen minutes. If you enjoyed this film, I understand why as there are elements of appeal that exist here and even I can't deny that but I also can't deny that this film had plenty of problems and while I didn't go into this film expecting it to be a masterpiece or a game changer, I expected it to be at least decent and entertaining and for me, it was inconsistent and forgettable."

","I was surprised to learn that the ""How Did That Get Made"" podcast had picked ""Space Jam"" as one of the movies they were going to do. Though I hadn't seen the movie in years, I remember as a 16 year old, taking my younger brother to see it at the cinema - just the two of us and it wasn't, in my memory at least, a bad film. Turns out, they were right, as the movie is a pretty shambolic mix of advertisements and nonsense.<br/><br/>With his space amusement park failing, Mr. Swackhammer (Danny DeVito) sends his lackeys to Earth to capture the Looney Tunes characters as his new attraction. Thinking fast, Bugs Bunny (Billy West) says that the Tunes characters have the right to defend themselves in a competition of their choosing. Given the small stature of their captures, Bugs picks Basketball, but the Aliens have a plan, and steal the skills of various NBA players (as well as a series of physical enhancements). Seeing that they'll now struggle, the tunes recruit Michael Jordan to play for their team.<br/><br/>Overall it's a bit of a mess. I can actually take the advertisements, they're not as egregious as it's been made out to be in other areas, but the plot is horribly under baked and lacking, the voices sound wrong (mostly because they're different people) and worst of all, it's not funny. Not even slightly. Not even when Bill Murray is in it. The best bits, oddly, revolve around the real human basketball players and their struggles once the aliens have taken their basketball skills. Their visits to hospitals and psychiatrists trying to get to the bottom of it. The animation work is poor too, with the interaction with the real world less convincing than ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" despite that being almost a decade later.<br/><br/>Michael Jordan actually does OK performance-wise. So much so you wonder why he hasn't taken up acting since his actual retirement and he's unquestionably the greatest NBA player of all time, so I understand the desire to eulogise him in a film like this.

OK, it's not terrific or a masterpiece, but it does accomplish one simple goal: it's entertaining.<br/><br/>The plot concerns Michael Jordan (playing himself and proving to be a rather charming actor) who, after retiring from basketball, finds himself roped (literally) into helping Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes in a do or die game against aliens. Sound ridiculous? It is but this is the Looney Tunes, not ""2001.""<br/><br/>The pros are pretty significant. The cast performs well (with Wayne Knight and Bill Murray stand-outs), the animation is colorful and lively and the comedy concerning the now-talentless NBA players is really a treat with a particular shout-out going to Albert Hague who plays a psychiatrist. Let's also mention the phenomenal soundtrack which I will never fault this film for.<br/><br/>Although it lacks solidity and most of the live action scenes without the Tunes are pretty dull, overall I enjoyed it. And I still do almost fourteen years later."

","NBA superstar Michael Jordan made the leap from the hardcourts to the big screen in this small film that is little more than a ploy to capitalize on the popular Nike commercials starring Jordan and Bugs Bunny. The Looney Tunes are about to become slaves to some evil little animated monsters unless they can defeat the creatures in a winner-take-all basketball game. Naturally the monsters change by stealing the talents of various other NBA stars (Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Tyrone Bogues, Larry Johnson and Shawn Bradley) and it is up to Bugs, Daffy and company to enlist the help of the greatest player ever---Jordan. Larry Bird and Bill Murray are super in limited action, but overall the movie is just one of those films used to make money and little else. Jordan does prove to be a likeable screen presence as he just plays himself. Not a bad film, but nothing really impressive either. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","Space Jam could've been way better if they had made it more like the originals. But then Michael Jordan wouldn't have been needed in the film.. So it's not a good Looney Tunes movie. Not to mention Lola is disgusting. I don't go for lewd cartoon rabbits, WB."
"T-ZER0","2","2","6","8 April 2020"," Face it, this movie sucks
","Like Mr. T says: ""I pity the fool."" I pity the fools who think this is the epitome of Looney Tunes cinema. Most people grew up with this and I did too. I used to watch it whenever it came on TV, or on VHS. But it never appealed to me as much as Who Framed Roger Rabbit does. When does a plot with Looney Tunes and Basketball sound great? It doesn't. I agree with that one animator of Warner Bros. they made Bugs Bunny stupid. If he was smart, he could've gotten rid of the aliens in a few minutes. This isn't the Broken Arms hotel!<br/><br/>When would Porky Pig say that he wet himself? How is that funny? Oh wait, it's funny if you are a kid. Which of course, most of the people who watched this were 6 year olds.<br/><br/>Can we talk about how stupid a character Lola Bunny is? I've always hated her, and I have a good reason to. I've never ever been attracted to cartoon characters. Heck, I don't think Jessica Rabbit is attractive, but she's a lot better than Lola. They want you to think Lola is attractive, by giving her curves and crazy shots of her body and face, but she's hideous. She's not attractive, and she's my least favorite looney tune out of this whole franchise.<br/><br/>I find it hilarious that the basketball game is terribly choreographed. Bugs Bunny is the point guard, yet he still lets Foghorn Leghorn skip down the court singing I wish I was in the land of cotton.<br/><br/>What sense does it make to steal someone's talent? It literally makes no sense. Stealing superpowers is a thing. Stealing intelligence is one thing. But what the heck is stealing talent? Also, they literally shut down the NBA, just because a bunch of players claimed aliens took their talent? They wouldn't have them checked out by therapists? In real life they would think that they are doing drugs. Shutting down the NBA for Coronavirus is one thing, shutting it down because of some players claiming aliens were there is not. This is just lazy writing and it sucks bad.<br/><br/>Also, besides the awfulness of the product placement, the only good thing to come out of this thing is the soundtrack, which my family used to listen to a lot. For you I will by Monica is the best song, but the movie is soo bad. I know Space Jam 2 is happening, but judging by this movie. It shouldn't. ""They are so occupied with whether or not they could they didn't stop to think if they should!"""

"mitsubishizero","7","1","2","1 November 2018"," Enjoyable though its flaws are more apparent.
","I grew up watching this as a kid and while I still like it, I'll be the first to admit it's definitely a product of the times. People are divided over this movie and it's not hard to see why. The movie's more like a commercial in disguise of a movie like The Wizard and probably the most critical of the movie was the legendary Chuck Jones but i'll get to that later. Many people agree that Michael Jordan can't act and to some extant I agree. The reason that doesn't bother me is because for what it's worth he does a decent job playing himself lost in an animated world full of insanity.<br/><br/>The story's basically the Looney Tunes forcibly recruiting Michael Jordan who retired from basketball to help them defeat the Monstars who want to put them in their amusement park on the home planet for their boss (voiced by Danny Devito). This's what Chuck Jones strongly disliked about the movie claiming that Bugs would've never needed MJ or the other tunes' help in defeating the antagonists regardless of their size and it would've been under 6-7 minutes had it stuck to the source material.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie's not bad but I can see why some people don't like it: Like I said earlier Michael Jordan can't really act but I don't know. I think he did ok considering this was out of his comfort zone. He plays the fish out of water pretty well. It's cool to see most if not all the Looney Tunes characters interact with each other which you don't see often in the original shorts. The characters are cool but I noticed Billy West voices Bugs and while it's not bad he gives Bugs more of a nasal voice which can be a little distracting. Bill Murray's character's more of a cameo that doesn't really help further the plot and while some people think Wayne Knight's annoying in this movie he doesn't get under my skin. In fact I think he's kind've funny. Last but not least is Lola Bunny whom isn't bad I just wish she had more scenes as well as more character development.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the movie's not great but it's not bad. If anything it's enjoyable in a strange way. Check it out for yourself."
"Rainey-Dawn","6","1","2","23 October 2014"," It's An OK Film
","Space Jam is actually a fairly good older comedy film. It's got the Loony Tunes characters in it and that is the best part of the movie - just watching the Loony Tunes in a new way. I have no problem with Michael Jordon either - I realize he is outstanding athlete and was extremely popular at the time this film.<br/><br/>The downside, for me, is that I'm not a fan of Basketball. I know it's a very popular sport that many people enjoy it and I will never knock it - it's just not something I am into.<br/><br/>Space Jam is worth watching if you like comedies, Loony Tunes and Basketball. If you like Space Jam then you might like similar types of movies: ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Song of the South"".<br/><br/>6/10"
"Electrified_Voltage","6","1","2","10 August 2009"," A hit-and-miss live action/animated crossover
","This 1996 live action/animated crossover, starring then-basketball champion Michael Jordan as himself, plus the popular Looney Tunes characters, was obviously a success. I never saw it around that time in the late 90's, but clearly remember the craze, with all the merchandise. I was familiar with the Looney Tunes characters (at least most of them) from old cartoons I had seen. Although I've certainly never been an avid follower of professional basketball (or any sport you see on TV, for that matter), I was also familiar with Jordan, as this was his heyday, and he had a huge reputation. Despite all this, I didn't see ""Space Jam"" until last night. A few years ago, I saw ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"", and remember hating it, but despite my fairly low expectations for its predecessor, this one does have some redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Michael Jordan announces his retirement from the NBA and switches to professional baseball, but is not very successful with this sport. Meanwhile, on a distant planet, Mr. Swackhammer owns a theme park called Moron Mountain. He is desperate for new attractions for his park, and thinks the Looney Tunes would be great. He sends his minions, five small aliens known as the ""Nerdlucks"" (Pound, Blanko, Nawt, Bupkus, and Bang) to Looney Tune Land, below the surface of the Earth, to capture the Looney Tunes and force them to act as attractions for Moron Mountain, whether they like it or not! However, Bugs Bunny tricks them into agreeing to a basketball game, which will determine whether Moron Mountain gets them as attractions, or they remain free. Since the Nerdlucks are so small, the Looney Tunes figure they can easily clobber them in the sport, but the clever aliens steal the talent of several NBA players and become the giant Monstars! Knowing this won't be as easy as they thought, the Looney Tunes recruit Michael Jordan for the competition. <br/><br/>For much of the film, it seemed I would only be able to rate it 5/10. I found that the plot was pretty dull, and most of it wasn't that funny (though there are some funny moments early on, such as Bugs Bunny telling the Nerdlucks he hasn't seen Bugs Bunny). I really don't know how to go into details about this, but for me, these were problems that brought the movie down in quality. However, to me it eventually improved, and I started finding it funnier. The cartoon characters in the film can sometimes be funny, and Stan Podolak, Michael Jordan's assistant played by Wayne Knight, can also be quite comical, especially later in the film. (Mind you, despite all the good jokes, there is a major fart joke towards the end, unfortunately.) Also, Jordan doesn't put on that bad a performance, considering the fact that he's not an actor, the film has some nice animation, and the big basketball competition is intense. With these qualities, ""Space Jam"" certainly isn't classic family fare, but they're enough to make it a mixed blessing. Maybe this movie has more appeal to kids, but adults might enjoy it as well, even if it's basically fluff."
"Zaptharo","6","1","2","24 February 2009"," A funny, wacky family friendly film, but comes up short..
","Since the release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, animators and producers have been trying to emulate the blockbuster success. Some were good, many were mediocre or worse. Space Jam happens to fall into the category of okay, but with many flaws.<br/><br/>This wacky film stars basketball legend Michael Jordan, who is more or less, a so-so actor. At the height of his career, Michael wanted to retire from basketball to play baseball. To promote sales and products, Hollywood producers gave him a chance to act in front of the camera. He agreed, but only playing as himself.<br/><br/>The real strong point of this film is that it stars the Looney Tunes, some of the world's most recognized and beloved cartoon characters. Despite their grand entrance, the movie received lukewarm reviews in it's first few weeks. It was also criticized for having a somewhat ridiculous story, in which a tyrant named Mr. Swackhammer (Danny Devito) wants to build a new attraction by kidnapping Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes at a distant theme park known as Moron Mountain. Throughout the movie, Michael and his buddies work hard to challenge the tyrant's helpers to a basketball game. If they lose, they will be forced to entertain the hard-pleased natives of Moron Mountain for all eternity.<br/><br/>Space Jam is one of the few films where the Looney Tunes characters get their chance to express themselves on the big screen. Whereas most of their movies had basically added segments and poor animation, Space Jam was an original concept that gave the cartoon characters more depth. The animation looks beautiful and the live action blends in well with the cartoon environment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the fact that the jokes and gags that are famous in numerous Looney Tune cartoons didn't make it into the movie. Weak dialog and somewhat poor plots revealed in Space Jam doesn't compare to the humor of the old cartoons or the better writing seen in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Some of the actors come up short, including the NBA players who simply play themselves. Wayne Knight was a goofy addition to the cast, but he was simply more annoying than tolerable. Bill Murray (Saturday Night Live, GhostBusters, Groundhog Day) was a disappointment, coming across as irritated and unlikeable by playing himself.<br/><br/>Still the good outnumbers the bad, and personally I think the critics were being too harsh on this film. The addition of Lola Bunny was a nice touch, and there were a few hilarious moments worth mentioning. It also has a good soundtrack, which fits in with the theme of Space Jam.<br/><br/>The film had a lot of merchandise going for it, and sadly it didn't hold up to it's full potential. If you get past the so-so acting of the live actors and the somewhat clichÃ©d plot, Space Jam is a funny film that will entertain kids and Looney Tune fans alike. It wasn't merely aiming at an adult demographic, but it is still enjoyable by those who have watched the cartoon shorts. Not the best live action/animated film, but certainly not the worst either.<br/><br/>Six out of Ten."
"supercygnus","Null","1","2","30 November 2003"," Bugs, Daffy...and Jordan? Not as bad as they say, but...
","Okay. This is NOT a tremendous success, and it really hasn't aged well. The voices are terrible. Few or none of the WB characters sound like the original inspirations. The inclusion of Jordan is just plain bizarre. Retains very little feel of the classic cartoons.<br/><br/>That being said...<br/><br/>It's not nearly as bad as some of the more poisoned pen reviewers on this site might suggest. First off, kids love it. It made a fortune at the box office. They love the character's hijinks and they love the basketball stuff (the game, the superstars, etc.). Some of our movie loving brethren across the pond and around the world may not appreciate the distinctly American past time of basketball (as some of the especially angry reviewers have noted) but we really dig it here. There are also some inspired bits here and there and some really funny stuff with Bill Murray. It is tragic, however, that the funniest scenes of a WB cartoon character driven film are the result of a human performance (and not a drawn one). All in all Looney fans all say they hate it, but most of us own it anyway. There are worse things to show your kids (and they really will like it) and there are glimmers of great scenes. The new LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION is a FAR SUPERIOR film and I would make that your top priority, but Space Jam may pass the time until the newer film hits the DVD stands."
"Jaime N. Christley","Null","1","2","26 May 1999"," High-spirited, lots of laughs
","There were two forces at work which kept me from seeing this film for a great long while.  One was the trailer, along with all the other promotional stuff.  They gave off the idea that this film was going to be self-conscious, obnoxious, and unfunny.  The other force was the saccharine R.Kelly tune, ""I Believe I Can Fly"".  Pop music written for movies has been on a deep decline since ""The Morning After"" from ""The Poseidon Adventure"", so I won't elaborate on that any further.<br/><br/>Having finally seen it the other day, I was pleasantly surprised.  Many things are right with it, and I will list a few.<br/><br/>First, it's very funny.  The directors and writers (who were, without a doubt, yes-men for the studio execs, but no matter) have the rare gift of being able to achieve and sustain the perfect comic pitch for most, if not all, of the picture.  Many sight-gags abound; some are old-fashioned, and they remind us of why we laugh at decades-old Looney Toons when we see them today; some are well-placed pop culture references (the one for ""Pulp Fiction"", with Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd in the Vince and Jules outfits, is the best one).  The sub-plot, with a half-dozen real-life NBA players dealing with the mysterious, supernatural larceny of their ball-handling skills, provides quite a few laughs--if you have a minimum knowledge-base on ""The Holy Game"", you will get the jokes.<br/><br/>Second, the darned thing works.  The special effects are startlingly innovative, and not over-done.  Michael Jordan, despite not being the world's greatest line-reader, has a great screen presence, and works well against the (invisible, during the filming) cartoon characters--that's harder than it looks.  The games, set in the animated universe, are well staged.  Bill Murray is funny just by BEING, and Wayne Knight is...well, forget it, he's kind of annoying.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, ""Space Jam"" doesn't quite do it as well as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", but for what it is, it's got game."

","What on earth were Warner Brothers thinking making this monstrosity of a movie called Space Jam? The director/producer should've been either bankrupt, or fired a very, very, very long time ago. This trainwreck of a movie has such a pointless plot, Wayne Knight was such an embarrassment in this movie, because all he did in this movie, was act so annoying and stupid. At least 3 years after, he had redeemed himself by doing the voice of Al, from Toy Story 2, I mean it's as simple as that. Bill Murray was an unnecessary choice for the movie, the villains were weak and pathetic, and Michael Jordan I understand he is a great basketball player, but he makes a terrible actor with this movie. Dr. Swackhammer was an annoying and a unimaginative villains in film history, the Nerdlucks don't even look like aliens at all, instead they look more like cockroaches that I could step on, and when they turn into Monstars, it doesn't get better, instead, it gets worse, because the Monstars are one of the weakest and most pathetic names ever for a basketball team along with the ToonSquad. And the Looney Tunes characters looks like that it comes from one of the Happy Meal boxes, and looks like bunches of ugly caricatures, and worse, the voice- acting sounds different, and doesn't even connect to the original Looney Tunes. That is a very bad excuse for Looney Tunes, and that's just shameful. It even makes the voices of Fanboy & Chum-Chum were slightly better than this. And also, not to mention, the two worst Looney Tunes characters are Tweety and Lola Bunny, I mean, why did those two had to appear in this trainwreck of a movie? This makes me wanna hate this movie even more, because not only are Tweety and Lola Bunny's the worst Looney Tunes characters ever, they are the most annoying cartoon characters ever, almost as annoying as Dora The Explorer. And not only that, there was a seen where they ripped-off one of the scenes from Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland. Also, the jokes in it is absolutely miserable. It has no real jokes at all, all it is just a bunch of wretched jokes that makes one feel disgusted every time they here a cringeworthy jokes from this movie. This movie should've won some Razzie Awards for being the worst movie ever. The animation is horrible, the jokes are pathetic, the characters are annoying, the plot is repugnant, and the music is also suckish. This is the worst Looney Tunes ever next to Tweety's High-Flying Adventure that I had ever seen in my entire life. It's even worse than Shrek Forever After, which that sequel is bad, but not as bad as Space Jam. This movie will only entertain little kids and younger, and frustrates adults. This is one of those family films that you should stay away, if you wanna watch a much better family film, watch Ferdinand and The Greatest Showman. But, STAY, AWAY, from Space Jam, it is a terrible film. I give this movie a 1/10. Looney Tunes Back In Action was bad, but I will admit, it's not as bad as Space Jam, Space Jam is just a horrible excuse, and it just feels like a preschool affair."
"lee_eisenberg","5","2","7","24 March 2007"," I still say that there's always reason to be doubtful about any of what they produced after Mel Blanc died.
","What made the classic Looney Tunes cartoons so great was their clever stories (with occasional social commentary) and their avoidance of gross commercialism; and of course there were Mel Blanc's voices. It seems like everything that they produced after his death was mostly really corporate. I'll admit that ""Space Jam"" is pretty entertaining, as Michael Jordan comes to the rescue of Bugs, Daffy, Porky, etc., after some aliens try to kidnap them. But aside from the over-emphasis on Jordan himself, it seems like this movie was just trying to sell a bunch of things (not to mention that the voices don't sound right without Mel Blanc). And if it was intended for young children, then some of what it showed wasn't particularly appropriate for children, namely the ""nice butt"" scene.<br/><br/>So, it's OK as straight entertainment. But you'll do far better to just stick with the classic cartoons. Also starring Wayne Knight, Bill Murray and the voice of Danny DeVito."

The story is a very nice idea, but there were parts when it was rather juvenile, likewise with some of the dialogue. Michael Jordan is a great athlete, and his skills are put to great use, but his acting isn't as impressive, it seems as though he is playing himself at times. Flaws aside, it is very funny with some great jokes and constant energy, and excellent supporting characters. Bill Murray, wearing clothes that you shouldn't ideally wear on a golf course, steals every scene he's in, and Danny DeVito is great fun as evil Swackhammer. The Looney Tunes are hilarious, especially Daffy, and technically with all the radiant colours the film works wonders.

","This movie undoes in 90 minutes what the masters Avery and Jones (and to a lesser extent Freling and McKimpson) did in 20 years and was maintained for 30 more.<br/><br/>The plot is inane: If Bugs and co. can't defeat the alien ""Monstars"" in basketball game, they will be enslaved forever. However, with some intelligent writing they could pull it off, but for some reason Bugs has become a complete wimp and enlists old pal Michael Jordan (they had several mutual commercials) to help. Come on! Bugs has defeated threats ten times more menacing all on his own!<br/><br/>The characters have seriously degraded. The filmmakers pride themselves on ""modernizing"" the characters. This means that Bugs makes a complete moron out of himself in front of newcomer ""Lola Bunny"", who is the cardboard cutout ""independent female"" and bears absolutely no connection to any element of the Looney Tunes. We are also supposed to laugh at Bugs repeatedly getting pounded into submission. Who is this impostor? He's such a wimp, he can't even defend himself against an ordinary pit bull!<br/><br/>And Daffy! After all of the blood, sweat and tears Chuck Jones put into making him one the greatest characters of all time, they reduce him to the spluttering lunatic we thought we'd never see again. His body proportions have been mutated to ridiculous, and his voice is just horrible. Whatever happened to Joe Alaskey?<br/><br/>It gets worse. Tweety has lost his innocence, Sylvester is a dolt, Taz is a prop, the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote keep up their usual rivalry but have absolutely nothing to do, nobody seems to know what to do with Porky, who seems lost in the movie's jarring, unmerciful pace, and some of the best players for the team (Gossamer, Crusher) are never used. The Nerdlucks/Monstars start out as cuddly, colour-coded Disney sweeties and become uninteresting, uninspired props. Way to go, guys.<br/><br/>The only satisfying character is Marvin the Martian, who referees the game. Whoever directed his short sequences had the right idea about what this movie could have been. Instead, we get jokes about urination, saliva and nudity, and some jarring incidences like Daffy muttering ""we're gettin' thcrewed."" Since when do they talk like that?<br/><br/>The writers should know that THE LOONEY TUNES DO NOT NEED TO BE MODERNIZED. They have been carefully crafted to always be entertaining well into the new millennium and beyond. Injecting Ren and Stimpy-brand humour and secular music is not becoming at all. Calling in Chuck Jones as a creative consultant would help immensely. However, the only indication that the producer know that he's alive is a sign advertising ""CJ's Toys"". Call me old-fashioned, but I think that would make a better movie than ""Space Jam""."

The animation looks VERY cheap - I was hoping for something more in the vein of Roger Rabbit in terms of the care taken for integrating the toons with the live folks, but it just looks rushed and only slightly above the level of saturday morning fare."

","Michael Jordan's recent departure from basketball will make SPACE JAM a memorable video collector's item to behold, now and forever. His appearances with Bugs & Company in past TV commercials put the tall guy into greater stardom than on the court. Here's where the magic is!<br/><br/>Frankly, SPACE JAM is a swift update for the LOONEY TUNES cast due to some modernized comedy. I can't believe Porky Pig actually said he wet his pants! It's no surprise this got a PG rating, and that's largely due to the animated effects of Jordan and other real-life humans sucking into holes, which is amusing, but points out the subject of ""mild violence"". It's not bad as it is cartoonish. To say it simple, it's great fun for all ages because of Bugs, Daffy, & Company who have timelessly entertained us for decades.<br/><br/>When Jordan spoke his words about retiring, there's one thing he forgot to say to the public: ""TH-TH-TH-TH-THAT'S ALL FOLKS!"""

","Space Jam (1996): Dir: Joe Pytka / Cast: Michael Jordan, Theresa Randle, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, Larry Bird: Space Jam sounds like something I did while parallel parking. It opens with a young Michael Jordan impressing his father with basketball. Too bad the screenwriter couldn't impress us with a screenplay worthy of the talent involved. Meanwhile the Looney Tunes may becomes slaves to a theme park unless they can win a basketball game. The opposing team travel to Earth to suck the talent out of the N.B.A stars save for Jordan who is persuaded to help. Ridiculous storytelling without any of the intelligence of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Animated characters look dashing with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote, Roadrunner, and a rather suggestive appearance by Lola Bunny. Her innuendo is perhaps a tad more suggestive than the film's intended audience deserves. The film is an excuse to cash in on the popularity of Jordan who actually holds his own opposite the cartoon and will need to think beyond human means to solve the plot. Other roles are merely cardboard with Wayne Knight, Theresa Randle and Bill Murray. Directed by Joe Pytka who highlights the star and the animated characters but hiring people to put an effort into plot would have been nice. The result is a very dull game that should be jammed in the space between a tire and the pavement. Score: 2 Â½ / 10"

","Michael Jordan is playing baseball and really sucks at it. Swackhammer is the owner of the amusement park planet Moron Mountain and he needs new attractions. His underlings arrive on Earth to take Bugs Bunny and the rest of the gang back as prisoners. Bugs trick the tiny aliens into playing basketball for their freedom. However the aliens steal the talents of the greatest NBA star to become basketball monsters. While playing golf with Bill Murray and Larry Bird, Jordan is taken by Bugs to join their team.<br/><br/>One has to compare and contrast this to 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. There is no excuse for this but the animation looks cheaper. There is some CGI but it's in its early form. It looks like a 90s TV cartoon and doesn't really hold up. There is a more timeless quality about Roger Rabbit. Then there is Jordan. This is very much a vehicle for Jordan but it doesn't make him a good actor. There is really no acting in this. As a pop artifact, it's kind of interesting to see but it's not a good movie. It's mostly for kiddie Jordan fans back in the day."
"Angels_Review","5","1","4","7 August 2014"," Space Jam
","Well this was a really fun show to actually watch. I guess part of it was because of the fact that it had Michael Jordan in the show. I used the live in Chicago so the Chicago Bulls were a bit nostalgic for me. This has an interesting show because it had a lot of the same idea's as Cool World and Who framed Roger Rabbit. The whole idea that toons live in another dimension then the real world.<br/><br/>When you look at the old looney tunes and the newer idea of them, a lot of things stand out. First, the personalities of the characters had actually been altered to make them a bit more rounded. Characters actually care for each other even though they still fight between themselves. One that seemed a bit forced though was the new character, Lola. She didn't have much story line and served as a love interest for Bugs as well as the only female in a mass of male characters.<br/><br/>I love how they pretty much brought Michael's family life into it. It made it really relatable because we saw how he was just like everyone else. He has a loving wife, a couple beautiful kids, and a wonderful house with all that he really needed to be happy. He has friends as well (Although many of them are rather famous like Bill Murray.) and does many things that we would normally do. Unfortunately, Michael is many things, but not an actor. He is alright but he doesn't seem to show much emotion when it came to the tunes and destroy some of the emotions in it.<br/><br/>One thing that bugged me was that in the start of the show, Michael has turned into a ball and thrown around by the Nerdlucks. There is a point at the end of the show that Michael actually asks if he can do toon physics to win the game. If he was turned into a ball and thrown around, wouldn't he know that he can? Not only that, but he never uses it except for those two times.<br/><br/>The animation is rather good though the characters seem more 3D then they have any business being I think. It just feels a little out of what we are used to. It's not all bad, but does throw the show off when they go from old cartoons to the newer CG stuff. When cartoon physics kick in with the live action characters, it looks rather off as well, and you can actually tell that it was pretty strange photoshopping rather then CG. It's OK for the time I guess but it's still really easy to tell it's off.<br/><br/>There really were no problems with the voices. They were really good and had the same feeling as the older version of the characters. The Nerdlucks were done well, each having there own personality and some stand out better then others."

","Can you just imagine the cost of this live-action animated comedy? Basketball legend Michael Jordan is forced to play basketball on a team of Looney Tune characters featuring Bugs, Daffy, Porky and Sylvester. The cartoon stars are to play a basketball game against some evil outer space creatures in order to not become slaves for an intergalactic amusement park owner. Its hopeful that Michael will be able to help save the day and maybe just bring along some of his buddies like Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Larry Bird. Also in the cast: Bill Murray, Theresa Randle and Wayne Knight. I found it funny when Daffy Duck makes a disparaging remark using the name of Mickey Mouse.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","4","25 October 2007"," Just not very good
","I am not a fan of basketball, Michael Jordan or the Looney Tunes. Why, then, do I own a store-bought VHS copy of this film, you ask? Darned if I know. Maybe it was a present. Maybe it was from a time where my taste was less discriminating... but hey, even kids must have some limit, some point at which they stare in disbelief at the crap thrown at them. The film opens to a scene which has a soundtrack song the choice of which is so painfully obvious, that actually choosing it is almost ridiculous, goes on with such highlights as a number of the Looneys all spitting in unison, and ends in a major showdown, with occasional awful acting by basketball players, and one rather underdeveloped, faint attempt at an emotion-evoking subplot along the way. The strange thing is that, save for said showdown, there's really hardly any basket played in the film... one would think that to be one of the main attractions. Their lead is one of the good players of the sport, and the plot can't be summed up or described without mentioning said free-time activity. Scenes that seem like they'd lead to at least *some* basketball... just exactly don't. Dan Castellaneta shows up in a cameo, doing nothing. The plot is OK. The pacing isn't too bad. The humor isn't all good, but it has its moments. The large cast of characters, some of which are animated, allows fairly little time for almost all of them, but I suppose people aren't used to spending too much time with the Tunes, so that may not be a bad thing. Oddly enough, they really hardly do any of their trademark gags. The film doesn't overstay its welcome, coming in at not much under an hour and a half. This is the introduction of Lola Bunny, who, I gather from the Trivia entry regarding this, stayed with the franchise. Bugs is this time, and some from this point on, performed by Billy West, also known from Futurama. If you listen carefully, you can tell the ""Fry"" in some of Bunny's lines. The direction is done by Joe Pytka, who, before this, had done a few Michael Jackson videos and a Richard Dreyfuss comedy. The blend of animation and live action isn't always smooth. The effects look dated today, in particular the CGI, but the general animation isn't bad. The film does have some reasonable moments... the initial arrival of the aliens to the land of cartoons, for example. The music is good enough. I guess it's a decent enough film for those who are fans of the sport and/or the cartoons. Just strange how much there is to be found in the film that features neither. I recommend this to anyone who finds themselves in either or both of the aforementioned groups, as well as anyone still interested after reading this review. 6/10"

","What a horribly made movie, blame the producer, director or who ever is responsible for such a STUPID STORYLINE.<br/><br/>it COULD have been good, it had all the looney tunes cartoons and some basketball greats. The IDIOT who produced or wrote the movie, never ever saw bugs bunny cartoons before. those doing the voice over for the cartoons? didn't even try to get the voices right.<br/><br/>then it has bugs bunny, a male, kissing Michael Jordan, another male with a deep kiss?? offensive, wrong and embarrassing. Its as if it was MJ's mother who wrote the movie, all about kissing his a.. and often showing MJs shoes then slowly going up to his up close face; and this happens at least a few times. if you're a female and have some romantic ""thing"" for MJ? and like seeing his UP CLOSE!! face over and over, showing his mid section up close? then its the movie for you.<br/><br/>if you want a family movie? Then DO NOT waste time on Space Jam. find something else. towards the beginning it has bugs sexually frustrated in a stupid, awkward way. Again, none of the cartoon characters act or sound like the original, its completely sad, had to be monumentally sad for those who wasted money buying a movie ticket.<br/><br/>It could have been an OK movie but since the producer never saw bugs bunny or any other of those characters before? he ruined it; would be nice to find out the producer/director went bankrupt and never made any other movies<br/><br/>The movie has Newman from Seinfeld, so at least he's funny. but its a non existent or incoherent story line, close ups of MJs face and mid section, .ss kissing of MJ overall in a weird way, and the . is supposed to be the letter 'a'.<br/><br/>Small children may be able to see cartoon figures running around on the screen and be entertained even though they don't know what its about and there's no storyline; so they can be amused for a while; That plus i don't recall hearing any flagrant profanity, so common in family movies in 2015 so it got 2 stars out of 10 instead of 1."

","It's really hard to comment on a movie like ""Space Jam"". Most people trash it because it is untrue to the tradition of Looney Tunes. I agree with this; I groan at the inclusion of Lola Bunny, and Bugs and costars would NOT need Michael Jordan's help in defeating these Monstars. The only thing that can kill them is Dip, for crying out loud. Nevertheless, the film has it's charms (though they are few). <br/><br/>One cannot review 'Space Jam' without mentioning Michael Jordan. I wouldn't mind the movie so much if it didn't center around Jordan worship. Here's an idea: Why not have a real actor play a fictional basketball player? A legend out of their prime, called out again in a time of need for the Looney Tunes. Doesn't that seem like a good premise? Apparently, Warner Bros. didn't think so, and much of the film has gallons of praise for Jordan. Michael Jordan is not a bad actor per se, but he really is just being himself. The Looney Tunes are still funny, but their personalities do not seem as apparent in this movie. I mean, when you get down to it, the personalities of the Looney Tunes is what makes them funny. Here, they just seem... like cookie-cutter cartoon characters. That ain't good. Bill Murray shows up to inject some much-needed laughs in the final act, and he seems more adept at acting alongside 'Toons than Michael Jordan. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Space Jam's problem is that it falls flat. It's dead in the water. 'Space Jam' is a disappointment."

","Most millennials have a relation ""Space Jam"", the 1996 live action/animated film is now more or less widely appreciated as a cult classic and deservingly so. The elements of some good ol' American 90s cheesiness involving basketball superstar Michael Jordan and his family, along with timeless ""Looney Tunes"" moments provides you with this sport comedy. In it, aliens have invaded the world of Loonies and to settle the fate of their future a basket game will take place in which Bugs, Daffy, Lola, Taz and the rest team up with Jordan. Jordan does what he can with his roles which isn't much. His lines are quite limited but it doesn't matter since will see him own the court fused with some Toon powers. The rest of the human cast aren't really showing their best sides off, apart from the always beloved Bill Murray, but the cartoon ensemble are the stars of the show. While much of the focus is on Jordan, ""Space Jam"" is all about the Loonies at the end of the day and they bring you all the whacky, toony, eye-bugging comedy you want. Wether or not ""Space Jam"" can be introduced to today's generation of kids I don't know, but if you are one in the Millenial crew, ""Space Jam"" will you give you a trip down the nostalgia lane in a fantastic manner."

","Not too sure why this film is called Space Jam but I guess it sounds kinda cool doesn't it. Despite the fact the film stars all the Warner Bros Looney Tunes characters the whole thing is really all about Michael Jordan. A fictional account of a small segment in his career if you will. <br/><br/>So if you haven't already guessed the film is also all about basketball, this makes me wonder if the film was as much of a hit here in the UK as it inevitably was in the US. Obviously the Looney Tunes characters had a lot to do with the appeal for many as the film serves as more of an animated adventure rather than a true basketball feature. That being said it does give plenty for both sides of this spectrum.<br/><br/>Should I really have a go at the plot? this is after all a cartoon of sorts. Basically MJ must do battle on the court against some aliens who want him to be their slave within their intergalactic theme park. Thing is these crafty aliens have pinched the talents of fellow NBA All-Stars Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Shawn Bradly, Pat Ewing and Charles Barkley (what about John Stockton or Scottie Pippen?). So end of the day its Michael Jordan vs a selection of other NBA players, guess who wins? I wonder what the films trying to say?.<br/><br/>As far as an animated flick goes this is a fun time, its bright bold and colourful, there's plenty of toon action, the usual visual gags, in- jokes, sly homages etc...and of course the WB roster is always good see. The problems I have is the fact the animation is nowhere near as good as the classic original toons of Chuck Jones and co naturally...and they never will be ever again. The voice talent is nowhere near as good as Mel Blanc and co...and they never will be again. Plus of course they mix in CGI with hand drawn animation which kinda works in places but looks awful in others.<br/><br/>I think the worst voice work going in this film must be the attempt at 'Pepe Le Pew'. Wasn't a fan of the stereotypical female version of Bugs either, wasn't required, was just added for the young female audience and felt totally out of place. On the other hand the baddie alien characters weren't too bad if a little bland, they became more interesting in massive monster mode of course. I think if I were Bradly I might have been upset my animated alter ego was made out to be a slow towering numbskull. Using Danny Devito as the chief alien badguy was a smart move, again his character wasn't overly intriguing and kinda standard in design but it worked.<br/><br/>The actual basketball game is good fun even though you'd think it wouldn't be. Its certainly looney, has some slick moments, a nice 'Pulp Fiction' homage, the gag about Michael's special drink is cute, its fun watching the lofty NBA Stars trying to act and Bill Murray adds some much needed fizz for adults. You know what happens in the end, its no surprise, luckily it is a good ride getting there. Definitely an unexpected hit straight outta left field.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

Instead, I'll echo what some other commentators have said about Bugs needing help to defeat a bunch of stupid-looking aliens. Bugs needing help? The Bugs Bunny who once single-handedly defeated the large, brutish baseball team, the Gashouse Gorillas [Baseball Bugs - 1946], needing help? The Bugs who once went psycho and sawed Florida loose from the USA, among other disasters[Rebel Rabbit - 1949]; needing help?? The Bugs who once trampled a huge, murderous black bull [Bully for Bugs - 1953] (who makes an appearance in this film in one of the film's few pleasant surprises). That Bugs? Needing help??? Uh...no, I think NOT. The ""character"" in this film bears little resemblance to the real thing.

","`Space Jam' is an impressive and genuinely humorous movie with the Loony Toon characters and actors all on top form. The plot is an attractive one and the overall effect is a generally agreeable one. While the animated scenes are more superior to the plain live-action ones, both are equally enjoyable. <br/><br/>But the film is best when it mixes these styles as it transports Michael Jordan into the Loony Toon world. It's real candy for the eyes and makes the movie a visual treat. This blend has proved to be hit (Song of the South, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) and miss (The Pagemaster) in the past, but `Space Jam' is one of the better ones. <br/><br/>The main star of the film is Basketball star, Michael Jordan. He isn't a professional actor but all of his in-experience and flaws go by relatively un-noticed. But Theresa Randle, the weasly Wayne Knight and the always-reliable Bill Murray ably support him. The Loony Toon characters are all on top-form aswell. I don't think the antics of the likes of Bugs Bunny, Taz, Sylvester, Tweedy, Foghorn Leghorn, Daffy and the rest of the gang will ever get old. Newcomer, Lola Bunny is a very welcome addition to the group aswell. The enemies of the movie are all equally likeable as the basketball rivals. <br/><br/>The only flaw the film has is the R. Kelly theme song. It seems inappropriate to say the least, even if it is memorable. The basketball game conclusion is very imaginative and there are even great puns on `Pulp Fiction' and `Ghostbusters' in it. It brings the film to satisfying and appropriate conclusion. <br/><br/>There's witty dialogue, stunning visuals, likeable characters, a great title and plenty else to keep you entertained. `Space Jam' hits a lot more times than it misses and is the best animation/reality crossover film in a long time. I give it 7.3/10."
