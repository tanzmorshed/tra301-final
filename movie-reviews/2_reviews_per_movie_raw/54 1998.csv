"mattymatt4ever","7","48","58","7 January 2002"," This is a good movie! What was the problem?
","Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>
Of course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, ""Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!"" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song ""Knock on Wood"" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>
My score:  7 (out of 10)"
"iliawarlock","Null","35","43","26 January 2001"," Surprisingly well done.
","One does not usually expect a popular movie to be much good, namely because it caters to the tastes of a crowd, which are notoriously un-demanding. Rarely, however, one finds a film which delivers on its promises.  This, fortunately, was one of these films. The acting was the high point of the film.  Mike Myers wore his role like a skin, naturally and easily.  Ryan Phillippe proved that despite occasional bursts of negative popular opinion he is more than a simple dime-a-dozen pretty boy, and possesses both skill and talent, both of which are put to good use.  (And he is good looking, which despite all else, never hurts. But, let's not belabor the obvious).  The filming was excellently done, with a good eye towards shock and an occasional shot of strangely unexpected beauty. The only real objection one could put to this film is that it was far too short.  Several sub-plots came up which were either abandoned or underdeveloped, and the ending, while highly effective, had a slight air of ""deus ex machina"" about it.  On the whole, though, a talented, unusually intelligent film with excellent actors and direction.  Well worth watching."

","While the acting is pretty dull in this movie, Mike Myers proved that he can handle serious drama. Shortly after this movie came out, it was rumored that Mike Myers would receive an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for playing the Studio 54 owner. I would have strongly agreed with this nomination, and I only recommend 54 to anyone curious about the serious side of Mike Myers."
"The Masticator","Null","7","7","18 July 2000"," A ""wasted"" opportunity (ho ho)
","[Pssst! Hey you! Watch out! Some feisty little spoilers in the fourth paragraph.]<br/><br/>The dangers of making a film about a club... even documentaries can't really get over what it's like to ""be there"". Mark Christopher's film is over-ambitious from the word go, which is probably why he chooses a sweet suburban kid as his protagonist, to make the film more personal, more real. But mass drug-taking, promiscuity, disco and mindless hedonism don't make, it has to be said, for an intimate cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The story of the rise and fall of New York's Studio 54 told through the eyes of aspirational Jerseyite Shane (Ryan Phillippe) is an interesting one, but the film ultimately fails because it fails to focus on the right stories. Shane is not especially dynamic or even sympathetic, and it's frustrating as we watch things happen to him rather than just seeing them happen. Christopher's mistake is failing to realise that the two main characters of ""54"" are Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) and the club itself, and he does not invest enough enthusiasm or affection or indeed screen time in either of them. While Anita (Salma Hayek) and Greg's (Breckin Meyer) romance is sweet and endlessly endearing, it only serves to detract further from what you feel was *really* going on at the time - that mindless hedonism I mentioned before.<br/><br/>Phillippe looks perfect as Shane - you can certainly understand Rubell being smitten with him. However, his petulant attitude and monotonous delivery, useful in some roles (see ""Playing By Heart""), don't make for 85 minutes of great entertainment here. Hayek is surprisingly good and Myers is absolutely stunning as Rubell, a role he clearly threw his heart into, but a dismally wan Neve Campbell undermines them all, contriving to make a dull underwritten role as a soap star even duller. Shane's relationship with her feels utterly false and forced, as does his friendship with Greg - there must have been at least half an hour more of this movie that had some actual character development in it.<br/><br/>It's hard to escape the feeling that this film, while attempting to get across the high times and wild nights of Studio 54, has actually sanitised the club by turning it into a mere backdrop for a minor human drama which utilises countless Hollywood clich√©s (an old lady befriends Shane, then dies! Shane clicks with the TV star when they find they have a similar Jersey background! Shane covers for his friend's indiscretions! Plucky Anita makes it as a singer!). The trouble is, we don't care about the story and by the end we don't care much about the club either. Those who were there in 1979 will no doubt be shaking their heads at the film's representation of ""their"" club, while those who were, say, living in England and three years old at the time (me) will wonder what all the fuss was about. Until... the snapshots of REAL glamorous people at 54 that appear over the end credits (Minelli, Stallone, Travolta when he was obscenely hip the first time around, et al) actually give more a flavour of 54 than the whole of ""54"".<br/><br/>A shame, and a waste. As I say, I expect there was more footage, but it would probably have been of the wrong things. As it is, ""54"" is mercifully short. This movie marks Mike Myers' coming of age as a character actor, but little else."
"Brian Blueskye","Null","14","16","16 September 1999"," Great movie
","It's unknown to me why this movie got such a bad review from critics. There are alot of factual errors about the club, yes. But this seemed to be a great movie. Mike Myers was an excellent pick for Steve Rubell, he had the same personality as Rubell in the movie. <br/><br/>Another thing is the story is so interesting about Studio 54, it was a fad, hip, and unusual place for it's time. Not only that, the story of the controversial club is one that really is unknown to some.<br/><br/>
The story might not be dead on accurate, and some of the characters might be factual, and there could be alot of mistakes in the movie, but it's still a great one to watch when you get past it. <br/><br/>I would suggest watching VH-1's Behind The Music on Studio 54 first before seeing the movie, for a clear understanding on the club. That way you don't get freaked out."
"Jodie-4","Null","24","30","23 February 1999"," Not too shabby
","This is, by no means, going on my 1998 Top Ten list, but I'm willing to cut it some slack. I thought it told the story quite well, and captured the rise and fall of Studio 54 wonderfully. The performances were all good,  but it's Mike Myers that impressed the hell out of me. In this film he proved himself to be an actor, and a damn good one. Although I anxiously await the new Austin Powers flick, I hope that Myers keeps taking roles that force him to stretch his limits."
"Wills","9","17","21","11 January 1999"," One Big Party Until You Come Down From The High
","Studio 54 was a swift, colourful flick that showed us the true ins and outs of the seventies.  The only difference is that the writers remembered the seventies .. thus, they obviously didn't really live the seventies atmosphere to its fullest. Mr Ryan Phillippe, in my opinion, took on an enormous task in performing this role ... I mean who else could you get to wear tight clothing, push pills, make drinks, take sexual harassment from a male employer, and still look pretty?  Ms Campbell' purpose in this movie showed young girls that you can get somewhere with talent and not just looks.  Basically, the script was compelling, the acting was sought as half way and ended up getting three quarters ... so overall I say that this isn't that bad of a flick if you are looking for something out of the everyday norm.  I gave this movie a rating of a ""9"" because it is a personal favourite of mine, and the casting was one of the best combos, for my taste in movies.  - David Wills christian 11/01/99"
"lee_eisenberg","10","34","48","7 March 2006"," And did what corporations always do...
","When ""54"" got released, many critics claimed that it was just another attempt to get into the '70s nostalgia that had swept the country. It's more than that. The movie shows New York's Studio 54, an unusual club where young people danced to disco and could meet celebrities, as seen through the eyes of employee Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe). At the end, he talks about, how after the government closed the place down, a corporation took it over and did what corporations always do: make the place safe and sterile. Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) built it up into a most unique hangout, and the corporation drained the life out of it.<br/><br/>So don't trust the critics. This was a really good movie."
"MatthewInSydney","7","7","8","12 June 2015"," Director's Cut review - an originally disappointing film reborn into something worthwhile
","The studio executives who ruined the first release version of this film in 1998 have a lot to answer for, but the director has had the last word and proved he was right all along, with the new Director's Cut (which I saw at the Sydney Film Festival tonight), which is an ENTIRELY different and improved experience. From now on, I don't think there should be any reason for anyone to watch the original release version again, the improvement is that dramatic. The one aspect that may irritate some viewers is that a few of the 'new' scenes have slightly lower image & sound quality than the rest of the film, as they obviously weren't able to find perfect quality footage for every restored scene, and the editing between some scenes doesn't always feel entirely smooth. And some weaknesses in the film still remain - such as Ryan Philippe, who is a bit limp despite being more than pretty enough for the role. But in so many other ways this is a far far better film, taking a film I'd only have rated maybe a 4 in the past, to at least a 7 now. About 40% of the film feels entirely changed, all for the better. There's a lot more life to the nights at the club, now that they've been able to put back the sex & drugs the studio removed (no movie about 1980-era disco makes any sense once you remove them). The parties are wild and bisexual and very disco. And the whole direction of the drama has been altered, now that the dull studio-imposed romance with Neve Campbell has been removed. Neve is still there in a small role, but the film now focuses on Ryan's love triangle with Salma Hayek & Breckin Meyer instead, which is far more interesting. Everyone who worked on the film should be happy with the Director's Cut, which proves they were making something pretty decent (until the studio stuffed it up)."
"oshram-3","4","14","19","9 October 2006"," Tepid approach to interesting subject matter
","If you hit your teens in the 70s, as I did, you probably remember the stories about Studio 54 whether or not you liked disco. An exclusive club, it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self-absorption; there's even an excellent VH1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday, and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film.<br/><br/>Sadly, this isn't it. 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees, a bartender named Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a busboy named Greg (Breckin Meyer), his wife, a coat-check girl, Anita (Selma Hayek), and of course the master of ceremonies himself, Steve Rubell (Mike Meyers). While the goings-on at the club are well represented, this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers, following Shane's story the closest.<br/><br/>The movie works in spurts. Sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture (such as when Shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn't know who 'Errol Flynt' is), and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama. Some of that is inherent in the premise ¬ñ following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous ¬ñ but a lot of it is due to the kid-gloved treatment with which both the club and Rubell are given throughout the movie. While Rubell certainly electrified the scene in New York with his penchant for over-the-top spectacle and his exclusive hand-picking of the crowds each night, the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on; and Rubell himself, while his excesses are mentioned, come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar, a cheat, a drug abuser, and promiscuous as all hell. Not that I was looking for the man to be pilloried here, but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate. A final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd.<br/><br/>Meyers does his best to capture Rubell, but he's given so little to work with here it's surprising his performance is effective; but he's good, and he helps to anchor the film. Philippe, whom I find generally to be a good actor, is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character; he's limited to a deer-in-the-headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown, and even he can't translate that into a strong performance. Hayek and Meyer are both okay, again, undercut by the writing, and Neve Campbell ¬ñ prominently featured on the DVD cover ¬ñ appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo.<br/><br/>For some reason I still find myself interested, even fascinated, by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies. But even given that, this is not a film that particularly engaged me, despite a predisposition to like it. I'd say if that era, or that club, has any interest for you, track down the VH1 special rather than this middle-of-the-road melodrama."
"moonspinner55","5","4","4","12 February 2012"," Superficial and awkward, but with a pleasurable, hedonistic nostalgia...
","Writer-director Mark Christopher worked hard at recreating the sinfully decadent magic of Manhattan's Studio 54, the number-one celebrity hangout from the late-1970s into the 1980s, but he skimped on the most intriguing part of the nightclub's history: the relationship between business partners Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager. Mike Myers was a terrific choice for the flamboyant, eccentric Rubell, but Schrager has gone missing. Instead, the story is told from the point-of-view of a busboy-turned-bartender (!), a muscular rube whose innocence is soiled by boss Rubell's dirty business dealings and hedonistic trappings. The film has a low-budget feel which doesn't make itself present in the production so much as in the character-driven scenes, which are underpopulated, padded with real and faked black-and-photos, and further undermined by stilted dialogue. Ryan Phillipe is well-cast as the young stud from New Jersey whom Rubell takes under his wing, yet his voice-over narration is uncomfortably omnipresent, telling us things we can see or perceive for ourselves, and the interrelationships between the club staff are uninteresting. Some of the music is good, bringing back those long-ago nights of carefree sex and dancing-the-night-away, but Christopher doesn't grasp the big picture. As a result, the film (at best) is a series of precious little moments struggling to surface. ** from ****"
"budmassey","9","20","29","17 May 2001"," Brilliant, tragic, and most of all, fabulous.
","Studio 54 was the center of a universe that revolved around sex, drugs, and a pantheon of ephemeral pop culture gods who presided over a world of decadence and music.  Long before the neanderthal ""disco sucks"" mob convinced the world to stop dancing, every possible indulgence was explored, and then surpassed, in clubs like this one across the country. Well, if there had been clubs like this, but there was only one 54.<br/><br/>The story mirrors the lunatic time warp within great dance clubs.  There was a cast of characters, you kind of knew them, and you knew some of the details of their lives outside the club, but make no mistake, the real world took place under the seductive lights, and everything else was just backstage preparation.<br/><br/>You might say that the myriad subplots that ran through 54 were not adequately explored by the movie, but that would be naive.  Nobody at the club really knew Warhol, Jagger, Grace Kelly, Capote, or any of the luminaries, famous or not, who inhabited the club like ghosts.  We drank from their lives from dusk till dawn and hibernated in the so-called real world until the stars came out at night.<br/><br/>Mike Meyers is beyond fabulous as the complex and tragic Steve Rubell.  If Ryan Phillippe is no Oscar winner, you might recall that the real busboys weren't usually National Merit Scholars either.  They were beautiful, and that was all that mattered.<br/><br/>The giddy yet tragic abandon of the Disco Days has never been captured so perfectly.  Everyone knew it couldn't last, but we all stuck it out to see who could make it till last call.  An era as beautiful and optimistic as the hippies and flower children of the 1960's drowned under the weight of the resentment of those who couldn't make it past the velvet rope.<br/><br/>This movie is the absolute best of its genre, and unflinchingly reveals the darkness that lay under the glittering veneer of 54.  If you weren't there, you won't understand.  If you were, there is no better way to remember. Brilliant, tragic, and most of all, fabulous."

Actually, aside from some great music from the period, the viewer doesn't get much of a feel for the late 70's. And frankly, it's a bit hard to because of the VERY 90's faces in the film. It would be okay if some of them could actually act...<br/><br/>The only thing this film has going for it, besides the music, is a stellar, surprising performance from Mike Myers as Steve Rubell. The filmmakers blew their chance with this movie...the REAL story of Studio 54 with Mike Myers in the lead role would have made a phenomenal movie.

","Elite nightclubs are all about hedonism and the power of the young, rich, and beautiful; places where a rigid hierarchy holds sway, albeit an alternative one. One may understand why those in the in-crowd may enjoy such places; but to suggest that they symbolise ""freedom"" is a rather strange interpretation. But every Hollywood film has to pay homage to this virtue, however still defined, and so '54', Mark Christopher's film about a once-fashionable New York venue, tries to suggest there was something idealistic about the place, in spite of the fact there seem few ideals on view. To strengthen this rather weak idea, his script casts lead actor Ryan Phillipe as a young Adonis, who is far too sweet to serve as a useful vehicle into the dark side of this underworld; but he tells us there was something mystical about the place, and as the audience, we're expected to believe him, although all we see are a lot of dancing, drug-taking, and sex. Which might not be unbelievable, but is hardly unique. Meanwhile, the film's plot goes nowhere and even seems to bottle out of it's own natural climax. The real Studio 54 might indeed have been where it was all happening; but this gentle homage is really very bland."

","54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era. It features the classic good-looking bartender. The sexy females. The high powered owner. The partying. When all entwined together chaos ensues, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be at the brunt of it all.<br/><br/>I'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible, whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments (like, it's an 'ok' film). I really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it's dire cast. Every time I sit down to watch a film casting Salma Hayek, I am always awaiting to see her beauty, radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance, but, reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is. I mean, really, what has she ever bequeathed the masses with, other than her immense table dance in 'From Dusk Till Dawn'...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as 'acting'. Mike Myers, isn't quite as bad as these 2, he does at least give the Film something worthy. Playing the seedy, extroverted co-founder of the 54 Club. The type that the majority watching would hate (i.e. job well done), he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick. But alas, it is not enough to rescue the film from it's baseless and flat nothingness. Most 'bad' bad films I find something to take from the film, but this has nothing to it, really. Neve Campbell isn't too bad, but she is just 'there'. The storyline is dull, it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else. Any meaning. Any class. Anything at all. Because like most ornaments, they are just hollow pointless objects, that are merely pretty to look at, much akin to the basis of this disastrous film.<br/><br/>Genuinely an hour and a half of time I could have spent better doing something much more exciting, like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather."

They showed the movie to a bunch of shallow preview audiences who shy away from characters who are good AND bad, instead of one or the other, and made Christopher do extensive reshoots.

","Great Major Character: Mike Myers, So-so Supporting Characters.<br/><br/>Yet, the writers and directors of this disappointing movie have unfortunately been smoking- I think it rhymes with ""coyote."" But anyway, with much better and higher paid supporting characters, better writers and directors, ""54"" could have been more interesting. It should've been more of a historical docudrama (Like: Summer of Sam), than a historical entertainment drama (Like: Boogie Nights). I think people would've taken this movie more seriously, if it didn't try so hard to be Boogie Nights, but be rather like ""Summer of Sam.""<br/><br/>Also, when Neve Campbell made her cameo in this box office bomb, that's when the movie tasted sour, smelled horribly, and started to attract flies. She completely ruined the whole movie with her role, and instantly sent ""54"" to you know where!!!<br/><br/>Plus, this movie's timeline, STANK!!! According to VH-1, Studio 54 was CLOSED on New Year's Eve 1979, and Steve Rubell didn't get arrested until February 1980. The disco did not close temporarily until November 1979. The movie should've been set in 1978, rather than 1979, in order for this motion picture to make sense.<br/><br/>A Disappointing: *1/2(1 1/2 stars)"

For me, at least, there was no reason to like any of the other main players, and so the film dragged quite frequently.  This isn't a complete disaster, since it does have the occasional entertaining scene and some decent performances, but in general, it's predictable and uninspired.

","I was perplexed as to why this film had such a bad rating and then I read some of the below 5 star reviews - and they are so pretentious and long winded. So that makes sense, people took this film so seriously they had to write 6 paragraphs about it for some reason.<br/><br/>This film is sexy, dirty and questions sexual labels. The characters are young, high and utterly confused. They're trapped in a toxic environment because of the money they're making and they're slowly self imploding and grabbing at eachother. If you've ever worked in this industry in your 20's - you'd get it. Then add in unlimited drugs, this type of money, and exclusivity and you have an intense demolition in the making. Studio 54 was an even crazier time than any club to exist after, so I can only imagine.<br/><br/>I've definitely known almost every type of character in this movie and although it's filmed in a very 90's way, it is still deserving of a 7+ rating."

","A look down the cast list of Mark Christopher's ""54"" might provide a few surprises. Yes, before he decided he wanted to be the King of the World Donald Trump turned up as a patron as did Michael York, Sheryl Crow, Cindy Crawford, Heidi Klum, Art Garfunkel and Peter Bogdanovitch but I wouldn't waste my time trying to pick them out of the darkness. The film is a 'biography' of New York's famous Studio 54 as seen through the eyes of hot young busboy Ryan Phillippe, (he spends most of the film with his shirt off). Michael Myers is Steve Rubell, the club's manager and the cast also includes Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse's"" Dawn Wiener herself, Heather Matarazzo. It's not much of a movie; it's mostly like a sex obsessed music video but the music's great which makes up for a lot and it does capture the hedonistic, drug-fuelled atmosphere of the place while Myers is surprisingly good, Still, maybe you would be better off buying the double cd instead."

","Okay, most people wouldn't admit it, but I will. I only watched this movie for the graphic sex and nudity. Based on the trailer, I was expecting a giant orgy, filled with drugs and dance music, but to my surprise, 54 actually turned out to be a docudrama about Club 54, as seen through the eyes of a young waiter/bar tender/dancer. The film features the shady practices of the owner, the drug trade inside, the celebrity guests, and of course the eccentric regulars, in what turns out to be one hell of an entertaining film (...and the sex and nudity don't hurt either). Ryan Phillippe stars in a role that today I could never see him taking, but back in his younger days, he really excelled in. The way he was able to demonstrate how the exposure to a place like that can change a person, was truly remarkable. He literally went from nothing to a face that was known all over the city, simply because he was a waiter at 54. It went to his head and changed the whole dynamic of his life and relationship with his family. For as good as he was though, Mike Myers was the real star of the film, portraying famed owner Steve Rubell. Rubell's life was just one big party and he never slowed down or cared about what he was doing or saying publicly, and we all know how that turned out in the long run. Myers is one of those actors who is out of this world when he's cast in the right role, and terrible when he's not, but much as the case with Austin Powers, this role fit him like a glove. On the surface, 54 is a wild, raunchy film that is going to offend a lot of people, I don't suggest watching it with your grandparents. It does however, tell a very relevant and historically accurate story of the drug and youth culture of the mid-late 1970s in the big cities. 54 is sexy, entertaining, and informative, a mix that you don't often see on the big screen."

","54 (1998): Dir: Mark Christopher / Cast: Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike Myers, Breckin Meyer: Dazzling film remembering Club 54 as the place to be. Set in 1979 with Ryan Phillippe venturing to Club 54 upon seeing a photo of soap star Neve Campbell in a newspaper. Club owner Mike Myers hires him as a bartender. The club demands a distinct appearance and upon removing his shirt, Phillippe is granted entry while his friends remain outside. Other key roles belong to Selma Hayek as a dancer whose bus boy husband steals money from the club. Campbell surfaces as a woman who hates her job and uses the club to escape the spotlight but her footage is almost unnecessary since it more or less disjoints the screenplay. Director Mark Christopher films it as an event with spectacular art direction. Mike Myers delivers the film's best performance as the corrupt club owner trying to avoid the I.R.S. He has both charm as well a loathing appeal where he can use employees at any means. Breckin Meyer plays Hayek's husband who is the real culprit when dirty deeds are passed. In the end it will all catch up with him as his empire crumbles. During the final credits we are given a glimpse of real celebrities that appeared in the club and represented its happening. It is a film about time and what occurs within it or how it stood still during club hours. Score: 9 / 10"
"bkoganbing","7","1","1","5 February 2014"," Playground of the elite
","Once upon a time in the not too distant past a man named Steve Rubell who to look at in this film and in real life was not all that much decided to create a playground where only the elite could participate. Two criteria decided who was among the elite, power and beauty. Rubell courted the powerful and selected only the beautiful. He created Studio 54 on West 54 Street in Manhattan and people would beg to be admitted. I was actually in the place once, not on charm, beauty, or personality mind you, but for a political fundraiser when it was rented out.<br/><br/>One who got in on sheer beauty in this film was New Jersey kid Ryan Phillippe and it is through his eyes that the story of 54 unfolds. And we see Mike Myers as Steve Rubell who reveled in the company of the powerful and beautiful, indulged in all the vices, and stole from his own business like the wise guys in Goodfellas used to rob the cargo shipments at JFK Airport like it was an ATM. Missing from the story is his partner Ian Schrager, still very much with us, still very much a power player. It's for that reason he is missing, but it renders 54 inaccurate from the start.<br/><br/>Phillippe has no problem using his looks and body to get all the sex he wants and to advance himself and establish. It's the main lesson he learns from Myers. What he sees as an ultimate goal in life, is something in the end he rejects.<br/><br/>Myers is fascinating and repellent at the same time. You've got to wonder why people would curry favors from this man, but in point of fact it happened. You know where he's headed and 54 makes you want to see him fall, at the same time you wish you could be part of the 54 scene.<br/><br/>Selma Hayek and Breckin Mayer play a couple who work at 54, a married couple who take Phillippe in. The hedonist atmosphere puts a strain on their marriage like few others are tested. Also Neve Campbell, a soap actress who is from New Jersey like Phillippe is also an ambitious woman who teaches Phillippe a thing or two. They all register well.<br/><br/>In the end though 54 is in the joint custody of both Ryan Phillippe and Mike Myers. This was Phillippe's breakthrough part and Myers is not in this role a part of Wayne's World or Austin Powers. No this is the story of a self indulgent man who had a heady ride and a tremendous fall."
"sraweber369","6","1","1","25 March 2011"," 54 A look back
","54 is the story of the famed New York night club by the same name. The movie was OK at best. The main problem is that the characters do not live up to the excitement of the famed club.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Shane (Ryan Phillipee) WHO is a Jersey boy and lands a job at the club. He is soon promoted by Steve (Mike Meyers). I have a problem with this for what boss promotes someone to bar tender with no previous experience. Well Steve is skimming money from the till to hide it from it from the IRS. In the mean time Anita who works in the coat check (Selma Hyak) is aspiring to be a singer.<br/><br/>While Meyers gives a very good understated performance as Steve the rest of the characters are only marginally interesting. So the movie just kind of winds down to the eventual conclusion. Making this a rather forgetful movie experience."
"ptb-8","7","1","1","11 July 2010"," the last days of disco
","If you have a great home sound system and a big plasma TV then 54 can be a spectacular home experience. Unlike the real thing. STUDIO 54 as a disco scene is legendary but lemme tell ya, in Sydney in 1988-1994 we had the gigantic real thing: massive and spectacular dance parties (no NOT raves) but massive disco nights in a place that held 5000 people and staged Busby Berkeley sized massive dance entertainment. See any Kylie Minogue concert today to get a sense of we had for free at the time! They were called RAT parties and BACCHANALIA events. Often our own big disco clubs competed and it was massive and musical and a throb of wild night fun unlike anything I have seen in any movie anywhere. STUDIO 54 as a small movie version of what we know as gigantic and real in our own Australian lives and makes us look like Hollywood epic disco. What is in this film is quite puny and tacky compared to the real thing here. I thought the film was a good but could have been great disco drama. There has always been a call for a great BIG disco film or a dance party spectacular and Saturday NIGHT FEVER and 54 and even parts of WEST SIDE STORY about as close as we will get I guess. Ryan Phillippe is cute and Adonis and well cast as the pretty chipmunk bar boy, Brecken Myer believable in their NY suburban angst.... as is all the cast esp the girls Selma Hyack and gorgeous Neve Campbell...however the dialog at the end of the film where they reconcile is truly lame and lets the film down. I real life these characters would both end up as prostitutes. But it is Mike Myer pulling off another creepy performance (see CAT IN THE HAT for the other) that is the core of the film. Studio 54 as depicted in this almost-there setting looks like a stinky old cinema with nut-case clients and ghastly B grade celebrities. (Do The Time Warp, anyone?)<br/><br/>I am glad I wasn't there for real as what happened here was real and astonishing. I hear there is a very sleazy and sexually explicit directors cut of 54 and that would be more to the mark as this is an almost-Disney version of what we can see had greater depths of nude depravity... all to a pulsating disco beat!"

","At first I thought that we were in for a variation on ""Boogie Nights"" without the porn angle.  I was right.  However, I didn't feel as if the film knew quite where to go.<br/><br/>Was it a look back?  A tribute?  A documentary?  Sadly, I didn't find myself feeling anything for these characters.  And considering the fairly short running time of ""54"" (approx. 1:35),  we weren't given a real chance to learn about all 4 main figures other than the fact that they were all outsiders just trying to fit in.  But, on reflection, maybe that was the point.<br/><br/>The one thought that I had leaving the theater was this, ""Mike Myers has taken his talent to the next level.  Period.  He made me forget his years on SNL and thw Wayne's World flicks.  Myers portrayal of Steve Rubell was, in a word, inspired.  And a little disturbing at the same time.

","Give me my 90 minutes back! You know a movie is bad with you're more interested in whether or not you should go get another soda than the characters. To be fair I missed the first ten minutes or so and might have missed out on some earth shattering subtext somewhere but I don't think so. Nothing happens in this movie! I saw a ""Biography"" on A&E that had wilder club scenes, more celebrities and a more poignant plot. Are we supposed to be impressed with the back of Andy Warhol's head. Give me a break! To be fair the movie did have a few good scenes. And I love Heather Matazzarro, even though she is wasted here. In fact there were quite a few things a found to like but every time something else would rear its ugly head. For example Mike Myers, who I read in reviews had totally transformed himself into the Steve character, has a tendency to open his mouth and grin like he's doing a Saturday Night live skit. You want to smack him. This is one of those movies that just meanders toward an anticlimactic close. For example the movie goes out of its way to show characters abusing drugs, but never shows any ill effects from them, except for the old lady who drops dead of course. Shane 54 seems to effortlesly kick all of the habits that the movie shows him developing by the end. And the raid on the club at the end, it's almost an afterthought, even though it contains Myers best line. As they stick him in the police car, ""This is so tacky."" My advice, stay away. It'll be out on video real, real soon."

I mean, he looks good and does his best but it would have been much more thrilling if they would have done something like ""The Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager Story"" ( because after jail they also opened the legendary ""Palladium"" club in N.Y.)and show their point of view or ""The Andy Warhol Diaries"" which describe the decadence of the 70¬¥s and 80¬¥s explicitly.

","As you can see from my summary, I think this movie is pure hell.<br/><br/>Perhaps author/director Mark Christopher might have made a decent movie had he been allowed to stick to his original ideas.  However, considering how contrived and threadbare the whole script as we see in the movie, I doubt this could have been anything close to a great movie.<br/><br/>The director seems to have assembled the worst cast possible, or at least made sure that most of them gave their worst performance possible.  Ryan Phillipe proved in this movie that he is nothing more than something nice to look at.  If your idea of a great actor is one who looks great in tight jeans or short shorts and a tight tank top (not that using acting ability would ever matter), he's perfect in the role.  <br/><br/>His character is not a loveable one, but Phillipe doesn't even make us regard him in any matter.  He does not develop his character's thoughts or emotions.  He could have been a villian or some cocky bas**rd whom the audience loves to hate.  Yes, Phillipe was limited by a poor script, but I can't say he has ever excelled as an actor in any movie.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell was also extremely dissappointing in her performance, in her battle with Phillipe for who could be the worst actor in the film.  Her performance is also uninvolved and bland.  She was better in the ""Scream"" movies and even ""Wild Things.""  She failed to show us why Phillipe's character would even possibly be infatuated with her.<br/><br/>For the most part, the rest of the cast was also terrible.  Salma Hayek proved why I don't like her acting once again, and the stoner from ""Clueless"" was also rather bland.<br/><br/>The ""dirty old lady"" bit is becoming too much of a bad Hollywood cliche these days.  I liked Ellen Dow's character the first time I saw it--in ""The Wedding Singer.""<br/><br/>One great thing about ""54"" was Mike Myers' brilliant performance.  He really threw himself into the role, and proved that he, as a true actor, might be more gifted than we have previously given him credit.  He used the terrible script to his advantage, using the contrived, false dialogue to show the pathetic nature of his character.  I only hope that Peter Weir will cast him in a movie and do for him what he did for Robin Williams (Dead Poets Society) or Jim Carrey (The Truman Show).<br/><br/>Perhaps if Mr. Christopher had the type of controll that Orson Welles had over ""Citizen Kane,"" he might have had a decent movie.  But to even mention the two in the same sentence seems sacrilege."

","From what I understand, Studio 54 was a place of excitement, sex, music, drugs, money, crime, celebrity, and high energy.  Amazingly, this movie misses EVERY ONE of those things.  Sure, there's some sex and drugs, but it's extremely tame.  The energy of this film is completely nonexistent - as is the humor and the sleaze.  Imagine if a good director told this tale (like Martin Scorsese or someone)!  There's a killer movie here.  Also let me say that Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek are NOT a believable couple, in no way imaginable.  I gave it a 3, but only because Neve Campbell is beautiful, Salma Hayek is sexy, and Sela Ward is hot.  I added a point because Mike Meyers rules.  It's kind of nice not seeing him be so happily goofy as in Austin Powers or Waynes World."

","Disco.  Many people hated it, many loved it.  54 told the story of the infamous New York nightclub, Studio 54.  The stars hobnobbed, danced, drank, and even snorted there.<br/><br/>I liked 54.  Very simple.  The atmosphere of the film, the decade of the Seventies, always provides for some interesting plotlines.  Ryan Phillippe played a young kid trying to make something of his otherwise dull life in Jersey.  His style was convincing, yet he had this annoying habit of 'mugging' for the camera as if to say 'see how attractive I am'.  Neve Campbell unfortunately didn't shine in her role as the soapstar boosting her career.  She also overused her facial expressions, the ones she helped to sell 'Scream' with.<br/><br/>Mike Myers, I say with a huge breathtaking sigh.  His performance as club owner and continuously high schmoozer Steve Rubell was incredible.  He showed depth and brought light to an otherwise pathetic character.  It's quite a shame that the other talent in this film couldn't have backed him up.<br/><br/>54.  Just like the club itself has closed, so has this review.  I give it a 'hustle-ing' THUMBS UP!"

","Admittedly, I rented this movie to get a glimpse of Neve Campbell and Selma Hayek doing their stuff, and of course, I was disappointed.  While interesting from a sociological standpoint, this movie never really seemed to get going.  The narration that helped so much at the beginning mysteriously disappeared, and the only sense of closure was the death at the end.  This movie was pure eye candy, and not much of that.  I would have to agree also, with the other critics, that Neve Campbell is lucky if she didn't do her career a major disservice with this part.  She was stiff, which is partly due to the writing, but I saw nothing more than ""Party of Five"" with a somewhat better cast (although I'm not sure).  Enjoy the music  and the dance, because there ain't much more to this movie."

","At a glance, this looked like it would be a pretty good film.  Then I started watching it.  Totally forgettable characters (except Myers), along with an unoriginal and tedious plot, combine to form a movie that tries to be Boogie Nights, but fails.  There are a few brief bright moments in the film (like a drug-addicted grandmother cutting it loose), but these hardly redeem the movie's shortcomings.

What I was a little disappointed about was the fact that they didn't really have a lot of the celebrities that went to Studio 54 back then such as Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Halston, Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Cher, just to name a few.  And where is the other owner of Studio 54, Ian Schweggar (or however you spell his name)?  The movie I guess you could say highlighted the lives of the more common people rather than the big stars and icons who were at 54 every night during the late 1970's.  My cousin, Jimmy, went to Studio 54 back in the late 1970's when he was a teenager.  I think he was the same age as Shane during that period.<br/><br/>Yet I give this film a lot of credit.  It was very glamorous, very exciting to watch, and above all, it was so much fun to watch!  Ryan Phillepe is a great actor, very talented, and he is soooo cute!  Reese Witherspoon is a lucky girl!

It tells the story of a Shane who lives at the other side of NY and who is picked up by the boss, who makes him a bartender. He soon sees what has to be done to make it (gaysex included) but he forgets his poor origin and climbs up to the ladder of stardom. ""54"" is a perfect movie for anyone who seek decadence with a discosoundtrack and for those who are at the end of their 30's, they all know the party's definitely over and fun never sounded so good.

He spends most of it shirtless, and there really is no finer representation of young manhood. While Phillippe has gone on to demonstrate his acting ability in other films, we will never forget his perfect physique in this trendy film. <br/><br/>The movie was never intended to be any better than the era and music it represents, but Ryan would be a treat at any time - at that age - if he removed his shirt.

"EW-3","Null","2","4","27 May 2001"," Liked it mostly because it is an accurate depiction.
","I agree, the story was a little weak, and some of the acting, although Mike Myers did a very nice job. But the movie does capture the era to a large extent, as well as the hallowed halls of the famous danceteria itself. How can I say this? Because, unlike most of those trashing this movie, I was actually there during its heyday (1978), and I can tell you that Mark Christopher DID in fact capture a lot of the details about the club.<br/><br/>Yes, they really did prevent ""ordinary"" people from entering, in just as condescending a fashion as depicted in this film, if not worse. Yes, your chances of gaining entry wearing a polyester shirt were near zero, no matter how empty the place might have been at the moment. Yes, the velvet ropes were controlled by 'Peter Perfect' doormen, who thwarted all sorts of tricks used to gain admission, such as calling out their names like they knew them, saying they were there before (somehow, the doormen remembered everyone, and that tactic rarely worked), riding up in rented limos and having the driver go up and announce ""Mr. So-and-So is here"" (that didn't work, either), or stripping off their clothes in the middle of the street (females). Yes, many did stay outside the club until 5 or 6 a.m., just to glimpse the beautiful people leaving. Yes, there really was a bag lady who was regularly admitted. Yes, there really was a crescent moon sniffing a coke spoon that descended upon the dance floor. Yes, there really was a balcony converted into a not-so-private area for more ""intimate"" encounters, of all varieties. The film didn't make up very much. It reported history, and pretty accurately, so far as I'm concerned. Don't like the decadence? Sorry, but that was the reality about this place. <br/><br/>Admittedly, I'm a bit partial to this film because the main character (Shane) looked something like me in those days - early twenties, blonde wavy hair, blue-eyed - and like me, was a Jersey kid who decided to take a trip across the river to the better places in Manhattan. Even that aspect was accurate, as there were probably many like Shane. <br/><br/>But unlike Shane, I never worked at Studio, and I never got too caught up its ""lifestyle"". And I'm quite grateful for the latter, for as I watched this film, I began to wonder about how many of the dancing hedonists I was acquainted with in those days were ultimately defeated by their own lifestyles, and like Steve Rubell, are now bopping in that great disco in the sky, if you get my meaning. For example, the friend who got me entry into Studio 54 - a person who was among the club's most loyal patrons - met an untimely end some years ago at the age of 37, due to hepatitis and AIDS. Back in the 70s, he once told me that he wanted his ashes scattered on Studio 54's dance floor after he died. In a way, he got his wish, albeit metaphorically; a sad story, as is the story in this film. <br/><br/>If you want to see a great drama, I don't think you'll find it here. But if you want to know what it was really like at Studio 54, then see this."

","Virtual unknown Mark Christopher's ""54"" came out at essentially the same time as Stillman's ""The Last Days of Disco,"" and most of us who are still Stillman hopefuls were expecting a TKO.<br/><br/>Sadly though, even with Kate Beckinsale in the cast, ""Days"" finishes a poor second.<br/><br/>Mike Myers, in his first truly dramatic role, is absolutely superb as the ubiquitous and egocentric Steve Rubell ~ the man who literally invented trendy~but~exclusive NYC hot~spots with his Studio 54.<br/><br/>But Myers is merely the thread which holds several subplots together. <br/><br/>
Most of these involve lowlife Jersey kid, ""Shane"" [Ryan Phillippe], who happens upon the club nearly by accident.  Shane, via several personally~compromising situations, is fairly~quickly elevated to ""waiter"" status which, at 54, meant overnight stardom.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell, as an ex~Jersey girl who has made it semi~big on a soap opera, excels as the object of Shane's desires.<br/><br/>Salma Hayek, in what is likely her best performance thus far, is terrific as the disco star wannabe.<br/><br/>I continue to be amazed with Mike Myers ~ even when he's not doing his comedy schtick, he makes it work.  This is a true oddity for ex~SNL personnel: Bill Murray, John Belushi & Dan Aykroyd's attempts at drama have been at best adequate [depite Aykroyd's nomination for the awful ""Driving Miss Daisy""] and at worst, deplorable [all of Aykroyd's other work].<br/><br/>The guy is gold.

","You would think that a movie about Studio 54 would focus on the life of Steve Rubel. But why make sense? This film is Boogie Nights meets disco. The stars are small time employees of Studio 54 who want to be famous but whose careers go nowhere. The film could have been about any famous disco club and it would not have changed the story very much. <br/><br/>Boogie Nights did this story ten times better. In 54 the lives of our young struggling characters are not explored in any depth and the gaps in the story are huge. When a bus boy steals 10 thousand why isn't he fired? Instead Rubel's top financial assistant is fired for stealing the money but Rubel says later he knew she didn't do it. 54 seems to have half a script.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the stars, Ryan Phillipe, Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer just don't carry the film. Hayek is often terrible with her Elvis sneer. Phillipe and Meyer can go back to TV and won't be missed. My advice to Neve Campbell; stay away from bombs like this. The decent performances by Mike Meyers and Sela Ward give a hint that with a good script, competent actors and the same interesting sets, there could have been a good film here.<br/><br/>
As Studio 54 plodded on, the dialogue became more ridiculous. I couldn't help but laugh at the Rubel welcome back party with Hayek in a terrible wig and Mike Meyers waving at our nobody main characters who he couldn't see 100 feet away and whom the real Rubel wouldn't have remembered.

There is no overall arc to the story, which gave it the feel of a 2-hr pilot for a prime time TV drama, in which case we would eventually find out more about the characters.<br/><br/>The only character I was interested in was Mike Myers's.  Surprisingly, the owner of Studio 54 was relegated to a minor role in the story -- merely window dressing.  Instead of the film being about the club, its owner, and its patrons, it seems to be preoccupied with how gorgeous Ryan Phillippe is.<br/><br/>With such a talented cast, it is a shame that they were wasted on a story and characters that go nowhere."

So one night he goes to Manhattan and joins the huge crowd of people seeking entrance into the world-famous nightclub known as Studio 54. Although most are turned away, the club owner ""Steve Rubell"" (Mike Myers) surprisingly allows Shane to come in and not long afterward hires him to be a busser. It's at this time that Shane meets ""Greg Randazzo"" (Breckin Meyer) and his wife ""Anita"" (Salma Hayek) who invite him to live with them for a while. He quickly accepts and before long gets caught up in the wild New York City nightlife which Studio 54 epitomized. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film served as an interesting snapshot of a time and place when disco ruled the airwaves. That said, while I enjoyed the trip down memory lane and thought that Mike Myers performed in an exceptional manner, I also thought that there wasn't sufficient character development in some places which subsequently caused the film to seem somewhat shallow and uneven at times. Be that as it may, I liked this movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

","I guess people are reviewing this movie as compared to around 1998. We seem to remember a lot of the great movies (depending on who you talk to) were like late 70's early 80's, the godfathers, and the star wars and so on. But seriously the 90's made some really hard core classics that the quotes are still around today. Forrest Gump, people still quote that. That movie was 1994. Saving Private Ryan, then you have Schindler's List, Titanic was 97. So when this movie came out you pretty much were up against the 90's and big name movies.<br/><br/>So I can understand how this didn't leave a good taste in peoples mouth. Plus all the talk of the late 70's and early 80's, which is still my favorite decade of music. I agree with every one about Michael Myers character. It was simply off the chain. You could tell he prepared for his role. And honestly I don't know how Steve rubell acted in real life. And frankly it doesn't matter, mike Myers still performed great.<br/><br/>Salma Hayek was just a beauty. A pure beauty back then and probably is now. Older or not. Great person to show in this movie. This was the decade of some drop dead gorgeous women with natural looks. The Pam Griers, farrah Farcetts, who ever played that girl in night rider, wonder woman, and all the charlie's angels. You name it those girls knew how to look good. Frankly in 2017 I'm not impressed. But to find some one in 1998 with that kind of natural beauty wasn't easy either. She played the part very well. Although her part wasn't as big as it should have been, it was definitely key to this movie.<br/><br/>Ryan part in this movie as Shane was all over the place. Probably where people had a hard time relating to. I mean they didn't really talk much about his family. And they played the whole dad was a drunk and didn't care about my life theme too much. As a matter of fact I wish directors would quit playing that scene out. Its old and pretty much the characters who play it in movies don't do it right. The dad just seemed out of place as well as the sisters.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, Ryan shouldn't even have been the main character. He didn't really live up to the 70's and early 80's and Nev Campbell is hardly convincing of somebody who ""is doing what it takes to get on top"". And I'm not sure if they cut out a lot of sex scenes but for the late 70's early 80's they needed a lot more sex and drugs. As matter of fact this movie if it was made in the early 80's would have been great.<br/><br/>All the other characters honestly aren't worth talking about. And I have to be honest. I love this movie. But its more like a guilty pleasure. If I'm writing an honest review of the quality of the film and acting. Its not very well for what they could have had. Where they were suppose to give an account of a bar where anything went. Sex, drugs and just simply a lot of questionable behavior. They simply went on about a bartenders life and how he got be at studio 54.<br/><br/>They should have just had the show focus on Myers and how he was the owner of the bar and what kind of business deals was he in. Would have been much more interesting. Or simply recast the character, make tom cruise play the part of Shane and then go far on about how salma and who ever played Shane were having an affair and then honestly ditch Nev and go with Denise Richards and that would have been a hit.<br/><br/>But they didn't. Its still a show worth watching. I love watching it, but it could have been better. I remember that decade from 75 to 85 as the greatest and most unique when it came to music and just experimenting with fun. The movie makes it seem like pretty good but boring at times with a bunch of people just trying to make it and falling in line when they are told. I didn't grow up in that decade, so maybe it was like that. But that doesn't stop people from making the 50's into pleasantville now does it?"

I definitely understood where Shane was coming from in actuality. New York City always looks better from the New Jersey side. I grew up in New Jersey where you aspire to be there. New York City in the seventies and eighties were exciting, fun, and gritty. I wouldn't have mind living then there. it's not the same New York City anymore.

","It has become almost folklore, the legend of how Studio 54 co-founder Steve Rubell use to stand behind the velvet ropes outside his very exclusive club and choose who could go in and who couldn't. '54' is a movie that seems to have been written by someone who didn't get in. It's a speculative work of fiction that is less interested in the legend of Studio 54 then in a lame story we've seen a dozen times.<br/><br/>The movie should be providing us with a look inside Rubell's modern-day Roman orgy of sex, drugs and disco. What was the freedom to be found there? What were the inside secrets? What really went on in that basement? Director and screenwriter Mark Christopher couldn't care less. He hasn't done his homework on his subject and instead writes a screenplay full of stolen elements from 'Boogie Nights', 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Showgirls' The story focuses on a fictional character, a dimwitted Jersey kid named Shane (Ryan Phillippe) who crosses the river into Manhattan in hopes of getting a glimpse of 54. He gets across the velvet ropes and is soon working as a bartender. Strange thing is, nothing really happens inside the club in this movie. There are a lot of drugs and apparently a lot of sex (we see very, very little of the sexual nightlife of Studio 54).<br/><br/>Phillippe isn't much of an actor. He has covergirl looks but his talent is only skin deep. He really isn't necessary to this story. He gets a job, watches others lose themselves in a haze of drugs, falls in love with a soap opera star (Neve Campbell) and watches Rubell get into hot water with the IRS.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Mike Meyers. He plays Rubell as a flippant gay socialite with a chip on his shoulder that has snorted too much cocaine. What there is of his performance is fine but Meyers is given almost nothing to do. He doesn't look like Rubell and every time we think that the movie is headed for some insight into him, they cut back to Phillippe.<br/><br/>A recent documentary on VH1's ""Behind the Music"" gave me more insights than any 5 minutes of this movie. If we are the believe the 54 in this film it doesn't live up to it's legendary status. The d√©cor is the same but what goes on there isn't much. The club in this movie looks less like a den of iniquity then an unsupervised high school dance."

","Studio 54 was one of the defining clubs of the seventies. Known for its lavish parties, limitless energy, and the known hangout for A-list celebrities, its inviting, yet elusive atmosphere completely challenged the party-life at that point in time. It was a cultural staple that has now faded into a curious piece of history.<br/><br/>It's only logical that a film make an attempt to capture the energy and the enigma of the popular nightclub, and Mark Christopher's 54 does just that at a basic level. Enthusiasts of the nightclub will find the atmosphere of the film adoring and majestic, while detractors or outsides will find little to note here. This is more a Cliff Notes representation of an enormous cultural staple. Think the social change the Vietnam War provided being summed up in a pamphlet of information.<br/><br/>The film stars Ryan Phillippe as Shane O'Shea, a young Jersey boy who lives a pretty unremarkable life until he ups the courage to cross the New York/Jersey border and becomes a bartender at Studio 54. Not long after, he meets the aspiring singer Anita (Salma Hayek) and her overprotective husband, Greg (Breckin Meyer) and gradually becomes closer and closer with Anita and alienating Greg in the meantime. Shane also finds himself slightly at odds with the egomaniac club-owner Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), who consistently reminds him he is an easily-replaceable pretty face. Overtime, Shane becomes sucked into the twisted drug culture that Studio 54 bears, along with the heavily dramatic lifestyle, which will ultimately cause his demise and the club's.<br/><br/>One would anticipate a film like 54 be able to capture the strange, uncouth wackiness of the club along with being able to bring the raw focus had by a film like Boogie Nights and the sophistication of a film like Casino. Unfortunately, we don't get much of either. 54 is a fine examination of a club, but it's too unwilling to go beneath the surface and really expose anything. It plays safe, hitting the right notes at the right time. Never does it become inoffensive or shifts its tone into a rawer, more unadulterated look.<br/><br/>Both of the aforementioned films had the luxury of surprising their audiences whether it was in the way of style or in the way of content. 54 remains something of an effigy in terms of style; it features rather muted colors and not a lot of dance floor excitement as the club was known for. We get a more behind the scenes look, which is nice, but rarely do we dive much into the characters to a get a sense of what they're truly about. We know a bit more about the characters than the average caricatures that pass in a raunchy teen flick but not by a whole lot.<br/><br/>Returning to the point of the style of the particular film, it's all pretty bland and inert. The excitement and energy that existed in the club isn't translated well enough to film. If 54 wanted to take on a persona equivalent to that of, say, European art-house, what could've unfolded would've been sure beauty in the way of color and vibe. It settles for a mediocre palette of redundant colors - that is when the film chooses to show them off.<br/><br/>At least we have a slew of solid performances here; Ryan Phillippe is strong as the lead character, portraying his rise believably and his downfall professionally, Salma Hayek is interesting to watch as always, Breckin Meyer gets a few laughs, and Mike Myers gives the best or his worst performance of his career depending on how you look at it. While no performance is necessarily bad, they all occupy an uncertain state in the sense that nobody knows if they're supposed to be serious or satirical. Myers' character seems to be from a different film, playing Rubell with a looser persona rather than Phillippe, who seems to be playing Shane with complete seriousness.<br/><br/>54 is benefited by a strong cast and favorable writing from director Christopher, but it's relatively too safe and too restricted to truly call itself the encompassing film on an entire culture.<br/><br/>Starring: Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Breckin Meyer, Mike Myers, and Sela Ward. Directed by: Mark Christopher."

","Set in the late 1970's, Studio 54 is a trendy disco nightclub depicted in director/writer Mark Christopher's ""54"" which stars comical actor Mike Myers as the club's flamboyant kingpin and real life character Steve Rubell. But the leading star of ""54"" is Ryan Phillippe as a fictional Jersey boy Shane O'Shea with ambitions to seek employment in that club as he gets his feet wet into the establishment arranging tables as a busboy. Then as he progresses, much to the approval of Rubell, he gets promoted as a waiter and sugar daddy to the club's client√®le. Salma Hayek stars as Anita Randazzo, the club's coat check girl who's eloped to another busboy and roommate of Shane's, Greg Randazzo (Brecklin Mayer). Greg has his sights set on becoming a waiter, but due to his marriage commitments, he is deprived from his ambition, therefore making his dreams are sadly limited.<br/><br/>What makes this movie only average at best is that the agonizing struggles of these fictional characters is that it's been rehashed and been done several times before. Critics who have expressed their harsh disdain on ""54"" compared the plot and the story as the weaker sister to ""Boogie Nights"", which was more successful at the box-office. I get the impression that the critics claim that ""54 steals most of their main ideas and themes, with only difference is that ""54"" is tamer than ""Boogie Nights"". While I agree to some extent that this movie isn't anywhere near perfect, and that there have been better disco-themed movies than this one, but what makes this film passable is that it has all the essential ingredients to make for a compelling movie. Unfortunately, the resources were not carefully featured.<br/><br/>In the case of Steve Rubell, his climb to success from a steakhouse proprietor to a highly successful club owner gets very meager notability, leaving most of his content in the dark, while the main plot is centered around these stereotypical failures as the struggle to climb the corporate ladder in the nightclub enterprise, which to me lacks any kind of depth to the movie. One of the questions that crossed my mind was how did Rubell emerged from running a steak house to owning club that Princess Grace and Truman Capote visited regularly? That should have been the core of ""54"". What about the aftermath of Rubell after his imprisonment due to his club being shut down via tax violations? That's where the importance of the movie should have been. Instead we are forced into watching overdone ego-driven hyper-extended melodrama with bare-chested men in tight shorts in a movie with an abundance of loose ends.<br/><br/>The acting as a whole was a snore casserole with a side order of yawn juice. But it's not entirely to be blamed by the actors, but perhaps due to the messy script. The big surprise comes from the performance of Mike Myers, breaking away from his comical roots to play an impressive portrayal as a restrained, but mysterious bar owner (I'm sure the real Rubell was more charismatic, if he was able to persuade Arab princes to his New York establishment). Salma Hayek is fun to watch as a coat-check girl who has aspirations to be a singer and paves the way for Shane into getting used to the customs and surroundings of the nightclub. It was a treat to watch the energetic geriatric Ellen Arbertini Dow get down and boogie as Disco Dotty (though her cussing was not all that necessary, even for an old woman). The scenery of this movie in terms of props and setting leaves much for one's desire."

Unfortunately part of the mystique of 54 can be found in the years after Steve Rubell went to prison, I would have recommended that the early 80's which lacked the glamour of the 70's be represented as well (if only for a footnote). This was an important era in the ""me"" generation and I don't think we saw enough. This is the first movie on the excess of the 70's that didn't really have a good soundtrack.

","I enjoyed this film.  Yes, it got slammed by critics.  Yes, it's a little slack on details and some might consider it dull.  While even I hoped for a little more of life inside the club than it actually projected I still amazingly liked it.  Maybe, because it was incredibly short and light -weight summer entertainment or because it had a constant beat to it; either way I still enjoyed it.  I'm not recommending this, even though i liked it myself; because most people won't have interest in seeing a movie on 54 and especially after reading the terrible reviews about it.  The truth is Mike Myers was good as Steve Rubell and the rest give reasonably good performances;enough to believe at least.  This film was incredibly low on sex and drugs considering it was the late 70's in the notorious Studio 54. I was a little surprised that the film didn't ever show rubell's co-partner Ian Shroeger.  If you're expecting a strict copy of the real 54, this will probably disappoint you.  The main story line is featured on a young adult who rises as a bartender in the club and how his life changes in all aspects; his connection with his family deteriorates, his drug use rises along with his sexual activity.  But there is really hardly much sex in it too make it possibly offending.  I love how the beginning and the ending is portrayed.  The film was cut short 30 minutes after it was shown to a test audience-which disliked various parts and the ending i believe.  Whether it was cut for the good or the bad I give this film an 8 out of ten or a B+ or better yet, 3 stars out of 4."

It's the plot that doesn't work on very well. It gets stuck in some points where Christopher could have done something else to develop. The movie is also some kind of waste -of -talent -that -should -have -looked -better -on -paper. Mike Myers does a great performance here, one of his best. Neve Campbell is also ok. But the one who should have stolen the movie is Salma Hayek. She is so beautiful that the only fact of seeing her on screen is a pleasure. Anyway, her character wasn't treated as it deserved. Doesn't matter........she's still appealing as always and very talented. My comment in just a few words: It could have been better, but is still a good one."

I saw a ""Biography"" on A&E that had wilder club scenes, more celebrities and a more poignant plot. Are we supposed to be impressed with the back of Andy Warhol's head. Give me a break! To be fair the movie did have a few good scenes. And I love Heather Matazzarro, even though she is wasted here. In fact there were quite a few things a found to like but every time something else would rear its ugly head. For example Mike Myers, who I read in reviews had totally transformed himself into the Steve character, has a tendency to open his mouth and grin like he's doing a Saturday Night live skit. You want to smack him. This is one of those movies that just meanders toward an anticlimactic close. I don't consider these spoilers because you can see them coming miles away. For example the movie goes out of its way to show characters abusing drugs, but never shows any ill effects from them, except for the old lady who drops dead of course. Shane 54 seems to effortlessly kick all of the habits that the movie shows him developing by the end. And the raid on the club at the end, it's almost an afterthought, even though it contains Myers best line. As they stick him in the police car, ""This is so tacky."" My advice, stay away.

Unfortunately, the audience will probably never know it because this movie squanders its short running time (90 minutes) detailing the boring, uneventful adventures of a fictional lead character played by Ryan Phillipe.

Salma Hayek absolutely stole the show as the fame-seeking coat-girl Anita, and Mike Myers was also very believable as 54 owner Steve Rubell.  Even though Ryan Phillippe could've been better, his wrong-turns are forgotten as Neve Campbell stinks up the screen.  Her performance as the soap-opera actress made me feel severely violated.  Even though I am a big fan of hers, I seriously think that she should stick to what she's good at:  portraying disturbingly neurotic people who scream a lot.

The characters seem to have something in common: they all wanna win in life, they want to become something important, and that's what I most liked about ""54"". The will to grow, to become big, the necessity to be a big shot; it hasn't changed. Everybody wants to be (a big) part of the party, and we know life is the greatest party. Shane, Julie, Anita, Gregg, they all wanted to create their respective ""real"" lives as they created inside the glamourous 54, where everybody could be a star. I see it as a metaphor about the race of life, our desire to be important or at least to do something important. If I'm saying too much bullshit, just think the film is still enjoying. It describes just perfectly how was the aura that surrounded Studio 54 and its guests plus that ""late 70's feeling"". The cast and the soundtrack are also great.

His words could've been written a little better (Mark Christopher is to blame for that; don't blame Myers), but Myers delivered them with perfection.

","54 was a good movie that did not live up to its potential.  The story is excellent, and a number of the performances were outstanding (especially that of Mike Meyers), but in the end I walked out of the theater wishing that any of the dozen or so sub-plots were expanded upon.  This movie tried to be about drug use, promiscuous and careless sex, an eccentric club owner , trying to make ones dreams come true at all costs, the dingier side (and price) of stardom, the strong desire of the  ""system"" to get rid of the club and the free spirited attitude that caused it to be so successful, romance, the degradation of family values and relationships, and the consequences of all of the above.  In the end however, with what seems must have been about five or six hours worth of film on the cutting room floor, this was a decent movie about a club employee and his scattered memories of his time spent there.  54 was entertaining, but it could have been great. I believe that most audiences will leave the theatre feeling that they were missing something."
"bob the moo","Null","2","5","28 March 2004"," Reasonable story with strong sense of period covering the weak characters
","In the 1970's Shane and his friends go out in New York to see if they can get into the exclusive club 54.  Shane gets in but his friends don't, and he immediately falls for the glamorous life.  He gets a job in the club and gradually works his way up from busboy to barman, getting more money, drugs and sex than he can handle.  However as relationships crumble and the excesses become the norm, things are bound to break eventually.<br/><br/>
With the success of Boogie Nights, period films from the Seventies were suddenly good business if you could pull them off.  54 is set in the `legendary' nightclub of the same name - although I must confess that the news of this `legendary' place never reached me in rural Northern Ireland, although I was aware of the place before I saw this film.  The lack of introduction to the place put me off a little bit - it expected the audience to already be in awe of this great club without it doing anything to win us over.  From this point in the film takes the narrative on a basic downward spiral of drugs, sex and general excess to act as a sort of cautionary tale against the period.  It does this a little heavily where I would have preferred it to trust me to get the message fro ma straight telling.<br/><br/>The character of Shane is the main focus, with him acting as our eyes on the other characters, particularly club owner Steve Rubell.  While it tries to paint a big picture of all the excesses and broken dreams, mainly it only manages to do Shane well and the rest are sort of in the background and not as well drawn and involved as in Boogie Nights.  It still works but it lacks the tapestry effect that would have improved it.<br/><br/>The cast are still pretty good.  Generally I hate the bland and expressionless Phillippe, he is not a good actor and he generally leaves me feeling cold by his performances.  Here, partly because he is our entry to the film, I thought he was better than he has been before.  Myers is good although his presence may have been part of people turning up to the film expecting a crude comedy.  He delivers his lines well and seems to enjoy having a straight role to play.  Hayek is OK but Campbell has very little to do.  The supporting cast are OK but the material doesn't fill them out beyond people who we know we will see the `curse' of 54 played onto, much like the `characters' at the start of Casualty who we know something will happen to.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable film that trades off it's good sense of time and place to cover the fact that the material is not as well written as it should have been.  The action is too simple and the characters are not real enough. I hate to compare, but Boogie nights deals with a similar tale but does it much better."

","This film rivals ""Killer Fish"" as the worst film of all time. The only reason I watched it so long (about twenty minutes) was to see how bad it could get. OK, and the pretty pretties.<br/><br/>I went to a lot of discos, and I went to them a lot, in the seventies. They were pretty great for me then; I loved the scene. I never went to one like 54, of course - so I can't say how the film measures up to the reality.<br/><br/>I can only give my opinion on this film as a film, and that's my favorite Middle School Reviewer line: ""This Movie Sucks!""<br/><br/>It is a celebration of debauchery and sleaze, which normally is my favorite, but it is very badly done.

There isn't really anything to recommend here, not even Mike Myer's Fran Drescheresque performance. It took about three minutes for me not to care.<br/><br/>And I was a teenager during the disco era. I hated the stuff--brainless, artless nonsense. With no discernible talent required to compose disco, there was no reason to take any of it seriously. An incoherent narrative, dreadful dialogue, and a whole undercurrent of stupefying stupidity (the heart and soul of disco), don't combine for anything other than a garbage movie about pathetic people living in the unreal world of the late 1970s disco scene.<br/><br/>Have at it."

The film is dull. It is set up a little like Boogie Nights (which itself was set up like Goodfellas) meaning of course that the story has a first person perspective, narration included with a blow by blow description of names places and faces, and ""what a good time it was"" or something like that. Too bad the narrator is a piece of cardboard, as is everyone else in the movie. Neve Campbell is the only one who feels human in her performance, yet she is given practically no screen time. If director Mark Christopher had bothered to spend as much time on character as he did on useless details like figuring out what color each light source should be, 54 may have amounted to something. It doesn't. Disco may be dead, but not half as much as this is."

","When I first watched this movie, I just knew it would be one of those films I would watch every couple years and it would never grow old to me. This made maybe my 10th viewing and I still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Studio 54 in the late seventies was THE place to be, clubs weren't as relevant as they are nowadays and even so 54 was the kind of place that people off the streets could hang out with movie stars and rock singers, anyone who was anyone had to be there. It was ran by a man named Steve Rubell and he was somewhat of a god in that world. Everyone wanted to be his friend, and he just wanted money, sex and drugs. He was embezzling money from his own company and not letting the IRS find out about it, but when word got out his place was shut down quickly and he went to jail.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe plays Shane, a character based on Tieg Thomas, a bi-sexual party boy who became a bartender and a star because of his time at 54. Shane however was straight and fell in love with a soap star on this movie and he and the girl he falls for have to realize that life and love is more important than selling yourself out.<br/><br/>Side note...there is another director's cut of this film out there based more on Tieg's life having lots more sex and bisexual encounters, director Mark Christopher may release it anytime, he got lots of clearance for the DVD release, but there's still lots more to be seen on DVD.<br/><br/>Mark did a really great job directing this movie film and with all the lights and action going on in the club he captured the right things at the right times, his use of slow motion is perfect. He is mostly famous for doing gay cinema and shorts like those seen on the ""Boys Life"" series, and his work here far outshines those.<br/><br/>Acting wise this was a gem. Ryan Phillippe is a good guy, I have met him and he's such a great guy in person that I could never judge him on film, but I will say he did a great job and thats not biased, he's nothing at all like the cocky Shane character he played here and he did good with the Jersey accent. Mike Myers may have did his best acting job ever here, we've all seen him do these crazy characters such as Austin Powers but here he's playing a real person and this movie is not at all comedy and he pulls off a serious acting job, it is so hard to believe this is Mike Myers. Neve Cambell also did her best work here in my opinion, early in her career but trying to play an older more sophisticated Jersey girl in the New York circle. Other great actors included Breckin Meyer, Heather Matarazzo, Ellen Dow and Sela Ward. Salma Hayak was the balance though, that girl cant act in a movie unless Robert Rodriquez is directing her.<br/><br/>Of course disco was the music of this time, and I thought the music here was very fitting, the songs were as important as anything when one of your stars is the club and the dance floor. Nice original music too, and glad to see a Bachman-Turner Overdrive thrown in the mix.<br/><br/>Great movie I recommend it to drama lovers, bio-pic lovers, disco lovers and just anyone looking for a way to kill an afternoon enjoying a film. 6 out of 10 stars."
"elshikh4","Null","1","2","7 December 2009"," Anti and Pro ??!!
","It is not a confusing movie. It's just confused. And with other defects too.<br/><br/>Most of this cast are so pale. (Ryan Phillippe) and (Breckin Meyer) both look like children, or idiots. But while this partly could mean good casting for their simpleton characters, the real problem was that they didn't add anything to their roles; being uncharismatic, and without any depth at all. So how about being in the hands of a clueless script that has no depth or whatsoever?!<br/><br/>The movie shows the atmosphere of New York in the late 1970s, and how some of the cream de la cream were living, or rather being doped. The sinking into this freedom of nightclub 54, so the developments of what it leads to moral collapses, are all clear. But suddenly, at the end, all of that turned into a mixed up stuff; the guys who were taking tons of drugs became suddenly clean?, the couple who was about to break became suddenly so in love??, and the movie which was a satire all along became suddenly an elegy???<br/><br/>It came to a point where it cries over the days of 54 where the freedom was so unlimited; (Steve Rubell) says a real goodbye to his staff, while the movie says the same to these days, in unhappy farewell, saluting (Rubell), and his original dream of a club, with the hat off. So, as a whole, was it a movie about how filthy 54 was? Or was it a movie about how great it was? Was this movie's (Steve Rubell) a ground-breaker creator, a wise mentor, a symbol of sensual liberty that deserved to be missed in the modern BAD America? Or was he a repulsive degenerate, who loved only money, cocaine, and being in control, and built a destructive hellhole? It shows that Mr. (Mark Christopher), the movie's director who wrote it also, didn't ask these questions to himself in the first place!<br/><br/>I didn't understand the problem of the 3 young leads while the movie was busy making a very shoddy love triangle between them. I didn't understand what's this movie's character mainly; anti 54 and the days of disco?, pro?, neutral historian?, anti and pro in the same time?! And I didn't feel joy out of the movie itself, since none of it was great or remarkable.<br/><br/>I can't say that (Mike Myers) did it fine, since this script didn't make his character finely at all. He just stole the show being solidly serious, considering originally his reputation as a comic star, plus being - surely - the best actor in this bunch!<br/><br/>I hate, truly hate, when I said about a movie: ""What did this one want?"". Simply because this can mean that this movie lost its meaning someway. And with this acting, directing, I hated the movie itself. It just looks like its leads.. confused; a fan of the illusionary colorful lights and a discloser for their illusion in the same time.<br/><br/>P.S: Now, there is a talk about a longer version, a director's cut, blah blah blah. Grrrrr! It didn't amuse me to the extent of seeking its right, un-shown, original. With many ""director's cut"" versions nowadays, I feel that this is exactly how to sell the expired goods twice!"
"j_graves68","5","1","2","18 July 2005"," ...the soundtrack's better
","""54""- a 1998 release of a fictionalized account of the late seventies' notorious nightclub that's peppered with drugs, decadence, and debauchery in the POV of a dimbulb from across the river that separates New Jersey from New York. Ryan Phillipe is the leading, narrating it-guy (I think this film actually helped destroy his career). Salma Hayek was the it-girl and played a philandering wife to Breckin Meyer (who, by the way, was HORRIBLY miscast to play her husband- no way Salma would ever touch him). Neve Campbell (all 10 minutes of her) played the soap star on the down, which incidentally mirrored her real-life career as well. Mike Myers as Steve Rubell stole the whole show. He played it with so much charisma, you couldn't help but to root for this freak. And even though Myers didn't look a whole lot like Rubell, he was not his usual over-the-top self and the subtle Linda Richman (SNL) voice he used, made the whole delivery work. Sela Ward had a small role in this as a hot-stuff, wired, record producer, but then again, EVERYONE had minuscule parts. Sherry Stringfield played his strung-out confidant Viv (and looked like she lost weight to the point of being unrecognized), along with Heather Matzarazzo (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", ""The Princess Diaries"") as Ryan Phillipe's younger sister.<br/><br/>The film had potential. It seemed decent most of the time, and you wanted to know a little more with what was going on in each scene. Yet it seemed more like watching an extended British theatrical trailer. An example was when Shane (Phillipe) is bummed that the magazine he posed for didn't have any text. Well, we never knew he even posed in the first place, but it must've been a piece that was snipped in order not to fully enjoy this subplot. The only problem is that there were multiple scenes that suffered from this same lack of coherence. The movie must have originally been three hours long, but the execs had to snip about half the footage for whatever reason. The result is a contorted, contrived, unremarkable film that doesn't even carry half the songs on film that are embedded in its soundtrack.<br/><br/>I did feel (as I did with ""Boogie Nights"") that I was in fact watching a documentary of the late 70s, and old memories of where I was at that time go-go danced in the back of my head. The Director of Photography deserves props (like the DPs to ""American Psycho"" & ""Boogie Nights"" do). I was only eight when this movie took place, but I remember where I was on New Year's Eve of 1979. But this film unfortunately tried to cram as much '70-isms and references as possible. When Breckin Meyer reaches for his wife, she says, ""Sit on it!"" Or when Shane and Meyer are the wild & crazy Czechoslovakian Brothers (Dan Aykroyd & Steve Martin in the '70s heyday of SNL). See my review of ""Boogie Nights"", you'll know what I mean. And I didn't buy that Shane (who wasn't a real sharp tool to begin with) magically goes to NYU and is a manager of a restaurant at the movie's end.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was dramatic in parts where it shouldn't have been; had no humor where it should have; was shorter than it should have been; and had scenes that shouldn't have been. The end credits were cool to watch because of all the celebrities and icons of the time were there: Liza Minelli, Martin Scorcese, Farah Fawcett, John Travolta, Sylvester Stallone, and even the Governator of California.<br/><br/>Not a bad film, but by no means a good one."
"CitizenCaine","5","1","2","21 February 2004"," 54: Pale Imitation Of Real Thing
","A host of young stars make up the patrons and employees of studio 54 in this film that supposedly details the allure of the celebrated New York night club, which I believe operated from 1977 to 1986. Mike Myers portrays owner Steve Rubell, as a sad imitation of a man, who was full of his own excess. The film begins with a narrative focus on Ryan Phillippe as a naive young man looking to be a part of the excitement. The initial juxtaposition between him and how his friends dress is painfully accurate as I remember it. Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer play a troubled young couple trying to find success, even though they don't fit in. Sela Ward and Neve Campbell are on the screen all too briefly as an older woman seductress and a young ladder climber. Several other well known stars turn up in bit roles like Lauren Hutton, Michael York, and even porn star Ron Jeremy. However, as one reviewer pointed out, it was difficult to tell whether some actors were playing themselves or not. I guess it's reflective of the whole disco era, with people going into these clubs pretending to be someone else. Reportedly the director's cut was butchered by the studio due to negative reaction at advanced screenings, and it shows. What we have instead of a den of drugs and sex is a bland account of an insider's rise and fall as a bartender. Myers really carries the film when he's on screen. The soundtrack is typical of the era, but focuses more on lesser known songs; the film bypasses several mega-hits from the time. There have been a lot of complaints about the undeveloped characters and shallowness of it all, but the film does accurately illustrate just how shallow people are when it comes to promoting their own interests. Almost every major character in the film has a way of pushing people aside when they get in the way of perceived routes to success or well-being. And, that's what the 70's was: the ""ME"" decade. ** of 4 stars."

","I love this movie. Mike Myers was excellent in the role as club owner Steve Rubell. Although he was not the only club owner at that time , but noone ever even sees that guy in this film. Mark Christopher does an excellent , almost flawless job in depicting the party that was Studio 54. Like with all bio/movies , some pieces are not true - but Mark seemed to put as much truth as he could fit into this one - as was the same for his other 1998 film , bio/movie of supermodel Gia.<br/><br/>One thing that was a little sketchy about this film is that when the viewer sees all the ""guests"" that were granted entrance or had been on the ""guestlists"" to enter the club , one may have a hard time knowing who is depicting who. In other words , as far as the real Studio 54 club goes , ""guests"" were people in power , of money , in the art world , in the business (actors , actresses , supermodels , music artists) - and this makes it hard to tell which star in the movie is depicting which star....Get my drift? Who is playing who in this movie???? Are we as viewers supposed to get just the ""feel"" of the club , or are we to know who these people are supposed to be???? Other than that - I JUST LOVE IT!"

"llihilloh","7","1","2","9 August 2001"," Ryan and the film overall is good.
","First off I would like to mention that I wasn't born until many years after 54 closed its doors. So, I don't really have anything to compare the film to. But despite of not knowing about the real club, I enjoyed the movie very much.<br/><br/>Many people criticize '54' saying that it did a terrible job of depicting the actual club scene while others commend it for bringing the New York happening spot to life. All I know is that I love anything 60s and 70s so I obviously liked this film. The clothes are good, the music is better than today's and Studio 54 looked like THE place to be. <br/><br/>The story line following a New Jersey nobody seems pretty simple. He hits New York, visits the club and in no time is the bartender. I thought that it was an excellent choice in casting Ryan Phillippe in the role of Shane O'Shea.<br/><br/>Phillippe's role doesn't look like it needed a whole lot of work put into because once again, it is a simple picture of a young man set out to make something of himself. But he does his best nonetheless. O'Shea was created well. Another young actor I particularly like is Breckin Meyer. He did a very good acting job but there was something wrong with his character. Greg seemed as if he had a purpose there in the beginning but after a while he slowly moved into the darkness and just became someone who hooked Shane up with a place to stay. Salma Hayek seems to be a popular name now days. I must say that I'm not too interested in seeing her anything. I've seen her in one or two movies before seeing her in '54' and I still don't get why everybody likes her. Not good acting on her part. Neve Campbell who is definitely not one of my favorite actresses plays a minor role in this film but they make it seem like she's in the lead. I won't comment too much on her since she once again chose a bad character to act out. And Mike Myers who plays the club owner, Steve Rubell, probably does the best next to Ryan Phillippe. It's not that Myers is such a terrific actor, it's just that he didn't have any competition (sorry Breckin). But still he played out the role his best. The cast was pretty good overall. <br/><br/>I thought that the re-creation of Studio 54 was very good. Again, I didn't know the real one but it looked so fantastic in there. Lights, dancing, music, it seemed as if the people had it made. The score for the movie wasn't anything too too great. The music was good, don't get me wrong, but I've heard better. <br/><br/>So, the story line following O'Shea was good. The acting was mixed with some good some bad. The writing was decent and the script as a whole was one of the better ones. See this even if you aren't familiar with the club itself. '54' gives a pretty good idea of what went on and how it finally came to an end."

Actually the movie could have been a lot worse.<br/><br/>I think they did a reasonably good job, though not an exceptional one, of capturing the Glitz, glamor and mystery of the greatest nightclub in the world. You feel the appropriate sense of loss at the end of the movie and wish you had been there. I know I did. The NYC club scene is still alive and kicking but no other club will probably ever be as notorious as 54. I was really shocked this movie didn't do better at the box office but though I liked it, I agree it had flaws. The movie while capturing the atmosphere and time period strongly, and making one curious about Studio 54 and maybe wishing they'd gone at least once, didn't succeed in making the club's allure irresistible and the movie compellingly unforgettable and an instant classic as it should have, because all the tools were there for an unforgettable film.<br/><br/>The movie should also have been MUCH LONGER. It still turned out much better then it could have though and is most definitely entertaining. I thought it was MUCH better then The last days of disco which I thought was horrible. I'd give it a 7 or 7.5 of 10 for the movie making, 8 of 10 for personal enjoyment though I'd really like to have seen this be a 10 all around, in the way of a ""Boogie Nights.""

","FIFTY-FOUR does not know whether it wants to capture the late 70's, the impact the club had on it, Steve Rubell, or the lives of the fictional characters, who are about as memorable as most people's memory of 54 parties.  They rarely have any.  It does not focus on any of the latter, but instead, tries to wrap it it all into a cohesive whole.  No go.  This is a very ambitious undertaking by the filmmakers, but it seems like they could not or would not let loose.  How can you really recreate Studio 54 unless you shoot inside the actual club ? (it still stands in New York)  I also feel that Miramax was afraid of backlash and box-office so they set strict productional values.  No real big stars, and, most importantly, no representatives of the world famous celebrities who attended 54 on a steady basis.<br/><br/>We do see some of the obvious in and outs of the club, like the drug-swapping at the bars, and the guidelines for getting in at the infamous velvet ropes that kept so many people out.  We never get a real sense that we are back in that period.  I would recommend seeing the current documentaries on the club being shown on cable TV.  The film is so short, the documentaries are longer and much more entertaining.<br/><br/>Mike Myers gives a half-decent performance, but never-mind the fact that Steve Rubell's partner in the club is nowhere to be found.  And the director makes a half-hearted stab at taking us into the highly private ""basement"" where all the stars hung out.  Myers' lines seem forced and I'm sure people who were close to the real Rubell were gnawing their teeth.  What could've been an important statement about the me-decade and its excesses is wasted. Instead, we get a Tony Manero-type story the viewer could really care less about."

Not one of the characters is worthy of any sympathy. It could have been a lot better. The only thing minutely interesting about this turkey is Mike Meyer's understated portrayal of Steve Rubell. It only goes to show that old saying, ""Disco, Man, it still sucks."""
"mark.waltz","3","1","3","8 November 2016"," Divine decadence doesn't cast stones...once you're inside.
","This is ""Goodfellas"" meets ""Valley of the Dolls"", a deliciously trashy example of the dark side of night life that is legendary even today. Oh, the many ghosts I've felt walking through the doors of the former disco, now a legitimate Broadway theater that transitioned from nightclub to stage with the classic German expression of decadence, ""Cabaret"". Nightclubs still have a strict door policy like this, but 54 made it famous, even if it wasn't the first. This thrives on the disco beat of the late '70s/early '80s, tossing in obvious corruption from behind the scenes from a manager who was ingenious in many ways but idiotic and careless in a ton of others. ""I've been to a marvelous party"", Noel Coward wrote, but as his muse, Elaine Stritch, admitted, some of those marvelous parties really weren't so marvelous.<br/><br/>It's a fantasy land that makes reality tedious, and for bar-back turned successful bartender Ryan Phillipe, that marvelous party turns out to be the key to the door to his possible destruction, turning him from a basically decent kid from Jersey City to an absolute phony. As for Michael Meyers' Steve Rubell, well, I don't like to speak ill of the dead, but he was as sleazy as they come, never realizing the self destruction his doomed success has him headed towards.<br/><br/>I have to call this a guilty pleasure, a fun bad movie, and a reminder of my own party days which in many respects, as a whole, were not really marvelous. Ellen Albertini Dow, one of the cutest of little old ladies, is unforgettably lovable as Disco Dotty, a fictionalized version of a real character, and all she's missing is the cat and the birdcage to be a dancin' granny with a Tweety bird. The narration by Philippe gives this a pedestrian feel, with a feeling of nostalgia that lasts as long as the club stays open, but the feeling of sleaze has the same impact as a Sunday morning hangover. I may not be able to read minds, but I do know the difference between classic art and a framed poster that ends up in the trash after its owner realizes its true value. But for those of us who were there for lights and beat, this is a nice memory that soon is as forgotten as one of those cheap book store posters."

","This is has to rank as one of the most poorly acted; poorly written and poorly conceived work I've seen in a very long time. It was incredibly mis-cast-- Mike Meyers was painful in the extreme!

Don't waste your time-- I did and I wish like crazy I had just cleaned my closet and taken out the trash instead of watching it. 54 is a prime example of what is fundamentally wrong with film-making today-- Too many people with too much money and too much time on their hands find a camera, desperate actors and an empty soundstage.....

","The story of Steve Rubel and of Studio 54 (the famous night spot of the elite on New York's 54th Street in an old ABC TV studio) is a facinating one which encapsulates much of the atmosphere of excess which characterized that era; this movie, ""54"" which purports to tell that story through the eyes of Shane, one of Rubel's employees, fails miserably in its attempt.  What we get instead is Reese Witherspoon's husband presented as a shiftless but handsome youth from Jersey City (a working class town directly across the Hudson River) yearning for the excitment of the ""Big City"" in a banal ""Cinderella"" tale.<br/><br/>Mike Myers is brilliant as Steve Rubel, the club's creator, a drug swilling homosexual who likes to surround himself with pretty boys. Enter Mr. Witherspoon's ""Shane"" who catches Rubel's eye while trying to gain admittance one night into the fabled lair of the famous. Through some oblique family connection Shane is introduced to Rubel, and is offered a job as a busboy. So far, so good.<br/><br/>At this point the film loses direction (perhaps literally) as instead of learning the secrets of what went on in the club- facinating bits about basement VIP rooms and drug pipelines only alluded to in passing, we are instead served up a lame story of Shane's attraction for a famous TV star and (Neve Campbell) who frequents the club, and an entngled relationship with Shane's fellow busboy's pretty wife (Miss Hayuk).<br/><br/>Out of nowhere Shane is suddenly driving a Camero with custom plates and living the high life, but inexplicably is still living in a small apartment with his two fellow employees- and by the way, how a busboy and hatcheck girl could afford a two bedroom apartment in the City is just another careless detail in this sloppy mess.<br/><br/>As many other have said, ""Boogie Nights"" does a much better job of conveying the mood and music of the period, and also tells a more interesting story of the characters involved, in frankly a very similar story.<br/><br/>There was a good story to be told here, but we never can get past the door."

"davidholmesfr","5","1","3","24 February 2002"," Last days of disco movies?
","It seems that making the definitive New York disco movie is a lost cause. Both Whit Stillman's `Last Days of Disco' and Christopher's `54' make valiant but doomed attempts.<br/><br/>The problem with `54' is, like `Last Days¬Ö' the characters lack depth. But perhaps this is no accident given the artificiality of the scene both movies set out to portray. Compared to ballroom dancing, or to be more accurate, `Strictly Ballroom' where the environment is populated with people dedicated in their own individual ways to succeed, the disco scene is a hard seam to mine. <br/><br/>Whereas `Last Days¬Ö' focuses on regulars who frequent the disco, here we focus on an employee. `54' takes as its central character Shane O'Shea (Phillippe), a New Jersey kid who is bored with life on the wrong side of the tracks, or, more accurately, the wrong side of the Hudson River. So he crosses into New York City, joins the queue of hopefuls hoping to be allowed into `54', and manages to get in by the rather unlikely process of removing his shirt (a scene recalled towards the end of the movie when he is thrown out of the same disco, again shirtless). From here on we follow his rise as an employee to the dizzy heights of bartender, a position that in the world of disco appears to be equivalent to a leading Wall Street bond trader. Phillippe is too lightweight in the role for us to really care too much about his fate. <br/><br/>Mike Myers makes a reasonable stab at playing the role of Steve Rubell, `54's charismatically odd owner. Unfortunately he has a tendency, in several scenes, to look a bit like the toothy British comedian Ken Dodd and I was half expecting him to come out with Dodd's old saying `How tickled I am, missus'. Given some of Myers's lines it might actually have been worked.<br/><br/>In the end Rubell is hit by the IRS ¬ñ given the amount of drugs being wheeled and dealed in the place he probably got the lesser of two evils. And as Ken Dodd also got into a little bit of difficulty with the UK's revenue service the parallels were just too much. <br/><br/>All in all, like `Last Days of Disco', this is a sorry effort. Perhaps the whole Manhattan disco scene can now be quietly condemned to the trashcan of movie history."

","54 was one of the films of 1998 I-was-waiting-for.  <br/><br/>I'm still waiting...<br/><br/>Give us the directors cut!!!<br/><br/>Based on a couple of gay-theme shorts Mark Christopher did, Miramax hired him to write and direct what was supposed to be a realistic portrayal of the infamous NYC night club, Studio 54.  <br/><br/>According to people involved, Christopher did just that.  His film showed an unflinching view of the late '70s.  Sex, both gay and straight occupied much of the club, and the drugs ran rampant.  I don't know what his version contained, but it HAS to be better than what was released into theatres. The story, as it is now, revolves around Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a Jersey kid who ends up bussing at 54.  The movie focuses on is rise to the top, and then dramatic fall.  Mike Myers turns in one of his best performances of his career as club owner, Steve Rubel.  Ryan Phillippe, who usually has a limited acting ability, shows a glimmer of a great performance trying to break free.  And, as far as Neve Campbell, Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek, why were they in the movie again?  I can't quite figure it out.  Lord knows, the only reason Neve Campbell was there was to add another name to the marquee.  <br/><br/>54 as it is, is a mess.  Not much makes sense, and I didn't care whatsoever about any of the characters.  I didn't care because I never got a chance to. The editing is choppy, dialogue reeks of quick re-writes, and the movie is tamer than most stuff put out under the Disney label.  Hey, Miramax, remember The Crying Game?  Priest?  Kids?  You used to take chances with your films, and stood behind the filmmaker. Now it seems your interested solely in the 'ole mighty buck!<br/><br/>54 had to have been the biggest letdown of the summer of '98 - and there were some pretty big let downs that summer.  I urge Miramax to let Christopher release the version he shot (at least on DVD), because as it is now, it's an embarrassment to all those involved, and to all of us who were first in line to witness this hatchet job.<br/><br/>My Grade: C-"

He befriends fellow employees Anita Randazzo (Salma Hayek) and Greg Randazzo (Breckin Meyer) who are trying to launch Anita's singing career. Meanwhile Rubell rules the club like a modern Caligula dealing drugs and getting the attention of the IRS.<br/><br/>This is a clich√© filled glossy superficial movie. It starts with the naive innocent that we're suppose to see this movie through. Shane is way too stupid, and his sycophant voice overs don't make it any better. Then there is Mike Myers. I do not begrudge anybody for taking a risk. However he is so out of his depths. In a better actor's hands, this could have been an amazing character.

","and agree with most of the negative reviews. In fairness, I tried to give the film a chance, and watched it more than once.<br/><br/>It isn't really the cast that ruins the non-existent script (was this ad-lib?; seems to be). Although one embarrassingly amateurish scene with Neve Campbell trying to sound like a New Yorker; ""waitress a cup of cawfeeee...."" like a teenager would even get waited on with that attitude; more likely she would have the coffee thrown in her face! Directed by Mark Christopher, I will have to read his bio, I doubt he has spent much time living or working in NYC.<br/><br/>The cast tries their best; Salma Hayek; Ryan Phillipe (although he is a bit too naive at first) Mike Myers does look like Rubell(horribly so) and Sela Ward is attractive and vacuous. We also see the usual inferences to Andy Warhol, Princess Grace, etc.<br/><br/>The real problem is, why do we care?. The first thing any writer or director must do is capture the INTEREST of the audience. We cannot care about these empty, coke-snorting characters, because they are one-dimensional. Overall, that is not the fault of the actor. The writer and director should oversee what they are projecting; and whether it does or doesn't work. This doesn't.<br/><br/>Even ""Boogie Nghts"" at least had Philip Seymour Hoffman, an excellent actor. Rent that film, don't bother to watch this."

","Dull, boring story about the legendary Studio 54 and one of its owners, Steve Rubell (played by Mike Meyers).  It also deals with three other people played by Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek and Breckin Meyer.  What their names were, I don't remember...mostly because there's absolutely nothing going on here.<br/><br/>Purportedly, the original version was much stronger--so strong with sex and drug use that it was threatened with an NC-17.  Then test audiences reacted VERY negatively to the extreme stuff (a gay kiss was completely cut out). What came out was a seriously watered down version of what might have been a good movie.  I HATE those stupid test audiences!!  I was actually in Studio 54 back in 1980--what I saw there was in NO way portrayed in the movie.  The drug use was out in the open and there were people (literally) having sex--gay and straight!  That's not shown here in any way.<br/><br/>Phillippe (as the lead) was terrible.  He is handsome and muscular but has a blank face on all the time.  Hayek is good but given nothing to do.  Ditto with Meyer (who's VERY good).  Neve Campbell barely even registered.  Myers is (surprisingly) very good in a dramatic role.  The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for him.  Also there are a few good songs (especially ""If You Could Read My Mind"").<br/><br/>But, basically, this movie is so light and inconseqential that I forgot about it the next day!  A waste.

"The-Sarkologist","4","0","1","20 July 2019"," Another One of those Films
","This is another one of those films that I am not really all that sure why I wanted to watch it. I guess in part I wanted to watch a film about hedonism in the late 70s, particularly during the disco era, mostly because I've sort of experience the rave era of the beginning of the 20th century, and in part wanted to get a taste of it. Maybe in another sense I really wanted something a little more retro in feel, though of course this film was released in 1998, so it is definitely not retro in that regards.<br/><br/>The film is basically about this rather infamous nightclub in New York called Studio 54. Basically, it was the place that pretty much everybody wanted to get into, but unless you were really famous, had oodles of money, or the owner, Steve Rubell, thought that you were drop dead gorgeous, and wanted you to be a part of his club. Well, that is basically what happened with this guy from Jersey city - Shane.<br/><br/>He was young, and Jersey city really isn't a place that is renowned for its nightlife, particularly since you happen to have New York just across the river. As such, one night they decide to ditch this town and decide to go and check out the big city. Well, while standing out the front, amongst the crowds trying to get into Studio 54, he is noticed by Steve and called over. Mind you, he wants him to enter, as long as he removes his shirt, so he does so, and thus his life changes.<br/><br/>Well, it changes in the sense that he comes back and manages to score himself a job there. He starts off as a bus boy, that is he collects bottles, and eventually makes his way up to the position of bartender. Apparently if you work in this club thenn, well, you do actually get paid a pretty decent amount of money, and that is on top of the tips, and all of the goodies that the drugged out patrons tend to leave behind. Oh, and this isn't just a job, it is actually one long big party.<br/><br/>Yeah, this is a film about hedonism, and in many cases we know where it is heading. Sure, not all films about hedonism have bad endings, but we do tend to know what eventually came from the club, namely that the IRS shut it down. Apparently the version I watched ended with Shane and his friends making up after Rubell was arrested, but I get the feeling that there are versions of this film that have much more happening at the end, namely that once Rubell is taken out of the picture, and Studio 54 shut down, then a number of other clubs start up on a similar theme, which means that once Rubell is released from gaol, he finds that he can no longer compete.<br/><br/>Look, it turned out that this film was, well, pretty bad. It is pretty much similar to a lot of other hedonistic movies out there, namely about a guy that pretty much makes it big because of his looks, and then it all crashes down around him. Mind you, it didn't really do all that well at the cinemas, but that was probably because it was heavily cut. However, it has since been making a resurgance, especially since the footage has been moved about a bit. Still, it really wasn't one of those films that particularly impressed me all that much."
"wilsonstuart-32346","6","0","1","29 December 2018"," Infernal Disco
","The irony that my 54th review should be on this film....<br/><br/>As a big fan of Salma Hayek I had a long wait for '54', one of a slew of late 1990's projects that examined the decadent and excessive 1970s club scene. If Boogie Nights (a personal favourite of mine) set the pace, what could I expect from a high powered cast of (mostly) then favourites and a young director who was considered to be in the rise?<br/><br/>Truth be told, I found 54 something of a frustrating experience. This ought to have been a powerhouse drama, with a dream back story, and an equally able cast. Yet it never really ignites the way it ought to have done. Firstly, there was not enough focus on Mike Meyers's ruthless, materialistic club svengali. It was a pity that Meyers never sought to build on this dramatic success, instead opting to spend the remainder of the decade in misfiring comedies (Austin Powers excepted); had 54 concentrated on the relationship with an effective Ryan Philippe - tailor made for a pretty boy reliant on looks and shallow charm- then this might have been a different film. Phillippe manages to a fair job here, but cannot quite make the effort required to stamp himself on proceedings.<br/><br/>Instead, there's too much emphasis on a tepid 'love triangle' between the underwritten Salma Hayek (who later disowned the role - nothing particularly wrong with her effort but see above), and a hopeless Breckin Meyer. Meyer's hapless everyman routine is fine in the likes of Road Trip or Rat Race, but he totally lacks either looks, charisma or credibility that his role demands. Neve Campbell puts in little more than a glofied cameo; sorry to say, but almost anyone could have played her part.<br/><br/>I'm not being overly harsh or unfair. This is not a disaster by any stretch of the imagination, but I honestly felt that it could have been better. It makes a fair stab in terms of atmosphere and pathos, but I just felt it was lacking in certain areas where the likes of Boogie Nights, Go or even Party Monster succeeded. I understand that there's cut footage/deleted scenes out that there that may have made a major impact on the storyline - perhaps the kind of impact that Mark Christopher, Salma Hayek and Ryan Phillipe intended (perhaps). Until this material is properly assessed, I'm only reluctantly willing to endorse 54. A bit like that party you were looking forward to going to. You know, the one that never quite got started?"

Isn't that what happens to Dirk Diggler in the days of disco fever in Boogie nights.  How much people don't want to believe this it's true.   Ryan Philippe is a very good actor but he is also a bad one.   Antitrust, White Squall and the excellent The Way of the Gun are his only great performances but the others he just tries to hard to give a great performance and it shows in 54.   Salma Hayek is not need at all as did Neve Campbell whose career was dying with the Scream sequels as this just helped her on the way.   Mike Myers proves that he can act just as much as he can make people laugh and was the only thing good about this film and was the only reason it probably got made.<br/><br/>Disappointing film that tried to jump the bandwagon but couldn't even hold on."

","This is a pretty standard telling of Studio 54, a nightclub that I never heard of but was apparently famous in New York. Frankly there just isn't much exciting in the movie. People dance, people party, people drink and do drugs. I'm not a stickler for stories with conventional story arks, but something of interest should happen on screen. This movie just plays it by the book. Ryan Phillip is pretty good in his role. Neve Campbell as usual has absolutely no chemistry with her fellow actors. <br/><br/>In contrast, 24 Hour Party People is witty, imaginative, and absolutely alive with characters.

","54 is a great movie for nostalgia pundits such as myself. It is an affectionately made journey through the looking glass to back to the late 70's and early 80's. It has a great soundtrack and enjoyable performances by Ryan Philippe, Selma Hyack and the like. Of course the man who steals the show is Mike Myers who is hillarious as Steve Rubell. The Script centres alot of the attention on Myers and Rubell, because he is quite simply the most interesting of the ensemble characters in the movie. I dont know too much about Rubell but Myers manages to make him a likeable character despite being nothing short of a bastard. Where the movie lets it's self down is that there is practically no style to the direction or even the script, so we dont see anything we havent seen before. Philippe's opening narration goes for a Goodfella's style feel, while the movie tries mercifully to drag it's self out of the shadow of Boogie Nights. Director Mark Christopher seems to be trying to hold back the feeling of excess instead of succumbing to what is natural. This is a pity because the movie could have benefited alot more from doing just that. Overall though, as it stands 54 is an enjoyable, watchable -Grade Mike Myers showcase with some great tracks {Knock on Wood for one} and some solid performances."

","My older sister was part of the 54 crowd and after seeing the movie, she looked at me and shook her head silently, her mouth turned down into a look of disgust. She asked me if the director had ever even been there. I had seen an interview on MTV with him where he said he hadn't ever been and I think that's where the problem lies with this movie. I rented this one on VHS and afterwards, I couldn't help feeling like this was given to the wrong guy to direct. No offense to anyone but the movie was obviously directed by a gay guy who was more interested in filming how hot the men looked than in the actual club itself. I don't mind seeing that kind of stuff in movies but in this one it just seemed like the focus was mainly set on that aspect of the era and I felt that not enough attention was being paid to the myth of the club. As you may or may not know, Studio 54 was a legend in it's own time. There was a lot more that could have been done with this movie, other than release this hack product. This could have been an epic masterpiece, not an undernourished crock. Come on, how could this movie clock in at just above an hour and a half? This could have easily been an entertaining three hour movie that would have covered the rise and fall of this famous nightspot in rich detail. It seems that no one else involved with the movie thought so because the movie seems preoccupied with meaningless accuracies and weak characters. This movie just could have been something special. Hell, Boogie Nights got it right. They should have let Paul Thomas Anderson do this one, he probably would've turned something out that would've been watchable. Maybe it wasn't the director's fault, maybe it was the work of meddling producers that caused this film to explode but I can honestly say that just from the endless stories my sis had told me of 54, they got this one all wrong. Maybe we'll see another 54 film in the future but after this crockery, I doubt anyone will get excited about it with the taste of this one still lingering. The acting by nearly all of the principals is horrendous. I like Ryan Philiipe actually but not here. Way of the Gun was more like it. Neve Campbell seems to have exhausted her bag of tricks because I thought she was still playing Sydney from Scream. The only positive thing I can possibly say is that the movie has a great soundtrack, even though it could've used a couple more tracks that 54 was known to play regularly. It's a little run-of-the-mill but contains a couple of the essentials. And lastly, Mike Myers delivers a knockout performance that hints at what this movie could have been if it had been done properly. He's the only one that walks out of this one unscathed. Everyone else, head to the showers and take a bath cause you stink! I didn't even rewind the tape when I brought it back to the video store that's how disgusted I was! I will never watch this horse pucky again. Unless, I wish to inflict further trauma on my already damaged brain. And I'll say it again, with the exception of Mike Myers, if you were involved in any way with the making of this film, take a bath cause you stink!

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","1","4 July 2002"," Welcome to the Party - shame this movie doesn't make us give a fig about it.
","'54' is about 'Studio 54' a night club and, in particular, one young man who works there - Shane O'Shea (played by the stunning Ryan Phillippe). Shane is dissatisfied with his homelife, as young male movie protagonists are wont to be, so he decides to work in the New York club everyone is raving about - 'Studio 54'. Getting in on the salacious looks of 54's boss, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), Shane gets to meet a variety of people and experience a life of new excesses, which will shape his whole life - because it would be a boring movie if they did not.<br/><br/>Right the problem with '54' is that. well we never get much of a feel for the titular place. '54' was, apparently, a place of hedonism, of pushing the boundaries of pleasure and so forth - the movie instead presents us with a slightly risqu√É¬© club, but nothing shocking or, more pointedly, memorable about it. Yes there're drugs - ohhh! Scary! Yes sex occurs - but in a low-key tame manner. Yes there's some glitz in the club - but hardly anything spectacular. So the quintessential heart of the movie isn't really beating - it's up to the characters to try and keep the body pumping. Unfortunately, with one exception, they're all rather dull. Shsne doesn't really do much except Fall For Girl Who He Should Not Fall For - a stock plot device that's tired. He forms a few friendships but they're never all that convincing. Is this a fault of Phillipe? Probably not because he can rise above being a very very pretty face (which is what he's in this movie for). His friend, Greg (Breckin Meyer), is dull and Greg's girlfriend Anita (Selma Hayek in an unworthy performance), is - in her thin sketchedness - a perfect companion. It's only Myers performance as Rubell that we see an actual character forming - this being clearly Myers' best performance, with a great touch of eternal sadness invested into the character that allows him to command the movie any time he is on screen.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Mark Christopher, this movie was apparently not what the director originally intended. Certainly there doesn't seem to be much of a vision here, as the movie ambles along to a somewhat obvious and certainly bland conclusion (admittedly, being based on fact it had no choice - that doesn't mean we have to be bored on the journey). There's nothing stand out about any of Christopher's work here. it doesn't really show any spirit but it's certainly no `Battlefield Earth'. Perhaps if his original picture was intact - which purported to really give us a flavour of '54'  and the people - then this movie would be decent. As it is it's fairly bland, saved only by the eye candy of the male and female leads. 3/10."

Ryan Phillippe seemed to be lost in his role, while Neve Campbell seemed real dis-interested. Salma Hayek done the best with the role she was given.

","Despite negative reviews, I liked this movie. I think the reason I had a problem with movies like ""Titanic"" and ""Forrest Gump"" was because of all the hype--when I finally got to see them they just didn't live up to all the praise they received. I was let down. I think the opposite happened here--I wasn't expecting much, a mediocre movie at best--and as a result enjoyed the movie. Not a great movie, by no means--not even as good as ""Boogie Nights,"" which it parallels, and yet entertaining in its own right. Ryan Phillippe has taken more criticism for his ""poor"" acting than he deserves--I thought he was quite effective as the naive, sensitive and not-too-bright Shane O'Shea who thinks he's made it big until the sh** hits the fan; if you've spent any time around adolescents from northern New Jersey, they do sound just like this. He was very likeable and sympathetic (not to mention very nice to look at). Neve Campbell also did a fine job as Shane's love interest, but I think the romance could have been better developed (the fault of the movie being too short to really develop *any* characters enough). And I definitely agree that the very funny and talented Mike Myers did not have nearly enough to do--his Steve Rubell was humorous and tragic at the same time--and you wanted to see more of him. The soundtrack was good, but the dance-floor scenes were somehow lack-luster, and had the feel of a daytime soap. I think if the movie had been longer, a lot of these problems would have been solved. I think Ryan Phillippe has a lot of potential as a dramatic actor--once you look past the ""dumb blond"" persona he presents here. Not a great movie by any means, but much better than you've probably heard. Give this movie a chance!"

There are funny moments with Disco Dottie but Ryan Phillippe's story, and his friends', simply did not keep me glued to my screen.

Evidently, New Jersey is a low-brow sort of place where Cro-Magnon men take their cave-girl dates out for beef jerky and slurpees.<br/><br/>After several sub-plots that painfully go nowhere, Shane ends up as a bartender - a job that keeps his pocket piccolo happy and many crotch crickets in his pants. Everyone with ambition and no acting ability wants to be a Studio 54 barman because this is where the women and drugs flow as freely as Mark Christopher's idiotic dialogue and contrived situations.<br/><br/>Shane, (who bears a striking similarity to Christopher Atkins) meets Anita, (Salma Hayek) who wants to be Patti Labelle but without the talent - the kind of aspiring star-to-be that appears fascinated by popping champagne corks, rockets blasting off, cucumbers and trains rushing through tunnels.<br/><br/>Anita is married to this half-pint wingnut who doesn't really have any relevance to the overall story but successfully provides a series of unplanned annoyances. Then there's the club owner, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) who is having trouble with a collection of bad suits from the Internal Revenue Service.

Studio 54 comes across as nothing more than a New York bag shanty where the mezzanine floor is reserved for a bit of blanket drill while the showbiz elite have a place to demonstrate their comatose wit.<br/><br/>This movie has all the steamy sex of 'Better Homes and Gardens' and by the time Neve Campbell is required to deliver lines, I was ready to cough up a phlegm ball.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe displays no redeeming qualities required for a leading man and Mike Myers is completely squandered as the strange and enigmatic Rubell. However, he does have a moment or two and is the only reason this movie rates its one star.

","I watched this movie because this summer I was in New York and I went to see the show ""Cabaret"" at Studio 54, so I wanted to see what the club was like in its 70s heyday when, according to what I'd read, it was an illicit sex and drugs den, as well as being New York's hottest nightspot. But the movie seemed very tame and watered down - it was hinted that a lot of sex went on, and that drugs were rife, but it didn't depict this very realistically. The plot centered around Shane (Ryan Phillipe), a kid from New Jersey who ends up working at 54, and gets sucked into the whole lifestyle surrounding it. Phillipe's performance was satisfactory, but by no means outstanding. In fact the only good performance was by Mike Myers as 54's owner, Steve Rubell, who comes across as a kid who never really grew up, and never wanted the party of youth to end. Myers' performance is stunning, and you totally forget he ever played Austin Powers, which is how it should be! The rest of the supporting cast was disappointingly mediocre, as was most of the movie. It seemed to lack a certain something, and the plot was very choppy - it was obvious that some storylines were developed, but then never properly concluded. Overall, I'd say if you want to see a good movie about the 70s club scene, see ""Saturday Night Fever"" - it's more realistic, has a better storyline, better developed characters, better acting, and last of all, better music!"
