","When Logan heard that his comic book would work in a similar way, my expectation was a little more. Later Logan's first trailer ended me. The tone of the trailers, the selected music, the intensity of the emotion was superb. I did not get my eye from X-23 in action scenes. Very good performance. <br/><br/>Sir Patrick Stewart, like Hugh Jackman, is the last time to portray the role of the X-Men in the universe. And gave a very good feeling and left the film with more drama.<br/><br/>Logan, beyond his superhero films, a fickle old and sick man. He is constantly showing the struggle with himself. Unlike other films, violence and action are not adorned with visual effects, they are given in a very hard and realistic way. These old mutants are trying to save the children to make the world a better place.<br/><br/>It's an action that will be an Oscar nominee from Hugh Jackman. Logan, it's a goodbye we cannot forget for a long time. 9/10"
"NpMoviez","8","37","48","1 September 2019"," A nice revisionist western ending to Wolverine saga
","Wolverine is perhaps the most beloved character from X-Men film series, but his solo outings have been the most forgettable and/or totally stupid. Thankfully, we have Logan to break that trend. Still have issues with it, but I would acknowledge that it was one of the best films in X-Men series.<br/><br/>Good : Hugh Jackman gives the most intense and gritty performance as Wolverine in his final film role as the adamantium clawed mutant. I have always loved him as Wolverine, but he has never been so good. Patrick Stewart does the same in his final role as Charles Xavier, and in his part, there's nothing to complain either. Dafne Keen as Laura - owns the film. Loved the kid as baby/lady Wolverine (X-23). The setting feels really different in this movie, compared to those of other X-Men films. It is obvious that they gave a Revisionist Western tone to the movie, which hasn't been done in the genre so far. It acknowledged the fact that it was inspired by Unforgiven, The Wrestler and Shane, which if had not been done, would've made it look like a ripoff. Not a total waste of a film, it has good parts, but still a copied idea without acknowledgement seems bad. Then, there is action. The actions are the best ones in the entire X-Men film series. The choreography is great to say the least. It looks badass, savage and intense. But there's one thing that this film does with action which most action films don't with these days. And that is, have the actions mean something. Every action scene has a purpose. It either sets up a characterization, or aggressively portrays what a character is feeling. Acting, action and the overall story won't disappoint. Also, all the characters are interesting.<br/><br/>Mixed : There are some story issues. It feels as if there is a huge story that needs to be told between the altered timeline of DoFP and Logan. We get tiny little expositions for that matter and sound like much more interesting ideas for a better X-Men Apocalypse movie. This made the largely different characterizations feel totally out of place, for both Xavier and Logan. It works for the movie, I like it, but I don't buy it. It felt a lot out of the place and quite confusing with why they were so different. With all the movies in the series, I don't think they have given all the character development necessary for those changes.<br/><br/>Bad : Mostly, it's the villain and some logic issues. There's a video narration/exposition which looked professionally edited with great voiceover, but was by a nurse who didn't even have 12 hours to do it, keeping aside the resources. Xander Rice doesn't feel so good of a villain. Nothing to blame Richard Grant, but just not a compelling villain. X-24 does have a frightening presence, I acknowledge that. But all his likeability depends upon the character arc of Wolverine over the years. Just take out the ""humane"" part of the character of Wolverine, and replace it with Terminator's menace. You'll get X-24.<br/><br/>Conclusion : It's a good goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. You can get the unpleasant satisfaction of seeing him die, and it does hit emotional notes a number of times and feel really saddening. But there are story and characterization issues which cannot be overlooked and to be honest, do not make a good sense.<br/><br/>Rating.<br/><br/>Score : 8.2/10<br/><br/>Grade : A-"
"badmanlykme","10","567","896","18 February 2017"," Logan is everything you wanted it to be and more
","Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.<br/><br/>Logan presents us with Logan (Wolverine), Professor X and Laura (X-23) and by definition its an escort mission involving X-23 but shes more capable than Logan and Professor X thinks and shes able to fend for herself. Logan is old and a grizzled shadow of what he once was and by going on this mission he unlocks some of the old wolverine inside of him and we see bursts of that throughout the movie, Logan also begins to realize things about himself through the vision of this little girl because they have striking similarities.<br/><br/>Every scene in this film feels necessary from the character development to the humor and action nothing is forced everything comes off natural which is a breath of fresh air and I was very pleased with it, I believe that this movie will be very well received by fans as it treats its characters with such care and embarks on an emotional and satisfying conclusion to Hugh Jackmans Logan (Wolverine)."
"TheJediWay9","10","535","846","2 March 2017"," Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, ""Logan"" is the Wolverine film fans have been waiting for
","""Logan"" is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, ""Logan"" was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.<br/><br/>If you are going into ""Logan"" expecting every scene to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. ""Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really ""her"" movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance. Yeah the dude gave it his all. This is by far Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. The conviction from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with the filmmakers on set.<br/><br/>This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. It is brutally violent, by far the most violent X-Men film w have gotten. Wolverine hacks, claws, and slashes his way through skirmishes with blood, guts, and gore flying. If this is what you had always wanted from a Wolverine movie and haven't gotten it up to this point, well this movie gives you all of that. <br/><br/>From a violence standpoint, the violence is there when the film calls for it. It is not violent for the sake of being violent. This is a film that puts its characters and story first before anything else, with violence being a secondary element to help propel the story along and to create tension. It is in the scenes where it should be. If this were just an all-out 2 hour and 20 minute ""hack-and-slash"" fest this film would have no depth to it. It would look cool, but giving Hugh Jackman the proper sendoff was what was more important in a film like this.<br/><br/>This film at times gets downright emotional. The final scene of the film makes you wanna cry. You care about these characters, you are invested in them. You don't want to see them put in harm's way. Even in the scenes where the film may feel a bit slow, the final act of the film is the payoff. This is where everything really meshes together with a force, creating a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat final sendoff for Hugh Jackman as he retires from the role. <br/><br/>This is by far the best Wolverine movie and possibly the best X-Men movie to date. I haven't decided yet. It's up there, and it deserves to be. Everything payed off in this film. It is emotional. It is character driven. It has heart. It is emotional. This is everything anyone could have wanted in a Wolverine film.<br/><br/>From me ""Logan"" gets a perfect 10/10."

"trublu215","10","426","733","23 February 2017"," If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.
","The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. <br/><br/>The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.<br/><br/>Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation."
"shawneofthedead","9","254","476","1 March 2017"," A fine, fitting farewell to an iconic character, LOGAN is one of the best superhero movies ever made.
","Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core. <br/><br/>Set in a grim near-future where very few mutants remain alive, we meet an unthinkable incarnation of our favourite enclawed superhero: one who's decidedly past his prime. This is not the near-immortal Wolverine we remember, but Logan (Jackman): a broken, far older man who feels the weight of every wound inflicted upon him. His once- formidable body – tattooed with scars that aren't healing as fast or as well as they used to – seems to be failing. It's only his determination to keep the ailing, ageing Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) safe and alive that never falters. <br/><br/>The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story.<br/><br/>In effect, Mangold has placed an intimate family drama squarely at the heart of this ostensible blockbuster film – strip the characters of their superpowers and LOGAN would still pulse with plenty of heartbreak and humanity. Logan keeps dragging himself through the world when one suspects all he wants to do is die. Xavier grapples with his own frailty as his once-sharp mind deteriorates and betrays him, again and again. Laura is a tough, tender mess of contradictions: a victim of horrific abuse but also a warrior in the making. Watching them interact – fighting, screaming, arguing, glaring and, once in a while, forgiving – will elicit laughter and tears (lots of tears), in a way that no other superhero film to date has quire managed.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean, however, that LOGAN is an entirely joyless, sombre affair. Far from it. It proves, quite conclusively, that films in this genre can plumb the darkest of psychological depths while finding welcome ways to leaven the misery. (Note: this is something Zack Snyder would do well to learn as he continues to expand DC's largely mirthless cinematic universe.) Mangold threads moments of genuine humour into the proceedings – from casual shoplifting and runaway horses, to an ornery old man who refuses to take his pills. <br/><br/>The fast and furious action beats in LOGAN are also quite delightful to witness. The violence that's on full, bloody display is dark and horrible, but somehow fitting for this film in which there really are consequences for battles fought and lost. It's only when you see Logan's claws plunging into flesh, shearing cleanly through meat and bone, that you realise just how neutered and family-friendly his earlier outings were. There's a slow-motion sequence halfway through the film, as Logan struggles to get to an embattled Xavier, that's gritty and beautiful to watch – as thrilling as that scene-stealing Quicksilver moment in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And it goes without saying that watching Laura gracefully spin and slice her way through oncoming attackers manages to be terribly wrong and wonderfully right at the same time. <br/><br/>To be quite frank, none of this would work without the incredible cast, all of them doing award-worthy work that will, sadly, be overlooked because their characters have such silly things as 'powers'. It's truly unsettling to watch Stewart dig beneath his natural gravitas to find the shaken core of a Professor X who's semi-consciously losing grip of his mind – the best and most dangerous mind in the universe. Keen is a revelation. Grabbing this breakout role by the throat and making it very much her own, she somehow manages to convey Laura's childish fragility and overpowering strength, often in the same breath. <br/><br/>And, finally, there's Jackman. He's been training for and playing the role that catapulted him to global stardom for 17 years now, and he brings everything he has to this final outing as Logan. He nails Logan's physical tics, of course: from his grizzled and aged demeanour, to his rattling cough and copious drinking. But Jackman also takes delight in unearthing the dark sadness at the heart of this once invincible, now vulnerable man. There is a hope and purity in Logan that doesn't always show through his wisecracks, but it shines brightly and unexpectedly here – often in the film's saddest moments. <br/><br/>There are a handful of things about the film don't work quite so well. The main antagonists, played by Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook, are largely forgettable – there's not much that defines them outside their nefarious goals. As many viewers may be turned off by Logan's relentless misery and eye-popping violence as those who welcome it.<br/><br/>But this doesn't detract from the fact that LOGAN is a remarkable achievement. It manages to be several things at once: a bruising action film, a tender family drama and an intimate character study, liberally shaken through with comic-book sensibilities and a Western or two. If Jackman really is hanging up his claws for good, there could be no better way to bid farewell to one of Marvel's most enduring and appealing characters."
"UMWolvie2442","Null","337","646","18 February 2017"," Just A Flat Out MASTERPIECE!
","Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.<br/><br/>How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres. <br/><br/>Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. <br/><br/>This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.<br/><br/>This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other ""dark"" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves. <br/><br/>I loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run."

"jcardella1","10","128","245","30 May 2017"," The Best Wolverine Movie, Hands Down!
","This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. ""Logan"", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.<br/><br/>This is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!"
"Ramascreen","10","144","299","17 February 2017"," A character-driven superhero film done right!
","LOGAN is brutal, merciless and powerful. This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it's better than many of the previous X-Men installments and spinoffs. And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie, then my goodness, what a helluva way to go out in a blaze of glory.<br/><br/>The story is set in the near future, mutants are thinning out. They've either died or been hunted down. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) healing power is not as strong as it used to be. He's old and weary and taking care of professor X (Patrick Stewart) in a hideout on the Mexican border, accompanied by Caliban (Stephen Merchant). But their attempt to hide from the world gets interrupted when dark forces arrive at their doorstep looking for a certain young little girl.<br/><br/>Great move on the studio's and filmmakers' part to have this film be rated R because what we get here is Wolverine unleashed. The violence is as graphic and fully exposed as you can imagine it to be. So just that aspect alone will excite the fanbase who's been wanting to see the destruction that could take place when Wolverine is really really angry. Setting it on the border does allow the film to play with certain tones and color palette reminiscent to ""Breaking Bad"" for example, the film's ending however does provide a more vibrant environment as a base for an extremely bloody collision.<br/><br/>The writing is solid for a superhero film, it really digs deep into these beloved characters, how vulnerable they are, how they long for a world where people would just leave them be. You truly feel for Xavier and Logan in a way that you never did in the previous X-Men movies, not only because they're now in their twilight years but there's also that father-son type of relationship that's tough love and endearing and then there's also the reluctant father daughter connection Logan has with X-23. By the way, the little girl, Dafne Keen, who plays X-23 is remarkable. So much force, so much energy, so much roar, she's like a cheetah that just runs and slices and dices left and right without prejudice, what an incredible young talent. This is a movie that gives you action to its fullest degree and an emotional journey that's uncompromising. The perfect film about the man who's the best at what he does but what he does isn't very nice."
"GomezAddams666","9","183","389","27 February 2017"," Knocked it out of the park
","LOGAN - SPOILER FREE REVIEW<br/><br/>As most of you are aware I have not been a huge fan of the latest X- Men outings, but THIS WAS AWESOME!<br/><br/>In a rather bleak entry we see a Post X-Men Logan, something has happened and the mutants no longer exist or there is a few of them out there. Director James Mangold chose to make the film almost colorless with much, much more character development than previous Wolverine and X-Men movies. We see a tired character that no longer belongs in a world that has feared him for over a century.<br/><br/>While Hugh Jackman in his last outing as Logan does an amazing job and proves once and for all why NO ONE ELSE can ever be Wolverine, the supporting cast does a superb job as well starting with Sir Patrick Stuart who returns as Charles Xavier, Boyd Holbrook (Netflix's NARCOS) as an astounding and dangerous antagonist and newcomer Dafne Keen who is a rather sweet but incredibly deadly Weapon X-23.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with gore and violence, but it does not feel forced at all in such an obscure movie. There is a rather new trend in Comic Book Movies after DEADPOOL, make them as brutal as possible, and while this started in the 90s with THE CROW and BLADE it has gained some track and more R Rated CBM are being developed as we speak.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend it."
"Her-Excellency","6","267","585","17 March 2017"," Such a sad farewell.
","I really can't get how in the world people are rating this movie as highly as they are. You would think they have never seen this done, and done better.<br/><br/>Yes, I understand that Logan is a heartfelt character dear to us, but THINK people! For that very same reason we should be holding this movie to a higher standard, and not giving it an emotional pass.<br/><br/>To, me, this film was slow and depressing a-la No Country For Old Men, without ANY of the Oscar-worthiness. It was just droll, SUPER PREDICTABLE, moronic in its' execution and so very far-fetched. (Yes, imagine saying 'far-fetched' for a movie based on a comic)! They spun and bent a bunch of things to get them to where they were in the year 2029 and tried to make it believable (it wasn't). Then, they try to impress upon your heartstrings Logan's connection or ties to the little girl, but the connection or ties are SILLY at best. Not only the supposed ties between them are silly, but the entire plot is full of silly holes.<br/><br/>Not SILLY, you say? Let me get this straight ... you are trying like hell to get away from the bad guys, and ummmmm, you STOP FOR A MINI VACATION - not ONCE, but TWICE, and put hundreds of strangers in jeopardy the first time, and a nice family in danger the second time? Yeah, sure. Seriously, anyone who could get over that gaping ridiculousness and who can, after that, in good conscience give this movie anything above a 6 is just messing with you or has total fan-boy blinders on. <br/><br/>As for the little girl, god, she was annoying and aggravating AF and 80% of her screen time was spent shrieking. Nooo, not screaming. SHRIEKING.<br/><br/>The rest of the acting was good. The members of the family they added as filler in the middle of the movie were the only ones IMO that you kind of cared about. Even old Professor X had seen better days and you kind of wanted it to be over for him. It was just painful to watch, and I don't mean in a moving way where the film is made better, but in a painful oh god, kill him off already way.<br/><br/>*** BIG SPOILERS BELOW *** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE OR ARE PLANNING ON SEEING IT!!!<br/><br/>The ending was unreal in how bad it was. Without giving too much away ... you have one little girl who is able to take out like 10-12 guys, PLUS you have Wolverine, PLUS a BUNCH of other mutant kids who have varying degrees of mutant abilities, and yet they can't take out a small group of bad guys? <br/><br/>W T H ?<br/><br/>As for Hugh Jackman, he was good and played Logan like he always has done except maybe this time he looked older and more tired which was a good thing because it translated unto the screen and gave Wolverine some credibility. Otherwise he was just there. The gushing over his acting this time around IMO is unwarranted, as he really didn't do anything that much different than he has on every other X-Men movie and if anyone disagrees, I defy them to point out what. Props also to the action in the film, and to how it was filmed. The action scenes alone are what I imagine 'made' the movie for most people. <br/><br/>All in all, I wasn't impressed. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a horribly BAD movie, I just don't agree that it was very good and I really don't agree with the overrating or the assessment that it is in ANY way a ""masterpiece"". If you look at it just on paper, you would think that the people that are reacting to it in such a way have ONLY EVER watched comic-book movies in their lives and have now seen a drama sold as a comic-book movie and their brains are exploding as they process it as innovative and different.<br/><br/>In closing, I understand that Hugh Jackman is getting older, and the great dilemma was 'how exactly do you keep making movies with an actor who is aging, playing a character who is supposed to rejuvenate or heal'? You don't. You kindly retire the character, as the creators of the franchise have chosen to do. The thing is, they could have really made it to where it wasn't SO depressing and/or bleak with no real outlook toward the future except a bunch of kids you are NOT at all INVESTED in, or care one iota about. <br/><br/>A bad ending for a good character, was just bad cinema. RIP Logan. hopefully, at some point you will miraculously resurrect so that you can be given the farewell you deserve. <br/><br/>My actual rating is 6.5-7/10, but some reviewers have gone over the top crazy with the 10s."
"alva3901","10","94","197","16 March 2017"," A masterfully orchestrated film
","The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of ""The Wolverine"" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.<br/><br/>When I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"", I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come. <br/><br/>The introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn't say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.<br/><br/>Lastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman. <br/><br/>Overall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe."
"jherrick-6-991336","4","373","849","10 March 2017"," Disappointment
","I look at ""Logan"" as the ""Alien 3"" of the X-Men franchise. It basically gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it (""Days of Future Past"") accomplished. In ""DOFP"", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film ""Logan"", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of ""Logan"" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film.<br/><br/>""Logan"" is annoyingly low on information. We are thrown into this terribly depressing future without a whole lot of explaining as to how we got here. As I watched, I kept waiting for a scene where things were laid down for the audience. It never came. The best we got were a few vague references here and there. There was something called ""The Westchester Incident"", but the reference was so fleeting that I barely caught it. There was also another part near the end where the main villain claims that he had something to do with the lack of new mutants being born and that he is Striker's son? I think? It wasn't very clear plus the dude's last name wasn't actually Striker, which further confused the issue. Later on, I hopped online and had a few things clarified (such as the ""Westchester Incident""), but why weren't they clearer in the film in the first place?<br/><br/>Another issue I have with this film is how it treats the deaths of its two main characters. First, with Xavier, he is stabbed unceremoniously by a clone of Logan about two-thirds the way through the movie. There are no heroics in this death, no greater purpose, no meaning. He's just stabbed and then dies. What a disservice to such an incredible and important character to this franchise. <br/><br/>Then there is Logan's death. Logan is impaled by a chunk of wood from a dead tree. The dude literally has a skeleton made out of adamantium, which is the world's most indestructible metal, but yet wood cuts right through it. What? Now, we are shown through the film that Logan is sick and his ability to heal is getting worse, but that shouldn't affect his crazy metal ribcage! They even go to great lengths to explain that the only thing that can really kill him is an adamantium bullet, but in the end a hunk of wood does just as well.<br/><br/>Then there is the ""R"" rating. Once again, if this were a true stand-alone movie and not part of a larger narrative, I'd mostly be OK with it. But of course it isn't. Everything that we got with the ""R"" rating was unnecessary. What we got was far more blood and gore (there was more than one decapitation), a dump truck full of f-bombs and even one scene where a woman in a bridal shower flashed her boobs. All of this could have been edited out and the film would have been fine.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies, heard plenty of f- bombs and seen plenty of nakedness on film. I'm fine with it, but it has to be there for a good reason. I didn't see a whole lot of good reason here. What really did it for me, though, was seeing a 10-11 year old girl running around slashing off people's body parts. That got to be a bit much for my taste and I began to wonder for whom that kind of stuff didn't bother? Once again, does our society have a bit of a violence fetish, one that has gotten so bad that watching children tear people to shreds is OK? <br/><br/>I think the reason for the rating has more to do with a popular trend in movies (especially comic book movies) nowadays than it does with serving this particular story. With the success of ""Deadpool"" last year, film studios realized that an R-rated super hero film is not only possible, but profitable. But as Malcolm hinted at in the movie ""Jurassic Park"", just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean that you SHOULD. For ""Deadpool"" it works. You can't do ""Deadpool"" without all that R-rated stuff. That is who ""Deadpool"" is and that's fine. With Wolverine, however, he's already been established throughout the previous 8 X-Men films. All of these R-rated ""upgrades"" now don't make a whole lot of sense.<br/><br/>When I read positive reviews for this film, the main point that is made is how good the dramatic performances are, especially from the two leads, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. In this case, I completely agree. They did a fantastic job. Even the little girl was amazing, I thought. That can be quite a rarity when you think about how hit and miss child actors are. However, even though most of the performances here are top notch, great performances do not a great film make. If the story sucks, what does it matter? <br/><br/>It is hard for me to imagine why Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman would be excited to work on a project like ""Logan"" once they read the script. Were they excited to basically negate all of the great work they did (and others did) in the previous X-Men films? They, better than anyone else, should understand what this whole series has been about since the beginning. Yes, ""Logan"" is unique and absolutely gave these actors something different to do with their characters. And yes, they gave stellar performances. However, there needs to be at least a little bit of respect for the source material (and its fans) than this. Much like the season premier of ""The Walking Dead"" this past fall, this seemed more like a kick in the pants for viewers than anything else."
"dhxmansarbajna","9","133","288","4 March 2017"," Hugh Jackman's swansong is as beautiful as it gets
","James Mangold's Logan (8.5/10) About forty seconds into the movie, you confront a bloody Logan who isn't able to stand up while puny thugs decide to assault The Wolverine. And somewhere deep inside you feel a little uncomfortable. Probably because all you have seen Hugh Jackman do in the previous nine installments is watch the healing and indestructive Wolverine fend off anything that weakens him with utmost ease. It all fall aparts in Logan, Wolverine's swansong and an enigmatic crossroad of fear, uncertainty and reality. Wolverine is at his most vulnerable self here and yet far more courageous than all the rest of the X Men movies put together. And this is what makes Logan an extremely compelling watch; the chance and ability to finally empathize with a 'superhero' in a much finer sense and to witness whether they possess the same fortitude once their 'gift' has been taken away from them. Logan, set in 2029, narrates the endeavour of Wolverine, as he drives through the rocky, dusty terrains of El Paso with Laura, a mutant, blessed (with the same powers that he has) who needs to be sent somewhere safe. Along with her is a rugged, dying and somber Charles Xavier who wants to make sure that Logan is true to his word. Donald Pierce (played adequately by Boyd Hollbrook) is a raging current who needs the mutant and spreads considerable blood without any account of collateral damage. The repeated encounters take a toll on Logan's already dying self and even if he doesn't show it, over the course of time, he starts developing a bonding with Laura. He finds within her, the same embodiment of rage that turns people into monsters and sees Laura waging off the inevitable with a silent grace. The relationship which Laura and Logan share has several layers to it and can be interpreted in a much wider canvas. That's for another day. The influence of nineties western classics on the Logan is clear and critical. The homage is directly linked when Charles watches scenes from the 1953 classic Shane, and the lines are repeated again in a final scene. The dust symbolizes the ruins the mutant have brought upon themselves in their ideology of helping mankind marking their own destruction. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as a Xavier who is on the brink of death, set upon the call of epileptic seizures that capsize the lives of anyone near him and there is nothing he could do about it. All Xavier wanted his whole life was to stop people from getting hurt, and in his final moments he cannot stop himself from hurting people. This irony is a powerful strike to the entire genre which relies heavily on willing suspension of disbelief. Everything dies in the end, it's all about the manner in which it is achieved. Mortals, superheroes, they all do. Hugh Jackman could have become a lot of other things, a fine actor, if his brooded look would not have been entirely associated with Wolverine his entire life. And even if he strutted and limped along the way, in Logan he delivers his finest performance. Period. Every scene is a rave emotional experience and comes with a satisfaction of being content if not necessarily happy. He is in pain and so are we, and the audience agrees to be a part of it sailing across in the journey. Logan becomes an imperative movie in changing the face of the superhero genre. The need and allowance of superheroes to be vulnerable and uncertain instead of omnipotent and sarcastic is something I'd been wishing for a while. In Logan, James Mangold manages to capture every element which thrives on the edge of this conflict and the swansong he creates, becomes a painting. It is a magnum opus, a bloody opera and a massacred theatre room with audiences still lying out for view. And yet, it is beautiful."
"bryank-04844","9","114","246","17 February 2017"," 'Logan' is the 'Wolverine' film we've always wanted!
","For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right. From his first incarnation in Hulk #181 to his own miniseries in comic book form in the 1980's by Frank Miller, to the amazing Saturday Morning Cartoon, and his first appearance in a feature film in 2000 with 'X-Men', which had the song and dance man Hugh Jackman play the iconic character. He was so good at playing Logan/Wolverine, that fans immediately took a liking to him as that character and he went on to play the 'Snikt-y Snikt' character in almost a dozen more films. Besides the 'X-Men' films, Wolverine got his own set of standalone films, which may or may not have been liked by a lot of people for various reasons. Either the story was too silly or the character Wolverine was to PG for fans.<br/><br/>If anyone knows the Wolverine character, it's that he's a brutal, violent, hardcore rated R character, which is something we haven't seen in cinema form at least. That is until now with James Mangold's new film 'Logan', which is very much an R-rated movie, complete with blood, ultra-violence, nudity, and vulgar language. It's everything we've always wanted in a Wolverine movie – FINALLY! With the past three X-Men films, we've seen our favorite X-Men characters growing up as it served as the prequel to the 2000 film. 'LOGAN' is set in the year 2029 and the world has changed for the worst, at least for a mutant friends. This is a very bleak, dark, and violent film with some flashes of dark humor. Nobody is doing well in 2029 here, particularly Logan (Hugh Jackman) who has crawled inside a whisky bottle and has never came back out, with the exception of driving a limo for cash around town. He's old, mean, and his body is starting to fail him. When he's not driving or killing people, he takes care of Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart), who is suffering from seizures and dementia, and who lives in a rusted out, abandoned water tower. Life is not good here for anyone.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a little girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) crosses paths with Logan who seems to have the same abilities as the Wolverine himself. Logan is now charged with the task of transporting this little girl to a safe haven with Charles in tow, as a group of bad guys are after her, led by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). It's a fairly straight forward story and it takes its time setting up these older, dying characters, as well as its new ones. 'LOGAN' doesn't mess about with side tangent plot lines or love interests here. It's balls-to-the-wall, heart breaking action and drama, which is something we've wanted for a long time now with the Wolverine character. The script is written by Scott Frank ('Get Shorty, 'Minority Report') and Michael Green ('Heroes', 'Gotham'), which these two writers have expertly added in a fair dose of emotion into these characters, but never back pedal into past films. It was a breath of fresh air. James Mangold certainly was influenced by some of his favorite old western films, as can be seen in some of camera shots, which are just fantastic.<br/><br/>Also, if you ever wanted to see Wolverine go berserk, you'll finally get that here on more than one occasion, complete with some long shots of Wolverine slicing and dicing the bad guys without any cuts. Simply amazing. In the past films, we've seen the characters Professor Xavier and Wolverine rather smart, witty, and put together for the most part. That's not the case here. These two characters are very sick and are not doing well mentally and physically. Jackman and Stewart give award worthy performances here, which might bring a tear or two down your face. It's that good. Newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura was also fantastic and very believable in every second she's on film. 'LOGAN' runs at about 135 minutes, which can seem a bit long, but everything is necessary here and for good reason. 'LOGAN' is the Wolverine film we've always wanted and it deserves some high recognition."
"slicedbread117","10","84","178","4 June 2017"," Here's to 17 Years
","Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.<br/><br/>Logan heavily, and fittingly, borrows from Marvel's iconic 'Old Man Logan' comic to tell the story of a grim and desolate future, where mutant-kind is all but extinct. Director/writer James Mangold was finally given all the tools necessary to tell a truly compelling Wolverine story, and arguably the biggest tool in the box was the 'R' rating. It pushes the film into an extremely dark and forbidding tone, which helps carve the movie into one of immense intensity and emotion. The 'R' rating, of course, also allows for studious amounts of gore and profanity, but those elements don't feel like they were added just because they could be, they only added to the atmosphere Mangold created for this film, and in turn helps set the narrative to be nothing short of enthralling. The pacing is spot on, the dialogue is stellar and the emotional weight is that of a moving mountain. I applaud Mangold for his brilliant writing, and subsequent directing, as he was at last able to produce the Wolverine story every fan has been craving for the last 17 years, one of raw emotion, brutality and pure magnificence.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has devoted the last 17 years of his career to this beloved character, and now, he leaves it all on the table, giving the performance of a lifetime, one which could seriously garner some looks at an Oscar nomination. The writing of the characters, Wolverine specifically, stand out the most in the gritty setting, because few superhero movies have ever done what Logan is able to do; make the characters vulnerable, make them real and to make you truly care like never before. Wolverine is worn down and beaten, looking for a way out, and Hugh Jackman gives you every reason to want to feel for his character. His action scenes are nothing short of powerful, none more than his final, and the emotion he displays in every aspect is worthy of an award-winning performance. I genuinely cannot express my praise for Jackman enough, he gave it is all.<br/><br/>Wolverine is accompanied by two spectacular supporting characters for most of the film in franchise favorite Professor X and the ferocious X-23. Both characters add tremendous layers of depth to both Wolverine and the film as a whole, with exceptional performances from Patrick Stewart and youngster Dafne Keen, who's X- 23 is an absolute showstopper. The main villain, Pierce, isn't anything too special, but doesn't have to be in a story like this. The core cast of Wolvie, Professor X and X-23 are what drive the film and the performances by their respective actors are outstanding. The father figure that Professor X is to Wolverine and the subsequent father that Wolverine is to X-23 is a deep, touching addition to their characters. This is no-doubt a character driven film, and with Wolverine in the driver's seat, and a pair of dynamite supporting characters, the ability to connect with these characters is real, and that is a treasure few superhero films have ever held.<br/><br/>The film's action is gloriously vicious, showcasing what a hacking from Wolverine or X-23 would actually look like. But it's not just the heavy amounts of gore that make the action so amazing, it's again the feeling that these characters are in true danger and every move they make could cost them their lives, none more than Wolverine himself, whose reduced healing factor forces him into a different mindset that, outside of briefly in ""The Wolverine"", we've never seen before. He's not invincible, and even with X-23's relentless attacks, he still has to play his cards differently, and it translates into an emotional roller coaster. All together the action sequences and sheer amount of violence were a sight to behold, entertaining and fierce.<br/><br/>17 years it has been, since we first watched a young Hugh Jackman don his X-Men suit. 17 years of stories, character development, action, hardship, humor and emotion, come together to deliver one final journey. The final scene alone may move you to tears, as Hugh Jackman's time as the iconic Wolverine comes to an end. One final epic masterpiece of superhero cinema; Logan.<br/><br/>10/10"
"daddyxj-1","10","77","164","25 July 2017"," What Happens When Superheros Get Old.
","What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","52","108","5 August 2017"," The Last Cut Is The Deepest!
","SPOILER: Did we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.<br/><br/>James Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.<br/><br/>Logan's Run!<br/><br/>Ah yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.<br/><br/>Tech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is ""A"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.<br/><br/>One of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10"

Why did Logan not kill the Dr, the clone, and Donald Pierce while they were laying defenseless and half dead at the farm?<br/><br/>2. Why did the black farmer attempt to kill Logan after killing the shaved clone Logan?

"edgeoflight","4","172","398","18 March 2017"," A movie void of any emotion
","I do not understand the reviews... What the heck? This movie was maybe not worth 1 star, I agree, because I enjoyed the brutality to some extent. But it falls very short of being the sort of masterpiece it is made out to be. I chose to rate it 5.<br/><br/>First of all, I am not a fan of Wolverine but I've always admitted that Hugh Jackman was made for this role. And his role in pretty much every X-men movie so far was outstanding. He is the Wolverine.<br/><br/>In this movie however, he bored me out of my soul. Even in the brutal scenes he played in, I was not convinced. I understand he is weak and old, and ravaged by Adamantium. But even so, it was not him. He kept whining and suffering and yet I felt nothing. I felt like a narrator who remains as distant as his character as he can. It was cold acting--I do not like cheesy actors either but he clearly left me unaffected. Too bad for a movie that relies on emotion to try and stand out.<br/><br/>Now on to the girl. I felt no emotion whatsoever for her either. There was no emotional build-up or any anchorage point I could tie my heart with. She was a dull character. The way she growled and made faces was overdone and... ridiculous. Her role was blurry. She begins as a beast bent on savagery and blood. And a few days later she calls Wolverine ""dad""? And she actually has friends waiting for her? Let me have a laugh, I almost fell out of my chair. Several other people summarized her role in action parts; she goes on a killing spree for the first heated scene but at the end of the movie she cannot handle a small troop with her mutant friends--who make the cut by boasting their powers against a man already down and apprehended while she and Wolvie eat dust. ??? Charles-Xavier's lines were bland but at times I was almost convinced. If it wasn't for the unlikable character that the little beast is I'm sure his words would have affected me more. His death was not even moving--and God knows how much I love Charles Xavier.<br/><br/>The black family was forgettable. Nothing with them engaged my attention. Except the fact they served as a redemption for a Wolverine that had given up on standing for what it is to be an x-men. And even so he failed. Because of a plot twist character who was there for the sake of adding more Jackman for fan service.<br/><br/>But most of all... What happened? For the whole movie I craved some flashbacks, some relevant explanation for Caliban, Xavier, the disappearance of the other X-men, for Wolvie degrading so much, for his copy's reason to exist--why not copy much more powerful mutants that must have been out there. My head was dizzy with lack of information and all it got was a few sentences.<br/><br/>I am honestly quite the easy-going guy. I was not full of expectations prior to the movie. I actually expected the movie to be bad so that I could be less critical or hyped up. I wanted to avoid being disappointed. And while the beginning looked promising, it just went downhill when I felt my questions were poorly resolved, or when the girl's incoherent role showed more and more.<br/><br/>Perhaps the unmemorable soundtrack played its part, perhaps the questions I kept asking myself and the writing inconsistency spoiled my appreciation of the movie. But so it happened and whereas I know the movie tried hard to be emotional and do Wolverine justice, it actually did the opposite.<br/><br/>In a movie in which all I can remember are screams and growls and bloodshed a la Tarantino, Hugh Jackman's last role as the Wolverine is forgettable and painful."
"milk-carton-reviews","10","61","131","29 June 2017"," so much more than i expected
","Being a huge X-Men fan, I really hoped this movie would be good and all of the trailers looked amazing, so I went into the cinema with impossibly high hopes, even preparing myself for tears. What I got, however, was an actual punch in the stomach and, like, an hour of crying. This movie exceeded every hope I ever had entering the cinema.<br/><br/>I'm actually having a hard time finding any negatives in this movie whatsoever. I wasn't particularly crazy about Dr Rice, but he's such a minor presence in this movie that I barely even noticed him. There are several villains in this movie, Dr Rice, Donald Pierce and X-24, but what I genuinely believe is going fairly unnoticed in all of the reviews I've read is Donald Pierce and Boyd Holbrook's portrayal of him. Honestly, I don't believe we've had such a good X-Men villain since Magneto, and that to me is really important now since we barely get any good villains in movies these days. Villains can be the most interesting part of a movie. I'm excited to watch Boyd's show ""Narcos"" now, and I plan on following his career from this moment on. X-24 is also a much better villain than I expected, serving as a sort of a shadow to Wolverine. Another highlight of the movie was Dafne Keen, the little girl that plays Laura. She is absolutely amazing, and I can't stress that enough. <br/><br/>I want to briefly discuss the R rating. Honestly, it adds so much to the movie, and it's amazing to finally see Wolverine cut loose, swearing and slicing people up, it's amazing. And there is a lot of blood and swearing in this movie, which just adds on to this gloomy, gritty feel that lingers over this entire film, further pushing the notion that the dream is dead, that this is the end of the X-Men. It's truly depressing seeing this world where all of your childhood heroes are dead. In a way, I'm almost angry with the creators for twisting the X-Men so out of what we're used to, and that's another thing that I sort of have a problem with, even though nothing really could have been done about it. I don't really feel like the message of this movie, to give up after so many years of fighting, to just kill off everything goofy and colorful about the X-Men and shatter all of our hopes is necessary in a time like this. I think that as goofy as they are, X- Men movies and superhero movies in general just need to do what they were created to do - to raise hope in people that things will get better if we all work together and that we can find a family no matter how different we are. That's an important part as to why X-Men were created in the first place, to show minorities that they're not alone. Now we have a movie that shows mutants, a minority already hated by most of the ""normal"" people being killed off by the government, and I really don't think that's the message that was needed right now. However, ""Logan"" is a typical example of the director giving the audience what they want (a nostalgic, gritty Wolverine road trip movie) instead of what they need. In this case, it absolutely works because everything is so masterfully crafted, the cinematography is beautiful, the performances are amazing (Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman should seriously be up for an Oscar), the action, gore and script are ridiculously good, there is a compelling villain and it managed to hit an emotional nerve for me. I can't even consider giving it a lower than perfect score. <br/><br/>I'm excited to see what Logan means for the superhero genre. It's definitely up there with the likes of ""The Dark Knight"". However, this movie can stand alone as something more than ""just a superhero film"", and as I've heard so many times before, superhero movies get old. It's time for a little change in the genre. While I can't say I'm particularly happy with the implied direction that the X-Men movies are taking after ""Apocalypse"" (even though the X-Men are my favorite superhero group ever, though people tend to forget all about comic books and animated series), I'm more than excited to see if they will ever again reach anything close to the masterpiece that is ""Logan""."
"magatsu","1","224","529","8 March 2017"," Terrible
","The movie started off well, with Prof X jailed and drugged in a DIY hideout maintained by Wolvie and Caliban. Pierce is a great villain, but there's no payoff with his abilities or menace. He's simply the foreman for the evil corporation that is growing test tube mutants and hunting them down. Besides having one robotic hand, him or his Reavers don't really have any glaring cybernetic advantages. It would have been interesting to see different types of cyborg Reavers as in the comics, but in this movie, they are simply claw fodder.<br/><br/>Once the introduction of Wolvie's clone begins, the movie goes downhill. We know nothing as to how or why this clone suddenly appears. Why wouldn't there be clones of all the X-Men at this point? Wasn't it already proved in the most awful of its series, Terminator Genisys, that Arnold vs Younger Arnold is not that captivating? Why would it work in this movie? Why not make Pierce a more capable and challenging villain?<br/><br/>Once the Prof is whacked, as well as the kind family that sheltered them, I really began to lose interest. What's the point of heroes if they can't protect the good and innocent? <br/><br/>The ending made no sense. At the beginning, Lara takes on 20+ Reavers on her own. After being reunited with 10+ other powerful, trained killer mutant kids, they are running away and being captured by the same number of Reavers? It makes NO SENSE. <br/><br/>I'm CONVINCED that the movie critic industry is PAID or compensated in some way by the studios to produce positive reviews to DUPE, bait and switch audiences all for $$$ because this movie is currently 77 on Metacritic when it should be a 37. Good violence, poor writing, sloppy ending is what you really get.<br/><br/>Its truly sad that a Wolverine movie has yet to be made well. Will never watch another movie by Mangold ever again. Learned my lesson. Save your $ and wait til this streams. Trust me, you'll thank me later. This is also part of the reason why IMDb shut down their message boards. Not to silence the haters, but to silence the voices of critical yet honest reviewers that ultimately hurts the $ of the movie industry."
"howardj-00306","1","141","325","21 March 2017"," How is this movie so highly rated?
","I created an IMDb account solely for the purpose of reviewing this movie and to give it a more honest and accurate rating. It says it has an 8.5 rating, but really it should be more like a 1 or 1.5, seriously. What happened to people? Is this really the standard for a good movie nowadays? <br/><br/>I will spare you the suffering of going into great detail about every little flaw in this movie. With that said, here are some of the reasons why this movie sucks:<br/><br/>1. No explanation of the events that have transpired to get to this point. Logan has apparently decided to become a limo driver to make money so that he and Charles can go live on a boat somewhere in the middle of the ocean? Really? And what happened to the other mutants? Supposedly there was some kind of ""event"" that I guess killed off all the mutants and also stopped them from breeding more mutants. It's hard to say because the movie makes no attempt to clue you in on what has happened.<br/><br/>2. No plot. Besides being lost from the very beginning, nothing really happens throughout the entire movie to progress the story. Logan just drives this little girl and Charles cross country while being chased by some random bad guys who eventually catch up with them -- there's a fight -- more driving -- they get caught again -- rinse and repeat.<br/><br/>3. Who is this Wolverine clone? Where did he come from? how was he made? what is he doing here? Want answers? You get none. He's just there.<br/><br/>4. Both Charles and Logan die in the most anticlimactic and meaningless ways.<br/><br/>The positives:<br/><br/>1. Hugh Jackman"
"andrewwegerif","1","114","259","20 May 2017"," Just awful, does not deserve any of the praise.
","Mindbogglingly bad film. I can't believe there are so many people saying lyrical things about it. Is this really what substitutes a good film in the year 2017? Come on.<br/><br/>The story is just so stupid and totally full of holes, right from the get go. Scene 1: Logan is sleeping it off in his fancy limo when he is woken by some Latino guys that are trying to steal his rims. The car is jacked up and we clearly see them loosening the nuts of one of the tires. Logan slashes them up, removes the jack and then drives off real fast. Eh... what about that loose tire? And so on, stupidity after stupidity, through the whole film!<br/><br/>There are people praising the characters. The characters, really? A bunch of morons completely and frustratingly unable to communicate with each other, unable to make any logical or reasonable decisions, and so utterly predictable. Charles constantly (more or less subtly) telling Logan that he is a stupid and unloved oaf, is that like peoples idea of cinematic tension between characters, showing profound depths of humanity? Seriously, tripe.<br/><br/>And the action... I mean honestly, after like the 10th goon has had his eyes poked out by Logan or mini-girly-Spanish-I-can-suddenly-speak- English-where-the-h**l-did-I-learn-that-Logan it's not really that fascinating. Oh look, the spikes can come out through this side of the skull too, whey! Yes, a lot of people do get killed, slashed, maimed, decapitated, etc. in this film, but that does not make it great. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>There is seriously nothing great about this film. So just avoid it. Or watch it and waste a couple of hours of your life like I did of mine."
"templar77099","8","59","127","12 June 2017"," Logan is another level
","The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life."
"abhitrying","1","238","569","18 March 2017"," Do not watch
","If you want to find intelligent people who are actually capable of reviewing a movie, then you have those here who have voted miserably for this movie The movie is full of errors and the story line is extremely predictable Following are some of the issues I found 1) Majority of the movie is cliché, you have a failing superhero, his ailing mentor and a young prodigy in a journey to save the young one. The mentor is taken out by the villain, makes the superhero very angry who in the end sacrifices himself, killing the villain and the young one goes free into an unclear future. Any person should be able to predict the ending of the movie after just watching 10 minutes of the start and here are people comparing this with the Dark Knight!!!! Unbelievable!!!! 2) The prey seems to be running after the predator in the movie. The kids with superpowers are already trained as shown in the movie. They are not poor scared souls, they are lethal, mentally and physically. You can see glimpses of that during the end, when they kill off the mercenaries ruthlessly. With their unique powers combined, its a surprise they were even once contained in a facility. Sometimes you can see the kinds wimping and crying and few moments later they freeze someone off or electrocute someone without remorse. 3) Logan witnesses a group of drones towards the end which makes him realize that the kids are in danger. Why on earth would a dozen surveillance drones move around in a bunch? Shouldn't they be spread out to do their job better or was their job to get noticed by wolverine 4) X-24 was shot by an adamantium bullet in the end which blew half his head off. When wolverine was shot by that bullet in X Men Origins he only lost his memory, another inconsistency. 5) Professor X knew well that they had a vicious mercenary group hell bent after them. Why on Earth would he then suggest that they spend the night at the Munsons'? That's the most stupid thing to do. Oh yes now I get it why, its so that the mutant wolverine can be introduced in the movie and it was the perfect time for him to die. Killed by someone who he thought was Logan, that's sure to get a lot of sympathy right there. 6)Logan clearly knows that they are supposed to keep a low profile, in spite of that he picks up a fight with the Reavers 7) The producers had this project nicely figured out. Kill Wolverine, kill professor X, earn a lot of sympathy and thereby earn a lot of money. Also keep a bunch of mutant kids alive so that in case they fall short of lunch money, well you know what they will be working on. There are scores of mistakes with the story line but I do not wish to waste any more of my time so my advice for those who haven't watched this movie yet, don't."

The camaraderie, the sense of family--of a home for misfit mutant kids? The risks and victories and sacrifices? Yeah, it was all ultimately meaningless.<br/><br/>I can understand if they felt they needed to kill off the old X-Men but they did so in such a way as to make every previous X-Men movie and story appear to have been a foolish exercise in futility. A miserable and lonely future awaits, addled and alcoholic, only to be relieved by violent death. Yay.<br/><br/>This could have been an uplifting homage to the ideal of what the X-Men were.

"fung0","4","67","148","26 May 2017"," Shallow, Tedious and Disappointing
","The high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure. But it merely masks the film's emptiness - its painful lack of ideas, lack of character development, and total absence of plot.<br/><br/>Jackman's performance? As someone once quipped, his emotional range runs the full gamut... from A to B. He looks grumpy and depressed in every scene. In every shot. Patrick Stewart is somewhat more nuanced, though he too is hamstrung by a script that gives his character the emotional depth of a cartoon. Dafne Keen does a great job as Laura, but her character has only attitude - which incompetent screen writers often mistake for character.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is bland. I hear there's a black-and-white version. It's always a bad sign when a film's creators can't make up their minds on such a key issue. A film is either shot for B&W, or it isn't. (In the case of Logan, the photography lacks the dramatic contrasts and strong composition that might favor a noir-ish B&W presentation.)<br/><br/>Logic holes abound:<br/><br/>* After being raised in a cage, Laura turns out to be a competent driver. What's more, she has no trouble reaching the pedals, presumably on account of some stretching power that's not mentioned elsewhere in the film.<br/><br/>* Laura is mute for half the film, for no apparent reason. Then she can only speak Spanish. Then fluent English. No explanation.<br/><br/>* Laura is often feral, as you'd expect of someone raised in a cage by sadistic scientists. Yet she acts like a normal child most of the time. Ditto for her friends. This quality does not 'develop' as a result of events in the film - it simply materializes when needed.<br/><br/>* Laura drives at random, ends up at a completely out-of-the-way building. And meets all her friends. When was this arranged? How did she learn navigation while locked in a cage?<br/><br/>* Logan and Laura have a cozy evening with a nice family - knowing full well that they're setting them up for slaughter, when their pursuers come along. The audience knows this instantly, characters in the film don't quite get it.<br/><br/>* Logan is dying, we're never told why. Professor X has a brain-cloud, or some such dread condition, also not explained.<br/><br/>Missed opportunities are equally plentiful:<br/><br/>* Laura's feral attacks are mentioned in conversation, but never really discussed. Logan dismisses them with a couple of heavy one-liners, when they could have (and should have) led to an extended rumination on violence. The film doesn't miss a beat when Laura's friends brutally murder the guy with the mechanical hand. This lynch-mob logic should, again, have been a starting point for reflections that never happen in this shallow, trivial film.<br/><br/>* Logan never has a character arc. Wolverine actually has far less emotional range in this film than in the first X-Men movie. His relationship with Laura is essentially the same as the far more developed relationship with Rogue.<br/><br/>* Characters are neither built up, nor revealed. To do that, you have to show them in a range of different circumstances, dealing with emotionally or morally challenging dilemmas. In Logan, the only dilemma is how to keep eluding inexorable pursuit so as to stretch the film out past the two-hour mark. Hence the only character trait that can be revealed is dogged perseverance. We get that in the first scene. After that, nothing.<br/><br/>* Ultimately, the filmmakers resort to having Logan shaved back to his familiar Wolverine muttonchops. You know you're in trouble when you're counting on facial hair to create characterization. (Or fan service.)<br/><br/>* Plot is nonexistent. The film is one long chase. Weak screenwriters often mistake this for plot, but it's a poor substitute: totally linear, predictable, boring. Yes, there have been great 'chase' films (Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway comes to mind.) They take care to incorporate twists and turns, and strong moments of characterization. Logan doesn't. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens.<br/><br/>On top of everything else, I had the creeping suspicion that this film was calculated less as a standalone work, than as a stepping-stone for the X-Men 'franchise.' It disposes of two performers who've stated their intent to depart the roles they created. And it seems to pave the way for the endlessly-discussed New Mutants franchise. Ugh. Replacing the people won't make up for a lack of ideas, and Logan shows very clearly how bereft of creative thinking the X-Men cinematic franchise has become.<br/><br/>I didn't hate Logan as I was watching it. But when it ended I was overcome by a feeling of emptiness and disappointment. This film lacks both entertainment value and deep ideas. The Marvel cinematic universe badly needs a shot of new blood, but sadly, this wasn't it."
"CalRhys","Null","56","122","3 March 2017"," A Gritty & Emotional Adventure Into The Vulnerability Of Superheroes
","In a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time- and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully- executed as 'Logan' is made. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.<br/><br/>I understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have tried with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the ""humane"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X-Men Origins' I'm looking at you).<br/><br/>Two characters that we've come to know and love, James ""Wolverine"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles ""Professor X"" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline- pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.<br/><br/>I think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that), we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army, but no matter what, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film, you sit back in ease, knowing the protagonists will succeed, however in 'Logan' that never happens, there is never that sense of safety, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way, Wolverine looks tired, he looks sick, he's dying gradually, and due to his weakened form, we are left worrying for the character, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.<br/><br/>With utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar- deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes."
"UnderworldRocks","1","109","255","24 March 2017"," Not worthy of all the praise
","This is highly overrated. This is nowhere near as good as critics say it is. 1 star for the little girl.<br/><br/>The X-MEN series has always been filled with continuity errors. The first 3 movies were pretty consistent. Then there were prequels telling stories that contradict the old trilogy. Hey! Remember Mystique? She is said to be of the same age with Charles Xavier in the prequels, whereas in the old trilogy, well...<br/><br/>Also, the franchise has never been consistent in style. Most of the previous X-MEN movies are PG-13, quite typical for Marvel movies. This time it is R. However, there is not much difference, only more blood but not by much.<br/><br/>The story does not make sense here and there. For example, had they shot the enemy instead of keeping him alive and attempting to dump him in the middle of nowhere, they could have avoided a lot of trouble later on. The Wolverine died saving a bunch of little mutant shitheads nobody cares about, who later on stood over his tomb, exchanging weird glances and as Laura quoted from an old movie, they seemed to be thinking, ""What the F..K is she babbling about?"" Clearly they haven't seen the old movie. Not to mention that the whole ""Save Laura"" Operation was based on a nurse who read lots of comic books. Who wrote the books?<br/><br/>The movie educates us: 1. Never let the enemy off easily. 2. Never trust the comic books."

Either way, the sad reality remains, a simple and unspectacular movie like Logan gets a 8.5.<br/><br/>The movie begins at a somewhat slow pace. The more it progresses, the more it starts to get evident that we're not going to be seeing decent special effects. This was produced on the ""cheap"" and has a TV series feel to it. The execution and the sheer scale are not up to par with the other X-men movies, the script is lacking too. The worse part however is that this movie is supposed to give the whole X-men series closure and it does that in a very unspectacular and boring way. They rushed it, probably seeing a good opportunity to slaughter the dying cash-cow, seeing that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart wanted to retire from playing their iconic X-man characters.<br/><br/>A big disappointment and a sad ending to an otherwise decent franchise.

No joke, that all really happens in this movie.<br/><br/>As usual, it hurts me very deeply to see my favorite childhood heroes utterly humiliated and destroyed by Hollywood. The underlying message of this movie seems to be that the Age of Heroes is dead. There is no beauty left in the world, no hope, no shining intelligent ideas or dreams.

"colonel52","2","68","158","17 March 2017"," Dark and depressing movie
","James Mangold wrote and directed Logan things became depressing quickly and set the tone for the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>This film should be titled kill kill and die. Or ""Sick Wolverine"" I find it hard to believe so many liked this movie, or worse thought it was great.<br/><br/>I don't care for sick wolverine, it makes no sense the adamantium was poisoning him, and I think it was the genetic stuff in foods, that made the mutants unable to reproduce, and also for them to die of some ailment. Wolverines healing power fought it but was losing. But really this is not a good story and ruined the movie for me, I would rather see a normal wolverine one last time than to see this travesty. And if they are going to kill him then so be it, but I don't really like that either. When a actor is saying one more time, they tend to think O lets kill him off then. I don't like that,<br/><br/>The girl Laura was the best thing in the movie, was his DNA daughter, and she looked like fameke Jansen who played jean so they could have said she had DNA from jean too. played superbly by the young Dafne Keen. She never speaks thru half the movie, so does it all with looks etc. And they could have ended it with Logan going to Canada with his new daughter, and the other kids, and starting a school like Xavier did in past. That would have been a better ending that this crap.<br/><br/>Basically everyone in movie dies, except few of the kids, and cant remember if any of the bad guys survived, like the geneticist? Even the family that helped them all died, kill kill kill, not a happy movie at all, just the opposite, very dark and depressing movie with a few light moments that were quickly squashed by something bad.<br/><br/>I did really like the character growth between Logan and the girl, which might be one of the main highlights of the movie's story for me.<br/><br/>I would only watch this again to see the Laura scenes, but it is so depressing I don't know if I ever will want to watch this again.<br/><br/>The main villains of the film are very one-dimensional; at times, the film almost goes deep into their motivations, but abruptly interrupts itself in lieu of more awesome fight scenes. Basically you have a bunch of guys with guns, but they don't use the guns or do so rarely. The main bad guy just seemed not bad, like a robot doing a job. The geneticist was a little better but seemed to come out of nowhere in middle of movie, and was kind of corny.<br/><br/>I gave it a 2 of 10 and I have always liked wolverine and the actor playing the part. The writing and story was awful except for Logan's daughter, take that and write a better story, and it could have been a great movie.<br/><br/>Aside from Laura, this story really sucked, the worst of all the wolverine movies.<br/><br/>It was R rated so they could show graphic violence and I like that, but combined with the depressing story makes it harder to watch.<br/><br/>So Logan winds up buried in some woods, and Prof X buried some unmarked grave too, and everyone says yeah it was great and fitting ending for these 2 characters lol.<br/><br/>O and having Prof X be sick like he was sort of ruined having him in the movie too, and not good to remember him by. I guess I am just an oddball for not liking it, or people who don't like it probably don't want to take the time to come here and do a review, just the fanboys that loved it."

The films tone leans towards edgy rather than dark in my opinion with profuse use of unnecessary cursing making it feel like an 18 year old was hired to spice up the dull plodding nature of each scene. Moments felt like the Coen brothers ""No country for old men"" was lifted whole sale and stitched onto the plot of ""Children of men"" with a smattering of ""Xmen 2"". Not necessarily the worst idea ever, but the execution just leads to a painful and cringe worthy experience. Many moments I found my hands raised in disbelief as mutants forgot they had powers. Antagonists failed to use even a percent of their brain when attacking their non Wolverine targets (""YOU HAVE GUNS SHOOT THEM"" was a message I found on my lips at multiple points in the film). Some scenes were so drawn out if the film hadn't been two and a half hours long I'd think they were playing for time (see: Logan exiting a car, sighting a mountain, seeing a girl, falling over, being winched up a cliff, 15 minutes of information being conveyed extraordinarily slowly (that we already knew and had been told before) the full scene took 20 minutes to end with nothing new being learnt, nothing interesting happening and the plot exactly were it left off). Bad acting is present throughout with the exception of Patrick Stewart and Eriq La Salle. Please do not let Dafne Keen star in any more films until she has been taught finesse and timing. Pacing, CGI (the fence scene is especially noticeable), script and attempts at political finger pointing all hinder this film greatly. The films greatest crime though, the ending.

Charles Xavier (Stewart), a mumbling nonagenarian and episodically inflicted by seizure and is unable to keep a tight rein on his psionic superpower, can only be tamed by medication, meanwhile the albino mutant Caliban (Merchant, a bug-eyed phantom actually has a golden heart) is Logan's sole help. <br/><br/>All Logan wants is to save enough money and buy a boat so that they can live in the sea while the rest of the world stays out of harm's way, because the blast induced from Charles' seizure has already caused disastrous collateral damage to those in the vicinity, but the advent of a Mexican nurse Gabriela (Rodriguez) and her so-called teenager daughter Laura (a commendable debutante Keen) will eventually sabotage his plan. It turns out, Laura is very much like Logan, she is a man- made mutant using Logan's own DNA by Doctor Rice (E. Grant), who takes a vocation to capitalize on mutation to manufacture killing machines, Laura is one of his experiments, but now, along with other mutant children, they are failed guinea pigs needs to be disposed of, since Rice has something much more advanced created. So, reluctantly, Logan embarks on his final adventure to escort Laura (along with Charles) to the meeting place, then with other escapees, to cross the border into Canada, where Eden, a mutant paradise purportedly exists (the metaphor of breaking away from USA today is right on the nose), at the meantime, they are hunted by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce (Holbrook, manage to pull off a clichéd role with verve and bemusing ambiguity), a huge fan of Wolverine's legend but also ruthlessly committed to his mission, but he is not the biggest problem for the fleeing trio. <br/><br/>Incredibly, Mangold thrusts a brilliant human touch into the story arc, not the least is the moving Western nostalgia eliciting from George Steven's SHANE (1953) and that soul-stirring denouement when Logan is again, regretfully, embroils an innocent family into his war; yet keeps the action sequences snappy, utilitarian but uncompromisingly lethal, that introduction set piece of Laura's destructive nature and combatting prowess is such a godsend. Hugh Jackman will be forever beloved for this role, which he has been playing for 17 years, and here he is even more manifestly touching in ramming home Logan's cursed kismet with unrelenting taedium vitae, which is countervailed by Keen's perfect embodiment of innocence and dispassionateness, slowly eroded when a father-daughter bond starts to burgeon, effectively reaches its crescendo in the coda where a sort of patricide passes on the baton to the offspring. Patrick Stewart, meantime, is equally poignant appearing for the last time as the aging Professor X, his valediction is every bit as potent as Logan's. <br/><br/>Also worth mentioning that there is also a noir-version of the film, which is entirely in Black-and- White and makes great play of the story's tragic/heroic tone, when all is said and done, LOGAN is another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation (after DEADPOOL of course) on the big screen, but in its core, it is an ardently past-honoring action-er doesn't shirk from the grim fate but also sows its seeds of hope with great dexterity, to a point that we won't even begrudge to bid farewell to our favorite screen heroes, distinguished by their superpower but permanently scourged by its distasteful corollaries."

","As usual with all previous X-men movies i approach to this one with big anticipation, which didn't let me down with previous ones... <br/><br/>But with Logan? <br/><br/>The movie is one big agony for spectators, as also for the characters playing their agonistic, pathetic roles... Poor plot, no explanation how happened that once mighty Wolverine becomes old, injured, with almost no (or progressive lower) self healing ability, alcoholic... with his final pathetic wish to get on the boat and retreat from the rest of the world, with (even older and more sick) once great head of all mutants Charles Xavier, which also becomes pathetic... <br/><br/>And, what happened with other co-Wolverine and Xavier X-men from the past??? Forget about it...

","This is the perfect movie treat for fans of the Wolverine character as portrayed by Hugh Jackman in films. Period. I won't argue with that. And you can tell as much by just checking the titles of the ""Five Stars!"" reviews here at IMDb. Yep, it's exactly what this movie is. And by the way I am not a ""fan"" of the Wolverine comic books, I happen to like a few of them from the 80s. So I don't go to the cinema expecting to see a comic book I already have in my shelves. So what did I find in this film? A boring, unoriginal and unimaginative movie, willing to satisfy the appetites of fans left open in prior attempts of the franchise, full of moronic routines I won't bother to list. The occasional comedy moments are jokes based around the walking disability of a character, so expect the laughs to border the derogatory. And the choreographed ""over the top"" slashing violence quickly becomes dull and repetitive. Plus... there is also a lot of violence dispensed to kids, and by kids. Kids are shot, stabbed and kicked -a lot. And in turn the same kids stab back, slash back, electrify and decapitate. Which is creepy if you ask me, as for this alone the film merits to be a horror movie -which it ain't. Last, lots of people are saying the story is based in a comic book series titled OLD MAN LOGAN. OK, please don't. Because in this film (do I need to say... SPOILERS AHEAD?) Wolverine, now Logan, works as a limo driver to make money and buy anti seizure medication for Prof. X and hopes to make enough dough to buy a boat and go live in the middle of the ocean with same Prof. X. Do you find any resemblance in that with the comic book series? I guess not. The only thing in common with OLD MAN LOGAN is that Logan is OLD. End of similarities. Yeah, just skip it I guess."

","Warning: This review may contain opinions that qualify as spoilers. <br/><br/>Rewind to the year 2000 when X-Men finally arrives on the big screen. Logan is a wild animal fighting in a cage for money with no memory of his past. Angry and disgusted with who and what he is he just wants revenge on the world. Enter Professor Xavier and the X-Men. Wolverine finds people who accept him, even like him oddly enough, and someone in the form of Jean Grey in whom he could maybe even find love. Armed with a new found purpose and backed by a family that believes in him Logan changes from a dangerous animal to an invincible super hero worthy of legend.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2017. Logan is a shadow of his former self as is Professor X. There are no more heroes in America. Corporations can do whatever they want. Good people who still believe in heroes or are heroes themselves just by raising a good family with American values will become casualties. There is no stopping an automated future. Your heroes are NOT invincible. Do not look to the next generation for hope. This was not a superhero movie but a dystopian pipe dream.<br/><br/>I would have been happier seeing gun toting thugs lined up on either side of Wolverine and 2 hours of him perforating their skulls one at a time. Much more entertaining and save a ton of money on useless writing staff. Could even CGI the whole thing, box office smash.<br/><br/>Do not be surprised when Hollywood kills off a few of the Avengers next."
"ianst1024","1","62","145","29 March 2017"," spare yourself the pain and don't watch this
","This movie is depressing and riddled with plot holes and contradictions with generally accepted lore. I didn't realize that this movie is based off of a different range of comics that depict this darker, older bunch of characters and apparently it relates to that range quite well. However most viewers aren't comic connoisseurs and will have their knowledge from the previous movies, the comics and cartoons they were watching as a child and anything that the movie itself would present during its showing. Logan, however, does very little to explain the background of the setting or the characters. The actors do a great job of acting but it's lost on the viewer when you have no idea why things are happening in the movie. If the writers of this movie were focusing on a non standard lore path they should have made damn sure the viewer was more comfortable with the new, and contradicting, environment they're presented with and not assume we've read or even appreciated the alternative story line. There are so many wtf moments when things don't gel in this movie that I can't recommend this to anyone."
"frisco2007","3","51","117","4 March 2017"," Spoilers Included - Horrible, a major disappointment. This movie is riddled with plot holes like Swiss cheese!!!
","Of all the X-Men, X-Men Origin and X-Men prequel movies, this movie is the worst, and separate from that - it is a bad movie, standing alone. Unlike the effective - in (X-Men director) Brian Singer's paraphrased words ""I would want my favorite comic book universe, if made into a movie, to be taken seriously"" - other X-Men movies, this movie is filled with gratuitous violence, bizarre levels of cursing and a one-dimensional villain. I can't even remember the villain's name, that is how forgettable he was. Unlike Magneto or Colonel Striker, who were instantly memorable. We are told the movie takes place in the year 2029, but that makes no sense, since they keep repeating there have been no new mutants born in 25 years. Since 2004. But Prof. X's school was - I quote - taking place in the ""not too distant future"" - and was filled with kids in all the prior movies!!! Which were clearly taking place during, before and after 25 years ago, by any clear judgment. It made no sense. We were informed that Prof. X and Logan were among the last alive, that all the other X-Men from the newly resurrected Jean Grey to Scott. But with no explanation, they are all now dead. The entire pantheon of the X-Men, dead, when in the last movie with them - Days Of Future Past - they were all at the top of their game. We never found out what happened to Rogue - who was alive - or Bobby or even flipping Beast! And for some bizarre, entirely inexplicable reason, in this movie the mighty Wolverine is trying to get by ... as a chauffeur. With a chauffeur's permit and everything. IMPLAUSIBLE, MUCH? This movie is riddled with plot holes like Swiss cheese!!! The movie has a double tragic death ending unbefitting the glory of these excellent characters. What a shame!!!"

"mounirrmaged","10","19","38","14 August 2017"," Hands down the best superhero movie
","Comic book movies have been through an impressive change over the course of the years. Superman 1978 peaked the audiences' interest in the genre, allowing superheroes to become big budget superhero franchises. And it kept growing bigger with other films like batman 1989. It wasn't until the mid 90s to the late 90s that this genre started to fall. With shitty ass movies like batman and robin and steel, people started to give up on the superhero movies. Fast forward to 2008, iron man and the dark knight not only gained the audience back, but they allowed the genre to grow in an unbelievable rate, giving birth to the MCU. There are still some crappy films both in the MCU, DCEU and some in FOX x-men. Enter logan, the film that dares to challenge the superhero genre. Logan is easily the best superhero movie of all time and for good reasons: <br/><br/>This is a phenomenal comic book movie. The most mature one as well. Now a lot of people say that this is a dark and gritty film and to an extent, they are right. But this is a film that gives us a harsh, harsh reality that wolverine, has to deal with. He is living in the shadow of his old self. He doesn't have his healing factor, making him incredibly vulnerable both physically and mentally. His physical health is awful, and works as a driver for living. The film is pretty simple in its plot. It's not about a hero in a spandex fight crime, it's about a survivor in a hostile world. Logan is trying to have a normal life but he just can't. He is constantly chased by his past and his animalistic nature, as well as his lone wolf attitude. He doesn't even seem to be happy taking care of his professor. He also meets X-23, played by Dafne Keen, who gives a phenomenal performance despite not given much dialogue. Their relationship is tragic and heartfelt to behold. It is truly tragic that all this time, logan does not care about the child, but when he finally makes a connection, he dies in the most brutal way possible. Seeing x-23 crying over her father was a giant tear jerker thanks to the emotions from these actors that they professionally display. Now there are other elements in the film to comment on: <br/><br/>1. The action: This is action done right in a superhero movie. Not only is it the best choreographed, but it is also fills you with intensity and adrenaline. It is brutal and does not hold back. The most impressive thing is that they finally made the action were you worry for the survival of this hero, that you're afraid he won't get out of the situation alive, which you don't see in big budget superhero movies like in DCEU or MCU <br/><br/>2. Simpler is sometimes better: This is a movie with not much complexity in its plot or a giant spectacle. As mentioned earlier, this is a survival drama film, which is most fitting for a character like wolverine. You did not need giant spectacle to deliver badass action sequences. <br/><br/>3. Letting the director do his job: Most superhero movies have studio interference that ruin the project at the end result (suicide squad, age of ultron, batman v superman etc). But since FOX gave up on doing anything due to the previous wolverine movies, they let director James Mangold do his job, and oh boy was the end result fantastic. <br/><br/>Yes, logan is truly a phenomenal superhero movie that is a marvel (pun not intended) to behold. Leaving clichés such as quips and witty dialogue in order to deliver a tragic character journey that leaves you satisfied and emotionally destroyed. It is a soulful film with a lot of heart. 10/10"

This movie wants to be Terminator. It even uses similar music as the  perfect killing machine stalks a little girl protected by the imperfect  killing machine.  Like other Boreverine movies, this one takes away Wolverine's healing  because the writers don't know how to handle it. The Wolverine from the  comic books is weakened and supposedly humanized.

"chaos-rampant","Null","2","2","28 January 2020"," Different ways to give rise to world
","I admit I was taken aback with this one. I hadn't planned on watching as Wolverine films tend to be a bore to me. Not long into it, I was sure I had missed a previous film, one that would explain for example how Xavier ended up broken and hidden away, how Wolverine has washed up as an alcoholic limo driver.<br/><br/>But no this is it apparently, and this is the thing.<br/><br/>We can be lowered late at night in the middle of a world that has long now been spun in motion. We can discover as we go. We can catch glimpses of a larger world as we move through it. We don't need to be racing to save the world, making it out of this room alive is enough, wondering and having no idea where to turn to next are fine.<br/><br/>None of it is novel, in fact all of them mainstays of 80s film, from Bladerunner to Terminator. But after a glut of samey, mechanized Marvel and X- men movies obsessed with 'universing' a greater story, this one feels welcome and fresh.<br/><br/>Another obvious influence here are western films and this probably sheds some light on Wolverine's popularity. So many of the other X-men have awesome abilities to alter the fabric of reality; Wolverine is just a gruff who kicks and punches his way through. It seems there's always going to be a hankering for the simple, uncomplicated guy.<br/><br/>So what more obvious choice than to cast him in the light of cowboy? It works but you'll note it's not any cowboy. They could have used Red River as template, or The Searchers. They used Shane. The flawed guy who risks all to ensure there are 'no more guns in the valley' but must ride off again at the end because his kind has no place in the world of loving farmsteads.<br/><br/>It's always indicative of a broader sensibility when I see this type being used, the resignation that someone has no place in a changing world and is better off being swept away with the old, this seen as 'honorable' and heroic.<br/><br/>But from the little girl (and her friends') point-of- view we have what? A fictional Eden they only knew as stories in a book but their desire for it has inspired an actual one."

","My initial reaction to this movie was one of disappointment. What I heard was a triumph of a movie was in reality a cliche plot with failing heroes and a redneck villain. What?
Then I thought about this film in light of the other movies. People say it's the best standalone X-men film, but in reality it is the culmination of the others. The wanton killing, abuse of the manipulation of time, and repeated ignoring of a reasonable course of action has indeed freed the world from cataclysmic disaster, but has not given Logan more power. It's taken his toll, and now he dodders around, struggling to support a senile old man and save one little girl. It's not fanfare and parades that hail the return of wolverine but a failing liver and many unintentional naps. It makes so much sense, and it gives the film significance.
Logan has little new to offer in terms of traditional action films. But as a revolutionary take on the genre and an emotional exploration of Logan and Professor X, it truly is an incredible film."
"vlad-08647","8","2","2","14 January 2020"," Logan - First Non-Superhero Movie Featuring a Superhero.
","Logan unlike most movies featuring superheroes and villains; unlike movies from Marvel Studios, Logan takes itself seriously and at every moment, with perhaps one of the most serious tone not just among superhero movies, but cinematography in general. Logan tells a gripping, yet depressing tale about the fall of the X-Men and Logan's attempt to adjust to the world around him. The movie does not glorify superheroes, but in fact portrays the world as it is; grim, evil and oppressing. Whereas most superhero movies contain the general, hero's journey plot, with a more positive tone (sometimes to the point of absurdity), Logan disregards the common tropes, breaking most of the rules common to superhero movies, and it does so with great success.
Truthfully, Logan cannot and shall not be deemed as ""a superhero movie"", as the focus of it lies not in the superpowers of the main character or the collaboration between characters in flashy costumes and red capes (yes, The Avengers, I'm taking about you) to achieve a common goal of defeating the typical bad guy. Instead, focus lies in such aspects as visual storytelling, strong character development and realistic relationships, as well as realistic portrayal of the world.
In a few words, without spoiling the plot, Logan is mainly about a broken man, oppressed and persecuted by the world around him and about his transformation from a broody, ruined Logan, into a respectable and caring person, showing that even the most broken of people have a bright side to them. Fortunately, that is where the lighthearted tone ends, as the movie quickly transforms into the gripping, grim tale it is. The R rating given to this movie only supports the point it is trying to make, and is not for the faintest of heart.
Logan's realistic portrayal of the world we live in as well as Logan himself sets this movie apart from many movies I have seen, and especially its superhero ""competition"". There is enjoyment to be found for both dedicated fans and casual viewers, although I strongly recommend viewing every movie in the X-Men universe before viewing this, as this movie marks an end to the series (so far), at least timeline wise, as it is Hugh Jackman's very last performance as Logan, and the movie thus acts as a perfect and fitting closure for his long, developed story. While X-Men fans will enjoy the movie more, casual viewers will find it enjoyable too due to the fact that the story is self-contained and sparsely based on and related to previous films, making the story quite easy to understand and follow, without prior exposure to the X-Men universe.
Overall, this is a great movie about a realistic depiction of the world around us and how even the most broken people can redeem themselves. This movie gets 8 out of 10 starts from me, which places it in the 250 best movies of all time, and that is an achievement to be proud of. It does not get higher rating because although however great it is, it isn't the greatest movie of all time and cannot and shall not be compared to the likes of The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, arguably two of the best movies of all time. Either way, 8 stars is an appropriate rating for this movie and I strongly recommend it to both hardcore fans and casual viewers."
"Aaron1375","9","17","34","27 June 2017"," Hugh Jackman in his last go around as Wolverine
","I missed this film when it was in theaters. That is probably for the best, not that I had any desire to see it then due to the fact my fiancé had just recently passed away. If I had seen it, it probably would have triggered an attack. It still did, but at least I was in my own home so no one could see me break down. Just anything like this makes me remember the love of my life and the tears just pour out and I end up having an attack and have trouble breathing. That being said, this was a very good movie and a nice way to send off Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Sure, there are things that make me question what has happened to reduce everyone to the state they are in, but when one reads comics, one understands that the story being presented may be sort of an alternate universe story arc, rather than the main one. I say this is the case with this movie, things may not necessarily turn out the way they did in this film, just in this universe things seemed to have gone very badly. It is a way to change up the actor playing Wolverine and get some closure for the X-men films starring him and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier.<br/><br/>The story has Logan as a limo driver trying to earn enough cash to get a boat so that he and Professor Xavier can escape to the sea. Xavier is having trouble controlling his powers in his old age and Logan watches over him as there are hints that the professor has done something rather bad due to this lack of control. Logan is being assisted by a mutant named Caliban who has the ability to detect other mutants, a power nearly worthless now as mutants have become few and far between. Well, a woman tries to get Logan to help her as she has a young girl with her and some men are tracking both of them. This girl is apparently a mutant with some very familiar powers. Logan escapes with her and Professor Xavier and they must stay one step ahead of the agents determined to capture her. However, there is another familiar face that is unleashed in the agents efforts to recapture the young girl and several other mutant children trying to flee their grasp.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film for the most part, the only problem I had is that I was hoping for someone cooler when they revealed the soulless mutant who had no problem killing. They really did not have anyone new as far as mutants on display as Caliban was the only one I do not think was seen before. I would have liked the reveal to show the new weapon to be Omega Red. Granted, that would have meant a few more special effects I guess so we do not really get anyone new at all on display.<br/><br/>So the film was good and the action was plentiful and quite gruesome. I knew there would be a bit more stuff shown because this film was rated R, but I was surprised at how many heads rolled and appendages flying everywhere. From what a few people had said about the film that I know, there really was not much action in the film. Not sure what film they were watching as there was a good deal. So ends Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and he did a good job in the role. I just find the makers starting with Marc Singer really did not do the character true justice as he was a much better fighter than the films portrayed, and his healing ability was not as effective in the comics as depicted in the films either. Basically, he was more apt to dodge in the comics than go head on and he would never have any problems fighting ordinary men and most superheroes could not match his fighting skills. Still, as I said, I just think of it as an alternative universe and it still saddens me to see Jackman depart the role."

So here goes... my fast review<br/><br/>SKIP TO HERE<br/><br/>-Have you seen Children of Men? If you have, you've already seen this movie. Logan is Children of Men's future for mutants. If you haven't, watch Children of Men instead. It's not the best, but it's better than Logan (as always, Michael Caine > Patrick Stewart)<br/><br/>-Do you know what Oscar Bait is? If you do, take my word for it. This is the best way to describe Logan (although the idea that anyone involved in Logan could be so delusional as to think that this movie would receive consideration would actually be legitimately depressing as opposed to the shallow feeling of dreariness it tries to create. If that was the goal all along then it is genius. Bravo! But honestly... nothing against the cast, but there are no Oscar worthy performances here. There is no best written screenplay here. And as for the biggest awards, did anyone really think this would be the Sci-Fi movie that pulled it off?)<br/><br/>If you do not know what Oscar Bait is, google it and read the wiki definition or even better read the one from TV Tropes (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait). Oscar Bait movies are the kind of movies that think being sad and depressing equals art. They try to appeal to the crowd that avoids films that are well liked in general. For them, a happy ending is cheesy, it's for the masses, it's less creative. Sad endings, they believe, are brave and smart and edgy and above all, more deserving of the word ""art."" In reality, this is of course complete garbage. A well written good ending takes just as much effort to create as a bad one.<br/><br/>Logan attempted to go ""artsy"" and ""dark"" and it felt shallow and clichéd. For me, the whole story was a very lazy way to explain why Hugh Jackman looks too old now and why Logan the character is no longer regenerating. It isn't original or ground breaking; it ripped off a movie that isn't even old, as if everyone would have forgotten that Children of Men existed, which I'm sure if I did some reading, would turn out to be not entirely original itself. I'm not about to say that films with sad endings are always like this. Some of my favorite films of all time have sad endings. Cuckoo's Nest, Aviator, Midnight Cowboy (though a little uplifting too), sometimes artists have a story to tell and those stories don't always end well for everyone involved. (side note, does anyone else but me think that Coming to America has the happiest ending of all time? Even Daryl finds happiness in the end, everyone wins! anyways..) So don't think that I'm biased against films that do go dark, I just want for them to be done well and with honesty. So what if comic books are what we read as kids in order to escape how awful reality really is and how rarely the good guy wins. So what if super-heroes exist because of how appealing the fantasies they create are and satisfying it is to envision a world where justice always prevails and nothing bad ever happens to good and innocent people. If you want to go dark and depressing do it! Just don't be lazy about it, put a little effort into it. Be sad if you want to just have an engaging and original story to tell. <br/><br/>Maybe they should have done to Wolverine what the franchise did to Cyclops. If you can't come up with something clever just kill him off-screen instead. I'm trying to figure out which death is more disrespectful to the source material and fans of the character. I'm also trying to figure out why the X-Men get so many chances after failing more times than not, while my Punisher gets screwed up one time and then gets banished to the small screen. ...<br/><br/>Well I guess my review ended up a little longer than I originally intended. Sorry I'm so wordy, I just don't get out much and when I do I'm usually pretty quiet so when I get the chance to speak or communicate I end up abusing it and I never know when to..... .. I'll attempt to make up for it, I'll make that fast (rant free) review now.... here goes....<br/><br/>SKIP TO HERE INSTEAD<br/><br/>Logan is Oscar Bait. It is lazy unoriginal garbage that takes itself way too seriously."

","This is my first review even though I have been a member here since late 90's early 2000s. This is due to the fact that I don't understand the love for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie stumbles about trying to figure out how to be a road trip movie with a western genre landscape and superhero theme. The result is a pretentious sloppy mess that takes itself too serious while giving very little regard to the films that led to this one.<br/><br/>The fans that requested an ""R"" rating did so with the thinking that it would open up the film to be more free with the character. Instead it felt like it was pigeon holed into justifying the R rating from the senseless breast flashing to random F-bombs that don't fit the characters as presented previously in the last 17 years.<br/><br/>The 2:21 run time seemed to drag past three hours as I felt a lack of empathy for any of the characters as they are not fully developed and flushed but rather used as props for beautiful shots against the desert and country roads of Mexico and rural America.<br/><br/>Logan's disregard to the other characters in the film was forced and lacked any connection to the empathetic character we were introduced to in the original X-Men film in which we were introduced to a character that felt compelled to help Marie D'Ancanto after encountering her on the road. Logan, though he has tried to be a loner, never really was a loner without any empathy. That is until this movie and the motivation for this lack of empathy towards a little girl and her issues is troubling as a movie goer. <br/><br/>I can not find a reason to recommend this movie or to see it again outside of the beautiful cinematography throughout the film."

","After countless delays and due to my stupidly swollen watchlist I finally got round to seeing Logan which at time of writing currently sits at #155 on IMDb's Top 250 list.<br/><br/>Though never really a fan of the X-Men movies due to the lack of consistency and shifting timelines I've always loved Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The man has taken the character and made it is own as the likes of Robert Englund did with Freddy and for this reason I hope we don't see Wolverine again as a recast would be a travesty.<br/><br/>Due to the high rating, rumours of the film & Jackman claiming this was his last film as Wolverine I went in with very high expectations and truth be told they simply weren't met.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong Logan is a good movie, Jackman is great, Keen is surprisingly competent and the movie flows nicely but it all felt very familiar and rather anti-climatic.<br/><br/>Wolverine has become of the most iconic movie characters of the last few decades so if this was destined to be his last film we truly needed something special and I don't believe this comes under that category.<br/><br/>Even with fantastic actors like Patrick Stewart, Richard E Grant & Stephen Merchant the movie never came close to reaching its potential and left me more than slightly let down.<br/><br/>The ending, arguably the worst part of the film. No spoilers to be found here just wads of disappointment.<br/><br/>After 9 films as Wolverine I salute Hugh Jackman for literally becoming a character, all the respect in the world.

In fact why not just stay home and watch terrorist videos on YouTube? <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman may as well not even have appeared in this bloated, exploitative, anti-human mess. The film is just one long hyperviolent chase scene. Donald catches up with Logan and Laura, and there is a lengthy fight involving decapitations, dismemberment, and graphic impalement of various body parts. You see Logan's blades puncturing faces and skulls. When the director feels that the fight scene has gone on long enough, Logan and Laura make a temporary escape. Donald regroups, lather, rinse, repeat. <br/><br/>There are a couple of gratuitous Christophobic images. One of the bad guys has a Christian cross tattooed on his arm. The arm is removed from his body. In another scene, a cross is repurposed into an X, for X- Men."

"Mike_Devine","8","16","33","13 August 2017"," A worthy, respectable finale to a storied franchise
","Marvel's 'X-Men' universe has come a long way since its debut on the silver screen back in 2000. 17 years later, audiences get to experience 'Logan,' the final chapter in the franchise as we know it.<br/><br/>In 'Logan,' we have a much darker, grittier story in which Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is faced with helping a young mutant (Dafne Keen) escape the anti-mutant strongholds of Mexico and the USA to Canada. In this sense, the film should not be considered a traditional superhero story, but instead a violent drama. There is much more of an emphasis on character development and dialogue as opposed to special effects and cheesy one-liners, as we see how the physical and emotional wear-and-tear that Logan has experienced over the years has finally taken its toll on him.<br/><br/>In addition to Jackman and Keen, we get to see strong performances from Patrick Stewart reprising his role as the venerable Professor Charles Xavier and Boyd Holbrook as the bounty hunter Pierce. This core cast is enough of a foundation on which to build the rest of the film, and is a better way to create a more meaningful film compared with stretching screen time too thin in previous 'X-Men' offerings.<br/><br/>There are also a few themes that are explored through 'Logan,' including perseverance, sacrifice and faith, which elevates the impact that the film has on audiences. Through all of these, it's really the metamorphosis that Logan undergoes as an individual based on the challenges he confronts that really puts an accent mark on the film.<br/><br/>While it's bittersweet to see this franchise likely end, 'Logan' is a worthy, respectable finale that does enough to satisfy fans."

Most of the super hero movies were rated PG-13, now we have another one that is rated R. There one flash of brief nudity, so we could have that added to the rating of the movie, that did nothing to add to the plot of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to go out of its way to kill anything that brought a moment of pleasure to heroes of the story.<br/><br/>They don't give Laura's age in the movie, but the actress is 11 years old.

I left the theater feeling as if all they wanted was to get my money one last time. What they state in the preview is the ENTIRE movie, no need to watch it, it dragged very slowly during much of the film. at one point I left to go to the bathroom, got back and still nothing had changed, no action, no nothing but another slow scene. And to add this was set in the late 2020s? I thought from the last movie there was a teaser set near the same time when Professor X and Magneto came for Logan at an airport. what happened there? is this a prequel? many many more questions arose rather than answer. If this is in fact a prequel, than this fact will make me want to wait till all episodes are in and watch them in entirety then maybe it'll make sense. As it is this wasn't very well written and they writers did little to no homage to the previous X-Men franchise movies. They left out completely what had happened other than a reference or 2 to an ""event"". I don't know I felt like it wasn't worth a theater show, straight to DVD maybe but not a huge success IMO."

It was a slasher film with a kid. If this is the best XMen movie then the other movies must be pretty sorry. I'm rating a 6 since so many are giving it a 10. This isn't a perfect movie.

","Spoiler alert. I don't hold back. Stop reading now if you don't want me to ruin everything. I hated this movie, I'm doing you a favor if you decide not to see it.<br/><br/>This is a horribly dark and graphically violent movie with children. It has no taste or balance. The has few coherent parts outside of the fight scenes, and they are way over the top bloody, and the children cannot act.<br/><br/>If you want your super hero movies to have more gore that a horror slasher film then this movie is for you. But if you think scene after scene of a small girl and Logan decapitating and dismembering people sounds like a bad way to spend 90 minutes then skip this movie, even if you are a huge fan of the movie version of the wolverine character.<br/><br/>The hopelessness of this movie and darkness is also pointless. Everyone dies except the kids. (The kids just get shot and hit and then show their poor acting skills. But I don't blame the kids. I am sure the director is responsible for everything on the screen.) But back to the hopelessness - the good family they meet - all dead. Because Logan starts playing the role of thinking like someone in a horror film. Example: We have had an army chasing us the entire film, but instead of staying on the move, let's bed down with this nice defenseless family. Just stupid and predictable that later they are all violently dead. There are tons more decisions like this in the film. Ones that are stupid for the point of letting something graphically violent happen later. Just stupid horror movie plot gimmicks.<br/><br/>And oh my gosh... talk about a movie dragging out telling you something you already know. You get that the girl is somehow his daughter from the time her claws come out. But then they take the next 15 minutes of the movie acting like you don't get it. Let's have an iPhone movie about it.... in two parts after letting the battery run out... but with the second part saying nothing new. Let's have conversations about it. All that give you little or no more information than you already have. Let's have Logan go from being confused and angry to being, let's see, how about just confused and angry still. It seemed like they were covering the same weak plot points over and over in case the audience had fallen asleep because no one had been stabbed through the skull in the last 10 minutes.<br/><br/>I laughed out loud at the scene where the mute girl started talking. It is like the writers said, ""Oh crap, we have killed everyone else, what is Logan going to do for dialogue? OK, let's have her talk, but wait. She was raised in Mexico. So she needs to talk Spanish. But wait, our actress doesn't speak Spanish. We will just have her move her mouth real fast and throw Spanish words in during post. No one will know. And then later we will have her speak bilingual, but not too much."" So they take the point in the movie where a speaking girl would normally go mute (after watching several people she liked get violently killed), and they make that the point in the movie where this girl gets to start talking. It is like no one making the movie had ever met a kid. And they do throw Spanish words into a rapidly moving mouth like no one will notice. Again, it was laughably bad. <br/><br/>This movie is a complete mess. Those praising it had to have seen a different movie. Or they are just horror movie fans and finally got to see their Wolverine in one. And I know I know, the comics are dark. But it is a different thing to take a small child actor and put her in this kind of movie. It is child abuse. A small girl like that does not need to see or experience this type of violence. And everyone of those kids will be watching this movie. And it encourages small children to watch this movie when small kids are in it, and it involves characters from other movies they have seen.<br/><br/>Horrible violence in something like Hacksaw Ridge is appropriate. That movie meant something. Violence in 13 Hours means something. Horrible violence in a poorly written comic book movie filled with children is just abuse... to us and the children."

","Logan - Touted as a sci-fi western, it definitely lived up to the moniker. Far-reaching deserts and a minimalist score really set the stage. James Mangold wrote and directed it, but I wish he had put down the pen. Each scene is thoughtfully shot, but it's the story within those shots that left me wanting. The positives for me, beyond the ambiance, were two standout performances by under the radar actors. Stephen Merchant, who is usually in English sitcoms, went way off type with his character. Given his past roles I thought it was an odd casting choice at best, but now I couldn't picture anyone else doing what he did. The other was Boyd Holbrook, who played the main antagonist. The subtle choices he made in line delivery and how he carried himself made him a magnetic presence on screen. The film was much more engaging while they were involved in a scene. And then there are the negatives...As I alluded to earlier, the story was just not there. There's weak motivation throughout for both Wolverine and the villains. The movie creates its own plot holes unnecessarily and leans on tropes and off screen happenings to propel it along. The action scenes are an exercise in redundancy. Slash this guy, stab that guy, try stabbing and slashing this person, now mix it up a bit and slash THEN stab this guy. Once you see the first fight you'll have seen them all. And finally there are the inconsistencies with the special effects. They could create extremely detailed battle damage, but couldn't remove the prominent scar on the forehead of the self- healing girl. They could green screen prosthetic arms for multiple characters, but couldn't remove the reflection of the camera in peoples' sunglasses. These, and other details, while minor, added up quickly. Suffice it to say, this western did anything but ride off into the sunset. 4.5/10."

"gerick_goldwyn","1","25","57","2 May 2017"," An all out sh*t movie!
","I am absolutely stunned that this film has received so much positive feedback online; when I couldn't be more disappointed! It's by far the worst Marvel film we have seen to date. The story line was incredibly weak – I personal believe it was written by a 12-year-old child – and the movie itself, is set during another random messed up future time line, which completely falls out of sync with the rest of the X-Men (or Marvel) films we have seen to-date. <br/><br/>Once again, this movie failed to capture (or portray) Wolverine's character properly. The closest we've seen so far is: The Wolverine (2013). However, my biggest criticism is: I am so sick to death of seeing Wolverine fight at a disadvantage. It's like he has a permanent piece of Kryptonite rammed so far up his ass, he is incapable of fighting properly. In the first Wolverine film (X-Men Origins: Wolverine), we were forced to watch him fight with the indignity of bone claws; I wasn't very happy when Marvel added bone claws to Wolverine's mutation in 1994, when in the previous 20 years, his claws were always the result of the Weapon X project. Not some bizarre, gross mutation. However, since it was an Origin story, I can bring myself to overlook this. In the second film (The Wolverine), his powers were suppressed by Viper (or that machine attached to his heart), and in this film (Logan), we were forced to watch him: as a tired, broken down, old man. It's so disappointing You might notice, when we watch all the other Marvel superheros on screen, they're all fighting at full strength (or in their prime); not at 10 or 20 percent of their working capacity. I want to see Wolverine completely cut lose! Is that too much to ask!! In the Avengers (or in the Captain America films), we see Captain America seriously kick ass, he is awesome, and so are all the Avengers. Even Spiderman and Ant-man kicked ass in the last Avengers film. We have never seen Wolverine shown in that light before. Half the time Wolverine is getting his ass kicked by random no bodies, and there is never a mission impossible factor involved. I cannot believe Disney don't get that God, it's pathetic!! I think we could have seen Wolverine fight at his best if he joined the Avengers, and I would have loved to seen Hugh Jackman join the team. He probably would have stolen the spotlight though.<br/><br/>I am also getting a bit sick and tired of seeing Marvel (or Disney now) releasing a X-Men film with no concept of who the X-Men are, what the series is all about, and what the characters are all capable of. In the first X-Men movie for example, Mystique and Rogue are mortal enemies, when in the comic book series, Mystique is actually Rogues adopted mother, so they would never harm one another, and their relationship is critical to the Rogues eventual story. In X2 and X-Men 3, Jean was given the power of the Phoenix Force, when the Phoenix's abilities were never part of her natural mutation. In X-Men 3, Professor X and Juggernaut weren't even step brothers, and in the final X-Men film: Apocalypse, Mystique and Nightcrawler were roughly the same age, when Mystique is Nightcrawlers biological mother, and there are errors or inconsistencies like this throughout the entire X-Men (film) series. With this film for example, Laura has the exact same mutation (or powers) as Wolverine; that isn't how mutations work, identical powers aren't passed from father to son. I can provide 1000 examples on this point but I won't. God!! Does anyone actually read the comic books over there at Disney?! Just imagine tuning into a random episode of Game of Thrones and none of the Lannisters are related, the Tyrion Lannister (the Imp) is a Giant (and is as dump as a box of hair) and Winterfell is in the South rather than the North, which is completely being run by the White Walkers under the blistering sun. You would think: if Hollywood was going to make a movie based on Games of Thrones, they could at least get these facts right – or is that asking too much? Apparently so I feel that's what the X-Men (film) series has become now. I feel it's become nothing more than a jumbled mess of random crap, and we're supposed to praise Marvel (or Disney) for their work. This movie was nothing more than another messed up alternate future, where mutates have largely been wiped out. So in the next X-Men film, are we going to see another time traveler go back in time and fixes thing because Marvel (or Disney) are incapable of producing a decent X-Men film. That's going to get, real old real fast. Whoever wrote this film has no concept of who Wolverine is or what the X-Men is all about! They came close in X- Men: First Class, X- Men: Days of Future Past and The Wolverine. I know these movies have inconsistencies compared to the comics but at least they came close to capturing what the X-Men is all about. However, this movie (Logan) was a complete mess, and only encourages me NOT to see anymore X-Men films at the movies! And, I won't be ever again! The X-Men has so much potential on the big screen but Disney seems determine to screw it all up! You know, get your sh*t together people, we deserve much better"

I'm that upset about this rubbish.<br/><br/>The most important thing about Super Hero style movies is that people like this fan, go to see HEROES WIN AND SAVE THE DAY. I'm sorry if a few unmentionables can't handle that or find the concept trite or boring etc, but the world needs Super heroes, not super loosers.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this film was the young troupe of new mutants(genetically engineered mutants). Sadly as I hope your getting the idea, the whole concept ruins the ideas that came before and more to the point Wolverine(I'm not going to call this character by the name that belongs to this terrible movie ever again), totally destroys the place of his origin. Zip, NADA, nothing left folks, so this whole story is a complete pile of badly written 'what if' at best.<br/><br/>Don't let this be the first (and last) X-Men film you ever see. Skip this one and enjoy the glorious other movies that Marvel has put out. This movie was so bad, they didn't even have a snippet clip at the end of the movie(even Marvel must have realised it would be wasting it's time doing so with this one, because most of the people in the cinema I saw it in, walked out as soon as the credits started rolling and all I heard where numerous comments about how bad they found the movie).<br/><br/>So no spoilers to give on this one fellow movie fans because the entire movie is a spoiler.

The fact that the movie was close to two and a half hours with no explanation actually made parts painful to watch. Everything is ""mysteriously"" unanswered and even from someone who's usually not bothered by violence, there's a very unnecessary amount ( trust me the origins wolverine is like you're in a kindergarten class playing with dinosaurs compared to it ). The only two characters from previous movies ( Logan and Charles) had hardly any lines, and most were ambiguous at best, or just a lot of random swearing.

However Pierce returns with a group and Laura uses abilities similar to Logan to escape with Professor Xavier and Logan, but Caliban is captured by Pierce and his men. While heading to Eden. Logan discovers that Gabriela was a nurse in the Transigen Corporation taking care of children developed with abilities by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant).

We were very disappointed in this one, and we regretted renting it. It just lacks the appeal and the gusto that previous X-Men movies had. If you are a die hard X-Men fan, and you never miss a single one, then I guess you'll watch it anyway, but for you all who are just the casual watcher, then prepare to be let down by this one. I personally would say just save your money and don't bother with this one, but that's for you all to decide. As for my wife and I, we thought it was awful, and wish we could get our money back.

"HorrorBrainShane","5","9","17","20 September 2017"," A slog through depressing Western tropes...starring Wolverine
","This movie is a Western. Let me get this out of the way first and foremost- I love westerns. I do not like westerns that remove the tropes, allegory, and character arcs from the setting of the old west and transpose it somewhere else. Perhaps that is just my opinion, but the setting is intrinsic to a large part of the narratives that westerns often use.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold clearly loves films like The Searchers, True Grit, A Fistful of Dollars, and Shane- Logan is rife with references. It telegraphs the plot, uses very obvious foreshadowing, and paints its obvious plot out for you. You know what's going to happen, in spite of how much you don't want it to. And I really didn't want it to.<br/><br/>This film has zero fun factor whatsoever. It's a hideously depressing film, one that doesn't celebrate the history of the character of Wolverine or use him in the comic-book context with which we are so accustomed. Instead, this hyper-realistic version of the universe has just about everything that could turn off someone looking to have fun. Perhaps brutal nihilism in the face of your own growing mortality is one person's idea of a good superhero movie. Not for me. This is Wolverine, not Neil Gaiman or Jhonen Vasquez creations. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is why the film got such a great reception: it is not a prototypical superhero film. But it isn't a very ambitious film, either, just a film that plays with genre expectations in one specific way in order to completely copy elements of older films. Even the cinematography is lengthy, uninspired, and wholly traditional. Even the plot follows a rinse-repeat formula reminiscent of the Man with No Name films. The saving grace of the film stems from its obvious influences, because if you copy enough good movies you'll eventually make some good narrative choices. The plot isn't bad, it's derivative. The movie isn't poorly made, it's poorly conceived.<br/><br/>I simply ask one thing of superhero and comic book films: Even if it is dark or r-rated, it still has to be entertaining. Logan is not. It;'s anti-fun, sucking energy from every person who views it. Logan has some fantastic performances and calls back to a lot of great old Westerns, but it's not a good superhero movie because it made me uncomfortably depressed, bored, and begrudgingly disappointed at how traditional, derivative, and copycat the movie is, and how much it utterly failed at being fun."
"graves-michele","2","29","70","7 March 2017"," Instead of this see...
","Although I shout ""Make mine Marvel!"" at the beginning of these movies and love most of them I cannot recommend Logan. The best part of this movie was the casting and great performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newcomer Dafne Keen.<br/><br/>However, if you are looking for a dark movie about the mistreatment of children strongly prefer the horror film ""The Girl With All the Gifts"" which has a stronger story, unique science fiction elements and includes social commentary.<br/><br/>Logan is a gritty, thriller in which our anti-hero feels a lot like just another Jack Bauer, Ethan Hunt, Jason Bourne with a plot that feels like we're watching a grim, drug-addled, violent downer of a drama i.e. Traffic, Training Day, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas — not a comic book superhero.<br/><br/>To the marketers credit, this was as advertised — ""Logan"" not Wolverine with a Johnny Cash/Kurt Cobain soundtrack. Point taken.<br/><br/>Indeed, I left the theater feeling hurt. Logan was no fun."
"wgeddings","1","25","59","5 March 2017"," Good acting and potential that is wasted
","I wanted to like this movie but the longer it went, the more I disliked it. I can only think how much better this movie would have been if Marvel had made it and done the story right. The good is that the acting is very good and Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart deliver great performances as you would expect from them. Stephen Merchant was great as Caliban. Dafne Keen was the true find as she did an outstanding job as Laura (X-23). Not speaking for most of the film means she had to rely on facial expression and looks and she did them with a lot of skill. Whether it was her or just great direction, the point is that she executes her role wonderfully. She has very expressive eyes and at times reminded me of a very young Sandra Bullock. I hope she has a long career. <br/><br/>The bad is the typical problem when Marvel isn't making the movie. Apparently the desire is to make superhero movies where the superheros detest their powers and stay far away from lame things like costumes (ie what fan like). So of course there are no costumes in this and there is a lot of complaining about having fantastic powers and everyone seems to determined use kung fu rather than actually use those powers. <br/><br/>At several points, it seemed that someone in Hollywood got an idea and insisted that it be included (hey let's involve border crossings, hey we need to say something about big corporations, hey let's complain about self-driving cars, etc. etc.) which all just muddle the story and add nothing in my opinion. <br/><br/>Although his acting was as good as always, I found Prof. X a distraction in the movie and was disappointed with his storyline. Others may disagree. <br/><br/>This movie is rated R. There are some bloody scenes but there are a lot of F-Bombs. Despite the rating, we had a 9 year old Wolverine fan sitting behind us constantly asking his parent what this or that means. With Wolverine being such a child-friendly character in comics and cartoons, making an R rated version was a pretty bad idea since a lot of kids are going to want to see it and give their parents plenty to have to explain. Deadpool could do it since Deadpool is not that common with kids. In fact, the best part of the movie was the preview (kind of preview) for the upcoming Deadpool sequel. <br/><br/>This was the 3rd movie I have seen recently in the theaters where the audience was disruptive. Talking, cell phones, etc. (one guy even taking a phone call during the film!) made it a bad experience. I love seeing movies in a theater but if people cannot learn that when in a theater they are NOT in their own den watching Netflix, I will have to seriously rethink it. Ticket prices keep going up and up and highly disruptive customers (forget poor films) make a good explanation for why people are staying away from theaters."

If Canada is such a safe option (and why would it be considering you've got ruthless killers after you who already operate with abandon in Mexico) why not just meet in Canada? <br/><br/>If what look like 12 year old kids whose only previous existence has been in captivity make such an arduous trip seemingly alone and unscathed, how can an adult with life experiences with 20 grand in her hand make such a balls up of everything.<br/><br/>The kids were to be exterminated yet now they must be captured alive? Then you go after the kids with lethal weapons yet you tell your mercenaries not to shoot, why not have non lethal weapons etc? <br/><br/>The only noticeable nod to the future I saw were driverless trucks, yet these trucks had no hazard perception or means of avoiding an accident other than the sounding of a horn? <br/><br/>There are many more plot holes and stupidity evidenced in the film.

","As others have said, the performances by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are very strong and the film evokes a powerful dark mood. If it were therefore not the sequel to many previous more upbeat movies, this movie would have worked very well as a standalone drama.<br/><br/>Because it is part of long-running franchise, however, it comes across as painfully incongruous with previous X-Men movies. At the outset of the movie, we see that Logan has descended once again into misery, so all of the gains made in ""The Wolverine"" are lost. Once again also, mutants are on the edge of extinction, so all gains made in ""Days Of Future Past"" are lost (and less than 10 years later, to add to the bewilderment). Basically, it looks like some writer liked the idea of rebooting the mutant doomsday concept of DOFP and taking it in a bleaker direction.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but while excellent acting is something I like in a movie, a good story is at least as important, and to make a good story, you can't render previous entries in the franchise completely pointless. The fact that this happens in the final Wolverine outing, with no opportunity to recover is, of course, all the more heartbreaking.

But, unfortunately, he is confronted by an evil next step by the lineage of the X-men experiments. This is a wild ride as his ""daughter,"" a clone of him, and he try to find other kids who have been changed and bring them to safety. Of course, the bad guys don't want their escapades to get out.

Wolverine is one of the most appealing X-Men to watch as he's one of the more ""human"" ones and one we can relate most with. In Logan you get a more emotional story, with of course alot of action scenes. Those action scenes are worth the detour, especially the ones where Logan fights side by side with the young Dafne Keen.

","The movie is a train-wreck from beginning to end. There's hardly a plot in the movie. In fact, here's the story line in one tweet-sized sentence:<br/><br/>Wolverine escorts a mutant little girl from Mexico to Canada and everyone dies on the way, including himself. <br/><br/>Since there's no story line, I will point out a few non senses: 1) There's no explanation why Wolverine, Prof. X and Caliban are hiding in the desert. Where are all the other mutants? Suddenly there's no one else.<br/><br/>2) Prof. X was a wealthy man how did they end up with nothing.<br/><br/>3) Prof. X is supposed to be the greatest brain in the world, thus he should be able to control his own ""brain"" diseases. <br/><br/>4) The most ridiculous part is the depiction of ""future"". The only futuristic thing in the whole movie is the self- driving/autonomous highway trucks. However, in the movie they are road-killers, bashing everything on their way. The trucks just run wild at max speed ignoring traffic. I am amazed that there was no quality control on terrible ideas whatsoever. Seriously, they had no one reviewing the sketches before shooting it?<br/><br/>5) A wolverine Clone pops out of nowhere, and without any explanation. The comics might explain but the director should have kept in mind this is a stand alone movie.<br/><br/>6) Everyone dies. Literally, everyone (except the kids, but that's because children death is hardly accepted by any audiences).<br/><br/>7) Non trained nurses are responsible for freeing the mutants from a super high security facility.<br/><br/>8) The nurse wants to take the kids to ""eden"", just because she saw in a comic book. The kids actually go there and meet in the coordinates given in the comics. Meaning that, someone wrote the comics for that. But who? Who needs an explanation? Anyway, at this point I though the plot was a cheap rip-off from the series Heroes. <br/><br/>9) All the mutant kids have super powers and they seemed pretty well combat-trained. How a bunch of dudes with guns are able to capture them again and again?<br/><br/>10) Finally, the ""bad"" corporation that are hunting the mutant kids, are exploding, shooting and killing everyone on their way. It is ridiculous to think that once they reach the border limits with Canada they would accept defeat: ""Oh man, the kids crossed the border, there's nothing we can do, they won"""

","As a comic book reader, I've seen a lot of misleading plot points when screenplays try to merge a lot of material into one original motion picture. Sometimes it's because they down own the full characters rights to make the full adaptation of the original but sometimes its lazy screenwriting in my opinion.<br/><br/>In Logan I was very pleased to see a great comic to film merge of a lot of source material without compromising the full marvel (x men) franchise in the meantime. It's done in such a superb matter that you almost don't get the full attention caught with the R rated scenes as they serve a purpose for the story. True to be told, Wolverine is one of the most lethal characters in comic book media that's ussually reprised as a good guy as he should be depicted more as an antihero.<br/><br/>Great work for an already intense actor before he was really too old for a character that's supposed to not age at all."

"Tweekums","9","4","6","7 May 2018"," A gritty, more adult Wolverine film
","It is 2029 and Logan is getting old and tired. Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive; he too is old though and as his mind goes so does the control of his powers. Logan is working as a limo drive in the area near the Mexican border and is approached by a woman asking him to drive her and a young girl, Laura, to North Dakota. It turns out Laura is a mutant with similar powers to Logan; unlike him though she isn't a natural mutation but one of a group of new mutants created in a lab in Mexico City as part of an experiment to create super-soldiers. When the experiment was judged to have failed the children were due to be killed so their carers are trying to get them to safety. Logan is initially unwilling to get involved but eventually ends up heading north with Laura and Xavier. They are pursued by those determined to retrieve Laura; everybody who gets in their way is expendable.<br/><br/>Those expecting another 'X-Men' film will certainly get a bit of a shock; this is not an exciting superhero movie suitable for all but young children. Instead it is almost consistently downbeat with some fairly brutal violence as Logan and Laura remove limbs and puncture skulls with their adamantium claws. There are some genuine surprises as bad things happen to characters one would expect to be safe. Hugh Jackman is great in the lead role, showing a different side to Logan; he is no longer young and angry, instead he is old and world-weary. Young Dafne Keen impresses as Laura; an almost feral girl who makes Hit Girl from 'Kick-Ass' look gentle! There are nods to other films; most notably 'Shane', which Laura watches with Xavier and their search for the possibly mythical Eden in North Dakota reminded me of a different Logan's search for Sanctuary in 'Logan's Run'. I'd certainly recommend this to older X-Men fans but would caution against showing it to younger fans as it is very violent and has some pretty depressing moments."

","Seeing how many people have praised this movie, i decided to give it a whirl.<br/><br/>2 hours and 18 minutes later i came away saddened that my time had not been spent in a more entertaining way.<br/><br/>Logan trundles the story like a helpless blind man whose hands have inexplicably been replaced by running chainsaws in a slaughterhouse. Its bloody, but the violence has no substance nor sense of direction.<br/><br/>Why would any viewer care about a rapidly self-healing demigod brawling it out with gunslingers and other mutants, when him winning the encounter appears to just be a question of time or bullets?<br/><br/>As such, even from the position of somebody that enjoys violent or bloody movies, it has to be said that none of the action scenes emit any pathos. They just happen.<br/><br/>The dialogue is bland and forgettable, as are the adversaries and their motivations. It might have been more efficient for the majority of them to say just plainly admit that they are the bad guys in order to allocate even more screen time to the violence.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, but i just don't see any good reason to.

"beladornon2","5","10","20","22 March 2017"," Sad slasher-porn ending to a good franchise
","Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart alone are responsible for the few good moments in this sadistically bloody slasher epic, which details the death of the X-man Wolverine in some alternate future in 2029. At a recent screening at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, director James Mangold rambled on and on about his love of cowboy films and the classic SHANE in particular. Sir Patrick Stewart, who was also there, and who was treated rather shabbily by said director, revealed that the amusing dialogue between his character and Jackman's Logan was entirely ad-libbed. Thus we can credit Scott Frank and Mangold only with one tedious slashing/shooting death after another, all bereft of explanation, logic, or a coherent plot. Cyborg killers in Mad Max-style vehicles? No explanation. Mutant Caliban who can't go in the sun? No explanation or back story at all. Lack of all law enforcement? no explanation. The writers don't care. Other tallies include— Claw slashings: at least 200. Bullets: in the millions. F-bombs: about twenty-five. <br/><br/>The Wolverine character deserves so much more than this. Whatever praise comes should be given to Jackman and Stewart alone, and to oddly violent little newcomer Dafne Keen; the rest of the film is a jumbled mess of disjointed scenes mimicking some of the good bits in SHANE. To make sure you get the connection, Mangold has his characters actually watch SHANE on a TV in some hotel. How boring."

That especially goes for all of the X-Men movies, I just feel pain because of their obvious stupidity.
That's when Logan comes into the place. There is no life ending threat to humanity, there are just Logan and those he loves. I liked how the villain can't be called a proper villain, who is just a younger version of Logan himself. The characters are not hilariously powerful, Logan is old and irritated and his actions are lot less destructive than before. And his greatest villain is himself.
No superhero movie felt so personal, so intimate to me before. The ending is not the end of the world, but Logan dying with his own heart in his hands.

Yes, Logan in every single way possible for me made me feel and think every single emotion, thought, etc. that they were trying to convey. I was on board for every second of this movie.

I have seen this movie five times since its release (4 in color and 1 in black/white) and by the end I am crying every single time Laura cries ""daddy."" The acting is superb, the direction style is fantastic, the music is incredibly haunting and beautiful, and more. But, I will finish this by saying that this is Hugh Jackman's magnum opus, and if he does not get at least an Oscar nomination for this I will be very disappointed. He laid it all on the line in this movie, and in my opinion elevated the entire genre of comic book movies with a sense of gravitas and subtlety that few leading actors have ever done in my opinion.

From the emotional relationship to the plot and character of wolverine this film had my interest most of the time. This is a great superhero film that is not like most where it has the need relate to other superheros or other films, but instead has its own movie that excels.

Its always some cliché bad guy, too. If Wolverine would do the claw through the face move on random ""climate deniers"", that could be entertaining.<br/><br/>And I don't understand how crossing the border into Canada is going to help these mutant children.

It is a bloody kill fest, showing a very downbeat and almost hopeless side of a former superhero. The story is quite slow in the first half, and actually the second half as well. I keep thinking that the film should be ending, but it just keeps going on and on. The change in the girl's behaviour at the end is quite annoying, as she should really have acted like that right in the first place, rather than saving it until so late. Is she doing that just for comic effect? I don't know, but it turns out to be annoying to me.<br/><br/>If it was not for the spectacular performance of the girl, who looks calm, cool and ruthless all at once, the film would have been rather lackluster.

"supermaggie","3","11","23","9 March 2017"," Not a worthy X-Men/Wolverine ending but a vulgar display of brutality
","I couldn't agree less with the positive reviews. This is not a realistic movie instead of a superhero movie (if you don't like superhero movies/movies based on comics - why watch X-Men/Wolverine at all? If you are so into ""realistic"" violence, go watch Hostel and other such abominations), this movie is just wrong. There is a reason that Mad Max movies are Mad Max movies and X-Men movies are X-Men movies and that Mad Max fans like Mad Max movies and X-Men fans like X-Men movies, and there may be an overlap between these two groups but I honestly doubt that these people understand the movies then since both series have a very different angle. And if you are into obscene, decadent, depraved madness and violence, feel happy to watch the disgusting Mad Max stuff and fry your brain. If you are into cool, creative, entertaining, positive, smart action and fun, you were being served right with the X-Men movies so far. This last Wolverine movie being a disappointing exception, reveling in blood and madness, without any coolness (and I do not mean / mind that Logan is older and weaker, that's absolutely fine with me) but dirt and vulgarity instead. The stupid girl doesn't make it any better, and the ending - well, actually, after watching this torture-like installment, I do not even mind the ending anymore this much, since if this are the sequels we could have expected, I prefer it to end. Would have never thought I would ever say this: not a good/worthy ending, but at least an end. If this is what people want to see, and if this is how the so far interesting X-Men series is meant to end, I can only confirm once more that people are crazy, primitive and all together completely different from me. I don't need such a vulgar display of brutality, neither do I enjoy it or give it a high rating. TWD is over since it lost its focus and Wolverine can now be buried, too, in any respect."
"denisbarbov","9","11","23","3 March 2017"," Logan is a brutal and emotional film that encapsulates everything good about its genre.
","Coming off last year's rather disappointing X-Men: Apocalypse, I really didn't know what to expect from Logan. I was not too impressed by The Wolverine so I was wary of being overly excited. After the initial buzz from the first press screenings, however, my expectations skyrocketed. Fortunately, they were met and surpassed. Logan is a brutal and emotional film that encapsulates everything good about its genre.<br/><br/>From the very opening, the the tone is set and you immediately notice just how bloody and brutal it is. Thanks to the film's age restriction, director James Mangold has the full freedom to go as far as the story calls for. There is excessive swearing but it never comes off as forced; it's natural because the situations that these characters are put in are dire. Another thing that fascinated me was that the gore was not gratuitous and was used effectively.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it takes place in 2029, sometime after all X-men are dead but for Logan, Charles and Caliban. We don't know why and how but we are given pieces of the puzzle throughout the film that we need to put together in order to understand what has gone wrong. Logan is now old and tired of life, offering a service similar to Uber until one they his car is wrecked. I'll leave it at that as the less you know when you go in to see it, the better.<br/><br/>Logan never treats the audience as if it is dumb and doesn't spoon-feed us every single thing that is going on. Moreover, the story is so told in such a masterful manner that upon leaving the auditorium, you will have seen a film with a beginning, a middle and an end—something rare these days, especially in the superhero genre. The end of the second act is by far one of the most suspenseful and shocking ones I have seen in a long while. The entire movie is intense and doesn't let you get distracted even for a second; you're glued to the screen.<br/><br/>A big contributor to that, apart from the fantastic direction and cinematography, is the acting. Almost everyone gives an exceptional performance (save for Stephen Merchant, who is a hit or miss) but the standouts are, as you might have expected, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. The former is harrowing as the guilt and tiredness from Logan's long life is taking its toll on him, while Stewart gives an incredibly nuanced performance with exquisite subtlety. Dafne Keen is quite stellar as well, even if she doesn't play the most likable of characters. What she does in her action scenes is commendable.<br/><br/>While the film's explored themes have definitely been dealt with before, it has its own spin on them to make them thought-provoking: are corporations too unregulated? Where should a line be drawn? Does good always win or does evil overpower it sometimes? Is immigration a solution to some problems? Do you choose yourself or should you go out of your way to help the others? These and many other questions are asked but you don't always get a straight answer. Rather, you need to make up your own mind about it.<br/><br/>It is deeply emotional as well. Even though it is based on a comic-book, it isn't of the type 'let's save the world.' Instead, it's a much smaller, and therefore, a more personal film about dealing with loss and illnesses, moral dilemmas, and explores the line as to when your actions are justifiable and when you've turned into a monster.<br/><br/>Not burdened by the task to set up a plethora of sequels and prequels, the director has crafted an impeccable film about what it means to be human and how far we are willing to go for those we care about. Logan doesn't cut away from the horror that one may afflict upon others and effortlessly scrutinises the motivations behind its characters' decisions. Combine that with the brutal but exceptionally executed action scenes and you end up with a film that elevates the superhero genre."
"spidervenom90","2","14","31","21 May 2017"," truly sad
","first off, i wanna ask is how the hell can you compare this depressing nihilistic, destructive horror film to the dark knight.....or ANY superhero film? superheros were meant to inspire good and hope...this film only destroyed those elements it completely baffles me how this destructive gore fest is being called ''the best superhero film of all time''. as for the dark knight trilogy-batman inspired people....even the criminals....logan starts off depressing and ends depressing. logan provided the perfect chance to restore the xmen and complete charels's dream by saving this dark, depressing world-yet, they chose to kill logan-and leave children trained to be weapons with no guidance, no hope to be anything more than weapons....this film spits on every xmen film before it, it spits on the xmen and the superhero gen as a whole and frankly, from what i've read-if it wasn't as graphic as it was- not very many people would've bothered....hell, one person here pretty much said this film would be nothing without the r rating! i saw the potential it had....but completely disregarded all that just to make a depressing, destructive, gore fest-frankly, i feel the r rating is what ruined this film. logan never liked killing in the past films- he would always try to avoid killing-here, he'll go out of his way to do so in the most graphic ways, logan is supposedly remorseful for the lives he's taken....yet, he kills more in this film-so i can't believe this, he also have a little girl who looks up to him.....and he continues killing! i can recall i quote from days of the future: I was your most helpless student, and you unlocked my mind. You showed me what I was, you showed me what I can be-so, in conclusion-he should've killed even less and he should've lived. so, i gives this film 2 stars-1 for the acting, another for the potential it had to be a masterpiece. i also wanna say that even though most say they can't relate to laura-i can, however. it's also worth mentioning logan has been a very influential character-taught me to never give up. another lesson completely overlooked is: just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn't mean they're lost forever. but, a quote that that should've been the theme here is: why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up! i also wanna say that the fact Laura is mute mostly is understandable-think about the crap she went through-would YOU be very social? one other thing i wanna address is statements regarding the children......of course they're gonna gonna be afraid.....they're abused children!"

"zardoz-13","9","7","13","18 March 2017"," Marvelous Marvel Masterpiece!!!
","Twentieth Century Fox has brought the curtain down on its original ""X-Men"" franchise with the ""Wolverine"" spin-off ""Logan,"" co-starring Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart. ""Wolverine"" writer & director James Mangold's abrasive, slam-bang, but valedictory entry doesn't resemble the usual, optimistic, hyperbolic, Marvel spectacle with a vibrant ending. Mangold and scenarists Scott Frank of ""The Wolverine"" and Michael Green of ""Green Lantern"" have formulated an often violent, profane saga set twelve years into the future. Jackman and Stewart claim this movie marks the last time they will portray Wolverine and Professor Xavier. Unlike earlier franchise entries, ""Logan"" arrives with an R-rating for its ""strong brutal violence and language throughout, and for brief nudity."" Saying that ""Logan"" sheds the kid gloves that previous ""X-Men""/ ""Wolverine"" movies wore amounts to an understatement. The ""Kids in the Mind"" website, for example, counted as many as 53 F-words and its derivatives, 24 scatological expressions, 9 anatomical names, and 6 minor obscenities. Although enough blood & gore flows for a half-dozen movies, the ferocity of watching various characters getting viciously battered as well as slashed and gouged constantly, usually with multiple blades skewering heads should keep squeamish audiences screaming and gorehounds drooling. ""Logan"" doesn't confine its murderous mayhem strictly to its valiant heroes and slimy villains. This anything-goes opus slaughters innocent bystanders with relative indifference. The thing to remember about ""Logan"" is Twentieth Century Fox produced it rather than Disney Marvel, so it doesn't resemble ""Iron Man,"" ""Thor,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""The Avengers,"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Mind you, the ""X-Men"" movie franchise probably won't vanish altogether since James McAvoy may still reprise his younger Professor Xavier, while a different actor will inevitably deploy those retractable, razor-sharp, adamantium claws that Hugh Jackman has wielded with such finesse in nine X-Men films over 17 years.<br/><br/>First, ""Logan"" takes place in the year 2029. Although everything appears contemporary, Mangold has inserted some thought-provoking, futuristic touches, such as self-driving tractor-trailer rigs that careen along the highways oblivious to the safety of other motorists. Second, the heroes and villains dress like ordinary people, and Logan and Professor Xavier are far older than we've ever seen them. They are hiding out when the film unfolds, and Professor Xavier suffers from degenerative brain disease. Indeed, Xavier relies entirely on Logan to protect him from unscrupulous people that want to seize the man with ""most dangerous mind."" The two have sought refuge across the border in Mexico, and Logan works as a limo driver. He manages with considerable difficulty to keep Professor Xavier on medications that prevent him from suffering terrible psychic seizures. These seizures constitute the equivalent of earthquakes that can paralyze people in their shoes. Some audiences may be turned off by the commonplace reality with which Mangold and his writers have wall-papered ""Logan."" Jackman's grandpa version of the Wolverine is comparable to Frank Miller's depiction of an older Batman in the graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" except Logan is in far worse physical condition. Indeed, Logan can still slice and dice his adversaries like a Christmas turkey, but his healing powers have waned. A physician warns Wolverine that he may be suffering from adamantium poisoning. The first scene shows Logan awakening from a siesta in his luxurious 2024 Chrysler limo to find a gang of truculent border trash trying to steal his tires. Our hero approaches them, and a fracas erupts that leaves several either dead or wounded. Wolverine, however, emerges the worst for wear, staggering about clumsily as he slashes and gashes his aggressive opponents who blast away at him. He is often shown repeatedly guzzling liquor and dresses in a sloppy manner. Director James Mangold stages Logan's hand-to-hand combat scenes so each battle has a chaotic and frenzied spontaneity. Nothing about the fights that ensue appear visually cool and kinetic as they were in earlier ""X-Men"" films. Sometimes, Logan looks like he is going to lose until he lets his rage fuel his ferocity. <br/><br/>Logan discovers that a desperate Mexican woman, Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez of ""Miami Vice""), has been following him. She has a group of mutant children with her. These children are not only trying to elude the henchmen, but they also trying to reach safety across the Canadian border. She pleads with Wolverine to drive them to their destination. He refuses to acknowledge her presence, but then discovers that an obnoxious enforcer, Pierce (Boyd Holbrook of ""Run All Night""), with a mechanical hand and a cynical Southern drawl, from the Mexican research facility Transigen wants to recapture the children. These children are laboratory mutants on the lam. One of them, Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen), brandishes lethal claws like Wolverine; she may be reserved and pint-sized but those claws do her talking. She demonstrates her savagery when she beheads the Goliath-like henchman sent to seize her.<br/><br/>""Logan"" boasts several exciting confrontations as Wolverine and Laura make mincemeat out of an overwhelming number of adversaries. The beauty of these scenes is that the hapless enemy doesn't have a clue about their impending demise. Mangold and company generate one surprise after another as Wolverine and Professor Xavier flee from Pierce and his legion of hooligans on a road trip. Laura accompanies them and earns their respect as a devastating killing machine, and her combat scenes are extraordinary. Eventually, new nemesis Dr. Xander Rice (Richard E. Grant of ""Hudson Hawk""), who wants the children captured, loosens his ultimate secret weapon X-24 that battles Wolverine to a virtual stalemate. The avalanche of tragic events that accumulate as ""Logan"" spirals toward its twilight of the gods ending may sadden some moviegoers. Furthermore, the dearth of backstory about the conspicuous absence of the other X-Men qualifies as ""Logan's"" solitary shortcoming. As the wizened Wolverine, Hugh Jackman evokes sympathy. Patrick Stewart fares no less admirable as the dementia-afflicted Professor Xavier who struggles to come to terms with his murky past. Altogether, ""Logan"" is unforgettable! Incidentally, a hilarious skit with Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool serves as a prologue."

","Half-man, half-beast. A brooding, violent mass of rage who shreds to pieces anyone foolish enough to stand in his way. Isn't that what all of us Marvel fans envision when we hear the name Wolverine?<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed when I saw the trailer for Logan. The fierce anti hero we're familiar with is a shell of his former self. Suffering from pain and drudging through day-to-day life. Far from the short-tempered badass that characterizes Wolverine.<br/><br/>I went to view Logan with low expectations and sense of loyalty. After all, Hugh Jackman is nearing 50 years of age. His hard work and determination to give us a final Wolverine performance is admirable (hopefully I can deadlift half the weight he does at his age).<br/><br/>The plot is set in 2029, with Logan making a living as an alcoholic limousine chauffeur - while doing his best to look after an ailing Professor X. The tone is dark, gritty and somber. Unsurprisingly, Logan's attempts to hide away from the world is botched when a young girl shows up in his life.<br/><br/>The movie starts off depressing and slow, but the pace ramps up quickly. Rage-fueled slashing and hacking? Delivered in spades. The action scenes are extremely violent and gory. The R-rating is well deserved.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives his best performance to date. He portrays Wolverine's nuances and inner struggles flawlessly. Dafne Keen, who portrays the young mutant Laura, gives an amazing performance as well (looking forward to her future roles). And Patrick Stewart delivers an exceptional performance as Professor X.<br/><br/>Overall, Logan blew away my expectations. As the credits rolled, I felt highly satisfied - and sad that Jackman's role of the character had come to an end.

Everything else around are to spice up this very linear moments in the life of decaying wolverine. <br/><br/>If you are thinking this is a movie that you will remember after even like a week and miss, then you are wrong.

I have no clue how IMDb works who comes and reviews these movies, it got a 8 because I suppose it is Wolverine. <br/><br/>Wolverine is a character already developed, new characters in the movie had no emotional influence on me at all including the girl.

","Logan certainly delivers in terms of hacking, slashing and stabbing, but the wounded bear routine of the titular character wears pretty thin. Logan is the antihero stock character very much in the brooding, world weary style of John Rambo. The zenith of the cliché occurs when Logan remarks that familiar tortured line: 'Everyone I care about gets hurt'. Jackman does transcend the limitations of his character with moments of raw emotion, but these are few and far between. <br/><br/>The rest of the performances are fine, passable; although I would have liked to see Richard E. Grant chew some scenery. If you're going to cast a British baddie, let him go full blown Gary Oldman - what this bleak spectacle sorely needs is some charisma. <br/><br/>Alas, the bland characterisation isn't saved by the narrative, which follows a monotonous cat-and-mouse formula that's bereft of any suspense. A viewing of 'No Country For Old Men', a preeminent cat-and-mouse film, will remind you just how tiresomely loud and noisy 'Logan' is.<br/><br/>What we have then is a dumb and decidedly average action film with a filter stripped right from Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' video and a litany of brutally repetitive fight scenes."

At the end of the movie, someone in the audience yelled out ""that ending sucked!!!"" and the entire audience laughed heartily - because most did feel that this was a mediocre tearjerker that wasted some great performances and superb CGI.<br/><br/>I won't give away too much in this review, just enough for you to set expectations. It sucks when characters do stupid things which you know occur solely to continue the plot. For example, if you know someone is coming after you to kill you and it will be worse then next go round, you don't just let them hang around as if you're just a little careless - especially after a bloodbath. And it happens too often.<br/><br/>What was truly terrible about the ending, without giving it away, was that it seemed as though the writers were trying too hard to figure out how to work in the ensemble shot reminiscent of a stage play that Hollywood cannot seem to stop itself from doing. It's phony and ludicrous. And I won't even describe the action, which basically happens throughout the movie. Characters will ""forget"" their abilities to do something smart or dangerous because if they do what you expect, it will ruin the scene from going where the directors want it to go.<br/><br/>The other aspect I didn't like about this movie was that Logan's character doesn't really get developed at all. It is manipulated and you'll appreciate what I'm saying when you finally get there. Please... we're all pretty smart. Don't insult our intelligence with yet another breathtaking spectacular moment where you can feel the director just praising himself endlessly for creating an emotional moment that is right up there on par with, oh... the climax of Saving Private Ryan. After taking forever to get to the ending, they rush right through it, as if they blew too much of the budget drawing out the first 2 hours and 10 minutes. <br/><br/>It's all watchable although completely unnecessary and milked for one last haul of cash. The young girl is very good but they seem to have kept the mystique for absolutely no reason whatsoever but to... well... make it super mysterious. It's OK but don't expect anything near the 8.4 on the IMDb ratings. This is another X-Men B-Movie, not really worth multiple viewings but something you might catch on cable. Farewell to two of the great actors who graced the screen with some great moments in cinematic history."
"Paul-271","1","10","21","11 July 2017"," Silly and Typical
","I got this as seatback entertainment on a Delta flight yesterday. I found it annoying, uninteresting and laughable at the same time. <br/><br/>It's typical superhero idiocy. Here's the key to this genre. The hero gets the snot beat out of him (or her, I suppose) until either he decides to fight back in earnest or remembers some secret word which causes something or other to happen by majicks. <br/><br/>The thing in question opens with a half dozen cholos stealing the wheels off of the title role's car while he's asleep inside of it. He comes out and nicely asks these fellows to cease. They kill him with a shotgun. Undeterred, he returns to life (?) and then tears them apart with majick talons which majickly appear at his knuckles. See? He's defeated and then gets serious. Predictable in the extreme, really. <br/><br/>So then he goes to some place which looks like south New Mexico to visit with two oddballs Who Have Majick Powers (of course). One of them is the old captain of a Star Trek TV series, Patrick Stewart, who's in a wheelchair. They are attacked by a gang copy and pasted from a Road Warrior movie led by a Bork from Star Trek. <br/><br/>I'm making NOTHING up. <br/><br/>The bad guys prevail because it's too soon for them not to. The captain, the guy with the scary knuckles and some girl who was manufactured in Mexico via a bio lab flee. I liked the movie's paying honor to the highly advanced biotech which does exist in Mexico (in secret). <br/><br/>About 9 hours later (it felt that way) the bad guys find and attack the group again - this time in a hotel casino. The captain then paralyzes them using his Super Power. I gave it up in disgust at this point. If the captain had used his Super Power back in New Mexico, the movie could have ended then. <br/><br/>There's a good deal more that I detested in this mess, but you got my take. 8 stars? This one, other than production values, should be less than Planet 9."

","This movie is ridiculous. Effects reminds me a horror movie with a small financial injection. It's even worse looking from history perspective, it's a big misery how he got sick, why, on what purpose grew up those little freaks and how did they even got Logan's DNA.<br/><br/>I am really disappointed about this crap...."
"srdjan_veljkovic","6","10","21","8 March 2017"," It's different, but that is it's only really good trait
","Yes, it's very different from other superhero movies. Not just that it takes inspiration from classic westerns, but also showing superheros when they are out of control, in fear, vulnerable, just trying to get by, rather than ""solving the world's problems"".<br/><br/>But, otherwise, it doesn't have much going for it. Hugh Jackman tries, but his ""Old Man Logan"" is strange, somehow you don't feel his struggles. You see them, but you don't feel them. Patrick Stewart does a fine job of depicting an old and sick Professor X, but his story is rather undeveloped, so, again, you don't feel it. OTOH, the X-23 is going ""full feminist rage"", and at 11 is much better than Wolverine ever was - you obviously can only feel silly about that.<br/><br/>In trying to escape explaining too much, they went overboard. They explain way too little. What's wrong with Professor X and Wolverine? Is it the same as the other mutants or not? What happened to other mutants? I mean, there's this virus and that's it? Come on, there were some geniuses there, The Beast, Emma Frost, Professor X, Jean Grey - surely they figured out something was wrong and tried to fight it. OK, they lost, but we feel way too disconnected with them to make us feel for the ones left behind.<br/><br/>Looking at this movie at its own, it has the problem of many modern movies of loosing its ""steam"" near the end. Start is OK, hey, there's even a few jokes after the first clash. But, afterwards, while trying, it fails to provide real meaning to all of this. Things happen, so it's not boring, but, it doesn't feel real or meaningful - and the ""party line"" is that this should ""feel real, unlike other superhero movies"". One of the problems is there are no more funny moments, which is not real in general, and especially for Professor X and Wolverine, who both had their distinctive senses of humor.<br/><br/>So, it's an OK watch because it's a fresh, different take on a somewhat washed-up genre, but don't expect too much."
"randomStuff101","5","14","32","6 August 2017"," It's okay, but ordinary, not clever.
","Bleak, with occasional entertaining moments and action.<br/><br/>Not as good as previous X-Men movies. Writing is simpler. Very early it becomes obvious where the story is going. <br/><br/>The little girl is good, and does provide some needed unique action. She's a copy in some ways of Hitgirl from Kick-Ass, similar age and similar level of violence. <br/><br/>Fight scenes were mostly about ""killing anonymous bad guys"" with various styles of stabbing blades through different entry points. Much like a video game, bad guys never learn that approaching a mutant with only a gun is not the best strategy, but they keep coming.<br/><br/>No doubt there's entertainment here, and a keen fan base will lap it up. Many will be happy enough with what's on offer. <br/><br/>In the end, it's just a movie, so who cares. It's a solid 5 or 6 out of 10."

"mstomaso","8","6","11","3 March 2018"," Wolverine Does Leon (The Professional) Surprisingly Well
","With strong support from Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen, Hugh Jackman successfully pulls off a sensitive portrayal of a declining hero and his somewhat self-imposed alienation, decorated with the usual Marvel studios CGI action sequences. While the CGI sequences were as protracted as they usually are in contemporary pop culture movies, they did not detract from the film's strong emotional content and were more integrated into every level of the story than they are in most comic book adaptations. <br/><br/>The Wolverine, Logan, (Jackman) may reach an heretofore unrealized peace with himself and his world through his newfound relationship with a young girl who may be his daughter Laura (Keen). However, Laura is being hunted by the same evil that has hunted Logan throughout most of his life, and his Logan's other real connection to humanity, Charles Xavier (Stewart), needs more help than he can give. The most dangerous mind in the world (Xavier) teamed up with one of the most dangerous men in the world (Logan) might seem like an undefeatable juggernaut, but for many reasons, neither of these superhero legends are what they used to be. As the story unfolds, Logan's powerful defense mechanisms are challenged in ways that have, in previous adventures, been his undoing; aspects of Laura's personality and history leave the value of the central adventure wide-open to question; and Xavier's loss of the ability to control his incredible mental powers threaten to expose everything. <br/><br/>It really is not clear what will happen in this film until it actually does. <br/><br/>Thoroughly entertaining, well-acted, well-paced and surprisingly touching, Logan is one of the best films I have seen from this genre."
"grobanworldnews","3","6","11","10 October 2017"," Highly overrated
","This movie is really over hyped and overrated. It is depressing and boring and has no real plot. I think it is overrated for two reasons--1) because it is rated R and 2) because it tried to be a ""different"" type of superhero movie by making the story a Western. Unfortunately, this film, much like that other overrated R-rated X- Men movie, Deadpool, goes overboard with the freedom of the less restrictive rating by loading itself with f-bombs and gory violence. I don't know why Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart agreed to the mediocre script that turns their once heroic characters into pathetic has beens. Logan is now a suicidal drunk and Charles is a decrepit, insane old man. Both men die pointless and violent deaths. The X-Men are decimated and everything they accomplished in the other movies was all for nothing. Logan has to get his female clone to Canada. The clone is a child who loves to dismember and behead grown men. Just really gruesome stuff. There is not hope or joy in this movie at all. The character of Caliban is just there as a plot device so Donald Pierce can use him to track Logan and his creepy clone. And, lastly, the villains are really lackluster and a huge disappointment. The Reavers, X-24, and Dr. Zander Rice are all bland and forgettable villains--some of the worst I have ever seen in any X-Men movie. Zander Rice is particularly awful, being nothing more that a generic mad scientist villain. Just a sad way to close the final chapter on the X-Men--a dark future where all the characters we've loved are doomed."
"leomilan","4","6","11","23 July 2017"," I want to like this movie but I just can't
","Logan is a movie loosely based on the comic book Old Man Logan where an old retired wolverine takes a cross country trip in search of money and redemption. The comic book was great but I can't say the same for Logan. Many people say they love this movie and the dark rated R format really captures the true essence of the wolverine character which I agree with but as a movie, I just hated it. <br/><br/>The movie starts off strong with Wolverine dismantling a Mexican gang and the portrayal of an ill Professor X, but after that all that really happens is a boring back story of X-23, Wolverine yelling at X-23 and Charles, Logan and X-23 flailing their claws killing people, and more of Hugh Jackman yelling. By the time the movie was 2/3 through I couldn't take it anymore I was overwhelmed with boredom and bad acting (mostly from the actress who portrayed Laura/X-23). <br/><br/>Overall I just felt let down by the writers. They could've done so much more with the script but they kept it to a long boring Wolverine movie with an unnecessary ambiguous destruction of the X-Men and Mutants with very little Easter eggs on what actually happened. This movie completes the Wolverine trilogy of bad writing and a waste of the Wolverine character and Hugh Jackman."
"morrison-dylan-fan","10","6","11","15 July 2017"," The Last of Us.
","Since seeing X-Men on the last family holiday I had in 2000,the franchise has always been one that has meant more to me than the other comic-book movies. With the son of my best friend being a comic- books fan and also having the name Logan,it felt like the perfect time to see Wolverine for the last time.<br/><br/>The plot-<br/><br/>2029:<br/><br/>Being one of the few mutants to still be alive,Logan/Wolverine makes money as a limo driver which he uses to get drugs for Professor Charles Xavier seizures. Returning one day to the isolated location that him,Xavier and helper Caliban are hiding in,Logan is told by Xavier that he has made contact with a mutant on the ""outside"" world. Dismissing Xavier,Logan gets caught up in a deal to take Alkali-Transigen and 11 year old Laura to a place called ""Eden."" Going to pick them up,Logan finds Transigen dead and soldiers surrounding Laura. As he reveals his claws to protect Laura,Logan discovers a brand new mutant.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Not saying a single line of dialogue for the first hour of her (film) debut, Dafne Keen gives a remarkable performance as Laura,with Keen clawing at Laura's frustrations and volatile mood swings with an abrasive body language that keeps all on edge. Raising her voice,Keen gives the difficult relationship with Logan a melancholy,which brings out a father/daughter tenderness. Losing 21 pounds for his return to the series,Patrick Stewart gives a great performance as Xavier,whose fragile,dying state Stewart does not allow to rest on pity,by showing that Xavier still has some sparks which opened the school for the X-Men.<br/><br/>Playing a role he has done for almost 20 years for the final time, Hugh Jackman gives a superb performance as Logan. Visibly carrying the history of Logan on his shoulders,Jackman gives him a raw fragility, as meeting Laura causes Logan to face his own morality.Working with Jackman for the third time,co-writer/(with Michael Green and a returning to X-Men Scott Frank) director James Mangold & cinematographer John Mathieson continue expand on the action style of The Wolverine with a thrilling,bare-knuckle fury,unleashed with blood darting across the screen and each fight move being delivered with a real thump. Setting it in the future,Mangold and Mathieson draw a Post-Apocalypse,Road Movie landscape,as the dry,dusty colour of the road and a burning red sun cast an end of days atmosphere over the journey.<br/><br/>Putting their focus on the trio,the screenplay by Mangold/Frank and Green does keep the ""baddies"" at a boo-hiss level,but does give them enough snarling menace so that they pose an aggressive threat to Logan. Using the wear and tear of Logan to take the ""superhero"" sheen off, the writers explore a wonderfully earthy character study,with the dialogue having a grittiness and an unshakeable air of death keeping everything grounded,as the ultimate X-Men reveal themselves."
"kosmasp","8","6","11","15 July 2017"," Re-tiring
","The Wolverine movies did not have much luck. While we got used to Hugh Jackman and his performance will be burned in our heads, the stand-alone movies never really stood out that much. Well that is until Logan came along. And Logan has another member of the X-Men family in it, portrayed by Patrick Stewart in this case. And while Logan/Wolverine does not age, both are retired.<br/><br/>A broken down Logan takes care of his former mentor and Professor at the Mutants Academy/school. Especially the Professor has lost a lot of his power (no pun intended). Those two are forced (you could have guessed that even without seeing the trailer) to go on one last road trip. And they have to because of a young girl. And while Logan seems not to care, circumstances do not leave him much choice.<br/><br/>There are battles, there is drama and it is one of the best X-Men movies that has been made. There is also a lot of violence. This may be a comic book adaptation, but it certainly does not shy away from the brutality of its source. And this rawness helps it elevate, helps it become even more emotional, in more than one instance. Set in the future this is a good movie to end the Wolverine .... Trilogy"
"timothyalanwilliams","6","6","11","7 June 2017"," Sad ""Logan"" Isn't Too Much Fun
","""Logan"" is the last chapter of Hugh Jackman's stand-alone Wolverine trilogy and has been one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year. Being the first R rated film in the franchise and Hugh's swan song to his most recognized role, you can expect to see a very different kind of superhero movie. And that's exactly what ""Logan"" delivers...for better or for worse. Set in 2029, we find Logan (with a frail Professor X and their hired help, Caliban) trying to lay low as a limousine driver. His secret identity is quickly blown by a woman and child who beg him for safe passage from some dangerous men who are after the child. As you garner from the previews, the child, Laura, has similar mutant tendencies as old man Logan. What follows is not your typical superhero flick. There are no aliens. No sinister plot to destroy the planet. No assembling of other heroes to defeat an army of attackers. It's just Wolverine protecting and defending those he has learned to care about. There is plenty of violent and bloody action. This is much more ""John Wick"" than ""Captain America"". I believe this is the first time you see blood on (and spraying from) Wolverine's blades during his fight scenes. And because of the R rating get ready to hear everyone drop the f-bomb frequently (I think it's the only word Logan uses for the first 10 minutes of the film). Leave the kids at home. This is NOT that kind of superhero movie. The biggest downer for me is the overall sad tone throughout the whole movie. There's not much ""fun"" to be had on this ride. ""Logan"" is serious, violent, and yes, even emotional. Like I said, not your typical superhero movie. It's very much the Ying to last year's breakout R rated superhero movie Deadpool's Yang. Where ""Deadpool"" came for your laughs, ""Logan"" aims for tears."
"bobblanchardjr","2","8","16","3 June 2017"," Huge disappointment
","I was really ready to see this movie but after I saw that it was rated R, I waited until it came out on DVD. Glad I didn't pay to go see it at the theater. While Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are amazing actors I was so turned off by how they portrayed their characters in this final movie. The whole movie lacked any kind of flow from any of the previous movies. We are dropped off sometime in the future where mutants are all but gone. Professor X is cursing every other word as is Logan. Now in the previous movies, Wolverine does slash and kill people, but in this movie he goes straight for the face and brain, etc. I believe that for the lack of a plot, they fill in the gaps with swearing and blood. This may appeal to some people but it's not entertainment as far as I'm concerned. <br/><br/>Secondly, a few gaps in Logan's predicament. Where did he get his metal claws back from? In the previous movie (Wolverine) they are cut off and he has to use his bone claws. Also, his healing factor has withstood being ripped apart by Jean Grey, aka Phoenix, and a nuclear explosion and now his adamantium metal is poisoning him? So much for his uncharted healing factor. <br/><br/>All in all, I won't be adding this to my collection."

Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears.

What I got was pretty much what I expected. From a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are doing good jobs as always. The action scenes are good. The cinematography is not at all bad. If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.<br/><br/>For me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made.<br/><br/>Wolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.<br/><br/>The entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go (censored) themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.<br/><br/>The bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X- Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of ""enhanced"" humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.<br/><br/>By the way, why the (censored) do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?<br/><br/>The story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about.<br/><br/>The movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting. I know a lot of people seem to like it but I cannot understand why. At least not if you are a X-Men fan."
"nandidot","9","10","22","4 March 2017"," Brutal, Unrestrained, and Brilliant!
","Holy Hell! My recurring thought while watching Marvel's latest outing- the unrelenting 'Logan.' I gasped, laughed, shook my head, and gritted my teeth constantly throughout the movie that will go down as one of Marvel's best ever. This is the standalone movie Wolverine has always deserved and boy does it deliver.<br/><br/>Imagine a limping, bearded, and farsighted Wolverine as a driver for hire in true Uber fashion. The year is 2029 and mutants are no longer around save Logan aka Wolverine and an old and ailing Charles Xavier whose mind isn't quite what it used to be. They hide out far from society on the American-Mexican border where Logan frequently crosses over for work (I wonder what Trump would say to that. Though a wall wouldn't stop the clawed superhero in either case. I'm sure.) Here, Logan encounters an unusual little girl who he's told needs his help leading them on a bloody and unforgettable journey.<br/><br/>""What the f***?"" are the first words Logan utters in the film rightfully setting the tone for the next 2.15 hours. This is uncensored greatness. It is brutal, unabashedly violent, and generously sprinkled with expletives. It's only Marvel's second R-rated movie after 'Deadpool' and let's just say this isn't the X-Men you remember from your childhood. The movie begins with a clip from Deadpool II but does a complete 180 when the title appears on screen. Unlike Deadpool, Logan isn't trying to make you laugh. It's trying to shock you. In one of the film's finest sequences, I was teetering on the edge of my seat as blood and bones engulfed a rural family home. The shock value and brilliant execution instantly took the movie to new heights. The entire theater audibly gasped.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is and always will be Logan/Wolverine. He started the journey 17 years ago in 'X- Men' and recently announced that he will hang up the claws after 'Logan'. Having played the character in 8 movies (including a special appearance), Mr Jackman is as good as it gets. His performance especially in this film is sharply nuanced. He grumbles when he has to wear glasses to read and when the claws come out you're in for a real treat. He even hides a hint of a smile when an inebriated bride flashes him from his limo's backseat. Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Dafne Keen as the young Laura are perfect in their parts. But it's undoubtedly Mr. Jackman who walks away with all the glory. Being unrestrained in this movie gives him the opportunity to show us Logan's true character and he doesn't hold back. It's a hell of a ride!<br/><br/>James Mangold has written and directed a superhero film unlike any other. You haven't seen anything like it by Marvel. The closest in terms of tone would be DC's 'The Dark Knight' but it's still an uncharacteristically original story. The only downside is it feels a little longer than it should. And it won't appeal to the fainthearted as moments of relief are few are far between. But these aren't real problems. This was a welcome watch and one that any cinema lover will relish. I haven't decided if I liked it more than 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', that might require a re-watch, but it's damn near close.<br/><br/>https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/logan/"

The Wolverine/Logan character which was so lively and likable in previous x men movies is an old grumpy limited super hero in this one which never smiles,hates the world and just waiting to die...All the other characters surrounding him in this movie are not much better - Mean,depressed and full of hate and anger.

","Like Clint Eastwood's William Munny in Unforgiven-a trained killer nursing decades of regret and sorrow, with enough juice for one last mission. <br/><br/>The dirty little secret few critics dare mention is that James Mangold's last film, The Wolverine, was just as good as Logan, if not better. <br/><br/>Mangold proudly wears his influences on his sleeve; a pivotal scene sees Xavier and Laura watching a clip from George Stevens's seminal 1953 film Shane, about another grim gunfighter with a mysterious past. Logan prefers hand-to-hand combat, of course, but aside from that he's quite similar to Alan Ladd's character in that film, a trained killer who fought for the good guys but didn't consider himself one of them.<br/><br/>Mangold is an excellent director with a solid, unheralded resume (including the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line and the Sylvester Stallone neo-noir Cop Land). But Jackman and Stewart are, quite simply, why Logan works-they're why the film doesn't just feel like a cheap exercise in bloody violence, and why its subversion of typical superhero-movie tropes feels organic (unlike with the X-Men spinoff Deadpool). The actors bring warmth and grouchy humor to the story, barking at each other like the married couple they've become, as they go on a road trip north with their young ward in tow.<br/><br/>The story itself is a little all over the place-Logan and company ping-pong from location to location across the country, as the villainous Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), a metal-armed bounty hunter, chases them in search of Laura. A long digression at the house of a friendly family of civilians feels a little forced; the film's bloody climax, involving a sniveling scientist (played to the hilt by Richard E. Grant) and another mysterious enemy, slightly overstays its welcome. No matter-anytime things get too out of hand, Jackman and Stewart are there to tether them back to earth, and at no point does a cosmic portal appear in the sky, or a giant purple supervillain start a monologue about magical gems.<br/><br/>""Logan"" is Jackman's latest, and possibly last, portrayal of Wolverine, the Marvel superhero he has played since 2000. If this is his final run at the role (comic-book characters do have a way of making surprise comebacks, so I'm wary), it's a peculiar milestone worth noting-he's our first superhero actor to officially age out of a role, a testament to the extreme longevity of some of these franchises. Will we get another Logan one day? Quite likely, no matter how foolish a proposition that might be; this is a world with a new Han Solo and a new John McClane, after all. All the more reason to salute Jackman as he rides out into the sunset; that's Logan's chief task, and it succeeds splendidly."
"scoobyvsvader","8","5","9","16 July 2017"," I would give it a B-
","Note: I am not a professional film critic. I just want to give my opinions.<br/><br/>Super controversial: I don't think this film is a masterpiece. Is it good? Yeah. Best super hero movie ever? No. I don't even think it is the best X-Men film (although it is the best in the Wolverine trilogy). Now first off, the acting is amazing. Veterans Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are fantastic, as is newcomer Dafne Keen. But I find my biggest problem with this film is the weird anti-technology stance it has. Now hear me out, I could be reading way to deep into it. But all the bad guys are technologically advanced with robot arms and a bunch of computer monitors and all that, while the good guys live in tree houses and work on farms and all that. The farm family that we meet in the film is trying to be pretty much killed by a big bad corporation and replace it with a giant factory...thing. And this wouldn't be a problem (ok, that isn't true, that thing tends to annoy me) if this wasn't a X-Men movie. X-Men is all about evolution and how it is a good thing. Change doesn't mean evil. So the underlying themes in this movie really go against that. Also, I think the film tends to drag sometimes. But even I can admit that the movie had me incredibly close to crying (my eyes watered, but no tears came out). So clearly it did something right. And I like how the film is basically like, ""Yeah we are sick of superhero movies too"". That is pretty cool. Overall, it is a competent and well made movie (one I wouldn't even mind seeing again), just not a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The ending.<br/><br/>B-"

","Logan is a proper continuation of the X-men Franchise .. The most admirable thing is the Acting ,, Hugh Jackman's performance is OUTSTANDING as well as Dafne Keen ( Laura ) .. The story is good and the music is really nice<br/><br/>Though , The movie needed some more explanations for some vague incidents like the Westchester's , how or why he became so vulnerable and what happened to Dr.Xavier ( disease or just aging ) .. You can make guesses or just bypass that and go on i know but I think it would be better if they mentioned some details of those things <br/><br/>Another thing , I'd have liked to watch the kids fighting more than running at the end of the movie especially as it was stated that they were trained to be killers in special facility where they hadn't left ever ,, I know they're kids but C'mon they do have amazing superpowers , don't they ?! :D<br/><br/>Overall , The movie is entertaining and enjoyable really that you can't feel the time but not reaching the level of my high expectations I made when I heard it's the best part of the series <br/><br/>Very good but not a masterpiece"
"RLTerry1","10","12","28","3 March 2017"," Uncanny!
","Uncanny! 20th Century Fox, Marvel, and TSG Entertainment's Logan is a compelling, grizzly, organic superhero movie that is the last to feature Hugh Jackman as Logan (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Prepare to have your mind blown as the action unfolds in such a way that your heart will be pounding, racing, and pumping adrenaline through your body and then tug at your heartstrings as emotions run high. Logan is quite possibly the most comprehensive and diegetically dynamic superhero movie ever, and perhaps best X-Men film in the long, successful franchise. With a penchant for thrilling, action, and even horror films, director James Mangold pulls out all the stops in the last chapter in the story of The Wolverine. While there have been several films about Logan/Wolvervine outside of the main X-Men films, this cinematic adventure will have you on the edge of your seat with anxiety and holding back tears simultaneously. Some of the responsibilities of the final chapter of a character or an actor portraying a long-standing character are striking a delicate balance between nostalgia, closure, but still providing audiences with a new story; overwhelmingly, this film delivers the absolute best as we bid farewell to Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart from the X-Men universe and exceeds any and all expectations.<br/><br/>What do James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma and Logan have in common? They are both grisly western films. Evidence of this is not only seen in the character development, pacing, and overall tone of the film, but can also be seen within the film itself as Professor X and Laura (Dafne Keen), the young girl traveling with Logan and Xavier, watch a western film on TV–a film that Xavier references several times as he reminisces about films from his childhood. While many think that the American Western film died out with Hollywood Golden age, it has certainly not retreated from cinemas. In fact, many of Quinten Tarrantino's films are westerns, the original Star Wars: A New Hope was a post-modern western, and Mangold's Logan is yet another example of a reimagination of the American Western film. Reading the film as a western enhances the visceral experience of the film. Although directors seldom pit cowboys against indians anymore, there are subtle references to that relational dynamic from early western movies within this film. Much like the Lone Ranger and many of John Wayne's characters, Logan is also a solemn solitary character being pulled into a world built upon the idea of relationships but his baggage makes it incredibly difficult. Emotions run high in Logan; and it's these emotions that provide audiences with a comprehensive experience that fulfills the desire for gritty action plus moments that may stir you to tears.<br/><br/>Although we are just coming out of this year's award season, it's entirely possible that Logan may be the first superhero motion picture to be nominated and even win Best Picture at next year's Oscars. All the elements that make up a Best Picture nominee can be found in Logan. It has drama, romance, a little humor, feels organic, deals with prejudice (by extension), and is based on a book– a comic book that is. The R rating is also important because it (1) serves as further evidence in the direction Fox is going to proceed with films like Deadpool and X-Force–gearing toward an adult audience (2) it allowed for audiences to see the Wolverine at full bloody force, which has been a desire for quite sometime and (3) the degree to which the film can deal with real adult problems physiologically and emotionally. The financial success of Logan will depend on adult audiences speaking the word about the outstanding nature of the film and even bringing more mature younger superhero fans to see the movie. Since most of the film contains disturbing imagery in regards to both the bloody violence and with Professor X's debilitating cognitive disorder (most likely a severe form of dementia), I would not recommend bringing those under 13 to the film until you have screened it for yourself. It's an incredible, film; but, there is content that may not sit well with those that are quite young.<br/><br/>Before Logan begins, fans of Deadpool will be excited to know that there is a short film (glorified promo, really) for Deadpool that does a successful job at promoting the highly anticipated sequel to last year's blockbuster. Its placement is also important to Logan in that it provides some levity before the rather somber tone of the feature film that follows Ryan Reynolds' offensively endearing witty charm as Deadpool. Logan is proof that superhero films can take the more serious route without sacrificing the art of the story. Both Jackman's and Stewart's acting is on point, and probably some of the best of their respective careers. Stewart, more specifically, delivers a command performance as Professor X and demonstrates that an accomplished actor who was primarily first known as Captain Picard can excel in both the horror (Green Room) and superhero genre films, all the while continually adding the touch of class that comes with his formal Shakespearean training as a performing artist.<br/><br/>This is NOT repeat NOT a kids superhero movie. Unless you have screen the film first, I would not recommend bringing anyone under the age of 13 with you to the cinema for Logan. There may not be ""adult"" content in the conventional sense; but, there are themes, subtext, and some violent content that may not be suitable for a younger audience who typically flock to superhero genre movies. Over all, Logan is an outstanding film, not just of the superhero variety, but also in general. From the writing to the directing and technical elements, this movie is a fantastic example of a superhero film that attempts to be and successes at breaking the mold and cementing itself as serious cinema."

","People complain about the plot holes...that's not really the problem.<br/><br/>The problem is that things are thrown at the viewer out of nowhere and threads are left dangling.

Why, why, why, why, why, why? We'd like to know...but that's either a movie for another time or they just didn't think we'd care enough to wonder about her.<br/><br/>Next time, we'd like to know a bit more. It's not too much to ask.<br/><br/>Or better yet, stop for a while. Refresh. Drop the X-Men, you have more to work with, X-Force, X-Factor, New Mutants, Excalibur, to name a few.<br/><br/>Let the X-Men rest and either pick up something you can do fresh without a reboot, or just let the licenses revert, because honestly, it's starting to really hurt to watch and you're starting to tick the fans off.<br/><br/>At this point it feels, especially with ""Apocalypse,"" that they are just making movies to keep the licenses. ""The Last Stand"" was awful, true, but the franchise was brilliantly rebooted with ""First Class."" They took the time to address continuity issues, they took the time to respect the concerns that the fans of the franchise had about the reboots and even tied up some of it in ""Days of Future Past.""<br/><br/>With ""Apocalypse"" they threw away everything they worked so hard to preserve in both the original franchise and the reboot. <br/><br/>""Logan"" does much the same thing, it takes a once respected timeline and throws it all away, leaving just a movie, a stand alone song that doesn't fit in with the rest of the Franchise album.<br/><br/>They aren't trying to protect the franchise any longer, they are just turning out movies with complete disregard over how they fit in with the established story."

"martin-alejandro","3","8","17","8 March 2017"," This is not a Marvel film, this is not a superhero filmthis is a SOAP OPERA!
","When you think of Marvel and X-men, what comes to your mind is entertainment and action. However, in this film its main focus is more about being sentimental. While the action, the acting and the connection of the characters is the best from this film, it is the way that the characters are written which makes it disappointing.<br/><br/>The plot is that Logan/Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) goes on a journey reluctantly to help a mutant girl named Laura (who is Wolverine's daughter), to find her other mutant friends who are chased by a group composed of cyborg enforces called, ""The Reavers"" along with their cyborg leader named, Donald Pierce (played by Robert Holbrook).<br/><br/>Now the plot sounds simple and entertaining but it is the mishandling of the X-men hero characters that ruins the plot along with its message about the elderly people and its questionable conclusion. First of all, Logan/Wolverine is shown to be a drunken X-men character who works as a chauffeur while suffering a disease that is making him weak because of the adamantium that was fused to his bones. We are never told how he ended up in this situation but you just have to accept it. Also, Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) still has his power of telepathy but because he is old, he suffers from seizures and cannot recognize Wolverine unless he takes his medicine although Xavier does state that he is aware of his telepathic power.<br/><br/>Now unlike the comic, ""The Reavers"" have no interest in destroying the X-men mutant but rather a group of mutant children who have superpowers but have escaped (Note: In this film, the mutant children want to cross the border from Mexico to the U.S. for a new opportunity of life). Inadvertently, Wolverine is caught in the middle of the chase. <br/><br/>The first conflict that I had is that during the film, Wolverine, Professor Xavier and Laura are given a shelter by a kind family called, the Munsons. Despite the family's good deed and kindness, the Munsons are slaughtered by X-24 (a clone of Wolverine who works for the antagonists) who is sent to capture Laura. At this point it shows you that being good and kind means death according to the message of this film (Logan). To add insult to injury, Professor Xavier, the world's most powerful telepath is easily killed by X-24 because he is old and old people suck (based on the message that this film, Logan, is giving). <br/><br/>After Wolverine escapes with Laura and they find the mutant children, ""The Reavers"" along with X-24 arrive but they are defeated by the mutant children and Wolverine. During the fight against X-24, Wolverine is brutally impaled onto a tree stump. Luckily Wolverine survives his injury, and knowing that the mutant children have no guidance of what is good and justice while also being aware that the mutant children were only taught to destroy humanity, he decides to take them under his guide were he establishes a private school like Xavier for the mutant childrenyeah that doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Instead after being impaled onto a tree stump, Wolverine dies from his wounds because well, he is old and old people suck (based on the message of this film). The children bury him and continue their journey as the credits roll but there is one problem THIS MUTANT CHILDREN ARE GOING TO END UP JUST LIKE THE REAVERS! With no guidance of what is right and justice, and with only the teachings that they were taught which is to destroy humanity, this mutant kids will actually become a new villainous group on the Marvel world of this film. Special criticism is also given to the fact that there is not the traditional Marvel post-credits scene and Stan Lee does not make a cameo appearance. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this 2017 film, ""Logan,"" gives the feeling that its director James Mangold (who also directed the 2013 film, Wolverine), its writers and its producers, hate life, they hate the Marvel heroes (Wolverine and Professor Xavier) and they have no respect for the elderly people as they see them as useless without taking note that the elderly people have a greater knowledge and that the youth can learn from them. The whole film just mocks Wolverine and Professor Xavier for being too old and it does not take note of their achievements as a hero or the great power and knowledge that they poses. Instead The message of this film is that no matter what accomplishments you've done in the past and no matter if you have done the right thing or if you are a hero, it is pointless because that was in the past. As a result, it means that since you are old, you suck and are no longer needed according to this film's message. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of X-men, Marvel and Wolverine, then this movie is highly not recommendable for you. But if you like Soap opera and you are a fan of Hugh Jackman, then this film is for you."
"namashi_1","9","8","17","3 March 2017"," Brutal & Brilliant!
","The third and final Wolverine film following X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and The Wolverine (2013), 'Logan' is the darkest & also THE most brutal X-Men film to date. Director James Mangold & Lead-Star Hugh Jackman returning for one last time as Logan/Wolverine, deliver a superhero film, that's Super in its truest sense. The one's an emotional, gruesome, gritty & powerful film, that holds your attention, despite excessive violence. Faint-Hearts please stay away, but those who relish Hardcore stuff, Grab A Ticket Now!<br/><br/>'Logan' Synopsis: In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.<br/><br/>'Logan' explores very less of Wolverine's journey, its all about Logan this time. 'Logan' is a character study of a superhero finally off his prime & facing enemies who are stronger than him. Even his life may end, for someone to whom immorality was certain. And that's exactly why 'Logan' works so hugely. The narrative is about Logan's constant fight to survive as well protect his mentor & a young mutant, who's on the run. The villains are ruthless & Logan's fight against them, is clap-worthy.<br/><br/>The Violence is too much though. I'm not complaining here, I mean a superhero with claws so sharp can't be projected with fake juicy blood, but the bloodshed here is rather disturbing. Whenever there is action up on screen, its brutal & unforgiving. The finale, particularly, is no-holds-barred. Don't tell me later I didn't warn you, dear faint-hearts! <br/><br/>The biggest triumph of 'Logan' is its emotional connect. Logan & the young mutant girl, share a wonderful relationship here, as does Profresser Xavier. The connect among them, despite all the brutality around, forms 'Logan' in its entirety. I was engrossed & even concerned about Logan & Co. here, I was connected with them & was rooting for them when they fought the evil-heads.<br/><br/>Scott Frank, James Mangold & Michael Green's Screenplay is intense & engaging. Its all-out brutality, with strong emotional undercurrents. The Writing, though predictable at times, is thoroughly arresting. Mangold's Direction is excellent. He's handled the film with authority. Cinematography & Editing are very good. Action-Sequences/Stunts are spectacular & pushes the 'R Rating' with force. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Graphics are top-class. Background Score & Make-Up, merit a special mention.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/ Wolverine for one last time & he's in terrific form. Right form his broken body-language, to the aggression he expresses when the claws are out & to the softness he emotes when building a connection with the little girl, Jackman brings fabulous layers to his portrayal. This is the best performance Jackman has delivered being Logan/Wolverine. Sir Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, is remarkable. The Screen Legend adds tremendous depth to the part & shines in every scene he appears in. Dafne Keen as Laura, is a surprise packet. She's electrifying! Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, is menacing to the core. And is it ironic that the chief villain here is named Donald?? Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gabriella, does well in a brief role. Others lend good support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Logan' is Brutal & Brilliant! Two Thumbs Up!"
"chrissusanhussey","1","19","50","4 March 2017"," Your Logan Movie is awful and borderline lame
","The movie was extremely slow getting started (how long do we need to see Logan riding around in a limo?), offered up a ton of questions that it never bothered to answer. I mean come on if you are going to kill all or most the mutants at least tease as to how it happened. What is wrong with Xavier? Somehow Logan has lived for 100 years with his altered body but now all the sudden the adamantium is poisoning him to death.Really??? In the end we have no idea where his daughter is going and next to nothing about the kids that she leaves with and who they have been talking to. The two main villains of the movie who may have offered answers are just killed off right after we find out the doctors name and I do not even know if it told the other guys name. <br/><br/>In the end the story is weak and there is no background to it. It seemed like a knee jerk reaction to Marvels idiotic idea to turn Wolverine into a woman in the PC world (because there was not room for the two of them I suppose)and a quick fix to explain that. I wish I had my time and money back! But more than that I wish you had made a better movie!!! I really do."
"dariusdf","4","9","20","7 March 2017"," I like superhero movie, this was not.
","This is Wolverine, he is the most beloved of all the X-men because he is a badass, and they turned him into this pondering, coughing, old weakling, that i need to be sorry for. <br/><br/>And how they killed him, by loosing badly a fight with a villain. Well at least he wasn't killed by an embolism or another old man disease like Professor Xavier almost was, if he wasn't put out of his misery. <br/><br/>Is this year 2029 after the year in which the events that would have happened in X-men:Days of Future Past? Because in that one the technology displayed was way more advanced, and Wolverine did not seem poisoned by the adamantium.<br/><br/>This clearly was not a super hero movie, i like a gritty action movie, this was not. This was a drama about two old dying men, with 5 action scenes(great action scenes, this is how Wolverine should had been portrayed), but still a drama. When i go to see a mma fight i don't want to see a play about the meaningless of a pointless life, or the inevitability of death. <br/><br/>I see a trend in the superhero movies in which a character of a series needs to die for the series to be rebooted. Yes Hugh Jackman was great at playing the role, but you don't need to kill him to replace him as Wolverin."

"ransomclarke-46236","6","9","20","4 March 2017"," Come on folks... It's not a 10/10
","I don't know what everyone's seeing in this movie that makes them think its such a masterpiece. Everyone's giving it 9's and 10's, but I'd give it a 6-7 at best. A 10/10 should only be reserved for a film that is flawless in every way -- whether it be acting, directing, cinematography, story and everything in-between. For it to be perfect, the story has to be gripping throughout the 140 minute run time, and that's where I felt it was weakest. It's serviceable, but it isn't perfect. I have a feeling that the people who are giving this film perfect scores are doing so because its much grittier than any X-Men movie in the past. It's definitely savage with the violence, which was refreshing to me and I appreciated them going all-out with the hard R rating. It starts out freaking great when it's setting up the overall plot, but then it REALLLLY drags along for the 90+ minutes in the middle. During the second act, the story spent so much time focusing on little moments with minimal significance to the overall arc, that I found myself feeling really underwhelmed when the big emotional moments finally happened. Don't expect to be heavily invested in the villains either... they're given very little development on screen, and as soon as any meaningful dialogue starts happening to give the audience some exposition into what's been going on for the last 20+ years in this universe, it comes to an abrupt stop. If you're looking for action, you will be happy with the beginning and the end. Other than that, it's nothing more than a mediocre country western style ""road movie"" about Logan and the girl. I also left with more questions than I had going into it, which I'm assuming will be told through a new series of prequels. Overall, it was a so-so experience that wouldn't be getting such high scores if it weren't for the fact that it's an R-rated X-Men movie."
"Laiath","5","10","23","14 April 2017"," Meh.
","I honestly didn't see what all the fuss is about. It was a depressing, sad little movie. Logan was too heartless and pitiful; what kind of ""superhero"" is that? There were so many ways things could have gone differently that could make the movie more action than drama, but alas! The final standoff was also lame af. My favorite thing about Wolverine from here on out is definitely Wade Wilson poking fun at him."
"victor-sto13","10","10","23","4 March 2017"," A movie about Logan, not Wolverine
","Last time I was this affected after seeing a big-studio movie was when I saw Interstellar. I admit, there is some bias here, Wolverine has been part of my childhood and will always have a special place in my heart. I remember playing outside, holding three sticks between my fingers pretending to be the mutant, 'fighting' my friends who were cyclops, Sabretooth and Magneto. Watching this movie made me feel a strong blend of emotions, there was the cheering kid in me seeing Wolverine protecting the weak and back in action, the teenager enjoying all the violence and blood taken to the next level thanks to the R rating, and the adult in me appreciating the emotions, relationships and character development. <br/><br/>This being said it is worth mentioning this is nothing like any other X-men movies. Logan is so much more mature, honest and raw. This is the conclusion Wolverine deserves. The character never truly fitted the family/mass-market/day-at-the-mall type of superhero movie. I was always bothered with how the previous x-men movies treated the character as, ""Ok, he's a badass, but forget about seeing any cuts after he takes his claws out"". Logan is finally the proper portrayal of Wolverine. It is almost like the R-rating finally gave the directors, producers and screenwriters the freedom to give us a more believable, almost tangible version of Wolverine. After seeing Logan it feels like you had seen all the previous X-men movies through rose-tinted glasses and you had suddenly taken them off. And that's a good thing. We have to thank our buddy Deadpool for setting a precedent and allowing this to happen.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the cast did a superb job. Hugh Jackman really pulled off one of his strongest performances. Disagree with me as much as you like, but I'd say it's Oscar-worthy. You think he did well in The Fountain? You haven't seen nothing yet. Patrick Steward perfectly re-visited his character, but again this time this was a darker, less perfect and more human version. <br/><br/>A few words about the plot: The movie perfectly presents a old, worn and sick Wolverine taking care of his even older and sicker 'father' Charles. Anyone who has ever experienced taking care of someone approaching to his last days can easily relate to the tension here. The first half of the movie very well explored these themes, of son taking care of both his dying dad and troublesome daughter. You can almost feel how tired Logan must be. Not physically, but psychologically. So much responsibility on his shoulders and none of it, something he sought. You get to see the most human and natural reaction to this: anger. Anger that he has so much to deal with. The weight is almost unbearable. Logan considers suicide. Could this be the short-cut to the peace he always sought? But of course, this is wolverine and he would never abandon his duties. So he stands up and fights. It is this character development and portrayal of emotions what really makes the movie feel so much more relatable and realistic than a typical emotionless superhero action movie. <br/><br/>Enough about the drama aspects and a bit about the action: This is not an action movie. If you want to see Wolverine on a speeding train fighting assassins, go watch The Wolverine. This is much more about Logan, the man and his problems, than about Wolverine, the action hero and his stunts. This being said, the movie still has it's fair share of action and it is impressive, even if it includes a much weaker version of Wolverine. That is, until the end, when the mutant gets juiced up and we get to see what he's capable of. This time add the blood and gore and you'll end up with one of the best Wolverine action scenes ever.<br/><br/>The ending:<br/><br/>I appreciate the conclusive ending of the movie. That's it. Hugh knows it, we know it. There is no stupid arm punching through the grave with claws pointing up the sky in the after-scenes. As I said, this is not that kind of movie. <br/><br/>I'll lie if I didn't feel sad. It was finally that a movie got the character right and 2 hours later it was all over. I also really enjoyed the somewhat smaller scale of the character's last battle. This was not a fight amongst falling skyscrapers that would decide the faith of mankind and the universe and the omniverse. No. That's for the Avengers. Perhaps for the X-men and Wolverine, but not for Logan. This was a battle for the lives of a few kids with mutant strenghts. Nothing big, just a few lives at stake, nothing barely comparable to what was at stake in Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>Yet this was his largest battle. By fighting in the battle Logan fought for something that meant to him more than more than the world: His daughter and the one thing he never truly felt until his last breath - family and love. And that's worth dying for.<br/><br/>Beautiful. Shakespearean. A battle for love not for saving the world. A battle that Logan had to fight, not the Wolverine. A battle won. <br/><br/>""So that's what it feels like."""

","Unlike many Marvel fans, I knew Wolverine before Hugh Jackman and didn't get to see the first X-Men in the cinema. I have always had a huge love of the X-Men comic franchise and in all the ups and very deep downs of the films, Hugh Jackman has been a consistent pleasure. Despite knowing the Wolverine character before Jackman, he was my Wolverine and can never be replaced.
This film works as a fond farewell and an entirely standalone, non-cannon story; it is rich in humour, subtlty, meaning and emotion. Few films have left me as affected. We will always want more, we will always want things to be different, but we need to learn to be okay with enough."

"pipecax","8","6","12","6 June 2017"," Concluding & Acerbic Contemplation For Marvel Comics' Fictional Superhero
","Weapon X, one of the most beloved characters that Marvel has brought to cinema screens, has departed, but he has made it in style, with scarlet blood dripping down his defective adamantium claws and leaving a feasible regeneration based on young mutants in the bequest. After insistent and suggestive promises of director James Mangold, which were disclosed while he filmed the notorious movie, ""Logan"" has finally landed in worldwide cinemas and we have had the opportunity to refute or asseverate whether or not the words of the scholar Marvel-fan were right. In general terms, the utopian western that Mangold has raised is the definitive entry point to out-of-the- ordinary facets in the genre, for the true meaning of adapting works with abidance. This installment will cause us to apply Plato's Allegory of the Cave to UCM in all its splendor, dusting off the glorious, intelligent, capable and above all human superhero movies.<br/><br/>Jackman shows us his alter ego drastically unrecognizable: ill, faint and about to collapse. Australian actor gives everything in order to offer a proper last goodbye his professional epithet, he provides it tangible malady and visible fatigue along capacities, his sad gaze captures hopelessness; this man's actions will annoy to ethical heroes world and yes, what Mangold declared has a voracious source: ""It's not a superhero movie, it's a film about humans with powers"". Hugh offers a properly successor, she is Dafne Keen, newcomer actress who plays Laura, an overfilled with anger and vigor girl, with the potential required to carry upon her shoulder weapon X responsibilities. The dialogs for young actress are quasi-non-existent till the third act of the film, supplementing that phonetic absence by formidable physical skills within magnetic and violent action scenes; she's the precise.<br/><br/>Wolverine's last adventure as an irrevocable spaghetti western is unthinkable, a feature-film with a dirty and stylized artistic expression and seemingly devoid of moral characters, rough and badass guys. Here, the action sequences are justified, calculated and incredibly ferocious. Officially, this is the movie adapting Wolvie's pages in form and essence, it doesn't display super bright battles or with light sparks instead of blood, violence has a reason and aftermaths; and although the application is concise, they stir more than Avengers' pompous fights. The signs of summer movie are almost microscopic; the pictures are dry, pessimistic, melancholic and without a doubt, selected components can be compared with ""Midnight Special"" by Jeff Nichols. All this lack of hope is embellished with a sudden parsimonious pace, aggressive when it has to be, but intelligent in emotions posed. Marco Beltrami's music squeezes every means at its disposal, however, paradoxically, calm and sad melodies excel, they capture the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>And emotional field matters. Sentimentality is suitable in each character, sensations are plausible and touch even the most disheartened person. It differs from sporadic determinations, incomprehensible twists, every act is motivated by a thought supported by feelings. As it's becoming a road/buddy movie, interpersonal relationships are improving and wins a brilliantly tremendous connection. Each of these mutant beings has a well-crafted conclusion, both expected and completely unpredictable endings. In fact, there's something sad about the movie: this one feels like by far the best Wolvie's story, making us reflect how other adventures would have been without MPAA restrictions. Must ""Logan"" thank ""Deadpool""? It's all in how you look at it, since even though Wade Wilson's feature film has explicit contents, everything tends to the wit, while nuance is different here, and exactly that's what disquieted 20th Century Fox, the change has an abrupt alteration in pace with respect to the preceding film, however, they can breathe easier now, money continues coming in.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""Logan"" must not be perfect thanks to the long- standing quandary which Marvel hasn't been able to keep down: antagonists. Year after year, movie after movie, despicable villains have to be as fundamental as setting or leading roles, they are a key piece in the puzzle, nonetheless, ""Logan"" re-inserted its reluctant hands in the painful ulcer. Perhaps, the screenwriters and director wanted the star trio was the absolute center of attention, embedding in the bad-guy role to Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), who doesn't appear the time requested on the screen, a few Mexican police officers and one or two human demons. Another point which many people have reviled is its ""extensive"" length, when a film with fascinating components is long? <br/><br/>""Logan"" says goodbye categorically to Bryan Singer's and Mangold's adaptations and takes delighted Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy aura thanks to its realistic and pessimistic way, a desolate horizon where the hero isn't super, is a hero facing human issues. The second R-rated Marvel film cements ambitions in the tone, script and performances, portraying fully both the fictional world of the pages as the mortal world, our world which can transmute in the twinkling of an eye, there's a dry and overwhelming realism to our uncertain evolution. A violent, clever and eloquent motion picture; Jackman's final performance gives an unprecedented Wolverine impression so far and offers an open-minded look at the superhero universe, also serves as confirmation that Marvel can get to be as melodramatic and dark as DC films without losing the skills, without losing the touch. A round of applause for Hugh Jackman, who says ""never again"" to Wolvie's suit, however, economic Hollywood can get it. Thank you for everything and good way. X"

There can't be a better send off to Hugh Jackman character than this. If you watch all the X-Men movies and know the connection between Logan and Charles...man this will break your heart. X-23 is at the same time so cute, so aggressive and she'll totally win your respect.<br/><br/>For me this is the best movie based on X-Men characters. Yes, Deadpool break the 4th wall, but man...the words are not enough to explain how incredible is this movie. It's not the R rating that make this movie masterpiece, it's the script and the history between the characters.<br/><br/>There is nothing in this movie, that I don't like. Probably it's one of the best comicbook movies adapted to real life. The third act is AMAZING and HEARTHBREAKING.

Spectacularly supreme swan song for X-Men anti-hero Wolverine AKA Logan (the erstwhile, world-weary Jackman having a field day in his strongest outing as Wolfie) set in the near future whose attempts to remain off the grid are thwarted when a new mutant (amazing new comer Keen) has been discovered by his old friend Professor Xavier (ditto Stewart) which also crops up old nemesis The Reavers led by hissable Holbrook hot on their trail. Director James Mangold (who co-wrote with Scott Frank & Michael Green) enfuses the franchise spin-off with some new insights and a damn well pay dirt in going very dark and very graphically (and wholeheartedly welcome) unleashed violence.

","I always knew from the trailer it was going to be sad and in my opinion it was time for Marvel to take a new turn with their films about Wolverine. After watching the trailer and hearing ""Hurt"" by Johnny Cash it just hits even more on the way this film is going be. The acting is pretty much on the verge of perfect. Hugh Jackman pretty much plays a Wolverine that has almost given up on everything but when he needs to be the old Wolverine we get hit with a bit of nostalgia as he can be incredible brutal at times but when fighting you can tell he doesn't have much of the original Wolverine in him anymore and they show that incredibly well. Patrick Stewart plays a Charles Xavier that has a new ""power"" being the shape of seizures that affect everything around him and so relies of Logan even more to control them. Laura plays her role as a bad tempered teenager who for the most of the film just sits there and scowls, and will not hesitate to throw down over the smallest of things and the way she represents the character is on par with the way Hugh Jackman played the original Wolverine.<br/><br/>Overall I am surprised that this film is not featured higher on the IMDB top 250 Rated Films. In my opinion this deserves to be at least in the top 50 area."

What disrespect to the creator and father of the X-Men.<br/><br/>I hope that this movie is classed as not canon as both main characters deserve a far better 'goodbye'. <br/><br/>Would have made a great Mad Max movie but it's definitely not a Marvel movie."
"Vartiainen","Null","4","7","25 June 2017"," The beginning of the end times
","Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart return to their roles as Wolverine and Professor X, respectively, in this film that is almost certainly Jackman's last run as Wolverine and might just be Stewart's last as Professor X as well. And as far as swan songs go, they could not have asked for a better film.<br/><br/>It's 2029 and mutants have become an endangered species. No new mutants have been born in years and only a few of the old guard are left. One of the few ""lucky"" survivors is Logan, who is radically removed from his glory days, being reduced to a suffering husk of his former self. And he has gotten off lightly compared to Charles Xavier, trust me. But then a new mutant enters their lives. A young girl with a power set almost identical to that of Wolverine's.<br/><br/>James Mangold is once again directing and he continues to show that he really gets the character. The Wolverine focused on Logan's past and the human behind the adamantium skeleton and the nigh immortality. Logan focuses on the mortality of the character. On the fact that all beings, even one such as Wolverine, must grow old. Must one day, no matter how far into the future, die.<br/><br/>In that light I'm almost hesitant to call this movie a superhero film. Because it's such a reconstruction of the genre that it's almost a new thing in and on itself. It borrows heavily from westerns and the rougher side of Americana, while also being a bittersweet love letter to all the previous X-Men films and to all superhero films in general. While also being a brilliant film in its own right.<br/><br/>Here's to you Hugh Jackman. Here's to you Patrick Stewart. And here's to you James Mangold. This will not be the last superhero film. But it almost should be."
"Leofwine_draca","7","7","15","26 July 2017"," Certainly the best X-Men film out there
","LOGAN is a fitting follow-up to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine series, directed by the returning James Mangold with a difference: this isn't your usual 12-rated superhero film but rather a gritty, adult movie full of profanity and bloodshed. Finally we get to see what Jackman's claws can properly do, and the film's regular violent action sequences are pure spectacle. The story is set decades in the future and sees an old-man Wolverine going on a road trip with a senile Charles Xavier and a mysterious young girl in tow.<br/><br/>It's a dark story indeed, one that climaxes in a fitting way, and it's entirely refreshing to have adult content for a change. The film's biggest problem is that it goes on about half an hour too long and slows down in between the action, but it's not enough to spoil a fine viewing experience. The action is lavish and large scale, and the good cast features stand-out turns from Stephen Merchant and Richard E. Grant. The FX are up to the job, as is Jackman, who delivers a complex performance of great depth, one of the best of his entire career."

","Because it is part of long-running franchise, however, it comes across as painfully incongruous with previous X-Men movies. At the outset of the movie, we see that Logan has descended once again into misery, so all of the gains made in ""The Wolverine"" are lost. Once again also, mutants are on the edge of extinction, so all gains made in ""Days Of Future Past"" are lost (and less than 10 years later, to add to the bewilderment). Basically, it looks like some writer liked the idea of rebooting the mutant doomsday concept of DOFP and taking it in a bleaker direction.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but while excellent acting is something I like in a movie, a good story is at least as important, and to make a good story, you can't render previous entries in the franchise completely pointless. The fact that this happens in the final Wolverine outing, with no opportunity to recover is, of course, all the more heartbreaking. I was surprised when DOFP managed a decent recovery from the mistakes made by X-Men:Last Stand, but not as surprised as I was to see those same mistakes repeated here!"
"Babi_Epetz","3","7","15","25 May 2017"," Depressing Disappointing Movie
","This is the most depressing disappointing super hero movie in my life. I am wondering why this movie have high rating. What a waste of time to watch this movie. I never wrote review before this. After watching this movie, yeah i think i have to write one.<br/><br/>First of all, this is super hero movie, Logan refers to wolverine from X-men. Not some sad drama movie such as The Notebook. He is superhero, he is wild animal. And yet now he is not too super, not too heroic, not too wild. Only his temper remaining.<br/><br/>Second, i watched it couple of minutes, i thought yeah OK maybe the plot is twisted or they wanted to make new level of story. But the longer you watch, the longer you ll feel depressed. Until half the movie, i started to skip minutes by minutes. Because its boring. Not to mention depressing. Why would you make depressing plot with death ending in superhero movie?<br/><br/>Third, as you can see the hero is dying, but from the beginning you already can see that his soul has already died. No more amazing wild beast. You only can see desperate dying hotheaded selfish stubborn animal there. The fights are bad too, lack of movement, technique, and anger. <br/><br/>Fourth, the children was the only good thing that ever came up, especially Laura. But the relation between Laura and the children with Logan is very depressing too. No compassion between father and child. No good fighting collaboration too. Actually Laura would be better if she is older teenager. Sadistic preteen is not cool. <br/><br/>Fifth, This is pathetic ending for wolverine. Why did they do that to professor too? Gave him depressed pathetic sadden story and ending like that? Should i mention again that this is superhero movie? I think they should have changed the title from ""Logan"" into ""Dead of X-Men"" or ""Dead of Heroes"" or ""End of Logan"" or maybe ""Logout"". Actually they should make sad drama movie or thriller horror movie. I assume this movie was made by depressed peoples.<br/><br/>Sixth, the performance of the actors and actresses are fine. But the story is a failure, the plot is a failure, the fighting technique and performance also failed. I don't even have to discuss the detail to show the failure. Because its so bold, from the big scope u already can see that this movie is so lame.<br/><br/>And last, my advice, don't waste your time to watch this movie. This movie is overrated. The good thing is that this movie is the end of story. I had watched a lot of sad depressing movies. But this is just not right."
"destroyerwod","5","7","15","23 May 2017"," Logan does not exist for me...
","What do i mean by this? Well i refuse that the ""Xmen Saga"" end up on such a depressing note. Wolverine has always been the best part of the Xmen movies, and yet every attempt they made to make a solo movie felt flat. As much as it hurt me to say it, i feel Origins is probably the best of the 3, even with the insult to Deadpool... At least it was dumb fun... But The Wolverine was over complex for nothing and just bored me, and this one although not boring me per say felt so depressing and dull in atmosphere with such a bad story that i want to whip it out of my memory.<br/><br/>I am giving it a 5 because the movie does have quality. The acting is very good from everybody, the landscape and cinematography is great, the brutal action sequences are extremely good, finally seeing Wolverine brutally decapitate and slash peoples is very nice.<br/><br/>Yet the story is just so bad... Basically they tell you almost every mutants died because they poisoned the food... and Charles pretty much killed all the Xmen in one of his seizure moments. So it mean everything they accomplished during the years was almost for nothing... As much as i didn't liked that much Days of Futur past and tough it really changed too much, at least the end make it feel right by the franchise and give overall a happy ending, even retconing the deaths that happened in Last Stand.<br/><br/>I could go on and make a rant about how the story was changed so much during the years that it created tons of plot holes, especially with Charles in Last Stand and his return later on, but i prefer to focus on Logan and don't go too much all over the place. I just feel that there way of whipping out the Mutants was very weak, and the reasons for Wolverine to loose regeneration once again(was it not the theme of ""The Wolverine""?) just didn't do it for me. Even without regeneration, is he not supposed to still have the Adamantium Skeleton? So why does a Tree manage to impale him? And the whole Adamantium bullet, from Origins to this change too much.<br/><br/>The clone villain really felt uninspired and flat and although Donald the henchman guy was presented as an important character and having ""enchancements"" in the end he and his men only served as claw fodder and did nothing much.<br/><br/>I am gonna stop there as i feel i could rant all day."

But given the huge promotion for this movie as well as the misleading rating and comments here on IMDb, I feel kind of urged to leave this comment in order to warn all the people out there not having seen this mess of a movie yet... <br/><br/>Not being a big fan of the whole new Superhero Genre / Franchises, this movie even manages - among with the first ""Wolverine"" movie, which was quite much terrible - to be the worst in the whole ""X-Men Universe"" for me.<br/><br/>What makes it so bad? <br/><br/><ul><li>The Movie does NOT really have a STORY - or at least not something worth to be called alike. For sure a plot is there. But what exactly is the story? It's about a child that has been given birth to using mutant DNA in order to make them strong soldiers - as they do have emotions and don't obey, they shall be executed and replaced. One girl (DNA- infiltrated with Wolverine genes) flees (helped by a doctor) and goes on fleeing together with Wolverine and Professor Charles Xavier. So in fact this is simply a PURSUIT MOVIE. No side-plots, nothing more to think about - nothing else of interest involved... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Out of this tiny story, something huge emerges: BOREDOM. Never has there been such a boring Super Hero movie. Basically nothing happens for more or less 2 hours: Family Talking (which it is not: they are not a family in fact...) seems to be the only driving force for a long time... </li></ul><br/><br/>why it doesn't work:<br/><br/><ul><li>For those calling it the first adult Super Hero movie that is not only about action: GIMME A BREAK. if you know a little about Independent Filmmaking and about stories with depth, ""Logan"" is a joke. It is totally SUPERFICIAL, the dialogues are not real to life, the emotions are fake Hollywood - it stays what it is: A COMIC MOVIE... So given the ambition to be a deep movie - something meaningful - it is a total FAILURE. It is simply NOT. Period. Go watch e.g. ""Perfect World (1993) instead... It's not that I'm a Blockbuster fan only looking for spectacle and action in a movie. But a movie should STAY TRUE TO ITSELF: If it wants to be meaningful and clever, a lot more would be needed than this. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>On the other hand, on a Super Hero and Action Scale, the movie is an absolute FAILURE as well, as for most of the movie duration there is not a lot happening on screen. There are 2 well-crafted action scenes, however: </li></ul><br/><br/>1. When Professor Xavier manages to stop time with his mind while Wolverine manages with his last force to kill all the bad guys who want to steal the young mutant (on the other hand, this scene is basically a rip-off of ""X-Men Apocalypse"" and the scene involving super-fast Quick- silver; thus: nothing new indeed. we have seen it all before...) <br/><br/>2. The scene near the end when they hunt each other through the forest with Wolverine jumping on the enemies running in front of him is quite amazing. <br/><br/>All the rest is rather cheap and / or unfunny; a cheap car-chase rip- off of ""Mad Max IV"" involved before they can escape behind the rolling train... <br/><br/>+ SPOILER: ... this extremely unsatisfying event, when Professor Xavier (the supposed to be wise guy) accepts the invitation (or rather forces Wolverine to accept) by this nice family who had problems with their truck... How stupid is this??? Obviously they are all killed in the end - but don't worry - no bad conscience involved...^^ Heck, they are on the run...! Xavier should be the rational, old, wise man, shouldn't he?! How bad writing is that? Too bad to be true... This movie is utterly ridiculous... :D<br/><br/>Are the 2 mentioned well-crafted action sequences worth your money for the entry fee? Certainly NOT! 7 minutes of enjoyment for 2h 10 of boredom? That's a bad exchange... Thus my advice: Safe your money, stay at home...^^ ...or watch something really worth your money! :)"

","I must say I was very disappointed in this film. I had read good reviews and was surprised by how poor it was. The basic plot was that Logan saves a load of kids that had been experimented on to create mutants,strangely the same plot as the earlier X-men film.Quite how a bunch of unaccompanied kids brought up in isolation managed to cross the whole of America to meet upon at a particular place and time was glossed over. Quite how armed convoys can swan about Mexico and the United states shooting things up with no comment from law forces or the security services is odd. Given that the plot is that the mutant creation program is is being shut down and the bad guys even say they want the mutants alive and dead they then spend the the film trying to capture them rather than just killing them.And why not bring high tech weaponry or even some adamantine bullets? Quite how the entire worlds security services haven't tracked down Wolverine or Professor X when he crosses the border daily is glossed over. A bit like Logan and Xavier going out to sea in a boat,how would Logan get the pills he needed for the professor then? What happened to all the mutants in just 20 years no explanation there either? It all seemed a lot of padding for a few very good scenes of overly violent action and a tired old rehash of a plot simply to kill off Professor X and Wolverine. Marvel want to watch out as DC seem to be catching them up.<br/><br/>Twenty preteen mutants wandering round a forest in Canada as an ending,also a cop out.<br/><br/>Also the very annoying dead pool clip at the start why bother?<br/><br/>Lets hope we get a better director and plot next time.<br/><br/>Hopefully Guardians of the Galaxy will make up for this poor effort."

The movie though? Worst of all the X-Men movies (even worse than the 3rd one from the original trilogy which is saying something). The violence was so over-the-top it was actually distracting. Some aspects were left completely unexplained (like the writers simply expected the viewers to 'know' - i.e. what was wrong with Xavier's mind, who the Reavers are and 'why' they have 1 metal hand, why there are no mutants left). The kid was fine when she wasn't speaking but then she wouldn't shut up so she became very irritating. Her 'attachment' to Logan really made no sense at all since she had just met him (and now she's crying over his body saying 'daddy'? Really?).

Some of the things in Logan may seem like nitpicking (how does one drive a bullet-ridden limo through Texas into Oklahoma, for example, without anyone noticing until the minute it's pulled up to the hotel to be uh parked), some things may be sort of griping about the logistics of things (i.e. the comic book of X-Men is a plot element in this movie, like the X-Men comics exist, which would be a clever meta moment if it wasn't in the midst of the one of the darkest comic book movies ever made), and there are other beats that just have to do with how quickly (or, really, not) the villains don't catch up with our trio of main characters, Logan, Xavier and Julia, even when they literally have the coordinates to get to them. Not to mention some things in the last third of the movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense, a little more standard as a comic book movie, certainly as it's the 10th film in 17 years with an X-Men character from Fox.<br/><br/>All of this noted... this movie is really good. The reason for that is James Mangold, the director, taking a second (ahem, sorry, I can't resist) stab at this character and as it's the end he takes almost a rough R-rated Clint Eastwood 70's Peckinpah spaghetti-ish western approach to it all. And this is an BIG R rating, so parents take note, if you don't care about your kids hearing ""F"" and ""S"" words (and there's a lot of them, it's not like this got the rating for going over the 1 or 2 time minimum of PG-13 movies), then you might care about the various dismemberments, beheadings, stabs through the head, repeated stabbings *from children* onto nameless bad guys. Or maybe that won't be an issue either; in that case this is a dark tragic western for the whole family about a mutant who is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning driving his 90 year old dementia-ish father figure with a little girl so they can find a possible Eden. If one feels a Children of Men vibe too I wouldn't say that was unintentional.<br/><br/>But alongside Mangold's commitment to going for something we haven't seen before, what matters most in these movies to me more than the plot or stories more-often - the interactions of the characters, the emotional weight, how characters do (or don't) grow since, you know, once an a-hole always an a-hole - that works spectacularly. This is maybe the most deeply felt of the X-Men films, or at least as close as Days of Future Past was, as far as showing us how these characters are in great pain and danger and grappling with things, but we also get to see more dimension than before. With Xavier, for example, a lot of time in past movies (certainly the first three) while played by an actor with gravitas like Stewart, he was an exposition machine. Here, Xavier gets to show anger, resentment, sadness, pain, misery, confusion (genuinely, remember he's 90 here), and even a moment where he gets to help a farmer coral his horses (it's a minor but important one). And damn if Stewart doesn't deliver the goods; I can praise Jackman high as he does deserve it, and the young newcomer playing the mutant Julia is incredible (mostly in how she listens and her subtle moments in silences), this is Oscar-worthy s*** from Stewart.<br/><br/>So I think if you have really enjoyed most over the years how the actors and characters have interacted the most, regardless (or regardful) of how it strays from the comics (a touch that gets commented on here, for better or worse), Logan gives that score with moving fashion. If you are interested in a coherent story, that's here too... up to a point. It's a good send off for these characters."
"Eshan_2110","8","8","18","13 April 2017"," A beautiful send off to the character
","Ever since the first trailer with Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' in the background was released, Logan looked special. From the locale, cinematography, and Hugh Jackman's performance, Logan is a radical departure from what we have seen in previous X-Men films. <br/><br/>Part of what I enjoyed about Logan was its smaller scope and more personable nature in relation to its narrative and characters. This is not a film about the action or the 'end of the world' narrative that we are so used to seeing in the genre. When we are first introduced to Logan, he is an alcoholic and devoid of any hope. His healing factor isn't working as well as it once was and the scars from his battles do not fade away like they once used to. Whilst working as a chauffeur during the night, he looks after a now helpless, Professor X in his desolate home. Xavier battles with Alzheimer's disease but also his own powers, which have unwillingly turned him into the most powerful weapon to exist. There is a rather interesting backstory regarding Xavier in the film. The characters are a far cry from previous portrayals. For instance, they are more vulgar as the film is Rated R. It was slightly odd to hear Xavier swear, but the swearing is not for the sake of giving the film its rating, but moreover to relate to its darker, gloomy tone. The introduction of Laura, played by newcomer Dafne Keen, becomes a catalyst in the narrative going forward. From the trailers, it was made clear that she is in fact X-23, a mutant who shares the same genes as Wolverine. Their relationship is beautifully conceived and leads to some great character development. Laura is brutal and feral, yet at the same time rather cute. That's quite a lethal combination! As a character, Laura is hard not to like, through her childish innocence, but also her dark history, which is one aspect of the film that helps give reason to the Rated-R. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the film I really enjoyed was its cinematography. Being set in New Mexico gave the film a warm, orange tint in the desert scenes that helped the film to look gorgeous. Aesthetically it helps to make Logan feel like an indie film. The camera work was thoughtful, particularly during the slower scenes, less so in the action. To elaborate, the camera work and slow paced nature of the film allowed me to connect with the characters. The action scenes worked in the sense that they really demonstrated the strength and brutality of the characters. Director James Mangold doesn't hold back and I loved it.<br/><br/>Marco Beltrami's score is not overly emphatic but it helps connote the right emotion given the scenes. It too is a departure from the often dramatic scores of many superhero films and is instead more humble and soft. <br/><br/>Part of why this film works is because we have seen Wolverine and Xavier's evolution as characters over the past 17 years and as such have an attachment to them. Their acts in this film will shock and surprise you. Hugh Jackman's self-professed final performance as the character is his best yet. He takes the character in directions we have yet to see him, as a father figure for example. Logan is truly a beautiful send off to a character who become a pivotal part of the franchise and its previous success."
"youvebeenphammed","10","8","18","12 March 2017"," Some people who were responsible for an 8.2 do need to re-watch
","I learn that you can't win everyone's hearts and everyone is entitled to their opinion. What I don't get is that some people may have missed the points of what makes the film special. <br/><br/><ul><li>Where have the mutants gone? There were hints throughout the film with the mentions of Canewood which is a corn farming company which Rice used to ""control"" mutant-kind. With his little exposition, he explained pretty much how he did it from breakfast cereals to drinks. We don't need to ""see"" because the film is already heavy itself with Logan and Charles degrading of what they were once represented. The ""Where all of the mutants?"" question isn't really important for Logan's story to be told.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He died a noble death by saving these kids. People ask why didn't they help Logan. The kids were scared of X-24 and the Reavers. Just because they have powers, doesn't mean they'll be saved, even from lack of experience. As kids, they can be easily overwhelmed. Logan managed to save them to let them continue as kids, not weapons. Logan died an X-Man. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>To the people who asked about his healing factor, you do realize that the older he gets, the weaker his healing factor gets. The director did say he took that inspiration from the 'Old Man Logan' story-line. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>To the people who wondered what is the point of having X-24. The point is to show Logan's worst enemy thematically, himself. The animal he wishes to hold inside him. Charles knows that Logan's heroic days are over but it shouldn't stop him being a decent person. Hence why he was killed by the animal (X-24), not the man (Logan). Besides, in the comics, did you know that Donald Pierce did create a clone of Wolverine? His name was Albert. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Yes, the film was too long and a little tiring. Well, think of it this way. Logan is tired as well. Hugh Jackman played him for 17 years, strict gym diet and was stuck with this character for a long time. He's playing as an old Logan who has been through a lot with the X-Men and Charles. His acting makes it realistic. Speaking of that, maybe the director wants us to feel that way. He wants us to try to relate to him as humanly as possible. He's fighting, we want to fight. He's angry, we feel angry with him. He feels tired, we feel tired. As the audience, we are drawn to it like this. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Since people were asking how could he die by a branch that's stuck through him. Even though his skeleton is made of Adamantium, the older he gets, his healing is weak. Caliban already explained that Logan may have Adamantium poisoning. Also, his skeleton is still basically the same as us. There is not much bone near the abdomen. He got stabbed in the back of the stomach. In the movies, both of those factors can kill him. He died a noble death anyway. If Hugh Jackman's really leaving, then this is the best way to go. Have an idea of a better ending, lay it out on me. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The villain problem. All of the focus is on Logan since he is his own worst enemy. Not Zander, not Donald, X-24 is a way to show it thematically. What Pierce did successfully is to make Logan come out of his shell since he was reluctant to protect Laura. Rice made a clone that killed Charles, the Munson family, and Logan to make him face his worst nightmare, himself. They were more of the reason why Logan and Laura kept running. Even if the director decides to give them a backstory, not only it'll drain the quality of the film, it'll lose it's the focus of the story. There is a reason why not many people like Avengers: Age of Ultron. Look at the title and you simply know why. The name of the villain shows that he is important to the story so he must steal the show. It increases how valuable he is as a character. As a result, the criticism is that Ultron is underwhelming. Same with X- Men: Apocalypse. The point is, Logan is the main focus, and you shouldn't worry of the villains being underwhelming. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Speaking of the story, people say it's too simplistic. Well, simple stories with complex characters are what they get us engaging. We immediately know what the story is. What more do you expect from the film? Apocalypse wiping out the world? Sentinels shooting down Logan? This is more of a grounded and personal story it humanizes the situation. For example, Deadpool has a simple story of revenge against Ajax and has to save his girlfriend Vanessa who he hasn't seen for years. The story was simple, but his meta-humor makes up for it and it got positive reviews from critics and fans alike. In Logan, it had emotional depth and the theme of family is shown throughout the events. This is seen throughout the father/son relationship with Logan/Charles and the father/daughter relationship with Logan/Laura. We understand the characters and what they have been through. In this film, the character is what drives the story, not the plot itself. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Timeline. With this film, you don't have to watch the previous films to see the relationship between Logan and Charles. Trust me, it will bother you more. As long the film is engaging, you shouldn't have to worry. Honestly, if Fox doesn't care about the time line, then we shouldn't. The best films coming from Fox happens to be stand-alone. </li></ul><br/><br/>What I've learned from this page is that you can't win everyone's hearts. But you can try to consider this opinion as helpful and hopefully you can understand the film better and realize the decisions they made."
"liahneb","4","8","18","10 March 2017"," Feminist-charged old man hero story
","I will say - for starters - that you won't be able to watch another movie featuring Wolverine in it the same. There is simply so much carnage throughout (as well as f-bombs) that it just makes sense for who Wolverine is as a character. Unfortunately, he's dying of old age because of adamantium poisoning (this reminds me of the midi-chlorian revelation in Star Wars Episode I). Sadly - and worst of all - we only get to see Wolverine in his prime for about 5 minutes, and this is only because he takes something that makes him operate at peak level until it wears off. You won't even believe the ending.... ***SPOILER ALERT*** The ending is about as anti-climactic as you can get in this situation. I think it would've been more epic if he walked off into the sunset. He dies saving the girl from the previews (X-23) and some other children. But the way the main baddie is killed doesn't make sense with previous Wolverine movies (which this movie tries to tie together). ***SPOILER ALERT #DOS*** (The main baddie has his head blown off with an adamantium bullet shot from a snub-nosed pistol. I won't tell you why that doesn't make sense, but you'll figure it out.)<br/><br/>Having a movie featuring X-23 is not feminist (notice how I use the word ""featuring""). The problem is that she's featured as basically half of the main story. This movie serves as an origin movie of sorts for her as well as an ending for Wolverine as we know him. I don't think X-23's story is completely distracting, but I do feel that it partially takes away from the going-away party for Logan. They turned her into some sort of savage beast with perfect fighting prowess. She gets hurt maybe once in the whole movie. When she's being shot at no one can hit her (professional mercenaries with robotic arms for even more accuracy), and the other times Logan is saving her. She's tearing into the main baddie at the end of the movie in a ridiculous fashion without a scratch on her (while Logan fights the same baddie and ends up completely mutilated). She's basically impervious to damage and is literally perfect at fighting (she can't be stopped -- even more-so than Wolverine ever was). It's funny how this movie attempts to be realistic with Wolverine and yet neuters itself in the way it treats X-23. They even go so far as to have a scene where Xavier explains that it's ""obvious"" she would have a claw in her foot because female lions do all the hunting and are the reason the pack survives and they use their back claws as well as their front claws and yada yada... It's all pretty strange and confusing. And of course Xavier says that she can learn to be better than Wolverine. FEMINIST MESSAGING blehhhh.<br/><br/>Logan's last purpose on earth is to save X-23 and help a diverse group of mutant kids cross the border into Canada (the only place they can find freedom is in Canada apparently -- they look for a place called ""Eden,"" but we never know in the end whether or not it exists). Also, on that note, there's an odd scene where individuals are driving from Mexico into the US holding an American flag in a pickup truck shouting ""USA!"" to immigrants from Mexico -- like they're rubbing it in their faces (very odd to say the least). I wonder if Hollywood injected their view on immigration at all.... Also of note is that all the bad guys are white. I'm noticing this trend in Hollywood (this reminds me a lot of The Force Awakens) where all the bad guys are white males while the good guys are females and minorities -- no young, white males are featured as heroes. I find this trend disturbing because Hollywood makes white males appear to be the enemy while offering no white, male heroes. They also use stereotypically racist scene in this movie: White farmers gang up on a black farmer for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Much of the plot is very ho-hum and boring. There is a cool twist in the middle of the film that I won't ruin because I think it's the only thing that makes this movie interesting. Other than that twist, this movie would be very boring. Basically all of Wolverine's redemption and last stand is him grudgingly going along with protecting X-23 and, eventually, her friends (and him dying in the process). He's buried with a strange speech by X-23 that's half about Logan and really more about her (it literally sounds like she's reading the script describing her character). She takes the cross out of the ground, turns the cross on its side to make an ""X,"" and then walks away while sadly looking back at Logan's grave. <br/><br/>The idea of adamantium poisoning Logan could make sense -- but only in a separate reality from all other X-Men movies. His healing powers haven't withered -- he just suddenly can't fend off the poison from his own skeleton. He ages very rapidly from his physical prime to being near-death in about 16 years. It simply doesn't make sense. Showing Wolverine with all blood and gore turned ""on"" is awesome. X-23's amazing fighting ability doesn't make sense (even though it's cool at times). Her being trained as an assassin is never explained in the movie, and there's no way a child would be that good so quickly! This movie is really about X-23. It's a father-daughter movie. It all feels like a ""been there, done that"" type of a thing, and I think they ruined this movie with their messaging. The feminist nods, the racial nods, the immigration nods, and the fact that this movie is really about X-23 all distract from the story being about Logan and serving it's main purpose -- having an epic send-off for Wolverine."
"Burnoutsss","9","8","18","4 March 2017"," One Last Ride for 2 Amazing Actors in Iconic Roles
","After 17 Years debuting in the X-men Franchise, Hugh Jackman exits the role as Wolverine, a troubled loner with a heart of gold and claws of Adamantium. <br/><br/>In the future of 2029, Mutants have almost become extinct. Logan, living with a dementia ridden Professor Xavier and a mutant recluse named Caliban, turns his back on mutant kind, instead attempting to make a living as a limousine driver to retire to the ocean. However, Logan's fate is changed when she meets a young girl with mutant powers very similar to his own.<br/><br/>The Live Action X-Men franchise has often been accused of being disrespectful to the source material (or rather the more fantastical elements of said source material such as the Dinosaurs in present day of the Savage Land or the space opera adventures of the Starjammers), in an age where Marvel Studios explores space with Guardians of the Galaxy or the microscopic world with Ant-Man. <br/><br/>In Logan, that grounded reality works to the benefit of movie. Instead of visual spectacle and technicolor explosions, the action grim, grounded and folded to reality. Unlike other attempts to 'mature' the genre through simple additions of profanity and violence, Logan uses its R rating to tell a more character driven story, showing broken old men at the end of their ropes. After years of a PG-13 rating, the R rating doesn't simply add blood and gore, but a sense of melancholy and bleakness other films of the same genre do not have. <br/><br/>Logan has been described as the mainstream Superhero Western, a fair comparison since Superheroes have often been compared to the Western Boom of the 50's while scenes of 1953's Shane plays during a scene. <br/><br/>The actors are fully giving it their all in this picture. Hugh Jackman has always had incredible range as an actor, but his turn as Wolverine is the thing that made him a star. It's only with an actor of his caliber and the age of playing the role for so long that you can get a performance of this magnitude with the emotional weight it deserves. Just the same, the usually reserved Patrick Stewart completely subverts his role as the kindly understanding Professor Xavier to a rambling, cynical cranky old man with a form of Alzheimer's. But, Dafne Keen will ultimately come out as the highlight of the film. It's hard to get children actors to put out a role of this magnitude but Keen's Laura manages to be both convincing as a child who's exploring the world for the first time and a violent killer in other scenes.<br/><br/>The action set pieces are astounding. The fight choreography is stable, the edits manage to feel coherent and the amount of chopped limbs, be-headings and spilled blood makes for a gory good time.<br/><br/>It's unclear where the X-men Franchise can go from here. After the critical disappointment of X-Men: Apocalypse but the financial success of Deadpool, fans have been counting the days when 20th Century Fox will sell the film rights back to Marvel Studios so the Mutants can become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But, for the payoff we received at the end, Logan is worth the 17 years worth of X-Men films (Some Good, Some Bad, Most Mediocre) to see two actors have one last ride in what was some of the iconic roles in Superhero film history.<br/><br/>See it!"
"claus-51","3","9","21","4 March 2017"," Has a lot of good and a lot of bad. Mostly bad, though
","Let me start by saying that I'm keeping myself totally out of the Marvel vs. DC debate. I own every Marvel AND every DC movie ever made (yes, even the old Captain America movies!) and I watch them no matter if they're good or bad. I love superhero movies. And that might be just the thing with this movie - because it doesn't FEEl like a superhero movie. It feels like Mad Max, a huge chase interrupted for a few moments, and then the chase continues, lots of fighting and explosions and gratuitous violence (more than ever before in a Wolverine movie!) but very little character, very little plot and a super-depressing story line that ends up in tragedy. I don't understand the appeal of the new wave of films where heroes have to be portrayed as old and dying people. ""Mr Holmes"", ""Star Wars VII"", ""Logan"" and there's talk of a new Indiana Jones...why not let the heroes remain the heroes they are? They don't get better from being shown as old, bumbling men dying of cancer or Alzheimer's! ""Logan"" is all the things that some people have wanted from Marvel movies for a while now. Dark, gritty, violent, brutal. But at the same time, it's lost the fun. It's lost the thrill of the superhero. It's lost the heart. I have nothing bad to say about the main . Jackman does a good job playing Logan, and Patrick Stewart finally gets to say ""f*ck"" as Professor X. The guy playing the villain is so one dimensional, however, that you will lose sight of him when he turns his side. Donald Pierce in the comic was an industrialist and a member of the Hellfire Club. Here, he's a good with a mechanical hand. What a waste. The fight scenes look good. It's nice to see Jackman go full-out berserker rage Wolverine, and X-23 (even though she's a very bad actress) is good at the fighting stuff. All in all, this is quite literally the first time in years, I've walked out of a superhero movie with this conflicted emotions in my head. It's not horrible like Fan4Stic. It's not fun and wild like Doctor Strange. It's not a good story like Civil War. It's just...kind of a dark letdown.<br/><br/>But I'll probably still get the Bluray. It will just end up next to Fan4Stic and Electra and Catwoman amongst the ones I just own because I want a complete collection."

This is a film about a nihilistic lead character and the ugly violent events, that seem to envelop his life like a dark, perpetual gloom. <br/><br/>Indeed, what most defines this film is endless, bloody violence. So much so that the simple story of redemption that's supposed to lift the viewer up is obscured and for the most part, silenced. <br/><br/>What you are left with, is a rather depressing film, that, sucked dry of any real sense of hope, staggers towards its inevitable demise.

One very annoying technical aspect was the cheap lens they used that created really noticeable parallax distortion every time the operator pulled focus. Made me feel ill.

"Raptor-the-amazing","9","5","10","7 September 2017"," Dark, Bleak Action-Packed and emotional, Logan has it all.
","When it was announced that Fox would be making another solo 'Wolverine' movie, I was excited. Then rumours began piling up that it would be based off the popular 'Old Man Logan', the comic community, (myself included) got even more excited. Then the first trailer dropped, and somehow we got even more excited. However, it was now I realized the movie was doomed to disappoint us. We had so much hype built up (by us, not Fox surprisingly) that there was no possible way Logan could ever reach the bar we had set. <br/><br/>Well, it didn't reach the bar. <br/><br/>It ran by the bar, grabbed it, and pulled the bar (and us) to levels we didn't think it could reach. All while being one of the best superhero movies ever, and not often using superhero powers in the movie (more on that later).<br/><br/>Logan follows, well, Logan (duh) at least twenty years after the events of X-Men III The Last Stand and the mutants are mostly wiped out. Logan has grown more bitter and old and is forced to live in the middle of Mexico with Professor Xaiver and a newcomer, Caliban. Eventually he finds that a group has been experimenting with mutants and have a clone of him, Laura (or X-23) now, he finds himself on the road with Laura and the Professor in an attempt to get Laura to her friends so they can be safe. The only problem are the people who want them dead, and that Logan's healing factor is weakening. <br/><br/>The movie Has a very simple yet interesting plot, The movie works because of the character dynamic. Logan is forced to face the fact that Laura is technically his daughter and that his family is gone. Professor Xaiver is slowly dying, both of old age and his powers becoming more and more unstable.<br/><br/>However, while the plot is simple, there is one scene which really doesn't work. In the original 'Old Man Logan' comic, the X-Men are gone because Logan was tricked into killing everyone. It's a horrific and tragic scene, one which no reader will ever forget. In the movie, it's implied that Charles lost control and caused a telepathic shock wave which killed 98% of all mutants around the world. It's sad, but not nearly as powerful as the scene in 'Old Man Logan'.<br/><br/>While that scene does slightly annoy me, the rest of the movie is nearly perfect. The character arcs are amazing, the plots are truly realistic and intense, and when the more emotional moments hit you and hit you hard. When Charles dies, it's a sad scene, but at the end of the movie when Logan dies, you can't not feel emotionally devastated. Not old because Logan dies to save Laura, but because it's also the end of an era (Hugh Jackman's Wolverine roles). The action scenes which are frequent throughout the film are top-notch and awesome to watch, if not a bit brutal, but the writers knew when to have action and when to have calm. Wolverine's ""Berserker Rage"" may be the greatest scene in the entire X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>All the actors in this movie are either returning actors to the franchise or newcomers. But either way, there is not a single bad actor in the entire movie. The special effects are some of the most realistic and well made I've seen in years. I'm also happy that not all movies are going wit the horrible CGI blood route.<br/><br/>Overall, Logan may not only be the best X-Men movie to date, but possibly the best superhero movie to date. It stands tall against movies such as Captain America The Winter Solider, or The Dark Knight and succeeds in it's mission despite being potentially hindered by the 'R' rating it has, which not only does it earn, but actually feels like it benefited from having an 'R' rating. If you for some reason haven't seen Logan yet, make sure it's on the top of your list."

","Welp, this is it, ladies and gentlemen. Wolverine's story has come to an end. Last time Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine ever in a movie. This is the masterpiece he decided to go out on.<br/><br/>James Mangold's direction was fantastic in this, really like his style and that he decided to do this less light and more gritty than 2013's okay-ish The Wolverine. This is a great move because this is what Wolverine deserves. A gritty, dirty, R-rated movie. And Jackman took a pay cut to ensure this was R-rated.<br/><br/>And hoo boy, does Mangold and Jackman use this to good effect. This film is extremely brutally violent. BUT THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED FROM A WOLVERINE MOVIE!!! Bloodless carnage in the X-Men films was simply just not acceptable now that Logan is out.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal. From Hugh Jackman's grumpy, old, weak, down-on-his-luck Logan, to Patrick Stewart's old, crusty, senile Professor X, to the insane, crazy debut performance by Dafne Keen. All played masterfully.<br/><br/>The action is awesome, still has that Wolverine edge to it. Just with more blood. The action is spread out throughout the film, so obviously as to not miss out on any plot details.<br/><br/>The ending is something to remember for a long time. (I won't spoil it)<br/><br/>THE VERDICT: If you are a fan of X-Men or the Old Man Logan comic books, or just a fan of R-rated comic book movies in general, see it. You'll be glad you did."

","A Superhero/Action/Drama Film which is story & character driven rather than spectacle/effects & Action driven.

Logan is not your stereotypical superhero film, in fact a person who doesn't like the genre would like this film as its so structurally sound. Its Flawless.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT BELOW<br/><br/>A film that had me & my dad shedding tears. We are both people who do not. Not often at all.

"shobanchittuprolu","8","5","10","1 August 2017"," Logan is really the most haunting superhero film since The Dark Knight.
","Logan (2017): Superpowers are one thing, but no-one said they were immortal. What happens when superheroes get old? Actually, what happens when, like many non-superheroes, they arrive at late middle-age without a partner, in ill health, and with an ageing parent to look after? I have hear rave reviews about Logan and many of them claimed that it is the most emotional superhero movie of all time.Except for Hugh Jackman's terrific portrayal,I never cared about Wolverine but Logan proved me wrong.Even not being a fan,Logan made me teary-eyed at the end ans Yes.. Logan is one of the most emotional superhero movie of all time.<br/><br/>Plot: In 2029 the mutant population has shrunken significantly and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan (Hugh Jackman), whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X (Patrick Stewart) whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan.<br/><br/>My Review: Logan is more like a survivalist thriller than a superhero film.Who would even dare tho think to make superheroes to fight for their survival?Logan did.Logan is an emphatically cheerless film about the cost of life, and the burden of being a superhero in a world that doesn't deserve them.<br/><br/>Part of the reason why Logan manages to be so emotionally effective is because it arrives late in the process for Jackman. The actor has been wearing the claws and percing the flseh out of everyone for 17 years, and he lets those miles show in every haggard look on display in Logan. Jackman full comprehends exactly what Wolverine needs to convey in each Logan scene -- whether its concern or compassion, remorse or berserker rage -- because he has occupied this character's skin for so long. It's second nature, and the decisions he makes along every painstaking step of Logan help ensure the movie's masterful success.<br/><br/>The second reason is the chemistry between Logan,Professor X and new entry, Laura.Our tired Logan taking care of ill-Xavier and the relation between them is heartwarming and funny at times too. Laura,who is almost mute for almost 3/4th of the film except for the screaming whenever she fights.All 3 of them has good chemistry between them which made us cry at the sad parts.<br/><br/>Logan doesn't follow the superhero blueprint, though that's a check in its favor. There are villains, yes, but the real antagonist staring down Wolverine is time, and fate. Cities aren't blown up and no visual destruction is shown in this movie.It has everything common which is uncommon for superhero film.<br/><br/>I was deeply moved by Jackman's soulful, intense and, yes, Oscar-worthy performance, which draws from every appearance as the Wolverine.Jackman wears pain, persecution and baggage in his eyes, and in his sighs. We see him wanting to stamp out hope but unable to go through with it, the actor carving up his character with both weariness and restlessness at once. It is a strong, resonant performance, an appropriately powerful.By his side is the great Patrick Stewart, who gives the most emotionally affecting performance of the entire X-Men franchise as a decrepit, mentally weakened Professor Charles Xavier.Dafne Keen is an absolute showstopper of a child who has all of Logan's powers and more, and none of the restraint its taken him lifetimes to accumulate. and the way this young child relishes the violence -- slicing villains to shreds with wildcat rage and ice-cream-truck glee -- may be this film's most disturbing image.<br/><br/>So,Logan is really the most haunting superhero film since The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>My rating 8.25/10"
"brandinscottlindsey","8","5","10","15 July 2017"," Mutants, Reluctant Heroism, and Genetic Patents
","Logan is a 2017 film based on the Wolverine character from Marvel's X-Men comic book series. Hugh Jackman portrays Logan, an aging and ill version of the character that we all know and love. Professor X is also in the film, once again played by Patrick Stewart, and is displayed as an old, senile shell of his former self, suffering from Alzheimer's disease and/or ALS.<br/><br/>The story follows Logan as he tries to gather enough money to essentially retire on a sailboat. Wolverine and Charles Xavier cross paths with a young girl who has been artificially created using Logan's genes. The girl is being pursued as a runaway patent by a corporation, and Xavier insists that they help her. Pushed into helping the child on her adventure, the reluctant Wolverine finds himself once again attempting to fill the role of hero.<br/><br/>Moving, exciting, and heart-wrenching at times, Logan is an excellent film. Each actor gives an amazing performance and the story is very well crafted.<br/><br/>If there are absolutely any complaints to be made about the film, it would have to be the dialogue in the first several minutes of the film. Sounding as if written by Tarantino, the word f--- appears in every other sentence. Adult language is absolutely fine in a movie, but sometimes it sounds as if it was added later. As if any f---ing person f---ing talks like this. You f--- ing know what the f--- I mean? Also, while an excellent device used to move and elaborate the story, the professionally edited and narrated cell phone video from the nurse is so unrealistic that it pulled me out of the movie for a moment. These are very minor criticisms and do not take away from the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a must-watch for anyone and will leave all viewers moved, whether they are comic book fans or not."

","It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura. They're on the run from a corporation which created Laura and other mutant children to be super-soldiers. Its thugs are looking to recapture the escaped subjects.<br/><br/>The movie is hard and bloody. It mines the well-worn relationship between Logan and Professor X bringing a feral little girl into the mix. The connection is ingrained. It takes the superhero joy of violence and makes it brutal. I would have liked a little more jokey humor between odd couple Logan and X. Overall, it's good bloody brutal violence with a familiar relationship and some new ones."

","This movie seems highly overrated. Didn't leave a mark on me, at some points I actually felt bored watching it.<br/><br/>The plot is basically one linear travel from point A to B and, with some stops here and there, but after 30 mins into the movie you can almost guess everything that is going to happen. Even the ending is clichÃ©.<br/><br/>Stretching this to the 2h mark, seems torture. Entertaining? Maybe. Something to remember? Only for the disappointment that I felt."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","10","11 March 2017"," For the most part, this R-Rated superhero movie was as solid as adamantium claws, but it did have a few flaws in the design..
","Wolverine is one of the few X-Men characters that appears in nearly every media adaptation of the X-Men franchise, including comics, television, and video games. He has always been a popular character. His willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes, for the rest of the late 20th century. As a result, the character was also feature in films, with Australian actor, Hugh Jackman playing him in nine different movies, with 'Logan', supposedly being his last. Directed by James Mangold & set in the near-future, the film follows a past-his-prime James ""Logan"" Howlett AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) embarking on a road trip across America with his diminished mentor/friend, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) for one final mission to safety delivered, a young mutant girl, Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) to the protection of the Great White North, Canada; while a group of scientists, and their security team led by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) tries to stop them. Without spoiling the movie, too much, director James Mangold and his writers does an OK job, helming this piece in the style of comics, 'Old Man Logan' & 'the New Mutants'. I just wish, he didn't his characters bash the comics, in-universe so much. What's wrong with having Wolverine, wear his iconic yellow suit!? Fans like myself, really do want to see it. It's sad that Hugh Jackman, will never done that suit. It could had made this film, so much better. Also, if this comic book plot sounds very familiar, it's pretty much, is; as the movie and comics, borrow elements from classic westerns such as 1953's 'Shane', 1972's 'The Cowboys' & 1976's 'The Shootist'; as well as story elements from other dystopian mediums hits like author, P. D. James 1992 'Children of Men' novel; which in return, became a movie in 2006; as well as 2013's survival horror video game 'The Last of Us'. All of this, been cited as one of its story's primary influences, even if the film loosely use all of them. Because of that, it kinda diminished the story, a bit, as 'Logan' is place in a future that's not quite post-apocalyptic as 2014's film 'Days of Future Past' timeline, but not quite as normal. So, it was not as intense as it should be. The film also became a bit confusing at times, as parts of the film talks about events like the Liberty Island accident in the original timeline, when technically, they're living in the revised timeline, set for them. It's really doesn't make any lick of sense. It's all f*** up! When, you think about it, 'Logan' has a lot of plot-holes that goes unexplained like Transigen killing mutants, yet, trying to create them. Don't get, where they were going with that. Also, the question who was in Canada, kinda bug me. Maybe, it's the Alpha Flight? Who knows!? The film never tells you. Because of this, the lack of exposition is pretty noticeable, toward the third act. It will leave you, puzzling, yet somewhat confused. Also, whenever, they do spill exposition about what is happening, it's told in the most laziness fashion like the well-made video on the smart phone. Like honestly, who had time to shot the video, and edited it, when it's supposedly smuggle out, quickly!? Also, why didn't Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez) just publicize it to the public? That would save time. Another problem for the movie for me, was when they unearth the new villain, X-24. In my opinion, I found the surprised villain to be, jarring and yet, also disappointing. It felt a self-jerk. It was just as awkward as 'Albert' from the comics. It just doesn't mesh for me. The film could had been better, if it had Donald Pierce take that role, since Boyd Holbrook was surprising, pretty good, as the extreme fanboy villain. If not, Donald Pierce. They should had use the character of 'Sabretooth' from 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Actor, Liev Schreiber was one of the best thing about that movie, as Victor Creed. So use him, instead! Despite the scenes with X-24, the rest of the action was alright in this film, even if it's not as bloody or gory as people make it, out to be. Just glad, it's not CGI heavy. I also like how Hugh Jackman still had the chops to do, most of his stunts. It's also cool to see, a young actress like Dafne Keen, be able to stand out on her own, in those fighting sequences as well. I just wish, the movie establish, more of a father/daughter relationship with the two, besides the fighting. I found those driving scenes part, to be below standards, due to the lack of dialogue and interaction between them. Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh Jackman's performance in this film, but couldn't they had him, lighten up for a few moments. I don't like, how much Logan is a sourpuss. Let the movie had some more fun with him. The film is dark and downer enough. Have some scenes with him, bonding with his kid. For the most part, I enjoy the connection that Logan had with Charles Xavier, more. It seems like they had more of a relationship than Laura and Logan. I found Patrick Stewart's acting to be the best, throughout this film. He really it, took some risk, like losing 21 pounds to look more elderly and ill. That's really intense. He really gives, something new, here, as the sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious, mentally deteriorating mentor-figure. You've never this side of him, before. It's sad that this will be his last role as Professor Xavier, as well. Overall: I thought the film was well-made. I have to say, this movie was just decent enough to be, a good finale for Hugh Jackman's run with the character. It's good, but it's not quite cutting edge great."

"malice_o_conner","4","6","13","1 June 2017"," Depression and Disappointment
","The film begins with a broken down Wolverine (aka Logan). Already sick and miserable. We are left with little to no information of the occurrences beyond X-Men Days of Future Past. While that movie ended with hope this begins in despair. Almost like mad max most of the beginning is some desolate wasteland. Charles Xavier is kept away from others due to his seizures that inadvertently (*hinted*) have killed all his X-Men. Wow. Could that just get any worse? How about watching 2 hours of a little girl fight and destroy in all the ways you keep hoping Logan (The Wolverine) would get into gear. Wait. And Wait.... Oh last 20 minutes. There you go. Done. Depressing Close. Movie over. <br/><br/>To watch the performance of the actors - magnificent performances and it's not the actors fault for the bad writing, the plot-holed story line, or the absolute depressing overtone throughout most of the movie. <br/><br/>I understand we're all bound to get old, to eventually be just as broken and pathetic as these heroes were on screen. But honestly stomaching almost 2 hours of despair, hopelessness, and slow death. Like watching a loved one suffer in pain and unable to do much. It's almost heartbreaking. <br/><br/>While I ""hail to the King"" of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) they performed wonderfully and truly brought their characters to life. However, they unwittingly brought them to a most pathetic end. The millions of ways they could've ended this, or re-wrote this, or done anything with. And they made this garbage. I will never keep this one in the collection despite their amazing performance. (Same with Wolverine Origins) Way to undo everything you fixed in DOFP. C'est la vie - Next!"

I expected a 4,9 IMDb rating not above 8! I don't know what other fans want to see but this movie was the worst xmen movie I have ever seen. To xmen fans: Don't see it, it will destroy the series.

"phoenixinvictus","3","6","13","18 April 2017"," If it's not a superhero movie then don't put superheroes in it
","I found this movie to be disappointing, boring and confusing. If it's not a superhero movie then don't put superheroes in it. There is barely any action in the movie and the whole second act is dull. Logan takes place in the year 2029, with technology that is barely more advanced than our 2017, there's an evil corporation complete with henchmen and they want to weaponize mutating kids to create killers. What a surprise! For some unexplained reason Canada is a magical land with a magical border that is able to repel bad guys and evil corporations. Maybe they have mutated Mounties guarding themÂ… In almost every X-Man movie the technology is always super advanced, with invisible planes, flying robots and holographic simulators, but all that technology seems to have vanished along with all the mutants. After having lived for over a century we finally see Logan is not only is ageing, but also dying. The movie never really explains why he no longer is able to regenerate except for a hint that the adamantium is somehow poisoning him. We also never get a reasonable explanation of what happened in ""Westchester"" other than that Xavier may have killed everyone with one of his seizures and who now has a mental illness. Wasn't there any signs of Xavier's illness? People with mental illnesses don't just snap from one moment to the next. Couldn't they have given him an injection of some sort like they did in another movie? This movie glossed over twenty years of back stories that wants to make me want to shake my head. Maybe they'll time travel their problems away in a reboot where things aren't so confusing. The plot holes are abundant and so I rate this movie with a capital B for Boring."

","As an avid enjoyer of most superhero movies, with the X men franchise near the top of my films to enjoy list I looked forward to the climax of the set. Unfortunately there is little to enjoy here as Xavier is senile, Logan is a babysitter for Charles and Logan's ""daughter"" says almost nothing.<br/><br/>It's hard to like a character that says nothing. There's little to endear them to the viewer and that is the case here. Suffering Alzheimer's is a terrible thing to cope with and not much fun to watch either. It might be a great challenge for an actor but it's not an area of entertainment for me. To then make Logan a drunk on top of two other miserable characters is asking too much for this viewer. With the characters so full of misery there's just no hero any more let alone a super one.<br/><br/>Of course Logan becomes the hero at the end but it's too little to late to make this a superhero movie. It's really just a means of removing the characters so Marvel can move on to some other franchise. All in it's easily the worst of the franchise and a poor way to finish an excellent series of films."

","Logan follows the remaining X-Men in the distant future, where most mutants have long since gone extinct. A young girl comes to their door with a group of threatening people looking for her, thus beginning Logan's attempt to help her escape. <br/><br/>As this is Hugh Jackman's last portrayal of Logan AKA Wolverine, it had high stakes. Personally I didn't expect this level of quality from it, considering how most of these big blockbusters tend to go in the direction of lackluster. <br/><br/>Logan is a heavy movie. It is fantastically performed by both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, and the emotion they are able to infuse within the audience is more powerful than anything I've seen in the series thus far. The content itself is hard-hitting, thanks to a fantastic script, and as a whole this proves to be a huge step in an entirely different direction for the franchise. And that's a good thing.<br/><br/>The R rating allows the movie to reach this level of heaviness, and with that weight comes some pretty awesome, but brutal, violence. Despite the warnings I received about how brutal the introduction alone was, I still managed to be surprised by it. The movie doesn't hold back, but it doesn't overdo it either. It's just right, and just right is exactly where I wanted it to be. <br/><br/>The movie does a fantastic job of building atmosphere. It's dark, it's gritty, and it really feels like the end of the world. And in the context of the movie, I'm pretty sure that was the case. <br/><br/>Overall Logan is a fantastic end to an already good series, and proves to be the best of that series, at least in my eyes. It's dark and gritty, but also well-acted, well-written, and never overdone. I can't wait to see this one again when it leaves theaters, and in the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie."

The script is weak and unfortunately dumbed down and needlessly mindlessly violent. Without ruining the film... you're going to ask yourself why the young girl doesn't talk. Cheap, exploitative tricks like this and a really rushed, dumb ending (because we need the same Kodak moment in every film) make this a pretty boring, droll drag of a film that is camouflaged in a deeper ""so this is what happens when X-Men get old!"" There was nothing deep about it.<br/><br/>The lazy script leaves open gaping holes but I won't repeat them as a spoiler. Just be prepared to realize that this is a much lesser film than is being lauded here. People feel they must praise Jackman's departure as well as Stewart. If it wasn't for their excellent acting, this film would have gone quickly to cable.<br/><br/>Notable are excellent special effects. I give them credit for seamless visuals. But the violence in this film was gratuitous and stupid, running into the face of danger like Superman.

Instead what I found was an overly long, pedestrian and even mediocre movie, which surely had its fair share of high-points, but not enough to make this movie one I loved or even liked.<br/><br/>""Logan"", while not a horrible movie, is missing something, that spark, that vitality, which should have lifted this movie above the fray.

","Going into this movie, I was really excited. Finally we were going to get the visceral wolverine character that we have wanted since the original X-Men movie. The carnage lived up to the expectations, unfortunately once that novelty wore off, there wasn't much left to make this an interesting movie. <br/><br/>The plot was so basic a 5 year old could have written it. Kids trying to get from point A to point B, yet it only seemed important for Logan to be escorting one of them. I get that splitting up can make it harder for them to track you, but given the woman searched for Logan when she was trying to meet a deadline seems a monumental waste of time, but that trend didn't just stop there. While Logan contemplated helping the woman (who specified that they were on a time frame), Logan decides to wait a while before going back to find the woman dead. This is the first time that poor time management was used to add a spark to the story.<br/><br/>This happened twice more. Hey, we're on the run from an organization that appears to have unlimited resources and technology, so lets keep stopping to help horses, or wait for morning before crossing the boarder. Same old repetitive simple storytelling, used only as a means to have more people get stabbed in the head by Logan. Also there was a showdown that made me grimace and think of the old Arnold vs CGI Arnold in the last Terminator movie. <br/><br/>This isn't the worst movie FOX has made, but Marvel Studios sill blows this movie out of the water any day of the week."

","This movie was absolutely terrible for to many reasons to list, but here are some. <br/><br/>1) They changed who the characters were (always a sign of a bad film). Logan is just mean, angry and mostly uncaring. Which I can understand, but only to a point with the long & rough life he's had. But who you are, doesn't really change. Charles Xavier is old and has mental issues. That's barely believable, even at his age, being what his mutant powers are. They both drop the F bomb many times throughout the movie. I can see Logan using it occasionally, but not Charles. Not only is that out of character, let's face it, it's just lazy writing. <br/><br/>2) There are no signs of mutants losing their powers, so Logan's healing, wouldn't weaken, nor would the adamantium poison him. Lame<br/><br/>3) Charles would have known the clone was not Logan. Ridiculous. <br/><br/>4) The adamantium bullet would not penetrate Logan's adamantium skull. Just plan dumb<br/><br/>5) Coating a kid's bones (Laura) with adamantium would stop her from ever growing. A small but annoying point.<br/><br/>6) Laura killed dozens of thugs in her first big scene. Then at the end, she and all the other kid mutants run from them in the forest?!?!?! Out of character and stupid<br/><br/>7) Logan wouldn't have died in the climactic scene near the end. Even at a slow rate, he would have regenerated. Has this writer never seen a Wolverine film before?<br/><br/>8) Many more problems, but you get my points. <br/><br/>Overall, not entertaining, lame and a waste of time (even if you have 2.5 hours to waste).

","Everything I've ever wanted to see in a super hero movie. James is on the edge. He doesn't care whether he lives or dies anymore, he's just a drunk chauffeur running away from his past. There's no purpose in life for him, he's lost all hope, until he meets Laura. He sees in her his old himself and an opportunity to make up for his mistakes. He won't admit it, but he cares for her and so does Charles. Charles is the closest thing to a father he has, on the inside he is one of the reasons he hasn't given up yet. When they realize they need to protect what they destroyed in order to preserve the future that's when the movie begins. Logan is not all about violence, it's about inspiring the next ones, the next generation. Inspiring our children to be better than we are, so they can teach the same thing to theirs."
"please_stand_by","8","7","16","15 March 2017"," A Gritty, Heartfelt Send-Off for a Legendary Character
","In purely literal terms, Logan is a comic book movie. However, it's a significant departure from the standard comic book movie formula. It does not have a super-powerful threat intent on destroying the city/world/universe. It does not have a gigantic CGI battle sequence. It does not have a contrived romance subplot. It doesn't even depend on the audience having seen some number of previous films to understand the plot or character motivations. And it certainly wasn't made for the standard PG-13 audience. Instead, Logan plays out in way that could perhaps best be described as an extremely intense, violent, and emotional family road trip. And as strange as that may sound, it works almost perfectly.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is one of weariness and struggle; from very early on it is made clear that Logan and Professor Xavier are in hiding. The look of the characters and world itself both reflect this tone perfectly; Logan and Xavier both look like they've seen better days. Not long after the film begins, Logan becomes the begrudging guardian to a seemingly mute young girl, Laura, who is being hunted by dangerous people. What follows is a road trip across the country, punctuated by a mix of quiet, heartfelt moments and brutal, unforgiving clashes. The tension of being pursued is a constant driving force giving our characters' actions a sense of purpose, and keeping the audience engaged at all times.<br/><br/>If I were to note a flaw with this otherwise very strong story, it would be the abrupt introduction of a large number of characters towards the end of the film. They are mentioned previously, but they aren't really developed beyond the bare minimum. They weren't particularly necessary to the ending, and it is hard to care about them seeing as we barely know them. I couldn't help but find myself thinking that if they were written out of the story it would have been more focused overall.<br/><br/>That being said, the three main characters work perfectly together as a strange little family, and they are developed in such a way so as to not alienate viewers who have never seen any of the other X-Men movies. The villains are also threatening and scary throughout while still being completely believable, albeit fairly one-dimensional. The near-future world in which the events take place is also a very grounded and believable one instead of a monolithic comic book fantasy world. References to events in past films are also minimal, though they reward people for following this character through his various past adventures. The ending is incredibly satisfying.<br/><br/>Overall, Logan is a highly compelling standalone film that can even entertain crowds that have no interest in comic books or the movies based on them. It is one of the rare comic book movies that transcends being great within the comic book genre to being simply great, period."
"simodandrade","10","7","16","7 March 2017"," The breaking bad of all superhero movies
","Notice how i didn't say ""The Dark knight"" of x-men or marvel. I personally believe that Logan was its own movie that had a unique way of blowing audiences out of their seats and can highly agree that with out a doubt it is up there with some of greatest superhero movies of all time like the dark knight, the dark knight rises, spider man 2, and deadpool. This review WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR LOGAN AND SURPRISINGLY THE BREAKING BAD (ALITTLE). So if you haven't seen Logan or breaking bad, read this later. <br/><br/>Now I know for a fact you may be thinking what does breaking bad have anything to do with Logan? Well the most simple way of saying it is breaking bad is known to be one of the greatest shows of all time and Logan im sure is now considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time , but one thing Logan kind of had in common with breaking bad was knot the plot but the outcome of the main character development. If i had to describe season 5 of breaking bad in one word rock bottom not just for Walter white but for all the characters surrounded by him, and watching the movie Logan i saw the same thing. In this Movie we see what we normally saw in all the X-men films. We see a depressed alcoholic Logan who has changed his identity, works a crappy limo driver job, and is hiding a old and sick professor Xavier in the Mexican border. The first 30 min of this movie had me interested because we learn very little of why professor x and Logan are in the state they are in, why both of them are depressed and hurt, and why all the mutant race is dead. This movie does a fantastic job of of living up to its title and that is really showing the true inside of Logan. In the movie Logan is actually suicidal and and multiple times refers to it because he believes that the "" accident "" was his fault and the same applies with professor x,but and the end of the day their relationship is what keeps both of them alive and MAN the does a great job showing their friendship build each other up. Next my favorite prat of this movie is X 23 Dafne Keene, god she was a bad ass in this movie her acting is just so perfect and im praying we see her again in a spin off. Logan's death in this movie is what i feel like really made the movie more heartfelt and how i can compare it to the breaking bad like Walter white dying we see that with his death we saw who he truly was, well the same thing goes with Logan at the end we X 23 flipping his cross into an X showed he was more than a human being he was an X men. Honestly this was a great film i have already seen it twice and am tempted to see it again so i 100 % recommend."
"alexlacatus","10","7","16","21 February 2017"," Logan
","For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right,Logan is easily the best X-men movie ever and I can say that it's even as good as The Dark Knight.And if this is the last portray of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine than I hope that we'll see his retirement because nobody will be better than him as Wolverine.All I can say is that the movie really earned its R rated and it seem's that this is the way for an superhero movie to be an success,all we need it's for the movie to be R rated or at least for some of the character who are in the comics known for their strong language and violence.I hope that in the future the DC films will be as these two R-rated movies(Deadpool and Logan) because we all know that the DC comics are the most violent and brutal comics.The action takes place in a near-future, one in which no new mutants have been born in two decades. As their numbers dwindled, Professor X's dreams of a new stage in evolution slowly died. Logan is scraping a living as a limo driver in the town on the Mexican border and hustling for medication that he takes out south to a remote, makeshift home he shares with Caliban, nursemaid to the infirm Professor X. Logan attempts to hide from the world and his legacy. However, when a mysterious woman asks for Logan's help with Laura, a young mutant being pursued by dark forces, he is drawn back into action despite his hopelessness..Unlike most comic book films ""Logan"" doesn't rely on CGI. Instead it focuses on character development and story arc.Again the movie is fantastic and one of the best X-men movies,better even than Deadpool so do yourself a favor and watch this film."

"neil-476","10","3","5","15 May 2018"," Superb and a fitting close to Wolverine's movie life
","Logan's mutant healing factor is finally being poisoned by the adamantium in his system. He is working as a limo driver while tending a frail Charles Xavier, suffering from dementia. He is abruptly put in the position of having to nursemaid a mute 11-year old with retractable claws who is on the run from an organisation which wants to recover its investment. He is not happy. <br/><br/>After his breakthrough performance as Wolverine 17 years ago in the first X-men film, Hugh Jackman has played that character in all of them, albeit by way of cameo in First Class and Apocalypse. The intervening period has been such a fertile period for comic-based movies that it is easy to forget that Brian Singer's first movie was a trailblazer for the ensemble super-hero film. But I think it is not unfair to observe that, no matter how good the scripts, how epic the effects, how committed the performances, all these super-hero films have been fairly shallow and superficial. There's nothing wrong with that - what else do we expect from super-powered escapism?<br/><br/>Not so with Logan. The joy of the X-Men films is that the internal continuity and, importantly, the passage of real time outside - and, therefore, also within - these films, have brought us to the position which allows this movie, a movie about familiar characters growing old, to take place. Yes, there is Wolverine action, but the heart of the movie is watching this weary and damaged man cope with his relationship with Xavier, father figure, mentor and, as a feeble but dangerous 90 year-old, a damn nuisance, and then also coping with a mute and feral child, a major problem even without Xavier and the hordes of mercenaries after her.<br/><br/>This is a film about fathers, sons and daughters, and may strike chords if you have elderly dependents and wilful teens in the family. It is also about earning redemption.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's about what the comics refer to as Berserker Rage.<br/><br/>The plot is straightforward. The various trailers have shown the set-up fairly comprehensively, but most of this material is drawn from the first half hour. There are some surprises in what follows, but nothing which will be completely unexpected. This lack of surprise does not detract from the performances: both Jackman and Stewart are superb as Logan and Xavier, adding depths and emotional nuances to the characters which we never imagined from the previous films.<br/><br/>They aren't the only ones giving us great performances. Newcomer Dafne Keen is astonishing as the mysterious clawed child Laura, both in terms of her physicality and the striking performance she gives without dialogue. And lanky English comedy writer and performer Stephen Merchant is a delightfully sympathetic Caliban. Sadly, the villains disappoint. Boyd Holbrooke's baddie Pierce leaves little real impression, and Richard E. Grant's Dr Rice is underwritten. Never mind: this film belongs to the three principals.<br/><br/>I have deliberately been fairly light on the detail, but there are a couple of things I should mention. One is that this movie is NOT kiddie friendly. The first word spoken is ""F*ck"", and this is repeated frequently, rather too much in my view: I like language to serve the narrative, and much of the profanity here seems to be present simply because F*ck. <br/><br/>The film is also graphically violent. We finally get to see what those claws do, in full and gory detail. So if your kids love the X-Men, treat them to the old TV cartoons, not this one.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoiler the ending other than to say that it is emotional, especially in its closing note, a beautiful and perfectly fitting touch which caught me by surprise.<br/><br/>I'm sure there will be other X-Men movies - why not? There are many X-Men who haven't yet featured on film - but I doubt there will be one as good as this one for quite some time."

","My most anticipated film of the year did not disappoint, instead proving itself to be a masterfully crafted and deeply effecting action/thriller that stays with you long after the credits roll. 'Logan (2017)' is brutal, sombre, visceral, heart-breaking, nuanced, tragic and, overall, an amazingly accomplished piece of work in every possible way. It's the culmination of all that came before, the true incarnation of this classic character, and a masterful deconstruction of the superhero genre. Not only is it one of my favourite films in that genre, but it has quickly become one of my favourite films of all time. Simply phenomenal. 9/10"

For example, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Paul Newman, etc. To me, it was the worst way to go away from a series. Why would this be done so differently from the rest? It has shown me how classless all of you people who put this together are. Tell me, did your children see it? Were all of you proud that they could see it?

"TxMike","Null","3","5","3 November 2017"," Lots of gore and violence but a good story to wrap up Wolverine.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. In an interesting addition it has a second disk, of the B&W version of the movie. I will add a note at the end of this after I have time to view it.<br/><br/>I have always liked the Wolverine character in the X-Men movies, he is played with the right amount of superpower mixed with angst. This movie is set in the near future, 2029, and Hugh Jackman is back as Logan. (Later in the movie we also see him as a clone, X-24.) Patrick Stewart is back as Charles, aging and delicate, and Logan is caring for him, the X-Men days a distant memory. Until someone shows up looking for Charles and a new mutant.<br/><br/>That mutant, one remnant of a series of illegal experiments to grow super soldiers, is little Dafne Keen as approximately 10-yr-old Laura. She has super strength and also the embedded knives in her hands. Before the story is over we find out Logan is in fact her biological father.<br/><br/>The movie has a number of scenes with extreme violence and gore, and some vehicle chase scenes, those are virtually mandatory in modern movies. But the story itself is a nice one, the surviving young mutants need to get to a particular place in N. Dakota to seek safe refuge in Canada.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed with the young actress, her character was for me the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Edit: I popped in the B&W version of this movie and viewed several scenes. I must say it is excellent, the lighting and appropriate contrast make it pop nicely gives it an air of mystery. If I had only watched the movie in B&W I would be totally happy with that. I know some prefer B&W as it gives them the ""cinema"" look they enjoy but for me a well-filmed color movie is still better. Color is very important to our reality so why leave it out?"
"demented_peruvian","7","3","5","9 July 2017"," More of the same while trying to do an Eastwood flick
","James Mangold and Hugh Jackman teamed up to make a different Wolverine movie: more serious, inspired by westerns, in which our hero has to deal with mortality and regret, while being on the lam with a girl. That movie was called ""The Wolverine"". For ""Logan"" they decided to do something bold and different by... doing exactly the same, while adding nothing to Wolverine's story, except an ending. Okay, this time the girl is a child with special powers (you know from the trailer and the DVD jacket that she is connected to Wolverine; I won't spoil details), which makes the plot go exactly in the same beats as as every adult-with-child-on-the-lam flick, from ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" and ""Firestarter"" to ""Midnight Special"". The villains in their vans and helicopters behave like all those on-the-lam villains who somehow always arrive quickly to wherever the protagonists are, even at times when there's no plausible reason. Innocent people are befriended on the way, and pay a price.<br/><br/>But yes, it is well shot, with well directed action, some style, and good performances. Back in the 80s, ""X-Men"" fans were campaigning for a movie to be made, with Clint Eastwood a fan favorite choice as Wolverine. Thus it is perhaps no surprise that style-wise and plot-wise, ""Logan"" behaves like if Clint Eastwood had made it, taking inspiration from multiple Eastwood flicks: ""Pale Rider"", ""Unforgiven"", ""A Perfect World"", and even small shades of ""Gran Torino"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". It also references some classic anti-Westerns of the 1950s, going as far as including a ""Shane"" homage. All of this it pulls off well, but you do feel like you've seen this too many times before.<br/><br/>""Logan"" also pretends to be a ""Mad Max""-like dystopian movie, but then it turns out that they're just in the US-Mexico border, and other than the lack of new mutants, the world looks exactly like the 2010s, despite it being 2029 or so. In fact, there's been no change to every day technology, including cars, cell phones and TVs. Only the villains seem to possess advanced technology, in the shape of cybernetic arms and advanced cloning abilities. The villains (The Reavers) are unimpressive, with the most powerful one being a metaphor of Wolverine's aging issues. And no, Nathaniel Essex is not in this movie, despite how it was promoted. Boyd Holbrook plays Pierce as a cunning dangerous redneck, somewhat of a cross between Gary Oldman and Woody Harrelson, but less strong.<br/><br/>The story does not do us any service. Aside from the standard plot themes for this sub-genre of 'grumpy dying hero reluctantly takes on a child and goes on the lam', there's little added to the story. We learn of a grim fate of a half-dozen unnamed X-Men, but have no clue what happened to the dozens of other characters. We are left wondering how Wolverine suddenly started aging rapidly, with no good explanation given, or to how/when he retreated to a menial existence. We also wonder how Professor X turned into a babbling fool, other than dementia at age 90. Jackman and Stewart turn in great performances, even if Stewart's character bares only little resemblance to his prior incarnations. Perhaps you can justify it with how dementia changes some great people.<br/><br/>What is different from the usual ""X-Men"" movies is the violent gore and the cursing. It shocks at first, then feels repetitive/gratuitous or over-the-top. I will say that the fight scenes are more effective, and overall in ""Logan"" the violence straddles a thin line between action and terror.<br/><br/>Saving the film overall is the good chemistry between the leads, the acting, and the fact that you are watching Wolverine in action on the big screen."

And do not forget this is a superhero movie!!! I must ask you all when will the time of these hard, slow superhero movies end?

","Since his debut on screen in 2000's X-Men, grizzled mutant Logan aka Wolverine became a fan favourite, the poster boy for the then budding new series and a career defining role for Australia's very own favourite son Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>A lot has changed since that memorable debut in Bryan Singer's well-liked comic book hit, for Wolverine as a character, most of that revolves around a lot of crumby cameos and forgettable solo adventures but proving once and for all that good things come to those that wait, Jackman and his The Wolverine director James Mangold have decided enough was enough and finally given the many fans of the clawed mutant the film they've been calling out for.<br/><br/>Logan, a downright glum and violent affair is very far from the ""perfect"" film but considering where this character has come from and where it seemed like he was likely to stay, Mangold's film is one worthy of the name and this Western inspired road trip provides a sense of closure when it comes to the Wolverine name, in that we can finally say Jackman did all he could with this creation that gave birth to his enjoyable international career.<br/><br/>A film that ends up being slightly too long in the claw, Logan is 130 minutes of dust covered, blood strewn and anti-children's entertainment that leverages Marvel's new found ""older"" audience targeting that did them so well with Deadpool and their Netflix events, as a now withered and old Logan is trying to live a quiet life as a driver for hire whilst supporting an ailing Professor X only to be thrown headfirst into a violent battle to protect mutant child Laura who acts as a surrogate daughter to the bearded ex-hero.<br/><br/>This set-up allows Mangold and Jackman to explore Logan on a deeper level, as the near suicidal man struggles to find meaning behind his sombre existence and Jackman delivers his best turn yet as the character while many fanboys will appreciate the time he gets to spend with Professor X (who I would argue gets too much screen time uttering Logan's name on repeat for the majority) and it's a chance to finally see the famed mutant act out some seriously impressive carnage.<br/><br/>The action in Logan is where the film truly shines and from the film's opening minutes you're acutely aware that this is not a film you'll be watching with the younger members of your family.<br/><br/>Limbs are lopped, chopped, sliced and diced and Mangold isn't afraid to linger on the killing that sometimes needs to be done and for all those years we've endured rather forgettable Wolverine fight scenes, Logan certainly does more than enough to make up for this.<br/><br/>With action a high point of the film, Logan's not so amazing moments come from a story that starts to drag come the final stretches and with a finale that will be far from many people's memories come a few months' time, it feels as though Logan wasn't entirely sure of itself when it came to delivering the goods come the films conclusion.<br/><br/>It's nice to see Marvel shy away from ""city destruction"" and an evil villain that just wants to take over the world but you can't help but feel the earlier beginnings of Logan signposted a far more ""epic"" final act, not one with a bunch of children running around a forest and a bottle of peptides.<br/><br/>A fine final outing for Jackman and his Wolverine to be a part of, Logan is without doubt the best solo Wolverine adventure and easily one of the best X-Men orientated feature films that draws out Jackman's best performance in some time and introduces us to newcomer Dafne Keen, who does a great job in her portrayal of Laura.<br/><br/>There's nothing truly ground-breaking here but it's certainly refreshing to see Marvel willing to keep expanding their horizons and deliver different takes on stories and characters that have flooded our cinema screens for nearly two decades and while this overlong trip is lacking a little in the emotional stakes and features a few to many corny circumstances, it's unlikely the images of Logan enacting out his sweet form of justice will be forgotten anytime soon.<br/><br/>3 ½ bowls of cornflakes out of 5"

"tubezzz","3","4","8","23 November 2017"," Schindler's list was upbeat compared this this
","Incredibly bleak and depressing.<br/><br/>I feel for the poor souls who actually had to sit through this painful experience in a movie theater.<br/><br/>It felt like they really wanted the the viewers to sympathize with Logan by making us share his agonizing and doomed existence. well it worked. 20 minutes into this thing and i wanted to off myself. Xavier is dying, Logan is dying. everyone around them is dying. all the mutants have vanished (I still don't know why or how) so they're all alone. <br/><br/>Now normally if a movie is so depressing you'd expect some serious drama to back it up. well, the first problem is, the film goes out of its way to remind you that 'this can not end well', so there's no hope, and there's no suspense - since we know the main characters are already doomed. yes there are those mutant kids we can root for, but we hardly get to know them, and the little girl is so feral that i didn't care for her either. the 'eleven' girl from 'Stranger Things' (Millie Bobby Brown) plays the same role only x10 times better. <br/><br/>The other issue i had with the movie is the lack of 'journey' (character development/progression). the characters just suffer until they die. at the beginning of the film Logan is an angry, withered terminal patient, and Xavier is a dying shell of a man. both characters stay mostly true to that description for the remainder of the film. Hugh Jackson goes out of his way to show us he doesn't give a damn. so much so that it was very difficult for me to believe that he's actually willing to fight for the sake of Laura or the other kids. why doesn't he just kill himself already?<br/><br/>Last but not least, the action scenes: those were incredibly repetitive. Logan and Laura slice and dice through a never ending supply of henchmen. an incredibly mind numbing experience. <br/><br/>I'm not huge superhero fan. but i got to watch all of the X-men movies and found them to be quite entertaining if nothing else. 'Logan' has nothing to do with any of those. it's a stand-alone requiem for fun."
"Neeraj100","8","4","8","15 November 2017"," Logan
","From the first moment Johnny Cash's mournful voice graced that terrific trailer, there was a sense that Hugh Jackman and director James Mangold were not going to play by the rules anymore. For Jackman, it was his ninth time playing Wolverine, and for Mangold, it is another shot to perfect what he almost achieved in 2013, when he sent Logan to Japan.<br/><br/>For both of them however, it was now or never. Jackman's missed no opportunity to tell everyone that this would be his last time playing the Wolverine, the character that defined his career, and would probably continue to define him for the rest of his life. Perhaps it was this pressure to do well, to erase bad memories (hopefully, after this, X-Men Origins will be forgotten), or perhaps it was the freedom afforded to it by the success of Deadpool, but Logan is unlike any superhero film you have seen. Like that Cash song, it is minimalistic, meditative, melancholy, and has nothing to lose anymore. We've seen him go through hell, we've seen him watch on as everyone he loves dies, and all he can do is keep living. All Wolverine can do is keep fighting. But what for?<br/><br/>The reason comes in the form of a girl, no older than 10.<br/><br/>When we catch up with Logan, grizzled, visibly older, the scars on his body like haunting memories of the past, it is 2029. No mutants have been born in the last 20 years. They've become folktales, legends passed on in comic books, and perhaps even movies. Logan scrapes a living driving a limo near the US-Mexico border. The little money he makes goes into buying medicine for his friend Charles, Professor X. They live in the desert, away from everyone else, together, like they have been for so many years. They're all they have in this world.<br/><br/>And then, Laura arrives. She's a lot like him, Charles tells Logan. She's a mutant. The first one to come along in decades. And she's the only hope they have. It is rumoured that thousands of miles away, in North Dakota, there is a safe haven for others like her, like them. That is where they must take her, away from the bad men.They do the only thing they can. In a subtle homage to the first X-Men movie, Logan takes the girl under his wing. They steal a car, grab some snacks, and take to the road.<br/><br/>It is said that the superhero movie will soon go the way of the movie Western (not by me, but by better minds, like Spielberg and Lucas), how it has arrived at a saturation point, how the six-shooters and cowboy hats made way for spandex and force fields as they journeyed towards their final destination. For an uncommonly grim film which would much rather contemplate mortality than gleefully demolish a city, the idea of Logan reviving a dying genre – two dying genres – is almost poetic.<br/><br/>There is only one way to push this genre forward, to prevent it from becoming obsolete. And that is to deconstruct it, to rip off all the excess CGI, all the capes and cowls, and exhume the essence of what makes these movies so great. Logan does that. And then it does it again.<br/><br/>It takes cues from classics like Children of Men, The Wrestler, and even the great video game The Last of Us. It is uncompromising in its brutality and fearless in its reverence of these iconic characters. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, and what creative freedom can produce.<br/><br/>Logan's cinematic journey began 17 years ago in a forest. He was making money fighting in cages. A young girl saved him then, she showed him what it was like to have a family, what it felt like to be good. In Logan, it takes another girl to show him who he really is, to remind him that his life was worth something.<br/><br/>It is the perfect swansong he could've got."

"soundoflight","7","4","8","26 August 2017"," Not bad for a superhero film
","I usually can't stand modern superhero films, the only exception being parts of Nolan's Batman series. But the mood of the first half of ""Logan"" is quite reminiscent of Nolan's work, as it brings a realism and humanity to these familiar, fantastic characters. There's something fascinating about an old, broken down Wolverine limping around half-drunk. Maybe I'm strange, but I almost wish the entire movie was just like the beginning: documenting the uninspiring life of washed up superheros. However, they just couldn't help themselves and the film's final act devolves into the typical kind of nonsense I've come to expect from Marvel movies. It almost seems like a different film at the end from the one that started.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity to make a true statement and break the mould of superhero movies (a rare thing indeed in today's world of movies by corporate committee). While ""Logan"" is entertaining and certainly worth watching, I was reminded of the 2016 film ""Midnight Special,"" which also features a strange young child on the run, and perhaps does a better job of it."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","30 July 2017"," Succeeds because it makes you care, and gives the viewer grit and consequences
","This film has had a lot of praise, and I think most of it is deserved. However there is an element where comic book movies generally are not consistently interesting or engaging enough, so whenever one comes along that offers a bit more then we go for it; certainly I know I have enjoyed some of them more than they probably warranted on this basis. With Logan it is that there are consistent touches of maturity, character, and plotting which make it something that I actually cared about. There was scope for much more of this, and it was a shame the characters did not have more quiet moments in between the violence, but there were enough to make us feel for the characters and their relationships.<br/><br/>I am not sure that the father/daughter side of things plays out as impacting as it could have, but certainly the relationship between Logan and Xavier is rewarding in its moments. These elements add to a feeling of grit, hopelessness, and grind, which the characters fit and the film embraces. I particularly enjoyed the consequences, the action had heft and impact and major characters suffer and die as it goes ahead. I will borrow a line from another commenter and say that the action scenes are justified or ""earned"" by this base, because they don't just feel like mindless spectacle (even if they are very well done).<br/><br/>While Logan is not as good as the high praise suggests, it does offer a lot of darkness, character, violence, engagement, and entertainment – very much worth seeing and it does stand above what the majority of this genre is doing."

The glory days of the mutants are long gone, as are most of the mutants. It falls on Wolverine to save a kid, a mutant created by humans.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is superb, as is Patrick Stewart. The little girl who plays the young mutant does a great job too. The film is violent, graphically so. This movie is to the XMen franchise what 'MacCabe&Mrs Miller' was to the Western - a deconstruction of the genre.<br/><br/>One of the better XMen films certainly. Worth watching."
"abhijeetsharma92","7","4","8","16 July 2017"," Let the new game begin!
","Logan is one of the warmest superhero movies I have seen. James Mangold, who is known for extracting some really heartwarming movies like CopLand (Sylvestor Stallone's finest performance), Girl,Interrupted (Angelina Jolie won an Oscar) & Walk The Line (Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give outstanding performances) and also thrillers like Identity (mind boggling thriller), 3:10 to Yuma (remake of a classic western) & Knight and Day (Tom Cruise all the way), makes a movie that possesses both these qualities in equal proportion. It seems that the 'blue potion' helps unleash the Wolverine out of Logan giving us one of the most dynamic characters in the Marvel series.<br/><br/>Logan is about this junkie cab driver whose past does not seem to let him go. The movie LOGAN shows us how sometimes even a super hero has to deal with his inner demon. The movie revolves around the impeccable character Wolverine and his undefined love for Professor X and the new mutant Laura (Dafne Keen). The chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart is to die for making this superhero franchise a more human touch.  The movie in many parts is inspired by one of the classiest Western movie ""SHANE"" (A highly recommended movie by Chapter 8). Much like Shane, this movie also defines the untold duties of a man and his quest to differentiate between right and righteous. The new mutant played by Dafne Keen has risen hopes for all the fans and to look forward for the next X-Men movie.Hugh Jackman has really molded the character of Wolverine as per his convenience and it is difficult to see any other actor play this 'lone wolf'. The story focuses more on the next generation mutants who look out for Logan as the guiding force. The action sequences are spot on, and it is the claws that bring out the real wolf in Wolverine. The best part was the director's little references to X-Men comics and when the cross becomes the 'X' symbolizing X-Men at the end of the story."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","4","8","30 March 2017"," Logan the Personal
","Let me start by saying that ""Logan"" is my first favorite movie from 2017. And let me continue by saying that you should not read this review if you have not seen the film yet as it will be full of spoilers to an extent where the normal message up there is not enough and I would like to put special emphasis on this. Now lets go: James Mangold returns from the 2013 film ""Wolverine"" here and I think he did a really good job as this film never drags despite a runtime of over 2 hours and 15 minutes. It's probably still not my favorite from him (""Walk the Line""), but this should not take away anything from his effort. You will not really see too many familiar faces in this one except Jackman and Stewart. As for Stewart, there is one quote from him about mortality and this is a theme that fits the entire movie. Everybody keeps dying here, the good guys, the bad guys and the longer it goes the more you wonder if Logan will get out of it alive. The wolf has gone gray and he only has two friends left with whom he is arguing all the time. For example what I just said also applies to an innocent family of Black people and the dad is a perfect example of how hate towards the mutants is fueled, even if you cannot blame Jackman's character really for anything that happened to this family. It's all humans causing it with their decisions.<br/><br/>This film has many parallels to other quality films like Léon The Professional (check my review title), Mad Max, Children of Men and this reminded me repeatedly of the child soldiers from the James Cameron television show ""Dark Angel"", a personal favorite. The ""Logan"" title cannot be coincidence right? Holbrook also reminded me a bit of Ames White with the Nazi-resembling race references, but if you know DA, you will see the similarities in general. Anyway, for fans of this series, it's probably the closest we're ever getting of a Dark Angel film with Cameron focusing on all these Avatar sequels right now. Now back to ""Logan"": If there is anything negative to say about this film, then maybe that the child soldier reference was not always working, but still this one also provided really touching scenes at the very end of the film and honestly the X grave was a stroke of genius and a perfect final shot. Also kinda fitting and cool that he can only be killed by his alternate self. It was a sad ending, but also an uplifting one with the next generation of mutants (and with the girl Wolverine left us) going out into the world. Johnny Cash song during the credits doesn't hurt either. Oh yeah and the pain from Stewart's character's brain was done so well you could feel it even in the theater. It is certainly a pretty depressing movie, but this also makes it really authentic I believe. There are very rare moments of situational comedy in there, like the fat kid being too fat to run and gets caught, but it's nowhere near the surface. This film delivers in 10 other areas much more than in comedy.<br/><br/>I think I have only seen the very first X-Men film apart from this one here, so even as somebody who is not a fan of the series (but likes superhero movies), it's easy to appreciate this one. Huge fans will probably love it. I think it is impressive how this series is still going so strong after 20 years almost and it was the perfect decision back then to cast the entirely unknown Hugh Jackman for the part as he is a vital ingredient why this film was such a triumph, with critics as well as audiences. I like him a lot and I am certainly biased, but it's hard to disagree with his craft after seeing this movie. Will there be another? Unlikely. I just hope that the fate of Wolverine's character does not go in hand with the fate of Jackman's as you keep reading so frequently about his fight with skin cancer. ""Logan"" also includes a great deal of action which was among the more forgettable parts for me, but there's enough people who like it, so it's all good. And after all with this runtime, people like me also get a great deal of character development and drama besides the special effects. So there are more reasons to see this film than I could actually mention here. You totally do not want to miss out. Check it out now!"

","Logan(Jackman, truly understanding the role that made him a star off Broadway too) is faced with helping a young female mutant who's having trouble with her powers. So it ends in much the same way it began. He's also taking care of Xavier(Stewart, grumpy and foul-mouthed, and we love it, but still some hope left). They're both dealing with aging, losing control of their abilities. The next generation need their protection. One last ride.<br/><br/>Third time's the charm. As close as the second solo outing got, this is what we've wanted from Wolverine right from when we saw him cage-fighting. And with X-23, or Laura(played to perfection by the incredibly talented young Keen), the torch is passed. The way is paved for the X-Force, as well as the New X-Men. This is a slow burn, and a road movie. The action is amazing, using the R-rating for the ferocity and brutality that is called for, never gratuitously. There is not as much of it as in other entries in the series, and if you're not that interested in the characters this studies, you probably won't be that compelled to watch this. You can go into this blind.<br/><br/>This has a lot of strong language, and brief nudity, in addition to what I've already described. I recommend this to anyone who even considers themselves a little bit of a fan. 8/10"

","I was so eager to see the movie because of its all positive reviews, but boy, how misguided was I feeling when it turned out to be nothing that I expected. The film sets 12 years in the future where are no mutants born in over two decades, aging and alcoholic Logan tries to get along driving his limo and together with the albino mutant tracker Caliban taking care of Professor X somewhere in Mexico. Logan is supposed to take the young girl Laura Kinney to a refuge called Eden. But then the bio-tech firm Alkali-Transigen's head security comes and tries to take Laura, who turns out to be a blood clone of Logan, one of many other clones that are now in hiding. with today's technology and yesterday's music nothing gives the feeling that this is the future.<br/><br/>All the forced cursing and unnecessary slaying of humans is just hard to watch. The X-men never was like this. In the fighting scenes Laura Kinney, played by fresh face Dafne Keen, sure does well all the already clichéd typical Marvel manoeuvres, just like little Black Widow. When she finally starts to talk, all I felt was embarrassed by the lacking quality of her acting. Naturally Logan is a jerk, but when the only character I felt any compassion for is Caliban, played by Stephen Merchant, I knew I'm not getting what I'm looking for. The bad guys are weak, and not even the ending didn't make me feel any sympathy for the lead characters. The simple plot is just a weak attempt to imitate the great story of the Old Man Logan comic book. The emotions I was feeling watching the film were boredom, frustration and anger. There just aren't any grounds for all the praise, whatsoever. Logan is just a perfect example of another overrated Marvel movie, right there beside Deadpool and Guardians Of The Galaxy films."

","First of all, I need to say that this film is so over-rated that it fooled me to watch it at my local cinema, instead of watching it online just like the other 99% of the films that I watched. I can not say that it is a waste of time or money to watch it at the cinema, but the film is nott good, it is not bad either, it is just moderate, just another action cliché movie that meets no more than 65% of my total respect. H.J. plays Wolverine as he used us, so perfect I mean. If it wasn't for him, I don't know how it could be. The final X-Men movie is so boring and commercial, with some, I have to agree, good scenes. Good, not memorable, not perfect ! The filming angles are so...ordinary...Not a single scene was shot from a different good angle so that it may stay in my memory or something. It was filmed just like another commercial film... The first half of the film made me think this requires no more than a 6 rate, but the other half was better, in other words, for my point of view, the action and the thrill both started about when they met those farmers and so on. I don't know, it is my opinion, but the end started to be epic, I mean the chase in the woods, just like the first Wolverine film started (I was thinking wow they had a brilliant idea, ending it the same how it started, with Logan running in the forest and fighting some soldiers, but the scene with him being buried by children was very embarrassing for such a hero as Wolverine). Another big issue that may have changed my opinion and could have made this film better was that it has almost no good music in fighting/drama scenes... To end, I can say that Logan is about on the 3th, maybe even on the 4th place on my X-men films list."

","Logan is probably the most hyped X-Men film of all time and I promise you this film will not only meet your hype but downright break your expectations.This is a searing epilogue to the character of Wolverine and a swan song for Hugh Jackman after 17 years of playing this legendary role.Logan is not only in my opinion the best marvel superhero film ever,arguably this is the best superhero film ever as well.I know in terms of technical ability Dark Knight might just edge Logan out but in terms of enjoyment this is an experience that is yet to be matched by a superhero film.It's brutal and merciless and when I say say brutal and merciless I MEAN IT.I mean we all knew that it was a R-Rated film but nothing can prepare you for the hell that will unleash upon.I don't care what people will say but Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewert are Oscar worthy in this film.This is most probably the first film where Hugh Jackman was challenged as an actor to play Wolverine and sadly it's his last.After 17 years of playing this role he knew everything about the character like the back of his hand but in this movie he had to portrait a person not a hero.It was gritty,brutal and downright gut wrenching.And can we talk about X-23 now?BEST SIDE KICK EVER!!!!!In fact she is much more bad ass than Wolverine.Wolverine is very worn out in this film.We see that the world has taken it's toll on him so,he doesn't fight too often but when he does you'll feel sorry for the guy who's gonna fight him.But when Wolverine isn't using his claws to slice up wholesale meat it's X-23 who does it and HOLY Crap!It's brutal and Awesome.Dafne Keen plays the role of X-23 and before going into this film I was kind of skeptical cause she's a kid and we all know kids in Hollywood movies are always the weak link.Can someone just slap me now for thinking that?She knocks it out of the park.I don't know if she'll feature in any future X-men films or not but I'd give anything to see her in this role.Let's talk about the action,Probably the one of the best action film of the decade and not just because it utilizes it's R-Rating brilliantly,The fight sequences are genuinely well choreographed.It's absolutely insane. Is it a perfect film?No,it's not.Do I give one ounce of crap?No,I don't.It's the most fun I've had watching a superhero film and that's the only thing that matters."

The film follows Logan as a limo driver trying to support himself and Charles Xavier as they live in an abandoned factory a couple of miles from the border to the U.S. in Mexico. One day a mutant girl (X- 23/Laura) finds her way into the lives of the two men as she is being chased down by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce, and the man Pierce is working for Dr. Rice. Soon Logan and Charles are sucked into the situation and take it upon themselves to protect Laura by any means necessary and getting her to safety.<br/><br/>""Logan"" might be the most realistic and mature superhero film that has ever been made. It's really hard to categorize this film under the superhero genre because the film is so grounded. There are no big budget explosions or people wearing spandex suits, this is an in your face film about what happens to superheroes when they are no longer superheroes. Logan is a heavy drinker and is slowly losing his healing ability and his powers are slowly draining. Charles Xavier has violent seizures which cause tremors and has lost all hope in what he is and was. This is a very depressing film where there is no glimmer of hope in these characters, all hope is basically lost.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the film where Logan fights off these gangbangers trying to jack his limo is not only awesome and violent but very depressing. You see Logan struggling with his powers and getting his butt kicked around a lot, even though he comes out victorious there's no feeling of relief or success. The Wolverine we know and love is gone, he's not making sarcastic jokes, or buffing up his ego. All of that is gone and all that is left is a broken man.<br/><br/>The acting is spot on. Jackman and Stewart do their finest works in this film and Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 was great, she is a very talented little girl. Boyd Holbrook as Pierce did a very good job, he was very cool and calm, and brought so much life to the character. Stephen Merchant as Caliban was so great in the film. You felt so much empathy for his character and it wouldn't have been the same without Merchant's performance and the fantastic writing and character development. <br/><br/>The film has a lot of action, blood, and gore. This is a very unconventional superhero film in that the action is very grounded there aren't any explosions and most of the action heavily relies on the hand to hand combat the characters face. The opening scene of the film just shows the grisly violence it has in store for us. It was just awesome to watch, I still have goosebumps thinking about it.<br/><br/>James Mangold returning to direct this film did such a fantastic job at it. He really created a Western drama disguised as a superhero film and it very much does feel like a Western. Mangold's vision for the film was spot on, it just shows how far gone the world is and the state the characters are in. Mangold directed the previous solo Wolverine film ""The Wolverine"" (2013) which I found to be quite underrated, Mangold did a good job with that film took what worked best about it and brought it to ""Logan"".<br/><br/>""Logan"" in my opinion is the best superhero film that has ever been made. It tackles so many themes in the superhero genre that haven't been touched upon or even noted and does it masterfully. Mangold's direction and Jackman's performance is what really brings this film together and in the end the best portrayal of the Wolverine."
"Thekeybaldemasterrises","10","6","14","3 March 2017"," I went back to the theater immediately to see it again. Not joking!!!
","Out of all the superhero movies coming in 2017 Logan was actually one of the few that sounded pointless to me. The X-Men franchise has been around for so long and it's run out of steam on many occasions as we well know. The last Wolverine outing for me was just meh. It wasn't great, but it wasn't X-men origins horrible either. It was just OK for me. My first impression was, ""Do we really need ANOTHER solo Wolverine?"" Let me tell you right now in case this review gets a little long, YES! It's not the movie we deserve but the movie we needed Dark Knight style. It's interesting because when the first trailer came out I thought it looked different but knowing that James Mangold would be directing I expected it to be more of the same as The Wolverine. I started hearing people talk about it and I would read interviews with Jackman, Stewart, and Mangold about the process of making the film. I learned more about what they hoped to achieve for it would most likely be Jackman's last performance as the character. It peaked my interest and I became a little more curious about what the Wolverine had cooking up for his last film. I had so many questions, what happened to everyone? Did saving the future really matter anymore? Why is Logan starting to show his true age? And quite frankly, when you get your answers you sometimes wish you didn't. This movie is grim, harsh, and unforgiving. It's a world where the X-men is all said and done, and mutants are dying out. Logan and Charles are at the end of their rope, they're war veterans that we recognize but act completely different from what we seen before. Both men dying slowly as the world just seems a little less bright. Until a light at the end of the tunnel, and we're introduced to X-23. A young mutant who shares strangely similar powers to Logan, and comes seeking their help to find her fellow mutants in their safe haven. As dark forces pursue X-23, Logan is brought back into the world of the X-men has he takes one last ride to help X-23, and to more importantly help himself. First and foremost huge props to James Mangold, his crew, and Fox for taking a huge creative risk with this movie. I'm going to assume Deadpool's success had a part to play in this because the R rating is totally used to it's advantage and it's brutal. You get to see Wolverine shred people to bits, and it's terrifyingly awesome. The movie has a dark and grim feeling where you really feel you're taking a harsh journey with these characters, but it never misses an opportunity to have a little fun with it. The cast just does a wonderful job holding their own and keeping the audience engaged despite the lack of action scenes. Which proves why X-men movies work when they take a more character driven focus(I'm looking at you Apocalypse). You want to see why everything's the way it is, you want Logan to survive, you want to know the dynamics of it all. X-23 will more than likely be a leading star in future films, and respectfully so. There's never a dull moment with her on screen, half of it she's just silent yet you still feel the emotional baggage she carries with her just as much as Logan and Charles. I'm trying so hard to find what I didn't like about the movie and I guess if I had to pick the weakest point, is the reveal of the true antagonist in the film. It almost seems unnecessary to force connections to previous movies but it didn't completely change my opinion of it overall. The movie set out to gave Logan an ending and did that, and arguably more. I'll have to be honest, this movie really hit me hard. To know that this his last movie after all these years, they didn't back down. I really felt stressed at times watching it because I wanted to know what happens next, and you know the movie really did a fantastic job when you're bawling before the credits even roll. I was so floored by my first screening that I immediately went back to the theater an hour later to watch it again. I'm not exaggerating this really was that good. Major congratulations and thanks to Mr. Hugh Jackman for bringing this character to life for the last 17 years. I grew up with the original trilogy and I just always remember always wanting to be like Wolverine, and you had those plastic claws from Toys R Us swinging them around the house. It's a shame to see him go especially when there are so many opportunities for him to show up again now that we have a successful Avengers franchise, as well as a new Deapool series along the way. I would encourage Ryan Reynolds to keep trying to convince Hugh to at least shoot a scene with him for the sequel, but I understand his reasons for leaving. It's definitely inevitable that somehow Fox will want to continue using Wolverine in future films but it's really hard to imagine anyone else replace Hugh, they've got big shoes to fill if that''s the case. Logan is without a doubt not just a great X-Men, or superhero movie. It's a fantastic movie in itself. So brutal and emotional you can see the passion and effort Hugh Jackman and company put into it if it's really his last one. if you're turned off by violence I would skip it of course. But the themes, the story really ends our pal Wolvie on a bittersweet but satisfying note, it deserves to be seen. I'm calling it now, it'll be the best superhero movie this year. It will set a high standard for comic book movies in the many years to come."
"aniseprakash","9","6","14","3 March 2017"," A must watch for Hugh Jackman and the plot.
","Set in the future and no proper time explained (Might be 2029) Logan is one of the bests of the franchise. Who knows this movie might change the future of the superhero movies as well. Logan unlike other super hero movies is emotional, moving and plot centric.<br/><br/>From scene one the movie takes the audience in and one might want to watch it without interruption. The aging of the Logan and the emotional bond between the lead characters are surprising and moving as well. Laura's character was a great add and one would fall in love with her. The film gave us a different, but great super hero movie experience.<br/><br/>The aging of Logan was evident from scene one. When he struggles to get rid of the thieves who are after his car, Logan indicates that we are to watch a different Wolverine. His life moves on with tired days and Charles by his company (Off course Alcohol). Though he is old, his action scenes are brutal as ever (Age <18 better stay away), Laura adds more cruelty to it.<br/><br/>As mentioned Laura is a great add to the finale. Her character is the core of the plot and sheds surprises at times. Charles being in the back seat sends emotional shivers throughout and advises Logan as usual.<br/><br/>Cast performance: Hugh Jackman is aware that this is his last outing as Logan and has ruled the screen. He excels in action scenes and equally in the emotional scenes. His expressions are standalone. This movie will go as one of his bests in his career.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney is my favorite in the movie. She is a great find for the Hollywood industry. With her fast movements in the action scenes and exceptional acting she is going to give a tough competition for the actors/actresses of her age.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart as Charles has done what is needed for his character and he does it with perfection. Richard as the antagonist is terrifying. His acting might go behind Logan still he manages to threaten as the villain.<br/><br/>Direction: This is James Mangold's second directorial in the Wolverine franchise. He didn't bother to put his protagonist as a week and emotional superhero; he has succeeded in doing so. His love for westerns has given a different shade to Logan which is great to watch as well. His direction gets life with John Mathieson's camera and Marco Beltrami's music.<br/><br/>On the whole Logan is a different superhero movie and a must watch for Hollywood lovers (No need to be a superhero lover)."
"paulijcalderon","10","6","14","1 March 2017"," Beautiful and emotional swansong
","I'm emotionally devastated right now. I'm a fan of the ""X-Men"" saga and I heard this was Hugh Jackman's swansong to the character of Wolverine. Meaning he intends this to be his final time playing that part. And plus he is caring for a weak and humble Patrick Stewart. So I was already invested and a bit emotional going in because I got sad seeing these two characters in this state. These are people I care for and I feel like I know them at this point. There's been so many films with them and it all lead up to this moment. I wasn't sure if I was ready for it, but I went in and... It exceeded my expectations. I loved it. I'm not gonna spoil anything because I think you should see. I don't even know what to write really, I'm really speechless.<br/><br/>This is a film that dares to go the extra mile and I applaud them for making an honest humble story and not this big extravaganza. Here the story and characters come first before all the action. Which I gotta say, The action was fantastic. It's extremely brutal and violent. Patrick Stewart gives a heartbreaking performance that's full of range. He is funny, crazy and wise. You feel really bad for him and seeing him be happy and remind Logan of the good values in life really got me. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal. This is ""THE"" performance from him.<br/><br/>It's a tragic movie too. A lot of scenes actually made me teary eyed. There's so much in this that broke me that I'm still unable to shake the emotions off. This film is something special. I will say that this is the first time I've seen an entire audience stay until the credits ended. Why you ask? Well, because everyone was waiting for a Post-credit scene. There is no extra scene at the end, so you don't have to wait. Some guys started booing because there was nothing extra. I usually stay for the credits, but I don't think this movie needed an extra scene. It's perfect as it is. One negative I can find is that villain was stock. There's not much to him.<br/><br/>That's it for now. I could talk about this film for hours, but I would have to go into Spoiler territory. My overall thoughts are that I think it's phenomenally exciting and heartbreaking. Go watch it."

"steverolfe","5","5","11","25 August 2017"," Nothing like previous X men films - bitterly disappointing
","Perhaps my expectations were high, but I found this film very disappointing. The previous films in the x-men series had great acting, interesting story lines, and believable action. This film had shocking dialog, way too much swearing (not that i'm a prude, but it was totally out of character for all the actors) and took so long to get to the point, it became boring. Yes, there was action, but so far fetched it was terrible. Hugh Jackman is such a great actor, he must have felt pretty betrayed by this movie as it did him no favours at all. Still, if you're an x-men fan, you'll probably want to watch it as it will help with some closure, but don't expect too much."
"cdjh-81125","8","5","11","6 August 2017"," The Legacy of A Legend
","Logan isn't really what I'd call a superhero movie it's more of a neo-western meets a road trip movie meets a family drama and it worked exceptionally. I was not as excited for this movie as much as everyone else, the trailers just weren't truly speaking to me but the final product absolutely did and is one of the most bittersweet movies I've ever viewed. <br/><br/>The direction they took the character of Logan in this film was not something I had expected, we've seen him at his absolute lows and his points where he was truly without hope but never like this, we've never seen him suicidal with absolutely nothing left to fight for and it made his arc in the film all the more satisfying. To see him Ben forced back into helping someone one last time but in himself old and weakened state was at times hard to watch but at the same time very captivating knowing that this truly is his last fight. Another character who's direction surprised me with the direction that they took was that of Charles Xavier, to see someone we've seen be a beacon of hope and an inspirational figure as a now weak and frail old man was not what I signed on for when I started watching this movie but i greatly admired what they did here, to see him in a light we've never seen before truly showed us that this film was going to be different. <br/><br/>As much as I was excited to see Hugh Jackman play his signature role for the final time I was saddened by the fact I would never see him take up the claws again but Jackman absolutely nailed it one final time. He brought a real harshness, sickly and vulnerable presence to this performance in both a physical and a emotional way, he truly gave one of the greatest performances ever in a comic book movie. The same can be said for Patrick Stewart one gave such a heartbreaking performance that often left me saddened yet captivated by the complete commitment to his final performance as this character. Newcomer Dafne Keen absolutely held her own in this movie in a very physical performance match with her great chemistry with Jackman and Stewart. <br/><br/>I've never been an advocate of R-Rated comic book films, or for any film really, I just don't like the idea of needless violence and excessive language being put into a film needlessly but I truly loved how this film used its R-Rating. It made truly apparent that this was different from any of the other films in the franchise, it made it feel much more gritty and real and allowed director James Mangold to take the action to its full extent by fully exploiting the capabilities of the titular characters powers, this film is plenty bloody and violent but is used as a tool to show the reality of the situation for its characters and against all my worries was not something I found to be an unnecessary addition to this film. <br/><br/>Like I said this film isn't like other comic book movies, it has a real slowness to it as well as a good heart and grit. Plenty of scenes are devoted to simply interaction among characters and their conversations all of which feel like valuable conclusions and added something to this movie. Is definitely one of the more slow paced films of this franchise but never feels boring or uninteresting as it's full of characters we've come to know and love which makes it feel more valuable knowing that it is there final few hours of screen time. <br/><br/>I don't think this is a perfect movie, I did have a few issues with it. For one the villains, I really enjoyed Boyd Holbrook in this movie he was a very charismatic character he wasn't very deep but he had a nice presence to him that made him enjoyable as a character. The same cannot be said for Xander Rice or The Reavers, I found them to be extremely conventional and generic. The Reavers were expendable foot soldiers who only served to see Jackman and Keen in full R-Rated fashion. Rice was a fairly bland character who had iffy motivations and didn't really do anything of consequence on screen. <br/><br/>I also found the last act to be a bit mixed, now the last 10 minutes were incredibly, extremely emotionally fulfilling material, but before that felt very rushed, as if the filmmakers had established so many plot lines that they desperately needed to wrap up before the film ended. I didn't particularly care for the new characters they introduced here and felt like a bit an underwhelming addition. <br/><br/>While it's not my favourite if the X-Men franchise it is most definitely the most emotionally satisfying and fulfilling. It had a nice heart and message, fantastic action, performances and character arcs that truly wrapped up the character of Wolverine in a masterful fashion that made me realise just how much a cherish the characters of the franchise and how much I'll miss them now that they time is at an end. <br/><br/>8.8/10: A- (Fantastic)"
"msbreviews","9","5","11","6 August 2017"," Rating: A
","Well, if you're thinking this is just another typical X-Men or cliché superhero movie ... You're seriously wrong. Of all the comic- book movies I've seen, I dare to say this is the one that I can finally call a goddamn DRAMA. Plus, this time it's rated R! Thank you Deadpool, I honestly hope that we'll have more films like this in the future.<br/><br/>The very first scene instantly transports us to a different tone that we're not used to seeing in this type of films. It's darker, gritty, bloody, gruesome, grisly, did I mention bloody? There are so many scenes that just stuck to my memory, I constantly jaw-dropped at almost every single action scene. AWESOME! Excellent direction by James Mangold, the quick cuts worried me at the beginning, but it's almost flawless. As for the action, this movie nails it and surpassed the already huge hype that it had. Best action from the whole  X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman ... It's an epic goodbye. As always, he's magnificent which I already expected before entering the theater. I mean, it's a character that he's been playing for almost 20 years, it's a routine that he knows from scratch, but this one is really the best from him.  A very different Logan and he nailed it perfectly. Patrick Stewart is great as always and this time he's even funnier than Hugh Jackman! However, the real surprise is Dafne Keen (Laura), who plays the extraordinary kid. She's able to connect with the audience without saying a SINGLE WORD until the beginning of the third act. Honestly, she reminded me of Millie Bobby Brown's powerful performance of Eleven on Stranger Things. She's that good. Marvel just keeps getting the casting right, again and again, every single time.<br/><br/>I can't and I won't tell you much about the story. What I can say is that this is definitely the most emotional and captivated that I've ever been in an X-Men movie. The ending is as perfect as it can be and the movie is honestly more than I expected it to be. It surpassed the hype surrounding it and I can only congratulate James Mangold for the brilliant work.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect as a whole (none is) even if it has a lot of perfect action scenes and performances. The pacing drops to a slow-burn in the second act (the least great of the three ... still great, though) and, don't get me wrong, it is needed and it's well compensated later in the movie, but it still dragged on for a little too much. The villain worked for the plot, I don't have that many problems with him even if I did expect more from him. A few exposition scenes, in the beginning, explaining the origins and purpose of some important backstory nagged me a bit, I think they had the possibilities and means to achieve a better way to explain everything (as they did in some other situations throughout the film) without recurring to an iPhone video.<br/><br/>All of these are minor issues because Logan is f*cking AWESOME! The bloodiest X-Men movie ever, the best X-Men action scenes ever and the best Hugh Jackman in all of the franchise: this is the best film from the X-Men universe. An emotional DRAMA, with powerful performances from both main and supporting actors, a beautiful ending and an epic journey that now (supposedly) ends. Thank you, Hugh Jackman.

","I'm gonna be completely truthful and tell you that this wasn't a movie I was interested in watching at all at first. I just put it on for background noise while I went around cleaning and cooking. But guess whose jaw slowly dropped when they looked up and guess who ended up giving up on cleaning about a few minutes in. *raises hand*<br/><br/>I applaud the performance given by all the actors in this film and I'm extremely excited for any of Keene's future performances. That little girl is special and she's gonna blow the roof off of any role she ends up playing. <br/><br/>Every one of the actors took a piece of my heart and kept me invested in them, the character development and character dynamics were complex and real. Laura was pint-sized child that held all the fury and fists of a grown man, fiercely loyal and bloodthirsty. Professor X's ailing disease turned him bitter but at the root of him you still saw the compassion and caring professor that had always been around. And Wolverine, man, I applaud the performance of this character. Jackman really blew me away; Wolverine was so complex and riveting and I'm sad to say I don't have enough words to explain how amazing it was. I have to applaud the writers for this as well. <br/><br/>This was truly a masterpiece. It seems as if Hollywood is really getting it's act together. This film was unflinching raw; it grabs you by the throat and doesn't shy away from showing you it's dark world.<br/><br/>I was in for one heck of a ride and I didn't even know it."
"philday44","3","5","11","30 June 2017"," Another example of where the writer/director are out of touch with the audience
","Good stand alone movie, but cliché as a stand alone movie. Nothing new here as a stand alone movie. I don't believe the writer/director are in touch with the audience for this kind of movie. Superhero movies are about the characters and the characters don't die, they always come back. Good overcomes evil and that is the basis for superhero movies. This is not a superhero movie but an over dramatized look at the burdens of a superhero. So let's get real, people that like these movies want to see a hero exploit his superpowers for good. The don't want to see a superhero whine over and over about how bad it is to be superstrong. Just watch the first Hulk movie and how bad the review were. So much drama. So in this movie, the director throws in a lot of blood and violence I guess because he believes the audience is going to like it. Not really. Deadpool was fun to watch because of the comedy Ryan Reynolds brings to the scene. This movie was depressing from every angle. Just not a good superhero movie. Sad to see the two lead characters retire their roles in a poof of dust rather than go out blazing. Watch as a rental or on Netflix, but don't waste too much time. DC and Marvel universe have outpaced the wolverine saga, with story lines that are fantastic. This is a waste of time in comparison. Hugh Jackman was a great X-Men, but sadly he has failed in the last two solo movies to deliver the kind of epic superhero movie that could have rocked."

","Wow! what a show. The standard of this movie is threefold higher than the previous PRE-2011 X-men Movies. Its worth watching more than twice (if you have a free 2hrs slot). LOGAN is packed with action, drama and unexpected twists. It portrayed the life struggles of the Wolverine (Logan) and Professor X that I can connect with and able to understand their pain that they had to go through as the last remaining mutants in the world. The action scenes were violent, realistic, and graphically detailed unlike the previous PRE-2011 X- men movies which were more suitable for younger audiences. To me, this should be the standard of most X-men/ Wolverine movies one that portrays real-life struggle, pain, emotional hardship, mental suffering, and graphic death scenes. I also like how they use classic X-men comics to demonstrate the differences of real world X-men and fictional figures. A very good closure for both Professor X and Wolverine."

","Logan is brilliant, everyone who helped make this movie needs credit, because every little thing about this movie is amazing, well done by the the cast, the directors and the writers.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10<br/><br/>This movie is about old man Logan, which is about Logan slowly dying because the Adamantium on his bones is poisoning him. While Logan is slowly dying, Professor Xavier meets a little girl, Laura/X-23 who was sent by a doctor who worked at the weapon X program in Mexico, the doctor promised to give Logan money to send Laura to a secret location where all the escaped children from the weapon X program would meet and escape. Surprisingly I didn't find any plot holes, so bravo James Mangold.<br/><br/>Characters 10/10<br/><br/>Logan: Hugh Jackman did an excellent job, he made Logan look like he was hopeless and broke, and that's what actors are supposed to do to roles like these.<br/><br/>Charles Xavier: Patrick Stewart played just as well as Hugh Jackman, he made Charles Xavier look so broken and aged, great job.<br/><br/>Laura: Laura is a clone of Logan, she is made up Logan's DNA which means she has the same powers as Logan.<br/><br/>Donald Pierce: To be honest Donald Pierce isn't a strong bad guy, he's always hiding behind people and doesn't look that independent, but Boyd Holbrook did have some acting skills.<br/><br/>Action 10/10<br/><br/>The action in Logan is brutal, it's down to earth bloody and violent, which is exactly why this movie is a 10/10, if this movie didn't have that type of violence it would be an average superhero movie and that's what made Deadpool so great. All of the action in this movie is combat, just Logan and Laura going all out in brutally fashion.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing, most movies rely on the action to make the movie a bit more successful, but this movie doesn't need it, the acting and the X-23 story is great, they couldn't have done a better job."

","This movie is not doing X-man movies any justice. Putting James Manglod as director was a bad choice. I would much rather see what Bryan Singer would do with it.<br/><br/>No regard for previous movies, lots of story flaws, bad writing, poor villains (if you can even call it that as they just seem as some big corporation's security), poor story etc..<br/><br/>What happened to the other x-men? no proper explanation. Why would wolverine ride a limo to make some cash to disappear on boat? The girl seem very cold at first and at some point for no obvious reason, she turns and even call wolverine dad? I thought adamantium in his body supposed to be the last one there is and suddenly there is this clone who seems to be full of it, coming from nowhere... Also, why would adamantium suddenly started to kill his body(for years it made him stronger) when he is suppose to be immortal? Even stretched, it doesn't make much sense to me..<br/><br/>He also wasn't suppose to age( wolverine origins), yet in here he is old and SICK!!! X-men movies suppose to be fantasy, comic book movie therefore we don't need for characters to age and die.<br/><br/>Bunch of trained mutant kids with special abilities running from regular people with guns? I don't think so...<br/><br/>Both deaths of main characters were complete disappointment. Professor dies in bed and wolverine is pierced with piece of wood? Really? Why did he then carry that adamantium bullet at all? (especially when in previous movie it has only made him loose his memory)<br/><br/>Before someone mentions comic books, remember that not everyone read them and it is just BASED on comic books. It doesn't follow them to the dot(and don't have to)<br/><br/>I believe days of future past happened in 2023(in some kind of space) and this movie is 2029 in normal age again? like I said complete disregard for previous movies.<br/><br/>This movie didn't come full circle with other movies as some critics put it. It had a great potential, there was so many ways the movie could go after previous instalments, but this seems to be one of the worse option. As a standalone movie it could get a pass, but not as a part of franchise... this completely ruined the experience for me.<br/><br/>I wish they would make another movie which would properly close the franchise and actually gave it some justice. <br/><br/>But this time let Bryan Singer or Gavin Hood do the directing PLEASE!!!"

","As if Marvel felt a dire need to drop their legacy of family friendly superhero movies and jump on the current bandwagon of 'realistic' and gritty movies void of any kind of morality, they went completely overboard with 'Logan', snuffing out even the tiniest ray of hope that might be gleaming on the horizon in this utterly depressing movie which not even the solid acting can save.<br/><br/>Without receiving any redeeming background information, we're thrown into some bleak near-future setting where the mutants are now almost extinct and mankind is hunting the last remaining non-government controlled mutants. Logan, for reasons unexplained now a limo driver, is possibly even more dejected and grumpy than ever, and he's lost all sense of hope and purpose. Obviously, something has happened to cause this situation, but this is never adequately explained to the viewer. We are to accept that all he cares about now is collecting money so he can get to some sort of safe haven which is vaguely hinted at but never elaborated upon. But he hasn't just lost all hope and purpose; no, he has wilfully abandoned it and spits in its face, and the viewer is made thoroughly aware of this throughout the film via his unrelentingly callous and self-centered attitude. He's apparently sick and dying,though it was hard to make out exactly why, due to the inarticulate dialogue and the film's annoying habit of not sharing any insight into any of the events that led to the depressing state of affairs the viewer finds their once-heroes in. He's also become an alcoholic,adding to the depressing tone.<br/><br/>Superheroes have lost; big pharma and global corporations are in full control. The movie is littered with F-bombs and gruesome gore, which feel totally out of place in a Marvel setting. Ultimate good guy Charles Xavier has become a weak and senile old bed-wetter, who's constantly in need of getting medication lest he destroy the world with his now degrading mind.<br/><br/>In such a dreary setting, with Logan extremely reluctantly taking on the job of bringing a little mutant girl, who escaped from a government facility out to create mutant soldiers for their dark purposes, to some sort of safe haven, the washed up superheroes receive a constant battering through chase after chase by anonymous corporate monkeys, who are out to get the mutant girl, with only Narcos' Boyd Holbrook breaking from anonymity with a charismatic performance, even though there is no information on his character at all. He's leading the chase, and that will just have to suffice for the viewer.<br/><br/>The corporate monkeys catch up with our ailing heroes at their ramshackle desert hideout, and there we discover that the girl is actually a little Logan with claws on both hands and feet, as she kills, maims and gores scores of corporate military monkeys in full glory for the viewer. No eye, skull, neck, chest or artery is safe from the little girl's fury and all that is lacking from the scene is blood dripping from the camera. They finally manage to escape by means of a clichéd freight train getting inbetween, but have to leave behind the wimpy Caliban, a mutant who has the ability to track other mutants. <br/><br/>Even though Logan reads from the medical file that he is somehow the father of the girl, which, fully in line with the movie, remains unexplored, he still treats her like an unwanted appendage, and in fact wants to leave her behind for being too much trouble, but Xavier, who goes in and out of consciousness due to the medication, somehow manages to get Logan to take the girl to her desired destination, a safe haven which Logan discovers is derived from a Marvel comic and therefore non-existent. <br/><br/>When along the way Logan, Xavier and the girl and a random family are both forced off the road by container trucks speeding autonomously on the highway, Logan and Xavier help the family and get invited to their home. With Logan and Xavier still being chased, the family where they are staying gets brutally slaughtered by a soulless,corporate Logan clone, whose existence was briefly hinted at earlier. The scene would not have been out of place in a Freddy Krueger or Halloween movie.<br/><br/>In a completely offhanded fashion, the Logan clone lethally wounds the bedridden and delirious Xavier, who dies from the wound later on and is buried by Logan in a similarly offhanded fashion. The character who is the backbone of the X-men just fizzles out, and it totally fits the tone of the movie. <br/><br/>While we know the corporation is out to eliminate the group of escaped mutant children, when these heavily armed corporate monkeys finally find and surround the children, they inexplicably opt to hold them prisoner. This obviously goes wrong, but not enough for Logan's clone to do battle with and impale Logan on the thick branch of a dead tree. As ""Death Wish"" Logan finally gets what he wants and lays dying in the final minutes of the movie, he at long last drops his grumpy self-centered attitude which the viewer had to suffer for so long.<br/><br/>Like Xavier, he too gets buried unceremoniously in some backwoods area, and as little girl Logan takes out the cross of Logan's grave and places it sideways to create the X of the X-men, the viewer is, despite the morally grey overtone and despondency and uselessness of our heroes, thus nevertheless reminded that God is still very much dead and the superheroes and accompanying philosophy are still His replacement. <br/><br/>I'm not sold on a Marvel universe turning ever more gritty and gory and full of f-bombs. The tone of this movie conflicts heavily with the established Marvel Cinematic Universe. Perhaps we can expect a Marvel movie that erases this future, or perhaps the writers expect the viewer to take Big Pharma anti-depressant medication and forget all about it."

"Wirxaw","1","5","11","18 April 2017"," Senile adventures.
","Warning - outright spoilers, as I will bring the silly and plot-crucial moments here.<br/><br/>By all means, I will agree that the movie is shot very well. Language, blood, action scenes, acting - everything is very, very solid. A real breakthrough after most of Marvel comedy.<br/><br/>So why 6\10? Because I couldn't watch this movie without twitching. Scratching my head in disbelief, wondering ""what the fancy are they doing?"" <br/><br/>-Antagonists. They seem to enjoy going out on their own. They have supermutants, cyborg soldiers, but in every situation - you'll see some top hat just standing there for... reasons. When first you see the big guy meet Logan, it gets clear that it's going down. Logan should pack his bags, pronto. And that the guy is probably bada** enough to stand up to Wolverine, since he was completely alone, completely d*ckwad and knew pretty much everything he needed. What happens next time we meet him? He is knocked out by a metal object. That's it. He's not a mutant, he's not some end boss, he's just a douche. And what is Logan's decision? Asking his indispensable tracker to... drive him away and dump him. WOW. I just sat there with my jaw open. Is that a bloody killer Wolverine's reaction to an enemy, who he knows is ""already"" going to kill him? Is that a G-level of approach undertaken in a R-rated movie? What the...<br/><br/>Of course, this... madness... Leads to the meat of this movie - tracker is used to hunt Logan, the bad guy is always there show his useless face. If he'd have killed him there, you probably wouldn't need to continue with the movie.<br/><br/>Same goes for the main scientist, who is there to kind of leash a pet, and who just stands next to armed Logan, explaining how evil he is. Wow. I thought that trope got old a couple decades ago. At least now Logan acts quickly, so the trope is kind of redundant, but the question is... Why include this character to begin with? Doesn't add anything to the movie.<br/><br/>And then the big bad wolf(erine). Was he adamantium-boned? Or was he just the same genetic offspring of Logan? His face was already pummeled by an almost point-blank shotgun blast, which didn't reveal the skull. Yet... when a an adamantium bullet is shot through Magnum - half his skull goes off. We've seen Logan survive this kind of shot before. He was mostly alright. And we don't know much about about big bad wolv. Yet suddenly this is a deus ex, a very pointless deus ex, on many levels. When all the kids combine their powers to kill a ""human"", one would wonder - why not just kill the big bad wolv? Or at least knock it out? Telekinesis, freezing - there are methods... Overall the final scene is very, very lackluster.<br/><br/>-Protagonists. Xavier sure takes his sweet time to reveal anything remotely worthwhile, making enraged Logan a protracted trend throughout the movie. Making everything a painful guess. He is shown to be able to communicate and sense mutants, yet what about tracker? What about big bad wolv? What about other kids? When they stopped at every worst corner, prompting the casino scene, the family butcher scene, I just wondered... ""why"". I think Man of Steel would cringe at the level of carelessness here. They wanted to get lost in a casino? Gee, great, with that level of hunting on them, they'd be sure to wipe out everyone in casino if need be. Of course, Logan takes his sweet time in pub, because it's not like he has barely escaped out of his own house... And, of course, the family dinner. I understand why was the plot line involved, but... why make it so incredibly dumb? If Xavier was too old to think straight, maybe Logan could've said something precise. They wasted a whole family on a stupid whim. And, of course, big bad wolv had to just stand there and listen to Xavier, to give surprise at what comes next. Except for when you think about it, he would have no reason to, besides allowing a kind of sad exposition.<br/><br/>-The Finale. I've mostly described everything, except for Logan's...well. Kids already were shown to have this weird green medicine. There were trucks around, probably carrying this stuff. Damn it, even Hishe ridiculed two of the moments I described, for good reason. Couldn't they show kids looking for the medicine? Giving at least some ""fancy"" about it? No... it was almost as stupid as Han Solo's ... well, in Episode VII.<br/><br/>So, to conclude, the movie is shot very well, very gritty and realistic. But I think the writing took some lessons from Prometheus or Gravity... for whatever reason. And it ruined some impression, as well as left an aftertaste. People compare this movie to TDK, and, frankly, not even close. No. Just... no. In the same league, perhaps, but this is a 2 hour ""wut"", not a grand movie."
"paul_haakonsen","8","5","11","15 April 2017"," An ""X-Men"" movie for the adult audience...
","Now, first and foremost I must stand forth and say that superhero movies is not my go-to pick of movies when presented with alternate choices. Why? Well, because I just don't really enjoy the superhero theme all that much. Usually, they provide nothing more than visual entertainment for me.<br/><br/>However, I will say that ""Logan"" manages to stand out in the superhero genre; a genre that is well-diluted with mediocre attempts of bringing comic book heroes to life on the big screen. ""Logan"", however, steps away from the absurdly generic mould that superhero movies tend to follow, and it is not the superhuman powers of the characters that is the drive behind the movie.<br/><br/>What makes ""Logan"" so good and entertaining, is that this is a movie intended for a mature audience, and it leaves the generic superhero archetype behind as it has been seen in most previous ""X-Men"" movies. With that being said, I will also continue on to state that ""Logan"" is actually the best of all the installments into the ""X-Men"" universe on the big screen so far.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is driven by a good story, and spiced up with good characters and good acting all around. This is also the most violent and bloody of all the ""X-Men"" movies, take it as it is, like it or dislike it - that is a personal preference, of course. I did, however, enjoy the approach and the more dark atmosphere that permeated this entire movie. It was refreshing not to see a rose-tinted superhero movie where you know that the heroes will prevail against insurmountable odds.<br/><br/>Sure, the effects in ""Logan"" are great, and they do help the movie along quite nicely.<br/><br/>I was more than genuinely surprised with how good ""Logan"" turned out to be, and this movie does have enough entertainment contents to sustain multiple viewings. My rating for ""Logan"" is 8 out of 10 stars, without a doubt. And this is a well-worthy addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise."
"littleging12","6","5","11","5 April 2017"," Old Man Slo-gan
","Early reviews of ""Logan"" had the film labeled as Marvel's Dark Knight. This brought me much excitement to hear such great things from a very anticipated movie. Then that excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I didn't come to think this film was anywhere near the excellence of ""The Dark Knight."" ""Logan"" was quite unconventional for a superhero movie as in it wasn't a superhero movie but an antihero action drama. An antihero action drama that had a hollow story, slow pacing, frustrating ambiguity, redundant action, and ineffective emotional resonance.<br/><br/>""Logan's"" standout selling point from previous X-men/superhero films was its R-rating. The R-rated action and grittiness was cool and badass through the whole first act, then it became excessive and redundant as you watch Logan continuously slice through the same bones and limbs over and over again. ""Logan"" did have similarities to 2015's best film (in my opinion) ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" in how certain characters are forced to work together to find sanctuary from pursuing bad guys. I don't think Logan had a shot at ever being as good as ""The Dark Knight"" but it could have been close to ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" with badass no-nonsense characters, insane and brutally entertaining action, road-trip-like plot with danger looming at every corner, and maybe even some emotional gravitas. ""Logan"" had the potential to match Mad Max but came up short in all of the previously mentioned areas.<br/><br/>The thing that probably bothered me the most about ""Logan"" was how bare, slowly paced, and empty the story was. The first act did a good job of setting up the story; Logan had to help a women and her daughter escape from some government agency experimenting on mutants with the help of Professor X and another mutant named Caliban. After the first act it seemed as if the story was going to be full of thrills, gore, emotion, interesting reveals of backstory and maybe even some twists. Yet, NO. What we got was a slow burner filled with the same slice 'em up action, no backstory or explanations to certain events, little to no humor, no grand set pieces, underdeveloped characters (like the main villain), and ineffective emotional appeal.<br/><br/>Let's start with the backstory. First, all the mutants are dying and this is never touched upon thoroughly as to why. There is a scene at the end where a scientists says he is the one who is responsible for the earth being eradicated of mutants. And that's all; they don't bother explaining how or why. Then there is the Westchester incident, which director James Mangold was going to shoot but decided not to as it was implied that Xavier's seizures killed all of the X-men. Wouldn't that have been an interesting, gripping, and sad start to an already planned emotional movie if that scene was filmed? The counter to that is that it would've taken away from Professor X and Wolverine's emotional send offs (more on that later). Also why is Logan dying? Is the adamantium really poisoning him or are his healing powers just weakening? The movie has no interest in explaining this. And I won't even get started with the timeline as who knows what all preceded this movie.<br/><br/>Then there was that ineffective emotional resonance. That basically means the movie didn't get me emotionally involved with the character deaths. First of all everyone knew that this was Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's last outing in their respective roles. So them dying is not much of a surprise. And the way Professor X died was just so out-of- nowhere and dreamlike that I didn't feel anything when it happened. I didn't even know for sure if he was dead because the way it was filmed gave a pretense of a dream. Logan's death was also anticlimactic in how I didn't really feel any sadness for him when he died, although maybe some relief for the character for all the trauma he was going through. So instead of feeling sadness for the departure of these characters I felt relieved because they were so broken, lost, lifeless, and without purpose.<br/><br/>""Logan"" did have some redeeming qualities like the lead acting which was as good as it gets, its badass first act, the lead villain (Pierce) who was cool yet underdeveloped, and how it was a standalone movie not concerned with sequels and spinoffs. I said it earlier and I'll say it again ""Logan"" was disappointing, nowhere near ""The Dark Knight,"" and just bereft of quality storytelling, consistent thrills, and emotional grip."
"tedd0093","9","5","11","23 March 2017"," Dramatic and perfect in every way.
","My expectations for this movie where pretty high, while the feeling i had walking out of the cinema was based in pure satisfaction. The start is setting up the later on too-old-for-this-sh*t Logan, who is driven by the existence of the former school leader and teacher Charles Xavier. The bond between him and Charles has changed a lot since the older x-men movies, and has created this humorous yet desperate feeling towards the plot. <br/><br/>As the plot unravel and we get introduced to more characters, the action holds nothing back from there on, and until the end. When I say ""holds nothing back"" I mean that this is definitely not a movie for people with weak stomachs... there is a LOT of blood-shed and a sh*t-ton of violence, but that's no minus at all, because it's executed and acted so well in every action scene there is. <br/><br/>Building up to the grand finale leaves every viewer with a lot of emotion towards the new character/characters, and ends in a way it's meant to. <br/><br/>Probably the best marvel movie with everything a superhero movie needs, while still being a very well polished dramatic experience. And that is why i'm giving it 10/10."

Maybe all they need is more Rated ""R"" versions, LOL.<br/><br/>Definitely a ""must see"" for true Wolverine Fans!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","11","6 March 2017"," What's in a name/title?
","Huge Jackman has appeared on the screen 9 times (reportedly) as ""Logan/Wolverine"". While these are primarily in the X-Men franchise, two of the spin-offs have ""Wolverine"" as their title. ""Logan"", the last of the so-called ""Wolverine Trilogy"", is only one thus titled. Intentional or not, this means something. Finally, more emphasis is given to the protagonist as a human being than as a mutant. The opening scene tells all.<br/><br/>The year is 2029, as we see Logan dozing off in a luxury car, to which he is the driver, earning a menial living. Four goons try to steal the wheels, and the usual drill ensues, but with something we have never seen before: Logan/Wolverine"" biting the dust under four common goons. Yes, the old ferocity eventually comes back culminating in a display of decapitated heads and disemboweled entrails (earning ""R"" rating for this movie). But the scenario is all too clear: even Logan cannot fight mortality. He is growing old(er) and weak(er).<br/><br/>We soon find that the case is even worse for Charles, Professor X (same old Patrick Stewart) who is pushing 90, an invalid under the care of Logan and another mutant, an albino named Caliban (Stephen). Here, I can't help wondering if the Shakespearean reference is perhaps a suggestion that Charles is an alternate version of Prospero, not powerful in old age, but a faint shadow of his former self. Furthermore, without proper medication, he gets occasional psychic seizures that has devastating effect on a radius of maybe a hundred yards: a small earthquake and people frozen in whatever they are doing (visually not unlike when Quicksilver, the speedy X-men mutant, is in action).<br/><br/>We then learn that these three are the very last mutants still in existence, the final targets for extermination to make the Earth mutant-free again. But wait, one more appears on the scene, a pre-teen girl called Laura (Dafne Keen) who turns out to be Logan's ""daughter"" under some unusual circumstances: genetically engineered mutant killer utilizing an ordinary woman's womb and Logan's DNA. This is some mad scientist's project on similarly engineered children with various genes from different mutants. However, when these children were subsequently found to be difficult to control, they were written off as a failed experiment. Laura, together with a group of children, managed to escape.<br/><br/>This sets the stage of a fugitive road movie, with the what looks like a three-generation family (Charles, Logan, Laura) constantly on the run from the villains who have captured Caliban, forcing him to serve as their tracker. Laura believes in a safe haven called ""Eden"", a theme that you may remember from a few sci-fi movies including ""I am legend"", ""28 days later"" and one of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. The trajectory becomes somewhat predictable but that does not take anything away from the appeal of this movie that is currently ranked #36 in IMDb's top 250.<br/><br/>I'll leave the best for last and start with the usual stuff. The action sequences are pleasing to watch (gore notwithstanding), leaning towards choreography rather than CGI. Making you sit straight and try hard not to blink is Laura, four-feet dynamite of a ripper, fiercest of the X-Men ever to grace the silver screen. And then, to give the time-worn Wolverine fight scene a shot in the arm is an old trick, old but still effective: give him an evil doppelganger. Those looking for the usual X-Men action should be more than satisfied.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the outset, Logan is humanized in the movie more than ever before. Very much like what we have in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2006), a touch of domesticity, apparent or real, works magic. When the fugitive trio is welcomed into one night's shelter by a humble, role model of a family, one can almost feel the warmth radiate into the entire cinema. Around the dinner table the host family talk about their prosaic daily life, as well as hopes, fears and aspiration. The protagonists recuperate, with Logan talking about his ""father's"" (Charles) school from which he has run away a few times. Even in the dark of the cinema, I could ""hear"" gleeful smiles spreading over the audience's faces. This is also the time when Laura starts to thaw and soften.<br/><br/>Spoiler or not, the end is very much predictable, a tale of sacrifice, redemption and reconciliation. In a way, it is also very much a father-daughter story, the easiest example coming to mind being the ""Taken"" series (Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace as father and daughter). Jackman, Stewart and young up-and-coming Keen all give superb performances.<br/><br/>The last words of the movie come from the conclusion of ""Shane"" (1953), Alan Ladd as the protagonist speaking to little boy Joel: ""There is no living with a killing. There is no going back from one. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand sticks. There is no going back"". Cleverly crafted, this is spoken by Laura who has memorized the lines from the movie she saw on TV in a motel room."

Oh and it's super predictable. Really? Did I see the same movie everyone's praising. Without the plot holes or inconsistencies it would be at most ""a good movie"", but with so much being wrong: it's awful."
"BA_Harrison","6","2","3","9 November 2019"," Logan buried.
","Logan (Hugh Jackman) is old and sick, living out his golden years as a limo driver. When he's not chauffeuring drunken hen parties, he's in Mexico, tending to Charles Xavier, who now suffers from dementia. After a woman called Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) comes to him looking for help, Logan unwittingly becomes the protector of a young mutant called Laura (Dafne Keen), who is being hunted by a ruthless scientist (Richard E. Grant) and his armed cronies.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold takes a decidedly different approach to this follow up to his 2013 superhero flick The Wolverine: whereas his first outing for the Adamantium-clawed X-man was pure comic book silliness, Logan goes for gritty realism. While the sombre tone is a gutsy move, Mangold's film does have a tendency to slip into over-ponderous mode as the director attempts to add depth and poignancy to his character.<br/><br/>Mangold's story also leaves much to be desired, being yet another case of young mutants persecuted by the authorities, with our ageing hero caught in the middle. Logan's character arc is easy to predict, as is the inevitable outcome, while certain elements aren't adequately explained (the drug used to keep Xavier from having seizures, the origins of the comic containing the co-ordinates of Eden). Trite as it may be, the plot at least offers up plenty of opportunity for action, which the director handles with aplomb, his R-rating allowing for lots of blood and severed body parts.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Logan is a mixture of exhilarating (brilliantly executed fight scenes) and exasperating (the uninspired plot), bringing fans some of the best the series has to offer, but also some of the worst."

That was so emotional how he opened himself up...and Logan didn't hear it and Xavier got murdered. Then Logan's death was actually heroic and sad like Xavier's. Then the action.

","Logan, easily the best movie to come out of theaters in 2017, was a well written story from the opening scene to the closing shot. The story follows Logan, one of the last two living X-Men in a time where mutants have been killed off. Through genetic manipulation done by Alkali-Transigen, many new mutants are created. One of those new mutants is Laura, a little girl with the same genetic makeup as Logan. His embarks on a journey to protect her and get her to safety at Eden, a place the children all met up to make it to safety. 
Logan's role in the film is not only Laura's guardian, but her mentor, showing her to be better than he ever could be.
The film takes you on the journey of an aging and dying Logan, attaching you to him during his struggles, knowing that it was his final film. 
The movie has the audience leaving and thinking about not only the future of the X-Men saga, but the many years that that Hugh Jackman spent playing his character, 17 years to be exact. 
Scott Frank took a very different yet successful approach to the original ""Old Man Logan"" story, giving them the chance to finish off one character and opening up another one very well but his only downfall was the seemingly quick third act, going from the death of a friend to the very end.
With this being James Mangold largest movie directed to date, his storytelling and character development shine and each scene feels involved with the camera angles and movements.
Michael McCusker's shining moment in the film was the scene where Logan goes to rescue the children from the mercenaries at the end of the film, changing from the seemingly calm patrol to the animal that Logan was becoming. 
Lastly, John Mathieson, with the role of cinematographer, balanced light very well, in what was a very dark movie. While most darker movies have a matching darker lighting, Mathieson was not afraid to keep his scenes well exposed. 
The only change that would have made the story better, is if it was able to follow the Old Man Logan comic book storyline, but seeing as it had not been purchased by Marvel yet, it was not able to happen."

"rmsplash","9","2","3","9 October 2018"," One of the best post apocalyptic film of all time
","Logan"" is THE prime example of the kind of glorious genre movie that can arise from a studio willing to fillet convention and financially-motivated tropes. James Mangold's brutal second foray in the standalone adventures of the X-Men's most popular mutant is a bold, savage vision with maturity and grit not seen in a superhero film before (or most modern blockbusters for that matter). ""Logan's"" influences don't go wholly unnoticed, but it remains very much it's own beast. Highlighted by arguably the best performance of Hugh Jackman's career, and fittingly in his signature role, ""Logan"" in not only the surefire best entry in the entire X-Men film franchise... it's something close to a masterpiece. One of the only complain that I have about this film is the Tchekov Pistol also known as the adamandium bullet, to kill Logan's clone. 
Disclaimer :This film is not a adaptation of Old man Logan, he takes some ideas but this not an adaptation"
"one-nine-eighty","9","2","3","16 August 2018"," Genre defying next level superhero mic drop....
","Hugh Jackman reprises the role of James ""Logan"" Howlett, a.k.a. Wolverine in this latest, and possibly last outing. Set in a future where mutants have nearly all been wiped out the surviving groups are on the run and hiding from the law, this post-apocalyptic world is slightly reminiscent of the Death of Wolverine/ Old Man Logan comic arcs. His powers are failing, his friends are nearly all gone - in fact he's babysitting Professor X - Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stuart), whose powers have nearly gone and is suffering from dementia as well as other problems. Wolverine has a chance meeting that leads him to discover a young mutant with very similar powers to himself. He takes her, begrudgingly, under his wing and makes a run for safety. The plot isn't too much deeper than this as it's a character driven film which relies on the emotions and development to drive it rather than a overtly complex plot.<br/><br/>This is a dark and bleak film - if the X-Men films were family friendly, this follows R-Rated superhero films and is definitely aimed at adults. The opening of the films sets this up brilliantly, in the past you'd expect to see Wolverine take down threats, whereas in this he is left bloody and bruised at the hands of 'nobody' thugs - he's gone from undefeatable to extremely fragile and vulnerable. There are adult themes of mortality, fear, pain, uncertainty, family, legacy, responsibilities, guilty and loneliness present here. While a little pre-knowledge of the characters is helpful, it is not vital to the understanding and enjoyment of the film - this could be plucked off the shelf by anybody and watched. Visually the film interesting, both drab and raw while also having the brightness and contrast maxed out. Audibly the film is great, there are chunks of the film where you don't need dialogue to follow it, the sound and score bring enough emotion to emphasise the visuals. Acting performances throughout are quality, from Jackman and Stewart who drive the film, to Dafne Keen (X-23), Boyd Holbrook, and even Stephen Merchant and Richard E. Grant, who you wouldn't expect to show up, deliver and add to the journey. <br/><br/>High on emotion and action, and ignoring spandex and neon's this is a great film and deserves all the plaudits it gets. Some people won't like it as they have gotten too comfortable with the Wolverine they have seen on screen over the last 15+ years and not matured with it - well this is a matured Wolverine and while it may not be the death the comic's led us to believe he'd get - it is a fitting swansong for the character we've had, that always felt more NSFW than the rest of the X-Men. If this is Jackman's last outing as Wolverine then this mic-drop is a definite ""come and have a go if you think you can do this"" as he delivers so much in this film. Take what you thought you expected and leave it at the door; this film takes superhero films to a different more gritty level - crossing genre's with chase movies, dramas, thrillers to a name a few. This wasn't and hasn't been my favourite superhero film - but I can recognise something outstanding when I see it and take my hat off and firmly award it 9 out of 10."
"shalabodov-32997","10","2","3","10 August 2018"," My favourite superhero movie of all time
","I knew this film was going to be great when I went to see it, but I didn't expect it to become my favourite superhero movie. We accompany Logan, as him and Professor X journey together with a little girl to a safe location because all the remaining mutants are being hunted down, while they uncover the little girl's past and try to escape the baddies. Hugh Jackman gives it all to his last outing as Wolverine, so does Patrick Stuart. The movie takes a dark, grisly path of depression, anger, and hope, thus it is brilliant. The R rating benefits the movie an incredible amount, because it gives us a better understanding of Logan's and Xavier's struggles, both eternal and external. The film delivers tons of emotions, including tears, hatred, and satisfaction. This is the best send-off of a beloved character ever put to screen. Hats off."
"WeAreLive","10","2","3","4 August 2018"," Thank you Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart
","Logan is the final movie in terms of Hugh Jackman's wolverine and possibly Patrick Stewart's Charles.<br/><br/>In an alternative timeline all of the X-Men are gone. Wolverine and Charlas are the only ones that are left as Wolverine is getting old and week in terms of heal, while Charlas is getting sick.<br/><br/>Both Charles and Logan discover a girl by the name of X-23 who has the same powers as Logan. But unlike logan she only has two claws and they must keep her safe and unite her with the next generation of mutants.<br/><br/>This was a satisfying pay off as Hugh Jackman's last movie as Wolverine, when there was dreama or action it didn't feel forced and the best part is that the movie is R rated.<br/><br/>If you loved both Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman as their characters or just generally loved their movies. I am telling you now you are in for a treat,"
"doxxman5","9","2","3","27 July 2018"," the essence of Wolverine
","Logan is a superhero movie on the surface, but a Western movie at heart. It brings the kinds of stories that are already present in comic books of the last 60 years to the screen in ways that are accessible to people who don't already know them, but even BETTER for those of us who have this kind of character memorized. In the actual comic-book story of Logan's fight with The Reavers, he gets crucified and left for dead; too much? Most importantly, this is the closest to the actual character of Wolverine the movies are ever likely to give us, so it deserves to be listed among the top movies of the year."
"nikhilkishoremails","10","2","3","21 July 2018"," What a superhero movie should be!
","It makes you cry and feel the pain of being a mutant. It is the best superhero movie made till date without crappy CGI. Hugh Jackman is at his best with great support from the cast. It is a western and draws insoiration from another western Shane. James Manigold has written a good screenplay. The rest is done by Hugh. You cannot help but empathize with the characters. They are devoid of hope and are done with the world. The entire journey of re transformation is great. It is what lacks in the superhero movies of today from Marvel or DC. It is a sad fact that this was the last outing for Hugh as Logan but he made the charcter sweep into our hearts. Thanks Hugh for 17 years of entertainment and LOGAN."
"christianfrates","10","2","3","19 July 2018"," More overlooked than Deadpool
","I honestly don't understand why both Deadpool movies are preferred over this piece of art. The dialogue is like poetry and it learned a lot from Ang Lee's Hulk. The pacing is better than most comic book films because it allows much more character development and much less visual effects.<br/><br/>The acting, especially from Jackman and Stewart are high points.<br/><br/>Skip all of the other comic book films except Ang Lee's Hulk and you will understand why I prefer quality over quantity.<br/><br/>James Mangold helped deliver a somber, heartwarming and memorable film for the 21st century."

"iseeeliteinthesky","3","2","3","18 December 2017"," It started of very good but turned bad
","It started really really great and til the middle, it was actually decent, then it turned really bad and just went downhill. The movie is really dark in a futuristic cold world and i like the music, its a little bit like The Road (2009), but its also to much gore in the movie. Heads are flying left and right, its not really especially nice or uplifting to view that kind of gore.<br/><br/>The film was blatantly anti-white, where exacly all the perpetrators were white males, and all the good guys were of mixed color excluding Logan and Xavier. The badguy-army-wanting to kill the girl, and later also the hillbilly rasists on the farm. Well that felt really strange to watch kind of contradictory to the real world as i know it, but enough about politics.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie felt deep and conscious. However there were many contradictories throughout the movie. The fact that Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart) is alive is kind of strange since he died in Xmen 3. But he does an amazing job in this movie as always. Sir Patrick is getting old and its saddening. And Hugh Jackman is also excellent."
"getuliohf","9","1","1","2 May 2020"," Great movie and great story

"zachbaritone","10","1","1","5 January 2020"," Masterpiece

"MickeyTheConstant","10","1","1","20 December 2019"," A fitting send off
","The thing I liked most about this movie was that it dealt with real issues. I am not obviously referring to cyborgs and mutants etc. Although at heart a superhero movie it was more of a toad trip where those on the ride, whilst being hunted down had to deal with the real issues of getting old, dementia, deteriorating health, not being the person you once were, realising (for some) you don't really fit in, loneliness and also loss and grieving. Many of these things our hero Wolvie has had to deal with throughout his long life but the aging and health issues are all new for him. In the past he never really had a family or loved ones but the X-Men became his family and he began to care and love. Now, mostly on his own, in pain, the loss and loneliness is kicking in and in many ways he can see the real curse of his once non ageing and healing powers. It's sad at times, often fun and joyous and also incredibly violent. The violence set the tone for what is now becoming a genre of its own, the adult superhero movie. Refreshing in so many ways. Hugh and Wolvie, I will miss you."

"nizzambaharuddin","10","1","1","11 December 2019"," PERFECT SEND OFF FOR HUGH JACKMAN
","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese once said that, the thing that always drew him to rewatching a movie isn't a plot or the story itself. It is usually the characters. And in terms of characters, Logan didn't failed. Not one bit.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that will get tons of rewind from here on. They nailed the characters from head to toe (or for Professor X, from head to hip). ""Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long."" At first, I was really curious as to why is this Logan so pessimistic and negative. But now I know why.<br/><br/>Recap the X-Men movies timeline if you will. The 1st X-Men is where Logan first meets Jean Grey. Here he starts to fall in love with her. Then in X-2, she sacrificed herself to save the others. Then in the Last Stand, she somehow is alive all along only to be reborn as the Dark Phoenix (meaning she's evil). She killed Professor X and Cyclops, only for Wolverine to killed the love of his life. He must be devastated. Then in X-Men: Days of Future Past, he witnessed almost all of his kind murdered by Sentinels, only for him to change the timeline and erased some of the important events (X3, X2 events). Then halfway through this movie, we learned that almost all mutants are dead because of Professor X. Picture it. Imagine the state of emotions he must have been through. He actually witnessed the deaths of his friends TWICE. No wonder he's skeptical and has a negative input on life itself.<br/><br/>The setting for the movie is quite simple. Save the girl (or his daughter, in this case). But, most good movies proved that you don't need a fancy mumjo jumbo to capture the audience. All the good characters are nailed perfectly. All of them has flaws. Profesor X, old, senile and regrets the Westchester events. Logan, older than Xavier, is borderline pessimist and hates confrontation (very uncharacteristic) but eventually gets to feel something he's been missing. Even Caliban gets to redeem himself in the end. I love how Professor X said about the most perfect sleep he had in years, a sound sleep as a normal human being. That showed the human side of him, even with all that power.<br/><br/>If there is a complain about the movie though, its probably the villain. I feel that Dr. Zander Rice's character motivation isn't developed as well as it should. Sure, he told Logan that his father were killed by mutants, but I felt that you need a bit more than just a mention for his backstory. In fact, I guarantee most will miss that. Even the final boss, another Wolverine is a bit of a cop out to me. They could have used another person with his DNA for instance. Or Zander Rice's own biological child. It might be an even more emotional fight if he wasn't just a Wolverine clone. However, it's not really that upsetting.<br/><br/>Nowadays, people love to jumped on bandwagons. Especially on the Internet. And so, most would claim they hated Fox for their misinterpretation of Xmen and Fantastic 4. But to me, they just produced 2 of the best superhero movies of the year in the form of Deadpool and Logan. While Marvel just rehashed the same formula again and again (Civil War is just a good movie, but severely lacking) Infinity War will definitely be big on scale, no doubt about it. Just doubt it would be big in the mind for themes and storyline. Don't think any Marvel movie is gonna as awesome as this one ever. Logan is a 5/5 for me. The perfect sendoff from Hugh Jackman."
"acedj","10","1","1","10 November 2019"," It is about endings which I want to speak.
","This movie makes me so happy and so sad at the same time. It takes us on such an emotional roller coaster while following along on the final journey of the wolverine as we have all come to know him. Hugh Jackman was made to play this part and has over the last, what 20 years, played him perfectly. This film is visually gorgeous and the characters so well written. In the end though, we say goodbye to some very cherished characters and that is a very sad thing."
"timothygartin","8","1","1","22 October 2019"," I Don't Like Superhero Movies and I was Hooked on Thhis One
","I didn't pick this movie to watch because I don't like superhero movie very much. It is very different than other X-Men installments and other superhero movies. It is character driven and has a solid story. The story isn't the main point of this movie, though. This movie explores the end of the character Wolverine. It does this very well. Hugh Jackman does an outstanding job bringing life to this character. The choices the character makes, the words he says and the emotions he expresses are all exactly consistent with what you expect.<br/><br/>I don't think the villains were very formidable and there were some inconsistencies about the trip across the country that were annoying, but not critical.<br/><br/>I could not stop watching this movie."
"Animany94","10","1","1","2 October 2019"," A hard-hitting wonder from Logan the Wolverine.
","Logan is the best movie in the X-Men franchise, but is solely about Logan wanting to live without being confronted with the mutant agenda and works a steady job while he is hiding with Charles Xavier and Caliban both of whom in a sad condition. Not that it is bad, not at all, but I will stress that I mostly consider it a spin-off, and therefore my favorite ""X-Men"" movie is still Day of Future Past.<br/><br/>But in this movie Logan is approached by a nurse who recognices him as the Wolverine and wants his help, but he doesn't want to. But that woman ends up turning his life upside-down because she knows something unsettling involving an 11-year-old girl and a gang of other mutant kids.<br/><br/>This story adaption is just all out violent, sad, gory and packs up all the heartbreaking events we got in the comic, so if you don't mind all the severed limbs and children being harmed, then you're in for a hellride of emotions. It does give itself room for some quiter moments to let us get into the wants and hardships of the characters, so it works as a satisfying journey with enough growth and bonding to make you care for them."
"borneobrian","8","1","1","16 March 2019"," Long live the wolverine!
","This film was made as the final chapter in Wolverine's story and it delivers perfectly. The action is super brutal and the narrative is interesting. We have an aging wolverine on the run from theses goons called Reapers with Charles Xavier and a cloned daughter named Laura and making a decision to put down the animal or to control it. Hugh jackman sells it here in his final role and the development is really good. The villains were so so and Xavier was kind of a jerk when he got some people in danger for his own selfishness. Dafne keen does a good job as Laura so I'd definitely recommend this for any wolverine fan!"

"Rclarke115","10","1","1","19 February 2019"," Best Superhero Movie of 2017
","""Logan"" is the best superhero movie of 2017. This marks as the 3rd Wolverine movie and Hugh Jackman's Last film to be portray The Wolverine. This Movie is beyond fantastic.<br/><br/>It's impactful, emotional, immersive, just one big helluva ride. just as the film starts, you can tell you're in for a ride of hurt and grit. instead of being upbeat or exhilarating, we see Logan as an Old, depressed, Alcoholic who's in pain and his mutant powers fail to work as well as they used to. He has some trouble getting his claws out, He's unable to heal as he gets bullet's out of his chest and biceps, he even gets beaten down by some Mexican Thugs before he straight up loses it and rips them all apart in a specific R Rated Fashion (Something that didn't happen in the last 8 X-Men Movies). We just see that this series has taken a huge turn in terms of tone.<br/><br/>In case it couldn't get more depressing we see Charles Xavier rolling around in his wheel chair quoting and shouting commercial lines in a depressing manner. He has these seizures that causes him and everyone in few feets radius from him to freeze and be unable to do anything. he stops these seizures as soon as he gets the treatment he needs. at one point people get harmed from his super powered seizure and he keeps saying he's sorry. I should also note that this is also Sir Patrick Stewart's Last Film to play Professor Xavier.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen play's Laura/X-23 who is a female blood clone of Logan. She's on the run from Cyborg mercenaries who are trying to track her or any other new form of new mutant down. Her Nurse tells Logan to take Laura get her to this place where her and people like Laura can be safe.<br/><br/>I'd say this film is the perfect way to say goodbye to Wolverine while giving the fans what they want and let him slaughter any enemy left and right. The Ending has definitely shoced me and left my mouth hanging wondering what's next. but that was it. No Post Credits. No After Credits. It Just Ends.<br/><br/>This Film is suspensful, emotional, and impactful in many different ways. definitely woryth a watch.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This film was heartbreaking, awesome, and entertaining to watch. It sees our favorite characters from X-Men at their lowest, sacrificing themselves in order to help kickstart a new generation of mutants. It's a movie that I can only describe as a slow stabbing pain, when watching people you love die and be tortured mentally and physically. The movie has a great country atmosphere and uses the rundown and folk nature well. The idea of the comic books used as a plot point is very interesting. The little girl was probably my favorite aspect of this film because it feels like a reborn Wolverine. The only problem I have with this film is the cinematography. I wish it was shot better in order to see clearer. It's mainly like some of the small scenes so its honestly more of a nitpick.

","'Logan' felt so so much better than previous X-Men movies. It's like the production team finally knows how to make *good* movies. The settings, music, atmosphere, camera work, writing, etc, just everything felt good.<br/><br/>
Patrick Stewart was *so* good in this. Dafne Keen was great. Stephen Merchant especially and Boyd Holbrook deserve honorable mentions. Hugh Jackman, you can tell, he might be getting a bit old for this, but still a great performance.<br/><br/>
I liked the first half of the movie more than the last.
And that's why not more than 8/10.<br/><br/>
It was a pleasant surprise of a movie for most parts, especially first half, but it actually reminded me in the second half of parts of older X-Men movies that I didn't like too much, like slow pacing or simply not getting the full potential out of the X-Men universe."

"creativecompass","2","13","40","3 March 2017"," This movie is out of place among Marvel movies
","Maybe everyone likes this film because it's ""different"" but the whole reason to watch a Marvel movie is to watch a super hero film. This definitely wasn't a super hero film, it's about adults going on a road trip to save a special girl. It's doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, it has a lot of unexplained story lines that don't lead anywhere and other than the children occasionally preforming their abilities, no one else else has super powers. It's just very depressing from start to finish.<br/><br/>SPOILER - I have so many questions - How is it possible that Logan is dying and aging all of sudden? That doesn't make sense! He has regenerative abilities and those abilities would have stopped anything from poisoning his body. Why bother having Logan and Charles discuss sailing away on a boat if it never happens? Especially if these are the last words that Charles Xavier utters. It is mentioned several times in the movie that the kids have to cross the border into safety, but borders never stopped the X-Men or the bad guys and the movie never explains how exactly their ""safe"" by crossing the border. The ending was completely anti-climatic. After all that Xavier and Wolverine have been through, this is how the writers decided to kill them off, in some lame normal way?? Such a disappointment in every respect. By far the worst Marvel film and it is not the actors fault, it is the writers and directors who have failed this franchise and should never be allowed to create another Marvel movie ever again."

We also see him accepting to be a part of a family, which is a key word in this film. Other then Logan we get to see professor X who is now, let's say, a changed man.

"darkreignn","9","6","15","10 March 2017"," Emotionally draining, but spectacular
","""Logan"" isn't good because it's rated R; it's good because it's one of the most emotional and intense superhero movie in years. It's involving, it's dramatic, it's emotionally draining, and it's spectacular.<br/><br/>Starring Hugh Jackman, ""Logan"" is about a broken, beaten down, and tired Wolverine. He's tired of fighting. He's tired of helping people. He just wants to be left alone, and if being left alone takes an adamantium bullet in his skull, then so be it. ""Heartbreaking"" is one word to describe what it feels like to watch our beloved Wolverine in this state; ""gut-wrenching"" is another. In fact, this film feels like one big continuous sucker punch to the emotions over and over. It's plain sad to see Logan in this manner, and it's even sadder to see him slice and dice and gore his enemies. Like I mentioned, he doesn't want to fight. But yet, people still seem eager to fight him, and with every stab to the face and slice to the gut, the sadness becomes more tangible. The violence is so brutal and animalistic that you don't actually want to see Logan kill anyone, because he himself doesn't want to kill anyone. Killing people is all he's ever done and the more he does it the worse he feels. It's hard to watch, but it's effective. Wolverine growls, yells, and screams as he rips people to shreds, and it's like watching an animal tear into its prey. Be warned, this movie is graphic and full of extreme violence that will wear you down and exhilarate you at the same time. It's hard for me to describe exactly what it feels like watching the action scenes, but you'll know what I mean once you see the film for yourself. But this isn't to say that the action isn't cool to watch, because you best believe it is. Wolverine goes nuts in this movie, tearing arms off and stomachs open. It's brutal and it's badass and it's honestly beautiful.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives a performance so Oscar worthy that if he doesn't get nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role I may never watch the Academy Awards again. Seriously, it's a performance that you'd never expect in a big budget superhero film. He reminded me a lot of Tobey Maguire in the first three ""Spider-Man"" films; Hugh was subtle and nuanced, with pain and frustration in his eyes. But when he went berserk, he held nothing back. And Dafne Keen was probably one of the best child actresses I've ever seen. The other child actors in this film? That's a different story, but she was magnificent. Patrick Stewart was amazing, do I even need to say that? It was a bit weird to hear Professor X cuss so much, but I understood why, and if I lived in that world you better believe I'd be saying the f-word as much as he does, too.<br/><br/>This isn't a perfect movie though. Around the halfway point the film introduced a character that mildly took me out of the movie, but I can't deny that the introduction of that character brought forth some of the most intense, nail biting, and exciting fight scenes I've EVER seen. I was seriously holding my breath during the first fight scene with this character, and I didn't even notice it until the fight ended; that's how engrossing this movie is. I also disliked how little tension some of the fight scenes had. Most actions scenes feature Logan fighting a handful of evil goons, and it's fun to watch, but it's nothing we haven't seen before (except for the graphic nature of the violence). Don't get me wrong, the action was amazing, I just wish there were a few more creative set pieces instead of just having Wolverine fight some expendable goons every 25 minutes.<br/><br/>There is also a scene of obvious, immersion breaking exposition, and the story is almost nothing new, but the fact of the matter is we've never seen Wolverine in a story like this before, and that's what makes this movie fresh. Seeing Wolverine in this broken, beaten down way is painful, but it's an intense and gripping watch. ""Logan"" is definitely one of the best superhero movies that has been released in a long, long time and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."
"HockeyFan91","9","6","15","9 March 2017"," Raw, Brutal, Uncompromising and Outstanding
","Logan has been on my radar for a while because it looked different. Super hero movies these days (this is not an insult it is common knowledge) have become somewhat formulaic. Marvel is particularly guilty of this and you cannot blame them because they have churned out good movie after good movie. <br/><br/>Logan is something else entirely. <br/><br/>From the first five minutes you know you are in for something very different not just because of the ""R"" rating, but because of the dirty, gritty nature of the first scene. <br/><br/>When the violence erupts it is presented in a no holds barred brutal manner you would expect from a guy who has lived a life as long, brutal and as violent as Logan has. He has had enough of having to fight his whole life and when he does fight he is absolutely doing it with no holds barred. <br/><br/>The action scenes are designed amazingly well and it is nice to see them grounded in reality especially after ""Apocalypse"" and its super cartoon like flippy twirling action scenes. <br/><br/>I have not returned to see an XMEN movie in the theater a second time, and I loved ""Days of Future Past"". I will be returning to see Logan again. I may be naive but I think Jackman should receive award consideration for his role as Logan. <br/><br/>I cannot recommend Logan higher. The only reason it does not get a perfect 10/10 score is because of some continuity issues with previous installments of the franchise. <br/><br/>Leave the little ones at home. Judge what your kids can handle by seeing it first without them if they are under 15. If they are under 10 they should skip this one until they are ready to see it at home when they are older."

This is a gritty change of pace from the happy-go-lucky-leotard-and-cape hero tales to a brutal, tough life on the run for a man... who happens to have claws.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger, Margot Robbie, Hugh Jackman. So far Australians in superhero movies are 3 for 3. They are so good at it.<br/><br/>Combine them with a British co-star (as was done in two out of these three) who also leave nothing on the table by way of acting, and you can't go wrong with the chemistry. No, they're not dad and son but by nuance you can see how annoyed they get with each other and how no matter what they will never leave each other's side. <br/><br/>The Dark Knight set the standard for the morbid realism superhero movie genre.<br/><br/>After this movie I'm not sure if it can be set any higher if any movie can even meet it now.<br/><br/>I used to help my parents at a care facility. <br/><br/>How far does this movie go in humanizing these characters we've come to know over the years and contrast the poised, answers-to-every-problem pure image with what just might happen if a person with special abilities starts to deteriorate? <br/><br/>Patrick Stewart's performance is so good it made me look up Star Trek t- shirts. No joke.<br/><br/>Around every turn of the movie is one clever approach after another. Mutants aren't real but if they WERE this is what it would look like. When something isn't right it isn't stated. We just see it and it is done so artistically that even those completely unfamiliar with the comic won't go ""What's happening?"" and there is no attempt made to go out of the way to explain it. <br/><br/>This is not about a dude floating around wearing his underwear on the outside of his pants and rescuing cats stuck in trees, saving people from burning buildings or stopping a man who just snatched a lady's purse <br/><br/>It's darkness, darkness.<br/><br/>The days of a pristine mansion ""school for the gifted,' suit-and-tie comfort in technology and always seeing the good in everyone become a vague memory if we can even remember it at all.<br/><br/>The movie seems to take Chuck's rose-colored optimism for humanity and thoroughly flush it down a toilet, suggesting he may have been just an old fool and now actually in his ""true"" form after life's illusions play out and have ran out... but think carefully after you've seen the movie.<br/><br/>One final note just for fun <br/><br/>Once again we hear Johnny Cash's ""When the Man Comes Around,"" featured almost 20 years ago in The Hunted, a movie that I think lead to making No Country for Old Men since it featured Tommy Lee Jones and another Spanish-speaking actor in Javier Bardem, and The Hunted featured a similar style of violence. <br/><br/>When I first saw the previews for this movie with no lines featured... just dark single-key piano notes and the professor in the back of a car looking nothing besides destitute and the simple title ""Logan,"" I KNEW this would be the 5th movie I would see by myself.<br/><br/>I had to see it.

So i thought i would give it a watch and oh my god, this movie is incredible. <br/><br/>Logan is the story of an old and tired wolverine that is done with everything. He is sick and on the verge of dying because the thing that makes him wolverine is now poisoning him. He wants to go away and live a peaceful life with Professor X, but once he meets this girl that has a few people hunting her down, Logan and the Professor are thrown back into the midst and have to protect this girl as well as themselves. <br/><br/>First the obvious, Hugh Jackman plays Logan and i honestly think he deserves an Oscar for his performance. He does a spectacular job at playing a man that is just wants to give up on everything. The action sequences are well done and greatly engaging. There is also a tragic and sad moral to this movie, about how we all get old and die. This is probably my favorite movie ever made. <br/><br/>If i was going to point out one flaw in this movie its that the movie at times slows down, but fortunately that happens to give some character development and it makes the upcoming action much more satisfying. <br/><br/>So in the end, Logan was a masterpiece and it truly floored me. Every character is engaging especially Logan and the little girl. The soundtrack, the action, and the story is just amazing and very well done.

Moreover, I personally just can't take kids seriously as super hero's, even if they have special powers.

","Without referencing the previous installments I think that the general plot line is good. So does the acting. All the other is quite mediocre.

And apart of one car chase, it was very dull. There was nothing interesting or new. Brutality replaced choreography.<br/><br/>Another issue is sloppiness. This relates to the useless army involved and jeopardizing the innocent. Another related question is how did they escape from the Hotel unnoticed?<br/><br/>Finally, Logan was depressed all the way through the movie, without any recovery (or trying to recover) and being constantly on low energy.

Really??? The same ""what"" whom the bad guys knows is ""the most dangerous brain in the world"" ..... This is just glanced over with some vague explanations of why this is - non of which makes ANY sense, especially seeing how the bad guys are trying to perfect creating controllable mutants - and a mutant clone of Charles would be a POWERFUL tool in achieving this.<br/><br/>2nd - DUMB AS HELL moments !SPOILER! - like the battalion of henchmen all using normal guns - and then the leader of them tells them ""Stop shooting at her - she will just heal"" - and then a few minutes later basically pacifying her with a god damn speargun with a wire... Seriously if you KNOW what you are hunting, then who the hell is that moronic? It's like being told to dive to the bottom of the ocean and then turning up in shorts and a sombrero! Retardedly hilariously moronic!!!<br/><br/>3rd - The bad guys are so flat and uninteresting it hurts!

(The scene in the hospital/lab is just cringe-worthy!) <br/><br/>4th - Logan him self is just so F-ing emo! It's good and correct for the character to be down a lot due to the circumstances he and Charles find them selves in - however - 90% of the movie he looks like he is about to cry! I mean come on... He is just so damn impotent - yet he pretty much keeps up with his young clone - which is just... LOL ... I mean ... Really...<br/><br/>How ANYONE gives this movie a 10 is beyond me!

","This movie showed how Wolverine and Professor Xavier died. But it did more than that. It focused more on Logan and showed a side of him that hasn't really been shown before. It did show him tearing people to shreds but it also showed a more compassionate side. It showed the people he cared for and the extent that he would go to to keep them safe which eventually ended up in his death. I also enjoyed how this movie foreshadowed another movie series after this. It showed that there will probably be a new wave of mutants. I also liked the fact that there really wasn't much of a filter which meant the fight scenes were way better than other super hero movies. The thing about this movie i didn't like was that it could have been just as good if it was a little bit shorter. The movie seemed to drag on forever and it could've done without 1 or 2 scenes.

We were immediately introduced to Logan's fowl mouth and new look. Had he aged? Yes. Did he still look smoking? Double yes.<br/><br/>I don't want this review to involve spoilers of ANY kind, but it's so hard to express how fantastically deep and disturbing this movie actually is without revealing a few plot secrets (don't worry I'm not going to).<br/><br/>The basic outline is we're a little ways into the future, mutants are a dying breed and my beloved Charles has aged a little more than I'd like to see.<br/><br/>Their X-men days are way behind them and they're basically in hiding.<br/><br/>Enter a mute little girl who needs their help and you've pretty much got yourself a road trip movie.<br/><br/>This movie is riddled with tears, nostalgia and heart!

"bob-the-movie-man","8","5","12","18 March 2017"," ""When the man comes around""
","At last – a superhero movie with real heart (and not just the chunks over the knuckle blades!). Logan is a bit of a revelation. I was reluctant to go and see it, since a) I'm a lukewarm X-Men fan at best and b) I hadn't seen either of the previous two Wolverine spin-off films. (Seeing the other Wolverine films, by the way, is not a pre- requisite for enjoying this one). After a long day at work, my choice was ""Logan"" or ""Kong: Skull Island"". I voted for this one, and I'm so glad I did.<br/><br/>It's now 2029. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, but this is not a Wolverine we have seen before. This is an aged and deteriorating superhero: his self-healing powers are waning; a limp is developing; and his fighting prowess (although still legendary) doesn't show the stamina it once did. This is a Wolverine that is also an unlikely carer, looking after a mentally degenerating Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), now 90 years old and finding it increasingly difficult to keep his devastating mental superpowers under control. This is a Wolverine trying desperately to avoid the limelight, working diligently as a limo-driver in an effort to save money for the dream of buying a 'Sunseeker' and sailing off with Xavier into the sunset, gaining true anonymity among the boating fraternity.<br/><br/>Life doesn't play ball though. A brutal encounter with a gang on the highway outside El Paso advertises Wolverine's presence and brings him into contact with a strange eleven-year-old girl (Dafne Keen) with impressive powers of her own. The girl is being pursued by a ""reiver"" (Boyd Holbrook, ""Run all Night"") supported by a small private army. Against his will, Wolverine is forced into a memorable road trip with the old man and the young girl that leaves a trail of bloodied bodies behind them.<br/><br/>For, be warned, this is an *extremely* violent film, with much dismemberment and 'blade work' that must have kept the prosthetics department busy for months. It's also quite emotionally brutal, particularly within a central segment set in a ""Field of Dreams"" style idyll (featuring Eriq La Salle from E.R.) that you know in your gut is not going to end with ""Goodnight John Boy"" pleasantries.<br/><br/>The well-choreographed and frenetic action within the road-trip segment reminded me at times of the harsh cinematography and dynamics of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" – a great compliment.<br/><br/>But the film also takes time to pause, in uncharacteristic Marvel- ways, for character development and genuinely intelligent dialogue. These interludes allow the acting to shine, and it is first-rate. We all know (from ""Les Miserables"" for instance) that Hugh Jackman can act, but this is arguably his best-ever performance: a meaty role (he actually has two in the film) that affords him tremendous range and emotion. At one point towards the end of the film I thought ""this has genuine Oscar show-reel potential"". He will surely never get nominated – a Marvel film? Get Away! But wouldn't it make a refreshing change if he was? Recognizing good acting, regardless of the context.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart is a great Shakespearean actor, and here he also gets given full rein to impress as he hasn't had chance to in most of his movie roles to date. <br/><br/>Claiming the prize so far this year for the most unusual casting decision is Stephen Merchant as the albino helper Caliban, unrecognizable to me at first until he had some lengthy dialogue to flex his Bristol accent on! A non-comic and dramatic role, Merchant does really well with it. <br/><br/>Finally, I can't leave the acting without doffing my cap to young Dafne Keen whose mesmerising feral stare would probably put the fear of God into every parent of a pre-teen girl! Even though she has only a handful of lines, this is an impressive feature film debut. I predict we will see much more of this young lady.<br/><br/>Less convincing to me was Richard E Grant as the evil mastermind behind the scheme, who never quite seemed nasty enough to me to be believable: in one scene he could be calling back a dog that's run off down the beach rather than desperately trying to gain control of an out of control situation! <br/><br/>Directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line"", ""Knight and Day""), who co-wrote the piece with Scott Frank (""Minority Report"") and Michael Green (""Green Lantern"" yes, really!), this was a gritty and well constructed movie. If you can stomach the gore and the body count (I would see it as very lucky to have got away with its UK '15' certificate) this is a roller-coaster of a movie that is recommended.<br/><br/>By the way, to save you from sitting through the end titles (although you do get a Johnny Cash classic to enjoy) there is no ""monkey"" at the end of this Marvel film. (I'm no stranger to still be sitting there as the lights come up but many of the crowd that were left looked vaguely embarrassed!) <br/><br/>In terms of my rating, I'm not a fanboy for Marvel or DC properties, but here I award a rating I have only previously bestowed on two superhero films before: the quirky ""Ant Man"" and the anarchic ""Deadpool"". Well worth seeing on the big screen.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com)."
"Gresh854","7","5","12","15 March 2017"," Logan Is A Dramatic Action Masterpiece, Not Just Another Superhero Entry
","Back in 2016 a special film called Deadpool came out and wowed audiences due to its overall success, considering it was Rated R. I just need to take a moment and thank Deadpool for existing because if Deadpool didn't exist then Logan most likely would've never been made the way it was. Logan to me is a very special film. The hugest praise I can give this film is that it doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie. Don't get me wrong I love comic book superhero movies, but we're at a time where some of these comic book movies are getting tiring and too familiar. Logan to me is secretly an extremely emotional and serious drama with bits of exceptional action. It is so nice to finally get an extremely dark and serious comic book movie, that treats it's overall product masterfully. Now I don't think Logan by any means, is a perfect film. I have now seen the film twice, opening night and a week after, and I do have to conclude factually, that it has a couple of knit-picky flaws. For the most part though, I think all these insignificant flaws are outweighed by all the positives in this film for sure. In conclusion, the two viewings of Logan have officially confirmed to me that this movie might just be my favorite Marvel film. Hugh Jackman's performance in Logan, is by far his best portrayal as Wolverine. It's quite intriguing to learn about and get behind the character as an older and weaker person. Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier also, is by far his best portrayal to the character. The new young actress in the film who plays Laura, Dafne Keen, was incredibly good in this film. Normally I get nervous when kid actors or actresses play huge roles in films because, typically they're never really good, but Dafne Keen's commitment to Laura's character is outstanding. These three characters are so grounded and so well developed, through the entirety of the film, to the point where it feels real. A lot of people have been calling Logan, ""The Dark Knight"" of the Marvel entries, and it most definitely deserves the title, because its by far the most realistic and serious Marvel film yet, and has some near Oscar-worthy performances. The only flaw I due have with this film is one character in particular played by Boyd Holbrook, who is a great Actor; I loved his work in Narcos. He plays the main villain in this film, and for me he came off as a little too over the top and cliché. For one, since his character acts sometimes silly in a couple of scenes, it kind of takes you out of the all-so realistic world the film Logan has developed. His character also takes kind of that MCU villain route, where the villain is always trying to be funny like Loki, and I didn't buy it too much in a couple of scenes with him. With that being said, his character wasn't terrible or anything, I just think he could've been improved upon. I think that just might be my only solid flaw with Logan. Everything else in this film works so well, and is crafted with such care and commitment. Now, the action in the film is freakin' crazy. It is all-over-the-place gore splats, slicing people, bodies flying everywhere violent. From a X-Men standpoint its probably the best action that has ever been done in an X-Men film so far. The choreography for every actors and actresses fight scenes where done professionally. I was worried that the character Laura's action scenes in the film would look fake, since she is a little girl doing action scenes. To my surprise it all looked significantly real, which is to be praised for. This review is spoiler-free and I can't get too into details about the synopsis of the film but all you really need to know is that, going into this film, expect a satisfying, action, drama. Don't go into this film expecting another Days of Future Past, or a Civil War, or even a Dark Knight-like film. because Logan is able to stand on its own so well just like Deadpool was able to do. Like I said, Logan is my favorite Marvel movie ever made so far, and I'm going to give it a grade letter of an ""A"" and a IMDb score of a 10/10."

","There are plenty of superhero characters that are being humanized beyond belief, but wolverine was one of my favorite super hero. The cinematography and the performance given by Hugh Jackman is stellar, it's just that the storyline is not suited for what The Wolverine stands for: Kick Ass and after he finishes kicking ass he walks away without a scratch smoking a cigar. Why was his body dying if his cells could regenerate faster than the cells that were being destroyed. Like i have said holes in the story in order to create a more human character. We get to see ourselves everyday i for one don't one to see The Wolverine death. I think that would have been a better title: Wolverine's Death :D and The Rise of Deadpool"
"The-Sarkologist","10","5","12","13 March 2017"," A Fitting Farewell
","I wasn't sure what to make of this film, particularly since of late when a film hits the screens, while I may really enjoy it, once I have finished watching it it becomes a case of 'well, that was that, lets get on to the next one'. It is sort of like the concept of the chase where the anticipation of the movie is actually much better than the movie itself, especially when the teaser trailers give you enough to make you really want to see it, but not too much to the point where you basically have worked out the plot and only end up seeing the film because you have seen all the others in the franchise (as is the case with the latest Fast and Furious movie).<br/><br/>However, it turned out that this film wasn't going to be following along the same lines as the previous X-men, or even Wolverine films. Okay, after the third film it looked as if the franchise was dead, but it was given a huge shot in the arm with the first origins movie, and also cemented Hugh Jackman as the character of Wolverine. In fact it will be difficult to even envisage anybody else being able to take up the mantle in the way that James McAvoy and Michael Fassenbender has done with Professor X and Magneto. However, after seventeen years, it looks as if it is time for Wolverine to hang up his claws, and what better way than a movie focused around both him and Professor X.<br/><br/>The year is 2029 and pretty much all of the mutants have died, all except for Wolverine, the professor, and Caliban. The problem is that the operation that Wolverine had all those years ago where adamantium was fused to his skeleton is starting to have a side effect, namely it is hindering his ability to regenerate, and as such he is also growing old. Professor X on the other hand seems to be drifting in and out of dementia while having spasms that result in psychokinetic outbursts. In an attempt to control these outbursts Wolverine finds himself driving a limo and hustling for drugs outside a hospital. However, into his twilight years comes one final mission, a girl who needs to be smuggled out of the country.<br/><br/>It is quite interesting teaming Wolverine and Professor X in a final movie as the characters cannot be any different from each other. Wolverine has always been portrayed as the loner who tries not to become too attached to people because whenever people are around him they end up dying. This was the image painted in the first origin movie. However Professor X has always been the communal one, being the founder of the X-men and the guy who went out of his way to track down mutants to bring them into a special school. This contrast is seen especially in the scene in the middle of the movie where they end up rescuing the horses from a farming family that have an unfortunate accident.<br/><br/>In some ways people might suggest that this is a movie where the baton is being passed on to a younger generation, but this is not necessarily the case. Sure, it has painted a vastly different future than the one envisaged at the end of Days of Future Past, but it seems that no matter what they do there is always going to be a reaction against the mutants. In fact what happened to result in there being 'no mutants being born in the past twenty-five years' is left hanging in the air. Mind you, this is not necessarily going to be the last movie in the franchise, especially since a new Deadpool movie is now being advertised, though it is certainly a great way to retire a character that has made an appearance in every X-men movie (with the exception of the first Deadpool movie) that has been made to date."

"tommoben97","10","5","12","6 March 2017"," No One Word Can Summarise This...
","{Minor Spoilers Ahead}<br/><br/>This is it. After all the good, the great, the disappointing and the abhorrently awful, this is it. This is the single greatest comic book hero film of all time. There is no topping this. There will never be quite as unique a lead-up, with 17 years worth of love for these iconic film characters and these recurring actors. There will never again be any actor that can compete with Hugh Jackman or Patrick Stuart. There is no competition. It wouldn't be fair...<br/><br/>It is nigh impossible to fully to describe this. Overall, 'Logan' is depressing, dark, gritty, and terrifying. Yet, it is also uplifting, heartwarming, real, and beautiful. I have never seen anything quite like this. 'Logan' is a difficult film to watch. To see these beloved characters so broken is almost too painful. You cannot sit down and just ""watch"" 'Logan'. It doesn't work that way. Once you settle in and the film begins, it becomes impossible no to be drawn into the pain. Johnny Cash was the perfect choice for the trailer soundtrack, 'Hurt' portraying everything you need to know before becoming involved in 'Logan'. <br/><br/>'Logan' is worth it. For the difficulty I personally felt when in the cinema, I was richly rewarded. This the most rewarding film in the 'X-Men' movie franchise, and for me one of the most rewarding films I have ever witnessed. It is often the most challenging that are most worthwhile. 'Logan' is no different. <br/><br/>I am now ready to say goodbye to the original 'X-Men' cast. Where the joint cast of 'Days of Future Past' was partly intended to be a handing-on of the torch, 'Logan' allows for infinite possibilities. I know that it's too soon to think about a follow up, and I know that it is impossible to create anything off the back of 'Logan' quite so easily, but it is important. I don't want another Wolverine. I don't want another actor to replace Hugh Jackman, James Bond style. I don't like the new 'First Class' cast, and I didn't enjoy Apocalypse. So where do we go from here? Do we move on and have these new mutants take over? Would that be preferable? I know that Hugh Jackman cannot be replaced, but that's why Laura is such an important character. Along with helping to give Logan a heroic send- off, she is a new Wolverine, a Lioness as described by Xavier. With so little knowledge of this new world, her immature eyes and Wolverine-esque rage can be how we might experience this new time period. Yet it may be more appropriate to let 'Logan' be.<br/><br/>If you thought 'Deadpool' was gory... The film itself, while filled with an absurd amount of emotion, still packs in incredible action, and lets loose with it's rating. Back in 2003, when 'X-2' came out, audiences loved seeing Wolverine have more violent fight scenes. They thought they were finally witnessing an unleashed Wolverine. It's ironic that he is enabled to truly tear people to pieces in 'Logan', when he is least capable of doing so. Don't let that fool you though, 'Logan' is gory beyond belief, and it's gorgeous. I know many people would dislike this level of violence, as they would have in 2003, but if you're against it, 'Logan is still worth it. My friend hated Deadpool due to it's gore and violence. She spent 99% of the movie with her eyes closed. But she watched 'Logan', and she f#&@%$! loved it. <br/><br/>I don't know if I can really say anything else about this movie. To me, 'Logan' is perfect. I'm sure it has it's flaws, as all movies do, but I don't care. This IS the best superhero film ever produced. I don't believe it will ever be topped. 'Logan' may be as difficult to watch as 'The Avengers' is easy, but it is infinitely more rewarding and worthwhile because of it.<br/><br/>I know this review won't be read, and is very unprofessional, but... James Mangold, Thank You.<br/><br/>'Logan' is a Masterpiece."
"j_forbesy","10","5","12","5 March 2017"," Logan Review
","Logan is the final chapter in Hugh Jackman's Wolverine story. With it's R rating and darker tone, this had the potential to be Marvel's (well Fox's) Dark Night, or burn where it stands like the other Wolverine film. Thank god it was the first one.<br/><br/>In Logan we get an old Logan, an Old Man Logan. While it is extremely loosely based off the comic, it was still great to get this older Logan that just doesn't care. His aged, his body isn't like it use to be, and his starting to become a grumpy old man. What was so great about this aged version of Wolverine, is you can see the younger Wolverine from previous film turning into this guy over time. Everything he did didn't seem out of character and he still had the Wolverine personality he has had for 17 years. I think much of this is down to the performance of Jackman. No matter what quality of X-Men movie he has been in, he has nailed Wolverine and this film is no different. <br/><br/>As well as being Jackman's last appearance as Wolverine, unless there's a Deadpool cameo, it was also Patrick Stewart's last appearance as Professor X. I've always really like Patrick Stewart as Charles, despite not jumping into the X-Men franchise til the new incarnation of McAvoy had come about. In Logan, Professor X is aged and unstable and I liked them playing with the idea of what would happen when the most powerful mind in the world becomes old. Through seizers that is able to freeze everyone in their place, we got to see how dangerous Charles has unintentionally become in his old age. While I've always really liked Professor X as a character through the other films, I think this is my favourite version of him because he comes with so much depth and history that he feels like this powerful and wise mutant. Again like Jackman, Stewart's performance is outstanding during this film and what is done with the character is because of what Stewart was about to do.<br/><br/>Moving on to our new mutant, Laura, aka X-23, was an absolute hit with me. Not meaning to get repetitive but the performance by Dafne Keen brought this innocence yet uncontrollable aggression to the character. While I'm not too familiar with the character itself in the comics, I felt like they were able to give her a great origin and make it clear who she is and how she has come to be. While this film is an end to an era in many ways, it still leaves a slight gap open to a new series, which I would personally be all for because we would have X-23 leading the pack. She was such a strong character and it is disappointing that we probably aren't going to get more of her story because she's a character you want to follow. Now onto the R rating. This film needed it. While Deadpool needed the R rating for the humour, Logan needs the humour the the realisticness. This is the most grounded and realistic X-Men film we have ever gotten. We are in this lived in and matured world that not giving it the realistic treatment. The main reason for the R rating is the language and violence, very similar to Deadpool, however it was used in such a different way. We got to see what Wolverine is, a killing machine, and not only that, his an aged killing machine that just doesn't care no more. With that comes the violence and gore that we got in this movie. As far as language goes, it's one of those things that when it's not there you don't notice it, but when it is, you appreciate it. While the language wasn't too vague in anyway, being able to have the characters say what they do is more realistic than anything else in this movie. These are mutants who have gone through hell, and being able to see them do simple stuff like drop an F bomb when their frustrated or express their surprise with language gives them more of a realistic feel than I would have gotten from anything else. <br/><br/>Touching on the villains, while they weren't the strongest villains you could think of, I didn't mind because they didn't have an extremely strong presence. They act as a way to further the plot and push our main characters further in the story and that's all they need to do. When they are great when they are on the screen they are great and their villain presence is felt and that's all I wanted them to do, especially a certain one that pops up mid way through the movie. For the most part this is a story about Logan's final chapter and him having something he has never completely had his whole life.<br/><br/>For me, there is only one slight negative through this whole film and it's something that I didn't think of til much later. During the film they touch on what happened to the other mutants and while it give you a pretty decent idea as to what happened to them, there is part of me that wanted that bit more and to actually see what happened. It was just one of those situations where I thought they could of done a ""show not tell"", however I can see from a length point of view as to why they went about it the way they did.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie. After Deadpool last year I never thought I would see a Fox Marvel property that I liked more but this is it. This is the Dark Knight for a Marvel character and it's going to go down as one of my favourite superhero movies of all time.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Am i the only person who thought the movie was not at all what i was expecting? Apart from the gore, which finally arrived to a Wolverine movie and was nice to see the rest was pretty dull. The story didn't really convinced me. and i understand that a lot of people will start to try and find an answer for the unanswered questions,and those will never be answered. If it was based on Old Man Logan it was very far from the great story that that comic was. If they can't use the characters from Marvel then make something with what they have. A final fight with Saber-tooth would be amazing.The actual Reavers would be awesome with the half-tank character and the full robot one that only has a human head. Anything would have made this story so much better.But no, have to add mutants for a next story. Logan is not a movie for Oscars, it should be a movie for fans who have waited all these years for a closure. It was really a great disappointment for me. Sorry guys for speaking my mind."
"Screen_Blitz","9","5","12","4 March 2017"," Gritty, visceral, and emotionally stunning, Logan is an astonishing superhero entry that really packs the punch
","Since the inaugaration of the X-men franchise back in 2000, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always stood as a compelling force to be reckoned with in the superhero. He is not firmly your average superhero, he is a hero with true grit and compulsion. Over the years, Wolverine has evolved into a powerful character aching with tragedy and sorrow similar to Batman from the DC universe. Although the iron-claw-wielding mutant has had more than his fair share of time to shine as a visceral cinematic figure, the X-Men franchise has never exercised his true, but gritty spirit to the fullest extent like Christopher Nolan did with Batman in the 'Dark Knight' trilogy...until now. Diving deep into the heart of the titular hero, this film journeys far into the grittier territory of the X-Men universe with a story tackling on complex themes of morality and sorrow that's plagued the inner being of the lead hero. And returning to the director's chair is James Mangold who last directed 2013's 'Wolverine'. Set in 2029, almost the entire mutant race has been wiped and one of the last remaining of the kind is Logan (played by Hugh Jackman). Retired from his glory days, Logan is now living in isolation caring for a dying 90-year old Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart). When he's unexpectedly introduced to a young Latina girl named Laura (played by Dafne Keen) who happens to carry the same claw-wielding powers as him, he and Xavier must escort to safety. Pursuing after them are sadistic forces lead by half-human, half-robot Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) who is set out to kill the young girl.<br/><br/>Here marks a major turning point for the X-Men franchise, and arguably one for the superhero genre. As this entry follows a much darker and somber story than the previous installments, it also strays away from the more family-friendly conventions of the both the franchise and the genre itself. Following the success of the R-rated 'Deadpool' which pushed the boundaries with over-the-top violence and sexually crude material, this one adopts an R-rating as opposed to the previous installments which housed a more friendly PG-13 rating. So this time around, when Wolverine hacks his enemies with those sharp metal claws of his, the results are much more gruesome and realistic than what we were accustomed to (let's not forget the four-letter words). While the bloody imagery may come as an objection to some viewers with a weak stomach (along with a small detriment to the box office), it allows the film to exercise to true and more devastating nature of the aching hero. The story introduces Logan as an aged hero is know devastated by the tragedy that put an end to his glory days, and a man strangled by an enemy he can't seem to defeat, his tragic past. The plot then carries out the relationship between him and a young girl with powers he knows little about, evolving into more of an atmospheric character study than a plot-driven story. Director James Mangold effectively builds on the nature of the fatigued character with rigid melancholy many superhero flicks have lacked over the past several years. To add to the spice, Mangold executes the story in the style that echoes the old western outlaw movies with a post-apocalyptic environment and criminal themes playing major roles in many scenes. Although the story meanders a little in the midsection, Mangold is very solid at keeping things moving.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has always stood as the show-stealer in the X-Men franchise with his portrayal as Wolverine/Logan. Unlike the previous entries, this film packs a punch with strong emotional grit and atmosphere that allows Jackman to exercise a more poignant performance than what he's demonstrated in the past. Jackman nicely knocks the ball out of the park with a somber performance as the titular character, a performance that also marks his final portrayal in the role before retiring as the iconic hero. Along his side, the only supporting to make his return from the previous entries is Charles Xavier whose role is proudly reprised by Patrick Stewart. With the aged Xavier know handicapped without his ability to walk, Stewart gives a blissful, if occasionally humorous portrayal as this signature role. Coming along for the ride is a young newcomer Dafne Keen who steps into the role of the mysterious young Laura born with a same clawing-wielding gift as Wolverine. Cashing in only little dialogue beyond a series of screams and occasional Spanish-spoken lines, her performance is displayed largely during the action sequences as we watch her slice and dice through the enemies in a violent, but dazzling fashion. While her performance stands strong, it is the subtly in which the character that makes her stand out.<br/><br/>Logan is astonishing superhero entry that packs a powerful punch with its gripping narrative and direction that defies the usual superhero conventions. It is an emotionally riveting that not only transcends the genre but serves as a spectacular sendoff to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine with results that are vastly satisfying."

He's taking care of Prof. X, who is now 90 years old, who still has the mind-power but its now uncontrollable. Somehow both meet a kid (X-23/Laura) who they have to save, but as it turns out she's also a mutant with Logan's DNA, hence obviously, CLAWS. The organization who created her and several other mutants, are on the hunt and the whole movie is about survival.<br/><br/>The kid who played Laura is so BAD-ASS, its amazing. Its a big deal to be the highlight of a movie where Hugh Jackman is the protagonist. The relationship between Prof. X, Logan and Laura are like Grandpa, Dad and daughter which makes these characters highly relatable. Patrick was amazing as a very different and never seen before Prof X. Hugh Jackman did what he has been doing last 17 years, only this was his best. Other Villainy characters did a fair job.<br/><br/>The movie is dark, like ""Game Of Thrones"" dark, people die, there's blood everywhere, heads and other body parts are coming off. But overall, its the best send-off they could give to Hugh as his last Wolverine film. Best part is you really don't have to watch any previous films to watch this, if you don't know what are mutants, it doesn't matter. Its a great watch for anyone (Anyone who's comfortable with blood and violence).<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman will be missed as Wolverine."

","This is not strictly a superhero's movie. It's more a drama in the Sydney Lumet's Running on empty tradition mixed with a road movie (if you don't consider Running on empty a road movie itself). Obviously there are characters with superpowers or enhanced skills, cyborgs, adamantium claws and telepathic stuff but the action scenes just cover less than a third of the whole movie. Maybe is a more mature movie amid its genre than usual but I felt that it lacks a lot of entertainment. At least the kind of fun I expect from a superhero movie. I recognize the risk that the authors have assumed with this kind of story but I don't find it too original. I didn't like a lot the previous Mangold's Wolverine movie and I disliked Origins but to rank all three from best to worst; 1 The Wolverine, 2 Logan, 3 Origins. I think that they have missed a great opportunity with a really great character. I would have enjoyed much more a Bryan Synger's X Men movie style (but discarding Apocalypse) So Long Hugh Jackman's Wolverine"

","I have been an X-men fan since the 70s. I knew it would have language and violence because Logan has always been gritty but Fox took this to the next level. The previous X-men movies had violence and some language but stayed within the confines of PG-13. This movie didn't dance on the edge it swam in the deep end with extremely violent horror movies. It almost seemed like every scene was written with making sure it would receive an R rating. The number of times the F-bomb was dropped was to point of ridiculousness. The number of beheadings, disembowelments, and dismemberments were too many to count. Shame on Marvel and Fox for turning a children's comic book into a horror movie massacre.<br/><br/>If you look back at every scene the movie could have been so much better. This movie destroyed the legacy of Wolverine and Professor X. Two bitter broken men with filth pouring out of their mouth are depicted as heroes. The girl would have been safer and better off taking a Greyhound bus or a taxi."

"memphisgreene","4","4","9","14 August 2017"," Too Self-Serious for a Wacky Comic Book Plot
","Fiercely hyped from the get-go, Logan carries with it a mature tone and the knowledge that it is The Last Wolverine Movie. Everyone is rough and ragged and tired. Unfortunately the mature tone of most of the film is diluted with the kind of comic book silliness seen in the other X-Men films (i.e. clones, evil scientists), so it's hard to accept scenes of beloved characters feeling intense emotions when they are immediately followed by adolescent ultraviolence in a campy situation. It's an okay flick, but its general acceptance by fans as a great movie shows that the bar isn't set high enough."

","LOGAN REVIEW<br/><br/>When Hugh Jackman was approached to make this apparently at first he refused, he wanted it to be more real and out of the Spandex universe and I'm so glad he stuck to his guns because the film is an epic.<br/><br/>Even if you have never seem any of the previous X Men films you will enjoy this.<br/><br/>Previously the X Men films, whilst good didn't make you emotionally involved with them, it was just action and special effects but front the start, middle and especially the end of Logan you care.<br/><br/>A well deserved 15 rating as the violence is in your face and not as comic book safe as all of the previous X Men films so be warned.<br/><br/>A must see, 2 downsides unfortunately.<br/><br/>Firstly, Richard E Grant (why?) There are far better actors out there and personally I think his role should have been played by a female.<br/><br/>Secondly, there is one item referred too throughout the film (almost too many times for my liking) making it obvious how it will be used, especially when Hugh Jackman is recovering, but that said by the time it does happen your that engrossed and care so much for the characters it still works.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting Spandex and happy heroes but I guarantee you won't be disappointed."

","I'm a big fan of the X-men franchise, and especially liked wolverine character. Unfortunately it was been ruined with this last wolverine insatallment. Firstly it has way too much violence, it is completely over the top, also needless profanity, especially considering the previous films. This film is a complete departure, and not in a good way. The story line falls.flat for me, and the writers seem to have change Logan's character completely. And the the child being his daughter was just plain stupid, the fact she has the adamantium was just tenuous at best. Such a shame, as they could have done so much with this film."

The original one or the reset one that made fans go WTF, so everything I watched up to now didn't happen?

And the coordinates of the location are written in a comic book so we know it is real, as comic books are never fake news. I did get a flashback to Mad Max 2 where Mel Gibson is rescued by a group of kids.<br/><br/>As a stand alone film...3 maybe 4 stars. As a sequel to the X-Men saga, this is an F as it puts the final nail into the series coffin that gave as J-Law dressed in blue paint. On the bright side we can now enter a new phase without high dollar stars and create mutants with qualities that suits the script writers in a future world that hopefully will look like a future world.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen did a pretty good job if you like someone who is Christina Ricci Wednesday Addams creepy.<br/><br/>Guide: 48 F-words and not just Hugh Jackman.

","I was looking forward to watching this for months but ended up watching it at home in my home theater after my friend bought it. I am so glad that I waited and that I didn't waste my money.<br/><br/>X 1: This was R-rated. I do watch R-rated movies, but my children are big fans of Marvel super-hero movies and enjoy watching them too. What kind of message does this send if I have to tell them that there are heroes they can sometimes watch and then there are heroes that you can't watch because of nudity and F-words. And yes, the violence was pretty intense too.<br/><br/>X 2: I was bored. Wolverine's first encounter was so-so. He wasn't threatening or scary. He was pathetic. I kept thinking he was going to fall and not get up. Just when you think he is going to call 911, he suddenly pops up and almost seems like his old self for a minute. Then he is back to ""Get me my walker. Where are my pills?"" <br/><br/>X 3: Nudity. At 20:00, he is driving around a bride and her bridesmaids in his limo, and of course she has to ask him to watch while she juggles her breasts. Yes, that was essential to the plot.<br/><br/>X 4: At 37:00 some action starts. I almost got my hopes up. And then we were back to, ""Someone help me up."" When there was action, nothing was held back. Heads and body parts were flying. Blood was splattering. People were dying. Maybe this was more true to form of Wolverine going full tilt...and then he falls down again, waiting for someone to help him up.<br/><br/>Over the years, I was attached to all these characters. By the end of this movie, I was almost hoping everyone would die so I wouldn't have to suffer through another boring movie with these characters. This just did not have the feel of an X-Men movie to me."

","In not very distant future a fatigued Logan who cares for an apparently mindless Charles finds his routine life disturbed by a young mutant who's being hunted by an army of mercenaries. Despite his unfortunate condition, he agrees to escort the young one to the border for safety, but the bad guys are determined to stop them at any cost.<br/><br/>While this plot sounds a bit simplistic and even somewhat clichÃ©, it does its job well, bringing suspense and thrill along the way. Although it doesn't have the epic action and intensity as the X-Men movies, it manages to create a bleary atmosphere in which his events become darker and darker until the predictable but tragic finale. I enjoyed this movie which made me feel strange though, seeing an almost powerless and struggling Wolverine in his attempt to protect the young mutant.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but not as great as its overall rating. You can get sentimental, especially when this movie is supposed to mark the retreat of Logan, but from my point of view, the X-Men movies are better as they provide more action and awesomeness, aspects for which you see such a movie in the first place."

","Sorry this is quite late, I couldn't get to see Logan at my local cinema but anyway, Logan is a terrific film, it follows a weathered Logan, caring for a sick Charles Xavier and his reluctant journey helping a young girl, who may be more than she seems. The reason this film works is how vastly different it is from the others in the X-men series its a lot more bitter and darker and this is reflected in the R-rated violence, the violence is so brutal and would maybe be jarring in a different X-men film but for this darker take on the character of Logan it works. The performances in this film are also on point with Hugh Jackman as always making an awesome Wolverine and also Patrick Stewart who has to play a lot less hopeful and positive Charles Xavier amongst these are also a menacing villain and competent child acting. Overall-A superb entry to the X-men universe and probably my second favorite after Days OF Future Past."

Thankfully,they didn't make Laura a humanized baby groot,her character is fantastic,and she did a really good job as the vicious predator in the form of a little girl.

Nevertheless, I believe the picture quality could have been adjusted to the best level. I don't underscore the quality, but of course I have come across movies with exceptionally intelligent pictures. For instance, Revenant's gory concept could have been adopted here."
"ryukang-41655","10","4","9","10 June 2017"," Thank you, Hugh Jackman...
","Logan is a well made and tearful swan song for Hugh Jackman as the title protagonist, and is quite possibly the best film adapted from a Marvel property since Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>The film defies superhero conventions by being a gritty Western-like picture that delivers on the gory violence we expected from Wolverine while earning its R rating for reasons beyond the spectacle.<br/><br/>This time around, Hugh Jackman portrays Logan as an older man who is broken (physically and emotionally) by the loss of his teammates of the X-Men, and his special abilities slowly deteriorating and poisoning him to the point where he could die. Jackman goes out with a bang (or a huge claw slash, in this case) by delivering a strong performance that reminds us of why we became so attached to this character. As far as I'm aware, he IS Logan/Wolverine.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is amazing too, including Patrick Stewart as a frail and unintentionally dangerous Charles Xavier, and newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura, a young runaway Mutant with some of the same DNA that Logan carries. The two especially share a huge on and off screen bond with Jackman to the point where you truly believe they are a family.<br/><br/>After two PG-13 attempts at a Wolverine movie and the success of Deadpool, 20th Century Fox gave into fans' expectations by going all out with the high R-rated gore levels and adult themes and language one would expect from a character as ferocious and ill-tempered as Wolverine. Though the film is light on action, the set pieces that are in the film are well executed, and gleefully brutal with a sense of grittiness and realism to them (for a comic book movie, that is). <br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the film plays less like a superhero movie, and more like a Western in the same light as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, which Jackman has admitted to being the main influence for this movie. The darker tone is perfectly consistent as it knows exactly what it is, and what it wants to be.<br/><br/>The plot moves along nicely, and is surprisingly thoughtful and metaphorical, coming from a comic book movie.<br/><br/>While it saddens me that this is Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine, it's still a great movie that stands out as one of the best of the genre, and his legacy as the character will never die."

In both tone and aesthetic, it typically plays much more like a Western than ""Superhero movie"".<br/><br/>Much has been made of its R-rating--a rarity in a genre that aims for mass appeal and merchandising--and for good reason. It's not just a few f-bombs and a little gore tossed in as window dressing. Though it's a little excessiveÂ at times, like a kid who's just turned 21 and overindulgesÂ because the shackles are now off, it's mostly used to good effect.Â  Hugh Jackman is Logan/Wolverine, and God help whoever eventually takes over the role (either in a reboot or a retcon or whatever is going on in the increasingly convoluted X-Men saga), and he's never been better than he is here. In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see his named bandied about come awards season. That also goes for Patrick Stewart, who is every bit Jackman's equal as the painfully frail Dr. Xavier.<br/><br/>Logan goes on for a bit too long, and I wasn't completely satisfied with some of the choices made in its third act, but it's a well made, flawlessly acted and refreshingly personal film that proves there's more to this genre than costumes and leveling cities."

","It's not 6, but more of a 6.5 - Definitely not a 7. I'll just straight up write the pros & cons -<br/><br/>pros-<br/><br/>Amazing action scenes. The best I've seen in any ""wolverine"" movie. They were intense with good pacing, excellent camera work and a lot of creative moments. (The grenades, the clone). Plus, they added to some of the action VERY dramatic scenes (Like with the person who hosted them, after Logan fought his clone).<br/><br/>A dark tone which is very intriguing since they executed it nicely.<br/><br/>Interesting plot (But there will be a related con). It starts off as vague, and as the movie progresses, as any good movie, it unravels the layers of the plot and the cause\purpose\destination. (Or all three of them)<br/><br/>Intense, dramatic, emotional moments that just might bring a tear to your eye. (But a related con will show up)<br/><br/>Cons- (Contains major spoilers)<br/><br/>The plot. As much as it was interesting and creative, it didn't deliver for me. The main goal of our characters was to get to a place that just might not exist. But we don't get closure about it. In the end of the movie, we don't get to see the main freaking goal of the movie! The destination! The most crucial thing, and we don't get to see it! Is the destination in the comics truly fake and made up, or it's a hint to a real Eden, safe place, a haven?! <br/><br/>The good dramatic scenes. Again, just like the main plot - No closure. We don't get any closure in the relationship of Logan & the professor. (spoiler) We get a short moment where the professor acknowledges and finally understands Logan... But alas, it was a freaking clone that ended up murdering him, hence Logan (and us) won't get the closure we so much wanted. Only a hinted, or half assed one. 2 more examples of ruined scenes: (spoilers)<br/><br/>1. Laura holding Logan's hand. He ruined the moment with a fit of rage. How I think they should've handled it: Let him stand there for a few moments and just collapse, instead of having a childish fit and then collapsing. The fit painted Logan as a child instead of a grieving & angry adult. <br/><br/>2. When Logan and Laura talked about him staying behind, he talked with the vocabulary & complexity of a 7 years old. <br/><br/>Dull ""villains""- They were interesting, but barely presented. I wanted some back story, at least about the mercenaries. (We did get a short summary about that evil doctor guy, so there's that).<br/><br/>And one last thing... HOW IS THAT CONNECTED TO THE MESSY TIMELINE OF THE XMEN SERIES!? It's after ""days of future past"", or ""what if days of future past never happened"", like seriously, wtf?"
"vetoswarn","10","4","9","31 May 2017"," Exhilarating
","The movie Logan may be my favorite release of the year. It keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire movie doing a perfect blend of drama and action. Never to much dull time, and all though everyone is dead and you don't really get to witness what actually happened; you feel you are in a dark place along side of Logan and the Professor, as if you have been through hell and back through out all of the xmen movies. X-23 acting was sublime; I was a fan as soon as she entered and she only got better. She skipped the typical confused daughter crying stage and wouldn't take crap from anyone; she was very much Logan when he was in the first film but she managed to take this role and make you feel she has so much potential and you want to see more of her and her friends. Although it looks like the end of Logan X23 and the gang give a lot to look forward to and hope for. Well done!!"
"henryluck","10","4","9","31 May 2017"," Logan Review: Blades of Brilliant Sorrow
","Listen to me right now, because I'm gonna tell you why Logan is one of the best superhero films I've seen in ages. I know that it may be clichÃ© now since the film's been out for a few months, but if you haven't seen the film yet just here me out.<br/><br/>The film stars Hugh Jackman as a past his day Wolverine (Logan) who's greatest strength has now become his worst weakness. The adamantium that is bound to his skeleton is poisoning him. This is shown when bullets now do a number on Wolverine when he should of been able to pop them out of his body with ease more angry then hurt. Hugh Jackman has really worked hard to portray how much Logan has aged in this film. Hugh Jackman even stated that he went without water for 2 days to help further portray this which is evident when Logan begins stumbling in some scenes, especially near the end. This level of commitment really shows how much Jackman put into this project in order to give his Wolverine character a fitting send-off.<br/><br/>The other actors also do an excellent job of portraying their characters. Patrick Steward has done a superb job of portraying an elderly Charles Xavier who's telepathy powers are starting to deteriorate, forcing him to become isolated from the world under the care of Logan, causing him to go borderline insane.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen also did a superb job in her portrayal of Laura, a violent young girl with powers very similar to Logan as she too has an adamantium skeleton. She is also put under Logan's care without his consent and as Logan is forced to care for her, you definitely see the bond that forms between her, Logan and Charles as Logan must protect Laura from a man named Donald Pierce and his group of soldiers who are hunting for children like Laura to create living weapons out of them. The character designs also matched the characters themselves with elderly characters like Logan wearing vests and old boots and characters like Laura wearing ""brighter"" clothes like denim jackets. It makes the film feel more grounded, more realistic and gives it a ""Last Of Us"" kind of feel as it shows the difference between the young and old.<br/><br/>Speaking of a ""Last Of Us"" kind of feel, the film's violence is absolutely on par with the film's dark nature. The film defies the usual superhero clichÃ©s of saving the world and getting the girl and the usual superhero film rating has been increased from 12 to 15. In fact, Logan rarely feels like a superhero film most of the time and the film is very aware of this when Logan mocks Laura for reading X-Men comics. The action looks slick and bloody stylish and the CGI and green screens rarely looked suspect. The blood and dismemberment was never in your face either. Right from the opening scene from Logan's first fight with a group of thugs vandalising his car, you know this film's gonna be bloody and brilliant. The film's soundtrack and sound also moulded with the violence really well as you could feel every moment claws slashed against flesh like an Old Man Freddy Kruger and the soundtrack that matched the intensity of every action scene flawlessly, especially during the forest massacre.<br/><br/>The film's themes also blow it away from everything else on the market. The theme of loss is present because it is the year 2029 and nearly all mutants on the face of the Earth have been all but extinct. The theme of family is also present because Logan's family are nearly all gone and having to look after Laura has made him rethink about why family is so important. The use of light and darkness adds even more to the sense of hopelessness and sorrow that Logan is facing as you can really sense in the trailers.<br/><br/>James Mangold should feel really proud of himself for Logan. This was definitely the kind of Wolverine film we needed for a character that's so dark but scaled down in previous instalments of the X-Men franchise. It's no bark and all bite! Let's hope more superhero movies follow this trend so we can have more classics like this and The Dark Knight. Here's to a ""lethal"" 17 years Jackman! ðŸ˜ƒ 9.8/10 <br/><br/>Is it better then? The Dark Knight- No. it's without a doubt a close one, but the Dark Knight's slightly superior writing and the theme of insanity slightly edge Logan.<br/><br/>X-Men: Apocalypse- Yes. Logan trumps Apocalypse in almost every way from setting to action and everything else in between.<br/><br/>The Wolverine- Yes. As I said, Logan defies all superhero movie clichÃ©s and tells a darker better tale then what The Wolverine could."

The acting is top notch all the way around and the story is very smart but the director tries too hard to make the film feel like a western when it should feel like an epic last adventure.

"annuskavdpol","5","4","9","15 April 2017"," Logan the movie is all about fighting
","The title of the movie and the main character are both called Logan. Logan is a man developed by a mad-scientist. He has switch-blades coming out of his hands which come out when he is angry. There is a character of a little girl, named Laura, who is a mini-wolverine, and in a round-a-bout way Laura is Logan's daughter. In the movie, Logan and Laura do make a family bond with each other, like robots make bonds with each other. Logan and Laura are mutants and they kill. They are the opposite of pacifists. They kill like animals in order to survive. Like a deer escaping from a lion, or a deer beating a lion in an attack. It is Darwinism. And lucky if the deer can escape a savage lion, like Logan and Laura being able to escape the mad scientists. Logan and Laura both have an instinct to live. They do not seem to have a direct mission in life, like to save other people from the unfairness in the world creating my evil or greed. I did like the reference to the comic book, with the coordinates of a safe-haven. This seemed to be a fantasy which turned out to be a reality. This component gave the film a bit more strength but otherwise the story and plot were both weak."
"midas-jacobs","9","4","9","8 April 2017"," A good ending to Hugh Jackman's take on Wolverine
","""Logan is the final installment in the so called Wolverine trilogy. In this film we meet Logan as a more damaged and depressed man, who's given the task to bring this little mutant to a place called Eden. <br/><br/>James Mangold, the man behind the second film in the Wolverine trilogy, ""The Wolverine"" came back to direct this film. In this film he has proved again that he is a very good visual director. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful with some good use of lighting and color creating very good looking shots throughout the whole film. He didn't only succeed at the visual aspect, but also at the action sequences. They were fast paced, yet easy to follow and also tense full. The pacing overall in the film is really good just in the second act it starts to become a bit slower, but I didn't mind, because the time is well spent. Mangold wasn't the greatest at making the character building scenes as interesting as they could've been, but they nonetheless were pretty good. The CGI wasn't noticeable, but was there and thus pretty good.<br/><br/>The acting was formidable. Hugh Jackman was born to play the character of Wolverine, just like Robert Downey Jr. was for Iron Man and Ryan Reynolds for Deadpool, and gave his all in all of the films in which he played said character, but in ""Logan"", he outdoes himself. He really showed how great of an actor he is. He managed to indulge himself into the character. He looked damaged and depressed and managed to convince me that he was the Wolverine. But not only Hugh Jackman was good. So was his counterpart Dafne Keen. She, especially since her age, was fantastic. She maybe even had one of the biggest challenges, because her character doesn't say anything for around two thirds of the film. She was equally as badass to watch on screen as Hugh Jackman. The two of them made a fun action duo and also had chemistry between them. I liked the fact that their bound grew throughout the whole film and I'd love to see her as the new Wolverine and not just a recast. Patrick Stewart was also great as professor X and the actor of the villain I found to be good as well.<br/><br/>The screenplay was pretty good as well, containing a simple, but effective story , which branched off into much more on the way. The characters were probably the best part of the film, because they have all developed since we got to know them in the original X-men. Logan has become broken down and sick, Charles has aged and has developed a brain disease. I like that throughout the film we get to know more about why Charles is like he is and that he too is a damaged man when he realizes that he killed seven mutants due to his brain disease. Developments like these are hidden throughout the film and are never really pushed into your face. This film utilized those developments and created a sad, depressing film, in which it succeeded without a doubt. The characters were all very well rounded and I found myself caring for them. They all had their depth, unlike in some X-men films, where they solely support on the acting capabilities of the actors. In this film the acting was just the cherry on top. And because of these well-crafted characters, each death was painful to watch. Even the character of X-23 was very good and Dafne nailed her portrayal. She was skeptical with everything that was happening and only trusted in Logan, even though she didn't always show that. The character was quite complex for such a young actress to portray, but I think that she nailed it perfectly. I myself was quite skeptical as well, because of the fact that they gave an unheard-of kid actor a major role in such a serious film, but after seeing the film I'm happy that they chose Dafne to play X- 23. The screenplay wasn't flawless, though. At a point Logan refers to Charles as Charles, even though they're in the company of another family and Logan had given Charles the name of Chuck, but this could also just be a tiny mistake on Hugh Jackman, and I didn't mind that mistake. My problem is that the movie doesn't explain certain things very well, which left me guessing. Questions like ""Why is Wolverine getting poisoned by his own adamentium?"" popped up in my head, but then again, this wasn't really a big flaw, I'd just like some more information on that subject. The villain was just OK, but the film didn't really need him to be better, because the main focus doesn't lay there. <br/><br/>In the end ""Logan"" was one of the better films I've seen that came out in 2017. It's a dark take on the character and it absolutely worked. The film was beautifully shot, with good and gruesome action scenes, that weren't there to be gruesome, but to show the dark and serious tone the film was going for. That's why this film gets a 8.9/10."

But what they failed to tell us, sadly, was that the story was going to take a tragically ill advised left turn later on, until the refreshingly simple concept of grizzled, battle weary Logan and his pretty little companion wound up in some Mad Max looking alternate world, where too many annoying, dull characters were wandered into the story and brought the whole production down a level. This had its moments, mostly from the concept alone, Wolverine and The Little Girl, but ultimately, it was a promise left frustratingly undelivered."
"stlcardinalsfanstl","10","4","9","14 March 2017"," It doesn't get any better than Logan. A MUST SEE!
","I went in with a massive bias against superhero/fantasy movies. I don't care for them. I haven't seen a single X-Men movie. The last superhero movie I watched was probably ten years ago. I simply don't like them. The only reason I went to see Logan was because my friend had an extra ticket. I almost didn't go.<br/><br/>How glad I am that I went. I can't give spoilers, so I'll keep this to my rating only. This movie was perfect. It started off a bit slow, but interesting nonetheless. I was dozing off due to my bias, being slightly tired, and not having any knowledge of the characters. As the story progressed--no more than fifteen minutes in--I was engaged fully. By the end of the movie I was in disbelief. I didn't want it to end. It is a perfectly-constructed movie. The acting--especially Laura's--is amazing. I didn't even know the characters at all and I still was immersed in their stories. It's one of those movies where no actor could have been replaced and had the same outcome. The plot is just as amazing as the acting. A perfect story line that will leave viewers in shock by the time it's finished. <br/><br/>If you know any of the story behind these characters, I can't imagine how much better the movie will be. I feel like my life is better after watching Logan. It's a strange feeling, really. THE PERFECT MOVIE. My favorite movie of all time is Braveheart. If it weren't for my bias keeping Braveheart at #1, I'd say Logan is the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>P.S. If you can, don't watch it in theaters. Unless, of course, you can still feel the same emotions with hundreds of people around. Save this experience for the right time. It's one for the ages."

","March 3, 2017. Girl's Day in Japan. My girlfriend, Japanese, asked to watch Logan to celebrate. It was opening night and it wasn't sold out. We went to the second showing. She loves Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and saw all the X-Men and Wolverine movies to this point. I read comics in the Halcyon era of comics, the mid-80's to mid 90's. I was used to great storytelling and eccentric artwork (Cerebus The Aardvark, Mage - The Hero Discovered, Moonshadow, Nexus), and to this point, I loved watching the X-Men movies just to see characters like Nightcrawler come to life. I didn't think much of the stories in the movies - they're very much aimed at teenage audiences. I think Watchmen was the closest thing to a great comic adaption, but that didn't go over well for movie audiences. I digress.<br/><br/>I didn't know James Mangold directed Logan until the movie started. I saw the trailers but thought Logan looked ho-hum. When Mangold's name appeared on the screen, I told my girlfriend wow! He did Girl, Interrupted and 3:10 To Yuma! I was ready for a great movie. The couple sitting next to us were obviously wanting to see another exciting X-Men movie. They were howling during the Deadpool trailer that lead into the feature movie.<br/><br/>Once Logan got through the initial action scene and went home to see Professor Xavier, things became somber and set the tone for the rest of the movie. The couple next to us leaned forward through most of the movie, totally absorbed and obviously blown away by the unexpected storytelling angle. Logan is a major detour from every Marvel and DC superhero movie adaption to date. Some compare this to the Dark Knight saga. If you thought Heath Ledger was a great Joker, or that Christian Bale was great as Batman... well, I would say that Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Daphne Keen's acting are much more elevated. Logan is a world-class A-list film. Easily Mangold's best work.<br/><br/>There is a scene in a hotel that makes you hold your breath. The couple next to us were white-knuckled, clutching the arms on their chairs and squirming in their seats. When the scene ended, they slumped down and signed from exhaustion. The whole theater was basically breathless.<br/><br/>Somehwere near the middle of the film, there's a scene where Logan, Xavier and Laura are introduced to a farming family and spend a night with them. My girlfriend cried from that point until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Logan, Xavier, Laura and Kaliban - the 4 main characters - are all lovable and likable. The movie trots along at a leisurely pace, letting you enjoy all the little things they encounter on their journey.<br/><br/>If you've seen any of Mangold's previous films, this is his best. If you've seen Hugh Jackman's previous films, this is his best. If you've seen anything of Patrick Stewart's, this is his best. If you've seen any Marvel or DC movies, this is the best. What's not to love about Logan? There is a word that's become pretty synonymous with the name James Mangold. Satisfying. Logan is supremely, supremely satisfying.<br/><br/>I felt honored to watch Logan on opening night. It was better than seeing the original Star Wars movie in the theater back in 1977.<br/><br/>Logan is THAT good."

","Alright, I'll just get straight to the point here. This movie and Mad Max: Fury Road have to be the most overrated movies that have come out in the past two years. However, the only difference between this movie and Fury Road is that, Fury Road was actually a GOOD movie. Overrated, but still good.<br/><br/>This movie just disappointed me so much and the people on IMDb and others of the internet are the main reason why I was so disappointed by this film after seeing it - they hyped the sh*t out of it. Ever since I heard that Logan was going to be released in 2017 I always knew I was going to go see it but I kept my expectations low due to past experiences with the Fox/XMEN franchise. Had I avoided the internet and went and watched the movie, I wouldn't be as disappointed as I am right now because just a few days before I saw it, my spirit was falsely lifted and I was misled into believing that this was something different - but it's not. Honestly, it's not.<br/><br/>So what's bad about the movie? Oh, nothing new (in the context of the Fox/XMEN franchise) - weak plots, terrible CGI, unconvincing stunts, poor action and bad character development...the usual stuff, literally - nothing new. Keep your expectations at this level and you'll leave the theatre satisfied, trust me.<br/><br/>However, not all is bad about this movie - the picture, the sound-tracking and the acting are quite good to be honest. Hugh Jackman gives a very good performance in the first two acts until he loses his touch as the plot also loses its mojo in the very clearly unclear third act but that's nothing to complain about. Sir Patrick Stewart was also good but I didn't enjoy his performance that much but good nonetheless.<br/><br/>I'm not going to dwell on a lot because I might go on forever. Basically what you need to know is that this movie is nothing new (overall) from what we've been given by this franchise and don't even get me started on the desperate and lousy attempt at being R Rated. You've seen one Wolverine movie, you've seen them all. I'm one of the few people who believes that the best film this franchise has ever given us was First Class (what a beauty). The Weapon X story that was being set up in Apocalypse would've been a worthier effort honestly if they stuck with the continuity.<br/><br/>This movie is a solid 6 at best."

","'LOGAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The third and final standalone Wolverine movie (and the 10th installment in the 'X-MEN' cinematic film universe); once again based on the popular Marvel Comics character, with Hugh Jackman reprising his most iconic role (for supposedly the last time). The film has an aging Wolverine traveling across a dystopian future America, in order to help a special young mutant girl. The movie also costars Patrick Stewart (reprising one of his two most iconic roles, once again, as Professor Xavier), Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Richard E. Grant and Stephen Merchant. It was directed by James Mangold (who also helmed 2013's 'THE WOLVERINE'), and it was written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green. The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office, so far, and it's received nearly unanimous positive reviews, from critics and fans alike. I enjoyed it as well. <br/><br/>The story is set in the year 2029, when mutants are almost entirely extinct. Logan (Jackman) is now aging like a human does, due to the fact that his adamantium skeleton is now poisoning his body (and it's stopped healing him as well). He's now working as a chauffeur driver, in Texas, and helping to take care of Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart); who's suffering from a disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities. Logan is approached by a nurse (Elizabeth Rodriguez), who wants him to help transport an 11- year- old girl (Keen), with very special powers, to a place in North Dakota. Logan reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>The movie is surprisingly dark, and extremely dramatic. It's definitely a very serious character study, and not a fun action flick like it's predecessors. The movie is also shockingly violent; and it's the second 'X-MEN' film to be rated R, in as many years (following last year's blockbuster 'DEADPOOL'). Hugh Jackman is also fantastic in the lead, giving arguably his best performance in the role. For all of these reasons, I really respect this movie. Like I said, it's not a fun comic book flick (like some might be expecting), but it is a really well made drama film. It's actually the type of superhero movie that could finally get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but we'll have to wait and see about that.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/203409666"

","In this James Mangold (Walk the Line, Girl, Interrupted) directed and written - along with Scott Frank (Minority Report, The Wolverine) and Michael Green (Green Lantern, Everwood) screenplay - film, Hugh Jackman (The Prestige, Prisoners) stars as Logan/Wolverine, a now drunk and in pain shadow of his former self. He drives a limo to earn money and hides out with Professor X/Charles (Sir Patrick Stewart: Star Trek, X-Men) who has the beginnings of dementia and Caliban (Stephen Merchant: The Office, Cemetery Junction) an albino tracker mutant. Charles tries to warn them that a new child mutant needs their help, but until he meets Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez: Miami Vice, The Drop) during a funeral, he just thinks she is another potential job.<br/><br/>When Pierce (Boyd Holbrook: Milk, Gone Girl) threatens him unless he tells him if he has contact with Gabriela, he ignores the advice, but when Gabriela is killed and he sees for himself what the child, Laura (Dafne Keen: The Refugees) can do, he realises why Pierce wants her.<br/><br/>She is the product of a secret series of experiments on children by Dr Rice (Richard E. Grant: Withnail and I, Corpse Bride) and she wants to go to over the border to Eden, where she hopes to be reunited with the others.<br/><br/>It's 2029 and in this new world, where mutants have been exterminated and there are few of them left hiding, Logan is a man adrift in a world that no longer needs him. Caring for his former mentor who he has to control for his own good, he is a man without a true purpose and who is hurrying towards death.<br/><br/>Unlike other X-Men movies, there are fewer nods back to earlier films and it is stronger for this. We are able to delve deep into the characters of Logan and X, plus see what they, and new mutant Laura, have missed out on in life that others take for granted. A particular poignant storyline involves the Munford family, Will (Eriq La Salle: ER, Coming to America), Kathryn (Elise Neal: Hustle & Flow, Scream 2) and Nate (Quincy Fouse: K. C. Undercover, The Goldbergs), who bring this home with stark reality.<br/><br/>Ever since Deadpool, movies seem obsessed with using gore and violence, seeming not to understand that why Deadpool worked was not just that, it was the kick-ass smart-mouth and there were moments of that, but nowhere near enough to justify that level of brutal death. I suspect this is because in this movie, they wanted to be true to the comic Wolverine and if this is the case, then yes, they delivered with bells on. It's just a pity they didn't do this earlier when Jackman was younger and Logan would not have been in need of a special injection to boost him up to his best.<br/><br/>If you are expecting a super-hero movie, don't go but if you want to see the real Wolverine, book now."
"view_and_review","10","4","9","5 March 2017"," Super Abilities Second to Super Story
","Bravo.<br/><br/>Encore! Encore!<br/><br/>This is what Wolverine is about, this is the Wolverine movie I'd been waiting for.<br/><br/>""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was alright. ""The Wolverine"" was about just as mediocre, but this... this was a masterpiece. This had depth, this had feeling, this had character.<br/><br/>Logan is an older, disheveled, drunker, surlier character with diminishing abilities. He is rock bottom. Probably not the ideal Wolverine but it makes his character so much more layered. This is a Wolverine you will be familiar with but maybe slightly impatient with as well. But one thing is for sure, this movie (hence Wolverine) benefited from an R rating. It wasn't an R rating just for the sake of cheap sexual jokes or gratuitous nudity, rather it was an R rating in order for Wolverine to be Wolverine: a cutthroat killer that uses his claws for more than just neatly puncturing people. <br/><br/>As for Charles Xavier, he is older and suffering from the effects of old age which has diminished his abilities as well as made him highly volatile. They are alone with hardly any mutants left and not much more to live for--that is until a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) comes into their lives.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen is wonderful as the little Laura. She has limited lines but she commands the screen nonetheless. She was both adorable and formidable and an indispensable part of the story line.<br/><br/>If you're looking for non-stop action, this isn't the movie for you. If you're looking for a good story with structure and pace and some well placed potent action, then this is for you. The movie may have been slow for some, but I'm an adult and I can tolerate a slow movie that has a purpose. <br/><br/>This was so much grittier and realler than just about any comic book/superhero movie. There was no saving the world, no saving the galaxy, not even saving a small town, but there was saving--and there was sacrifice. I love the movies that aren't afraid to make us angry or make us sad. Not the cheap anger that comes with every bad guy, or the cheap sadness that comes with the death of a good guy. I mean those movies, such as this one, that can cultivate and build to make an authentic anger and an authentic sadness. Not everyone can be saved, not everyone lives happily ever after and not everyone changes for the better. We try to reach those in need of saving--both literally and figuratively--but some people you can't reach. This movie had that.<br/><br/>I could wax on much longer about this film I love it so much. For the sake of brevity I will conclude with this: Logan is that superhero movie done so well that the super abilities are second to the super story."

","In a hideout near the U.S./Mexico border, an ageing Logan cares for the ailing Professor X who is suffering from a form of dementia. <br/><br/>But their sheltered existence comes to a end when a young mutant girl arrives and needs their help to stay safe.....<br/><br/>Last year's Deadpool showed audiences and the studios just how successful an adult orientated comic book hero film can be.<br/><br/>Logan show's how well an adult orientated comic book film is.<br/><br/>The last two standalone Wolverine films were very lacklustre to say the least, they had no coherence, felt rushed, and just didn't have the consistency to tell the story of one of the most interesting comic book heroes of all time.<br/><br/>But this film, goes above and beyond the call of duty to tell the final chapter in the titular characters story, and it's been worth the wait since we were introduced to Wolverine back in august 2000.<br/><br/>As you all know, it's not your atypical comic book film. It's not effervescent, it's not full of wonderful humour and groundbreaking effects, it doesn't feature talking ducks or gods, this is a western, a western with mutants.<br/><br/>If you look outside of the box, this is a film about oppression, an oppression that's been exploited by the masses via comic books and legend, and it's quite meta that the film let's the full universe into the film subliminally via what's in the films backpack.<br/><br/>For what's going on in the world, this is a very topical film, the three are outcasts, no one warms to them, almost everyone are antagonised by them aside from....the African American family who take them in for the night to offer them a meal.<br/><br/>The film also focuses on redemption, and how the narrative will not let certain characters redeem themselves. In one scene in-particular, a character confesses something to someone, but it falls on dead ears, because it's not the person they thought it was.<br/><br/>Jackman is brilliant, and in his ninth performance as Logan, he's putting his all in this. This is his definitive performance as Logan, both physically and verbally. Gone is the wise-cracking hero who had a rapport with his colleagues, this Logan has demons, he's lonely, and dependent on alcohol. His body is strewn with scars, and it feels as if he's just waiting to die.<br/><br/>Stewart, as well, is wonderful. Again totally different to how you've seen Xavier before, more short tempered, but he has an unconditional love for Logan that cannot be broken. The dinner scene is probably on of the most touching scenes I've seen in this genre, proving that these two are platonic soul mates, and would do anything for one another.<br/><br/>There are a few surprises in the film, all changing the course of the narrative, and then there's the case with the violence.<br/><br/>It's pretty shocking, there are quite a few wince inducing moments, but the profanity is thrown around everywhere, and it feels like they are trying to get as many f-bombs in this film as they can.<br/><br/>Many are comparing this to 'Shane' the comparisons are rife, right up to them watching the film, and referencing lines, but the relationship between Logan and the girl slightly reminded me of the relationship between Costner and the boy in Eastwood's 'A Perfect World'.<br/><br/>The villains in the film are your atypical soldier types with tattoo's and swagger, and the backstory about the girl is again, focusing on oppression and borderline slavery.<br/><br/>But it's a monumental film, one of the best comic book films released thus far, and I think that the MCU may have to rethink their safe strategy with their films, as this is Marvel's The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>outstanding...."
"jackransom-69832","10","4","9","2 March 2017"," Logan - His Time Has Come
","Saw 'Logan' yesterday it was one of (if not) my host hyped for movies of this year. This is not a typical comic book movie at all and is nothing like any if the X-Men franchise, if it didn't feature the characters of Wolverine, Professor X etc. then it could easily be mistaken as a completely different movie. This film is a dark, depressing, brutally violent drama action movie. The film see's Logan (Hugh Jackman) at the end of his rope, his healing factor is going and the admantium in his body is poisoning him, he's relying on alcohol and drugs to numb the pain, he also now a limo driver for hire to pay for medication of Professor X (Patrick Stewart) who due to his ability is experiencing brain seizures which are affecting everyone around him, he is also being looked after by the mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant). However unexpectedly a young girl (Dafne Keen) (I won't spoil who she is and why) enters Logan's life and we find out she is being hunted by a group called 'The Reavers' led by Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and this leads into a chase/road movie spread over the 2hrs 17 mins. The acting in this movie is brilliant, this seals the fact that no-one can replace Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, this is his best portrayal of the character and seeing go full berserker mode was one of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen, Patrick Stewart is as good as you'd expect as Charles Xavier he's becoming more insane and reacting to the drugs which is affecting his behaviour, also hearing both him and Logan drop the f- bomb didn't feel wrong or forced because it shows just how sick they are of everything that's happened. This is Dafne Keen's first movie and she is also brilliant, it's not often like 6 or 7 year old girl can be menacing but she acts this part really well and she works well with Logan & Xavier, for me the most unexpected casting was Stephen Merchant as Caliban, however it works really well he's sarcastic, creepy and it's interesting seeing Merchant in a non- comedic role. Last Boyd Holbrook plays Pierce well, he is a menacing and threatening villain and immediately dislikeable (which is the point). This film is R-Rated/15 for a reason, honestly seeing those claws slashing throats, stabbing heads, chopping limbs was incredible, it's what I've wanted to see my whole life, these action scenes are brutal and grounded and as the director said no CGI is featured. 'Logan' is the wolverine film I've always wanted to see and is nothing like any other comicbook movie."

the little girl's psychotic violence is over the top. The only part of the film I even liked was when Logan tore up the car thieves. After that it went downhill fast and hit bottom....then started to dig. Our time will be better spent watching the earlier films."
"CinematicInceptions","7","3","6","17 November 2017"," Doesn't live up to the hype.
","I had high hopes going into this movie, and while I wasn't totally disappointed I must brand it an overrated movie. Maybe this is new territory for superhero movies, but it's hardly new territory for movies in general. As someone who's not primarily a superhero fan, I like the X-Men superhero world better than most other superhero movies. The stories are much more engaging because the X-Men are treated like a minority group rather than protectors of humanity. Also the plots are character driven in a really good way, and that made me have good expectations for Logan. This is the first Wolverine movie I've seen, so maybe I shouldn't have expected it to be like the other X-Men movies. <br/><br/>Logan is definitely the superhero that most deserves this sort of grittier story, but I think they pushed it a little too much in the wrong ways. The blood and gore was a little bit much, although it was good that the action sequences actually had people dying in them. The body count in this movie makes up a little bit for the lack of deaths caused by other superhero/super villain fights. But it did get to be a bit much. The excessive amount of death in the earlier half of the movie made it less shocking or powerful when Xavier, Caliban, and even Logan himself died. There was maybe more strong language than there needed to be. It wasn't totally excessive, but having Professor X start dropping F-bombs felt weird after seeing him as so level headed for so many movies. Maybe that was the intent.<br/><br/>There was a decent theme with Logan trying to keep Laura from being exploited and used as a weapon like he was. The theme with Logan hoping for a more normal and simple life was not handled as proficiently in my opinion. I guess it just never connected enough to the plot for it to matter. I think the reason that the themes were lacking was because there were not enough active choices from Logan or really any other character. The plot was motivated by Logan, Charles, and Laura running away from Pierce and his men, which didn't leave a lot of room for the characters to make active decisions. Yes, there are a couple, but in a movie that seems to be centered around the character of Logan more than anything else, there should have been more focus on his arc.<br/><br/>I also noticed that the action choreography and special effects weren't that good for this kind of movie. That's not exactly a good thing, but at least somebody felt like it was okay to save money and have Laura's jumps look a little fake. There was also practically nothing in the set design to suggest that the movie took place in the future. This is definitely an area where Logan sets itself apart from the effects-heavy comic book adaptations. We still get plenty of action, but it is a brutal kind of action rather than the fantastical supernatural sequences that superhero movies typically feature. Maybe that is what people are talking about when they say that it ""transcends the genre"".<br/><br/>I won't say that you shouldn't watch this. Comic book fans will probably see it anyway, but for those who are speculating over the hype I'll say this: it's not bad, but it's really nothing special. Overall Rating: 7.5/10."
"tobysillett","5","3","6","15 November 2017"," Not as good as people say
","I'm no critic or film buff so I'm not pretending that this is anything other than an opinion. Basically, if you think you're going to watch a wolverine film, you're not. It's okay, would probably be more enjoyable if it was a different character. For years we've seen wolverine in unrealistic marvel universe films and then for some reason, Marvel try to create a film in the 'real' work almost. And make it more gritty than it needs to be. More gratuitous swearing than we've ever heard in a marvel film too. I'm not prudish, it just felt very forced like they were trying too hard to make a real film/movie instead of their normal mindless fun escapism. Also, what is with the scene when they stay with the black family?! If they know they're being hunted why would they hold up there and put innocent people at risk?! That just annoyed me as it was just so out of character and added nothing to the story line/plot. It also bugged me just how rude and uncaring he was to his kid. Yes, he did the right thing in the end etc. but again, he was uncharacteristically harsh to a child. It's still worth a watch, it's just not the marvel they think it is (did you see what I did there?). Laters"
"ena-45782","4","3","6","5 October 2017"," This script smells like the work of some cinematography major fresh out of college
","-----disclaimer------ Ever since I started being a movie junkie, I have never given any slightest attention to movie reviews, especially those percentages on RottenTomatoes or IMDb. I encourage everyone else to do the same, make your own judgment for a movie based on your preferences instead of letting someone else telling you what to like or to dislike. The following review is my very first review without the intention of persuasion. Also, I don't spoil. Any possible detail related to the movie in my review can all be seen in trailers. -----review----------<br/><br/>Superhero movies, in my regard, should serve a purpose of giving the younger generation hopes, inspirations, or courage for life. I believe that is why some of the famous superhero comics came out in the first place. The movie 'Logan' features the well-known characters Professor Xavier(brain) and Wolverine(brawn), but it paints a gloomy picture for these two characters' journey as if it attempts to constantly remind the audience that there is a supposedly forced reality kicking in. It seems that the script targets at a certain range of audience which clearly includes adults but not primarily the younger generation despite the fact the script implies the notion of legends passed on from generation to generation. I have no objection about it, am only slightly disappointed about a gloomy superhero movie with such great characters in it.<br/><br/>The second thing I intend to point out here is that, it seems that this movie does not want to give a clearer background of the antagonists. If the antagonists were given a much fairer amount of time to be introduced to the audience, I am sure I as one of the audience would not feel as if the villains are bunch of coyotes coming out of nowhere chasing down the protagonists on the road. If I want a script which puts more focus on action and less on the reason behind, I would prefer watching pornography. <br/><br/>Third, the plot holes. I am sure many have pointed out several major plot holes in previous reviews, as a guy who promises not to spoil, I will say no more. Every movie has sins, plot holes are considered sins as well. However, when they are too many, the story is thus ruined.<br/><br/>Last, let's imagine ourselves to be the screenwriter: ""Hey, let's have a senile wise man, an invincible tough guy who is known for having lived for a long long time of life but now all of a sudden has trouble staying that way, and a little young girl, make these three on a road trip while being chased down by villains! That would be awesome!"" When I was somewhere in the mid of the movie, I started to question myself: who wrote this simple minded d screenplay?! <br/><br/>There are in fact more to talk about to express my dissatisfaction toward this movie, but those would involve spoiling the plot so I will stop here. Overall, I have to say, the script is predicable, too predicable. This is the kind of script that I would expect from the drama contests back in my university days."

"MrTeaNCrumpets","7","3","6","28 September 2017"," A satisfying end for the Hugh Jackman Wolverine
","This is the best film of the X-Men series and a great end for the Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman. Things like the gore, profanity, Comic Book Inclusion/Reference were all very appreciated, backed up with the thrilling action and surprisingly emotional tone of the film only improved the experience. It felt like the film went on quite a while, however I found I never became disinterested or unsatisfying, not to mention the death of Professor X was an amazingly done scene.<br/><br/>Some of the issues I had with the film was the horrible soundtrack, a very forgettable villain, the way it felt like they were setting up a new set of films in a series that has passed it's sell-by date, how the other children were not hunted in a similar fashion, the lack of a good explanation for the death of incredibly powerful mutants such as Magneto and Pheonix, the somewhat anti-climactic death of Wolverine, plot hole in the death of X-24 (His brain is capable of healing) and the fact it is part of the already confusing story line that is the X-Men films.<br/><br/>It may seem like there's more negatives than positives here, but the pros outweigh the cons and I highly recommend seeing this film if you're a fan of the X-Men films, you will enjoy it."
"jamesrupert2014","7","3","6","16 September 2017"," Grim entry into the Wolverine saga: a big improvement over its two antecedents
","'Logan' continues the darkening trend in 'super-hero' movies, and being rated ""R"", was allowed to be gruesome in addition to being grim and dark. The plot is pretty thin: essentially 'Logan' is a 'bonding-during-a-road-trip' movie back-dropped by the X-Men mythos. The storyline allows Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart to showcase their acting abilities (a big step up for both from the 2D comic book characters they played in other entries in the franchise). There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies, but that's nothing new for the genre and, all in all, the story is interesting and (spoilers hinted at) its position in the overall X-man/Wolverine story-arc allows outcomes not possible in earlier chapters. Probably as close to that oxymoron ""an adult-superhero movie"" as I've seen (other than the much superior ""The Dark Knight""). A bit slow at times but generally watchable: not as great as some reviewers gush but a lot better than many of the entries in the Marvel (or DC) film-verse"

","Take out fighting and killing - slaughtering and you get a pretty descent drama. I was actually very surprised that the movie had a story frame. Of course it is a fictional movie but has much more real elements that makes in more believable, much more grown up and mature. The Logan character was deeper, more life like and the whole story has some neat details which makes it a good movie. Of course Patrick Stewart was very good. The movie itself is very well directed and has plenty things going on and it leaves you with a feeling that movie is very long. Which it actually is with over 2h and 10m long. There could have been less fighting, but the director probably had to follow guidelines to make it more action like. Besides X-Men: First class which was great and X-Men: Days of Future Past which fell somehow behind the first one, Logan is the only X-men movie I like. All others were mostly story-less and dumb and childish."
"Jackbv123","6","3","6","23 July 2017"," A Milestone in the X-Men story, but not a truly great movie
","45 minutes of this movie elapsed before there was any significant attempt at a plot other than the fact that Logan and Xavier were very down and out. During that 45 minutes there was extensive gore and violence including several cases of men stabbed in the head by Logan's claws. There was one scene where the child, Laura, rolls a decapitated head which presumably was a result of her own fighting. I think Logan said either the F word or S word more frequently than any coherent sentence. Since there was no chance this movie would not be R rated, there was also a short flash of women's breasts just so the movie could be labeled as having nudity. (There are cases where producers actually find this advantageous.) Logan repeatedly uses either drugs or alcohol.<br/><br/>The movie improves from there. We get some plot to explain where the movie should go next and why. The goal is to try to get Laura to Eden.<br/><br/>All the violence and vulgar language continues through the rest of the movie, including at least one blood-spurting decapitation. It also includes the unnecessary killing of a mother and her teen son and then later torture of ""mutant"" children. Even the ""mutant"" children commit extreme acts of gore. I cannot overemphasize how much gore and violence there was.<br/><br/>We do learn more about Laura's origins and there are several other significant events that occur that are extremely relevant in the ongoing X-Men story.<br/><br/>In the ratings, I see a very high percentages of 10 votes, 9 votes and 8 votes. I have to assume that the people gave those votes did so because of the significance of events that take place in the story and their enjoyment level. This is no where near an all-time classic movie. I don't even rate it among the best of the X-Men saga.<br/><br/>The villains were all cliché and overplayed. Hugh Jackman did nothing in the way of credible acting. I don't know if Patrick Stewart was acting like he was feeble or if he is just actually getting old, but even so, not his best performance. For much of the movie Dafne Keen did not speak and tried to look fierce and vicious a lot, which is a little hard for the size of girl she is. Later, she showed some promise, especially with events at the end. Basically, IF there was any acting in this moving, it was done by the children.<br/><br/>I still give this a generous rating of 6. This is because after the first 45 minutes the plot became much more interesting."

Because we know one character has the consciousness from the original timeline & a second character is an alternate version due to the altered timeline from Days Of Future Past.<br/><br/>I didn't dig the Children Of Men-style plot, the super soldier-esque serum, X-24 & the exaggerated healing abilities of the former.<br/><br/>The first half of the film was good, but started to fall apart with the introduction of the family & X-24. I had hoped for a better final outing for Hugh Jackman, rather then a partial rehash of The Wolverine (the subsided healing factor, the clinic scene!!).<br/><br/>Regardless despite some of the X-Men & stand alone Wolverine films lacking in quality, I truly admire the commitment Jackman gave to this role.

If Deadpool brought something new to the genre with tons of swearing, blood, violence, and nudity, Logan is one of those superhero film you can call ""dark"" and ""adult-only"". It's full of amazing actions, drama, and acting. Both Jackman and Stewart deserve an Oscar nod (But unfortunately, I don't see it happening).

","Released in 2017 and directed by James Mangold, ""Logan"" takes place in 2029 when loner Logan, aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), is a weary Uber driver near the border in West Texas. No new mutant has been birthed for 25 years and Wolvie lives with the Alzheimer's-suffering Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and the albino mutant-tracking Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in an abandoned smelting plant across the border. After a mysterious new mutant girl enters the picture (Dafne Keen), Logan, Xavier and the lass flee for possible sanctuary in North Dakota hounded by a malevolent security team from the dubious corporation in which the girl originated. Donald Pierce plays the arrogant cybernetics-enhanced chief of security.<br/><br/>This is the third and arguably the best Wolverine movie, although I slightly prefer 2009's underrated ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2013's ""Wolverine"" was okay, but overall meh). ""Logan"" focuses on aging & death contrasted by new birth and the potential thereof. For a superhero flick, it's gritty realistic with compelling drama & characters and an entertaining road trip, not to mention loads of hard R-rated violence. The movie explores the possibilities of what would happen when high-powered mutants become aged and diseased.<br/><br/>Some of classic Marvel Comics' best moments were when one of their superheroes, e.g. The Thing or The Black Panther, was thrust into an everyday scenario, like talking to regular folks on the street or shopping at the market. There's a lot of this in ""Logan."" It dares to slow things down and focus on the characters and is the better for it. One of the best extended sequences is the trio's meeting with a hospitable black family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal & Quincy Fouse) after a highway mishap somewhere north of Oklahoma City. This episode is Exhibit A in why ""superheroes"" can't mix with regular folk for too long, for their own welfare.<br/><br/>""Logan"" ranks with the best superhero movies because, like 2009's ""Watchmen,"" it dares to be different. It's anything BUT a conventional superhero flick. Unfortunately, it's overlong at 141 minutes. The movie should've ended shortly after the trio's arrival to their destination, with some kind of potent dramatic close. But the filmmakers insisted on tacking on yet ANOTHER action-packed attack by the antagonists and it therefore ends on a tedious, redundant note. Disregarding this caveat, ""Logan"" is a great 'superhero' flick.<br/><br/>My favorite mutant, by the way, is the chubby black boy.<br/><br/>The film was shot in Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Newhall, California; and Pauls Valley & Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

","As I big fan of Marvel and indeed the X-Men, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Logan more than any other recent X-Men film, perhaps with the exception of First Class in 2011. There have been numerous films surrounding Wolverine in recent years, and I don't think any of them have been terrible, but this one is by far the strongest.<br/><br/>I love superhero based movies, even if most of them appear predictable. For example, I really liked the last Avengers film, but it was admittedly predictable. Logan however, is far from predictable. Set in a somber era for mutants, Logan keeps us guessing about what has led to this current state of affairs for the X-Men, and keeps us invested in what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>The movie plays on your emotions too, especially if you have a previous attachment to the franchise. In terms of action it keeps it exciting and never really goes over the top (with the possible exception of Laura's first introduction as a mutant). Indeed, the visuals are fantastic and the story is very well written. I can't give the bad guy enough praise too, so often in films nowadays we see a dull antagonist... not in Logan. The character development is fantastic, adding to the whole strength of the film in general.<br/><br/>Marvel fans go see Logan... in fact, I advocate non-fans to go too, you may not understand the timeline but you will be entertained. Enjoy!"

Anyone who has ever driven through east Kansas and east Nebraska knows there are no mountains anywhere. <br/><br/>Why did the kids just run through the woods and not fight back until right at the very last moment? They have super powers. It just screamed of stupidity.

"isaiahwilson15","9","5","13","15 March 2017"," A near perfect swan song for Hugh Jackman's grounded, ragged, and above all anamalistic portrayal of the Wolverine.
","Over the course of my lifetime, I have heard countless stories of actors and actresses, before my time, becoming icons through breakout roles that would become synonymous with their very name. However, as previously stated, most of these roles were either before my time. Never did I expect to see the emergence of an unknown Australian stage actor that I would grow up with for the next 17 years over the course of 9 movies, 3 Spidermen, 2 Batmen, 2 Supermen, and 2 Hulks. Hugh Jackman has embodied the Wolverine character in a way that has changed the way people perceive the the comic book counterpart. Whether its his image, voice, personality, or any other trait, Jackman has become inseparable from the Wolverine character. A feat that I am really overjoyed to have experienced growing up, and was genuinely sad to let go heading into this movie.<br/><br/>Anyway with that out the way, the movie itself is an absolute masterpiece. It not only provides the most accurate incarnation of Logan, but also takes the time to explore a broken side of Charles Xavier we've never seen. Then finishes with the introduction of X-23 who has the strong potential to be just as popular as her father.The introduction, interaction, and insight into these characters proves to be the strongest element of this film. The relationship between Logan and Xavier developed over the course of the past 16 movies finally has its payoff as every scene packs the emotional weight that hasn't been experienced in a superhero movie yet.These relationships then help in the introduction and explanation of Laura.<br/><br/>In discussing breakout movie roles for actors and actresses, Dafne Keen may quickly find herself on that list. Portraying a mutant is already difficult enough, but not having any dialogue for the first half of the film while also playing the daughter of the Wolverine, its a tough task for even the most ""expert"" actors. This girl handles her role with such skill that allows her to stand out in a scene with Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. That's without even mentioning her brutality once the claws come out!!<br/><br/>I could go on and on about these characters, performances, and I haven't even gotten to the action yet, but no movie is without its flaws. Logan primarily struggles with its villains their motivations. Both villains while given an ample amount of attention, don't really shine essentially due to their vague and simple motivations.This is however combated by the presence of a lethal threat which provides a nice twist that was entirely unexpected. <br/><br/>So this is it. James Mangold, 20th Century Fox, and Hugh Jackman save their best for last with an all-time great movie that once again transcends the ""superhero"" genre. This classification will unfortunately immediately cause many to compare it to the Dark Knight which has and will always reign king among this newly found category of superhero movies. While I would stray away from making these comparisons myself, I will state that Logan does a number of better than this seemingly untouchable movie. It truly is a near perfect film to end Hugh Jackman's on-screen portrayal of an all- time great comic book hero, James/Logan Howlett AKA Weapon X AKA The Wolverine."

","The third trump card of Wolverine stand-alone movie has all the elements needed in order to craft a movie that is worthy enough to call an art. Logan also marks the ending of a great legacy left by Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine and of course Sir Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. <br/><br/>Here's the strength of this movie, the plot is pretty straightforward and simple but it was enough to make the audience shocked in every part especially when X-24 emerged. Hugh Jackman, again made a great job portraying and ailing Wolverine with his ability to heal starting not to work and also he had to take well care off Charles Xavier, who is now no difference than a senile old man. I pretty disappointed at first when Caliban doesn't get much screen time but he do proves himself worthy by sacrificing himself to help Logan and X-23. X-23 is awesome, majestic mutant that will become the second Wolverine and achieves her peak as one of the strong mutant. Other than that, the death of Logan is well taken care off when X-24, the only one that can kill him, did that (but later got killed by X- 23 :'))) ) <br/><br/>I cried at the end scene where Logan is now dead and the legacy that the he left will sure leave a mark in every true fan's heart ."

","It is 2029, and mutations are still looked at as potential weapons for border patrol purposes. No longer are the mutants considered human, but tools. Although one is not yet a part of this fascist organization to redeem hope to America. He is the long-lasting hero who we have looked up to for over fifteen years, the one who we have experienced many highs and lows with, the one who Hugh Jackman is now making his adieu to, yes, he is Logan, or as some would know him, Wolverine.<br/><br/>But it's not all fun and games anymore, with a crisp, well-earned R rating to match the red on dust violence this franchise needed. Director James Mangold (Kate & Leopold, Walk the Line) makes the most of Logan's legacy with the bloodiest action you'll see this spring. Especially with the backdrop upon the Mexican border, this gritty view of classic comic books feels more like a modern day western than a popcorn flick.<br/><br/>Logan's first mode of action is taking down several immigrants attempting to steal one of his hubcaps. Then he receives a request from an unknown Mexican woman, demanding he escorts a little silent girl named Laura to North Dakota. His motivation for this is low, until three motivations erupt. One, he watches an upsetting video of mutant children in hospitals forcefully trained to become soldiers as if in a concentration camp. Two, she is one of these mutant children. Three, she is his daughter. So now with her on the road with him as well as Professor X, Logan learns his responsibility to punish those who neglect the gifts of these mutants.<br/><br/>While the overall look of this journey looks nice, cinematographer John Mathieson (Gladiator) constantly sets up horrible lighting arrangements that make the backgrounds lighter than the subject's face. It becomes especially problematic, I might add, when he films the action scenes super up close, with nothing but a forgettable musical score to back it up. This is not the only thing that hurts the tension of the action scenes, but the aftereffects of the turmoil are weak, with no thanks to the unconvincing makeup effects. If you don't believe me, look at the albino man who serves as Logan and Professor X's personal assistant: The pale texture of his skin looks plastered on from at most ten minutes in the makeup chair.<br/><br/>At least that's a minor complaint. Compare that to the stellar performances by Dafne Keen and Patrick Stewart, and this may just as well be the greatest achievement based off a Marvel comic. Stewart in particular steals the show with his aged, frail curtain call of a presence that just disorients your expectations further whenever he gets a seizure.<br/><br/>With such a humble grandfather figure here to ground us into the foundation of this world, it's too bad that there's nothing else in the backdrop to give us a sense of Mexico's and Texas' true culture. The latest Academy Award nominee Hell or High Water delved quite a bit into this culture, but the closest that Logan gets to in creating the social pressures is a brief moment in a casino, and a villain with a really bad accent. Nothing else about the look of this world looks authentic enough to buy into.<br/><br/>The other moral implications are also quite problematic. We all can understand that bloody adult-rated violence can lead to viewers imitating it in real life, but judging by the character of Logan as a father, he takes several actions that make me question whether he's worth looking up to as a role model. Shortly after he brings in his daughter to escort her, she robs from a convenience store (since she grew up in a hospital and thus doesn't know any better). While he does discipline her for attacking the clerk who tries to stop her, he robs from the store himself—and in a moment that is mostly played for laughs. Is this really the role model people should be looking up to?<br/><br/>But then again, this type of gritty realism proves just how far superhero movies, and superheroes in general, have come since their rising popularity. All three of the protagonists: Logan, Laura, and Professor X, learn what it means to live in this wild frontier known as the United States, as represented by the professor's favorite motion picture, the classic western Shane.<br/><br/>While he may not have always been the perfect sort of hero for us to look up to over the years, it has been a great pleasure having Logan around to entertain and teach us about what's really worth fighting for. So long, Wolverine. Thank you for your endeavors over the years, and thank you for leaving a strong legacy for the upcoming generation of mutants at heart."

"blondalol","4","7","21","3 March 2017"," Forced drama
","Well, the action scenes were amazing to be honest. But this movie was obviously intended to be emotionally driven, and, while many people praise it for that, I felt like every emotional manipulative cliché was there. For example *spoilers* when the whole yacht thing between Charles and Logan was mentioned, I already suspected where it would go from there. The cowboy movie scene? If you have seen more than five movies you could see from a mile away it was gonna come in play later. <br/><br/>And the ending? Yeah, I understand, it was a downer ending, but they used the ''character you didn't want to die dying'' so many times in the movie, I felt nothing. And what about Laura? I knew nothing about her by the end of the movie, and the relationship between them was bland for me. One week? And we're supposed to believe the kid that has killed and saw people get killed, is crying? OK he is her father but... it felt forced. The whole emotional part of the movie felt forced. And when a huge part of your movie is based on emotional manipulation, a no for me."

"krish-andrew","8","4","10","1 August 2017"," i think this movie clear my all doughts about XMAN. love this
","James Mangold's Logan (8.5/10) About forty seconds into the movie, you confront a bloody Logan who isn't able to stand up while puny thugs decide to assault The Wolverine. And somewhere deep inside you feel a little uncomfortable. Probably because all you have seen Hugh Jackman do in the previous nine installments is watch the healing and indestructive Wolverine fend off anything that weakens him with utmost ease. It all fall aparts in Logan, Wolverine's swansong and an enigmatic crossroad of fear, uncertainty and reality. Wolverine is at his most vulnerable self here and yet far more courageous than all the rest of the X Men movies put together. And this is what makes Logan an extremely compelling watch; the chance and ability to finally empathize with a 'superhero' in a much finer sense and to witness whether they possess the same fortitude once their 'gift' has been taken away from them. Logan, set in 2029, narrates the endeavour of Wolverine, as he drives through the rocky, dusty terrains of El Paso with Laura, a mutant, blessed (with the same powers that he has) who needs to be sent somewhere safe. Along with her is a rugged, dying and somber Charles Xavier who wants to make sure that Logan is true to his word. Donald Pierce (played adequately by Boyd Hollbrook) is a raging current who needs the mutant and spreads considerable blood without any account of collateral damage. The repeated encounters take a toll on Logan's already dying self and even if he doesn't show it, over the course of time, he starts developing a bonding with Laura. He finds within her, the same embodiment of rage that turns people into monsters and sees Laura waging off the inevitable with a silent grace. The relationship which Laura and Logan share has several layers to it and can be interpreted in a much wider canvas. That's for another day. The influence of nineties western classics on the Logan is clear and critical. The homage is directly linked when Charles watches scenes from the 1953 classic Shane, and the lines are repeated again in a final scene. The dust symbolizes the ruins the mutant have brought upon themselves in their ideology of helping mankind marking their own destruction. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as a Xavier who is on the brink of death, set upon the call of epileptic seizures that capsize the lives of anyone near him and there is nothing he could do about it. All Xavier wanted his whole life was to stop people from getting hurt, and in his final moments he cannot stop himself from hurting people. This irony is a powerful strike to the entire genre which relies heavily on willing suspension of disbelief. Everything dies in the end, it's all about the manner in which it is achieved. Mortals, superheroes, they all do. Hugh Jackman could have become a lot of other things, a fine actor, if his brooded look would not have been entirely associated with Wolverine his entire life. And even if he strutted and limped along the way, in Logan he delivers his finest performance. Period. Every scene is a rave emotional experience and comes with a satisfaction of being content if not necessarily happy. He is in pain and so are we, and the audience agrees to be a part of it sailing across in the journey. Logan becomes an imperative movie in changing the face of the superhero genre. The need and allowance of superheroes to be vulnerable and uncertain instead of omnipotent and sarcastic is something I'd been wishing for a while. In Logan, James Mangold manages to capture every element which thrives on the edge of this conflict and the swansong he creates, becomes a painting. It is a magnum opus, a bloody opera and a massacred theatre room with audiences still lying out for view. And yet, it is beautiful."
"skippe-56455","9","4","10","28 July 2017"," Film Review on IMDb
","I must first warn you that this film review includes spoilers. ""Logan"" is a film that was written and directed by James Mangold. ""Logan"" is part of the Marvel empire that created such great movies such as Spiderman, Dead pool and Ironman. This movie is a spin-off from the long running X-men movie series. This movie starred Hugh Jackman as Logan. Logan, who is better recognized as the Wolverine is much older in this film and is dying slowly. The plot takes place in the future where Professor X, who is played by Patrick Stewart need the protection of the Wolverine to stop from destroying himself and others. The new comer on the X-men story line is Laura, she is played by Dafne Keen. She plays the daughter of Wolverine, which was created by his DNA and she took on a lot of this incredible attributes. Boyd Holbrook who plays Pierce is a task with finding Laura who escaped the facility that she was being held and taught to kill. <br/><br/>Wolverine goes through a transition from being invincible to being vulnerable. This vulnerability helps Wolverine find the strength within himself to fight one last time to save Laura from the company that was hunting her. Wolverine gave his life to save the new generation of X-men. This film is the third of the Wolverine movie series. The other two movies"" X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and ""The Wolverine"" was very successful movies from the Marvel franchise. These two films were very important to show the growth of the Wolverine through the many different obstacles that he faced. <br/><br/>This movie used motifs to express a repeated theme of survival. The main characters throughout the film had one goal, which was staying alive. The mutant children were searching for a safe location away from those that wanted to harm them. ""Logan"" used many close-up shots to show the dramatic emotions that the characters were expressing throughout the film. The medium camera shot was used to film the car chases and high impact battles that occurred in this film. These frames provided high intensity and help tell the future and end of the Wolverine. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this film provided a mixture of action and great drama. ""Logan"" had great editing that made the transition of each scene seem smooth and organized. This film help bridge the X- men franchise between the other previous films. This film provided great performances, especially from Hugh Jackman. I would recommend this film to individuals who appreciate a great action movie."

"theVade","7","4","10","11 July 2017"," One of those movies that I feel will age better with time.
","Logan was a good time and definitely worth the price of a ticket to see it. Keen's character is fantastic, and both Jackman and Stewart were great while their characters weren't as fleshed out. The western tone gave the movie a distinct feeling, unlike any other superhero film, but gets boring in the lack of set pieces. The finale takes chances that are unexpected from these types of production companies, and really brings out a lot of emotions that one might not expect to feel when walking into this movie. In the end I decided to give Logan a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Although it's a little higher than I wanted to give it, this is one of those movies that I feel will age better with time, ironically the opposite of Logan's character in Logan.<br/><br/>Read more at theVade."

Some of the casting was a bit ""hit and miss"" for me personally but not enough for me to be turned off from the overall experience.<br/><br/>Really, really a worthwhile watch.

We'll see Hugh Jackman in his finest role and it's heartbreaking. I have so many questions, beginning with the whereabouts of Magneto, Raven and Hank . . . I truly believe I will never cry in a X-Men movie, witness the deterioration of Logan and Charles Xavier was a distressing moment, probably the most anxious moment in all the X-Men movies. I don't know if they will make another movie in the events that cause the sickness of Charles Xavier, I don't know neither if Logan will appear again, I don't know anything.

","I never read the Wolverine comics but I have seen all of the previous Wolverine and X-Men films and I watched the X-Men cartoons when I was a kid. I have some familiarity with the Wolverine character and I like the Wolverine and Hugh Jackman. I have to admit that I have not been a huge fan of the stand alone Wolverine movies as I have not found them as interesting as the X-Men movies. <br/><br/>That said, I think that Logan is by far the worst of the Wolverine movies. This movie is ostensibly an installment in the Wolverine movie series, as well as the larger X-Men cinematic universe, but this movie does not seem to have any connection to the earlier movies. That would not really bother me if this was a great stand alone story, but it is not. This movie is set in a dystopian future but there is no explanation as to how the characters got into the circumstances in which they find themselves in this movie which are very different from the previous movies.<br/><br/>I love Patrick Stewart, he is a great actor, but it pains me to see him in this movie. This movie is a mess. I don't expect too much from the plot of a super hero movie but this one makes so little sense that I could not get into the movie."
"tomgillespie2002","8","4","10","25 May 2017"," A brutal, angry movie
","For the past 17 years, Hugh Jackman has played X-Man Wolverine nine times. It was the role that made him a star, and he's thanked Fox for having faith in him by sticking by the character regardless of how bad the franchise became. But at the age of 49, Jackman has decided to hang up his claws and trim the sideburns, taking a pay- cut in order to give the character the final send-off he truly deserves. He and director James Mangold, who joined forces to make stand-alone entry The Wolverine in 2013 only to see the studio step in and butcher the final edit, have persuaded Fox to go with an R rating. Whether this is down to the huge success of the wonderfully foul-mouthed Deadpool in 2016 or Fox feeling they owe the actor for his loyalty down the years, the results are pretty astonishing. With Logan, the camera no longer cuts away when Wolverine slices and dices, but captures his animalistic ferocity in all its bloody, decapitating glory.<br/><br/>Logan is a brutal, angry movie, and more than warrants its 'hard' R rating. It's no gimmick, nor is it a cash-in on Deadpool's success. Superhero movies don't need to follow the Marvel formula of good, clean, family-friendly fun, nor DC's preference for muted colours and CGI-overkill, world-threatening set-pieces. In fact, Logan doesn't feel much like a superhero movie at all. Here, the former cage-fighting, time-travelling X-Man (although it isn't entirely clear where the story fits into Fox's ever-confusing timeline) is an old man, dying of some mysterious illness and battling alcoholism and depression. He is bearded, grey, and wrinkling, and his torso covered in grisly scars from some unspoken former battles. When he uses his claws, his knuckles seep with puss. We're in 2029, and all but three mutants are dead. We don't know why, but Logan is intent on living out his remaining days looking after a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with clairvoyant mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), working as an Uber limo driver to fund the medicine required to keep Charles' dangerous telepathic seizures in check.<br/><br/>People start to look for Logan. Gabriela Lopez (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse working for corporation Alkali-Transigen, wants him to transport both her and an eleven year girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to a place in North Dakota called 'Eden'. Logan is also questioned by Transigen's chief of security Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), a cybernetically-enhanced thug who seems to be searching for the little girl. When Gabriela turns up dead and Laura ends up in his care, Logan is forced to take Charles on a road trip to escape Pierce and his Reavers, and to seek out the mysterious Eden. Caliban is abducted by Transigen head Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), who forces the albino to use his powers to track down the fleeing mutants and take back Laura. It is revealed that the young girl is one of many mutants experimented on by Rice in the hope of turning them into weapons, and that she possesses the same adamantium claws as Logan.<br/><br/>For a character who has seen and done pretty much everything over the past 17 years, it feels a fitting time to draw the curtains. Knowing that another run-of-the-mill superhero adventure wouldn't do the mutant justice, Mangold has done what no other studio movie has done before and portrays the superhero at the ends of his days, trying to bury the past while haunted by his deeds. While Logan does throw in a couple of exciting - and utterly brutal - set-pieces, this is an incredibly sombre experience. It's about getting old, loneliness, and rediscovering a reason to live. Jackman has never been better, and Keen is a real find. Their shared scenes are touching and often hilarious, and with the presence of the ever- reliable Stewart, the trio form an amusingly dysfunctional family unit. While there is an issue with a bland villain who brings back memories of that horrific climax in X- Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), this is a damn near-perfect last hurrah for a character who comic book fans have been hoping would fully unleash his berserker rage for years. Farewell then, Logan aka Wolverine, until the inevitable reboot."

It's probably also because of this that the ending didn't hit me as much as it did others. There were a lot of good fight scenes where I didn't know who the real winner would be, and I LOVED how Logan wasn't your typical good guy. Yes he was a good guy but he was also selfish, didn't think twice about killing others, and didn't care if you were an old man or a little girl (he treated everyone nearly the same)<br/><br/>I especially loved all of Laura's fight scenes.

"erick-palacios04","10","4","10","2 May 2017"," The Most Epic Conclusion of a Superhero
","I have seen all the superhero movies out there, from Marvel, Dc, Dark Horse, etc, and i love them. But of all the movies, i think this is the most epic conclusion of a character in the superhero genre.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film please be advice, ""Big Spoilers Ahead"".<br/><br/>In comparison of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the X-Verse, i love the MCU a lot more, because i like all the films in it, in the X-Verse most of them where great, some of then not, and the first two Wolverine films are in that list of not that good. I say that because they are reborn with ""Logan"" and it's very sad that the best film of this amazing character is the last (as we know of) Hugh Jackman X-Men film.<br/><br/>We see a more human Wolverine and Xavier that we've seen in all the films, they struggle with issues of getting old, alcoholism, depression, parenthood, (talking about Laura and Logan and why not Xavier with Logan and Laura) loneliness, we even see Logan with a part time job, which i think was an amazing detail for the movie. And of course we love to see this guys, this heroes, as that exactly, Heroes, like Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Peter Parker and of course Logan, but we can't forget that they are still human beings, sure the mutants are not categorize as human but more advance than us, or a mistake from god like they say in this movie, but still with all the human elements, and to depict this things in a superhero movie, making us see that they can be hurt, they have feelings, they have issues and problems like we all do, was and beautiful way to move us and make us love all them a lot more. To see the magnificent Charles Xavier, the guy with the greatest and most powerful mind in the Marvel comics, with a brain degeneration disease, like Dr. Zander Rice played by Richard E. Grant says in the film and quote ""the guy with the most powerful brain has a brain degeneration disease? that's a great combo isn't it?"".<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart give the most heart warming performances in this characters, to imagine that powerful Xavier in the X-Men films and now been a sweet lonely nonagenarian it's something that really got to me, made me cry since the beginning of the film. And of course the Jackman himself, that gigantic (metaphorically speaking) Wolverine now with this characteristics i just describe it's heart warming-wrenching, he is tired, he doesn't run and fight like he used to, he can't regenerate as fast as before, and when he does leaves a scar in his body, leaving a scar in our hearts, and now he has to take care the old Xavier and a child, His Child, making the movie more realistic in the surrealism.<br/><br/>Why i say is the most epic conclusion?. It is known that when an actor leaves his superhero character it's because he gets fired (Andrew Garfield), he gets tired of the role (Wesley Snipes), he doesn't come back for the sequel (Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer), there is no conclusive film (Ron Perlman) or the last movie really sucked (George Clooney, Wesley Snipes again, Ryan Reynolds twice, Tobey Maguire) you get the idea. But to see an actor leaving his costume in his own terms it's something to be proud of. <br/><br/>This is not just and epic conclusion for Jackman, for Wolverine as well. Big Spoiler: He dies yes, but he dies with his daughter besides him, it 's amazing that the only one who could killed him was a younger self, of course the only thing that can kill Wolverine it's freaking Wolverine, he goes giving a great advice to his child, with tears in his eyes, and a beautiful heart wrenching final line, quote ""So this is what it feels like"", long overdue man, but finally at peace, only true fans could really appreciate those words. <br/><br/>This is a Masterpice, and you won't regret watching it 10 times."

"blazedounal","10","4","10","3 April 2017"," Excellent movie but not super hero movie
","Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. What makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core.<br/><br/>In the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine, spends his days working as a chauffeur in Texas. His healing factor has been severely weakened and he has aged due to the adamantium on his bones beginning to poison him. Logan lives with mutant tracker Caliban in an abandoned smelting plant across the Mexican border, where they care for Professor Charles Xavier, who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities to devastating effect. One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela Lopez, a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called ""Eden"".<br/><br/>After reluctantly accepting the job from Gabriela, Logan discovers that she has been murdered. Logan and Xavier learn that Laura is one of several mutant children Transigen was breeding using DNA samples from several mutants for the ""X-23"" project, and that upon completion of the ""X-24"" project, the children were deemed obsolete and were to be euthanized. Gabriela helped several children escape from the Transigen compound before smuggling Laura, who is revealed to be Logan's biological daughter, across the border.<br/><br/>The Reavers catch up with them in Oklahoma City, but Xavier suffers a seizure and telepathically freezes everyone in their hotel, allowing Logan to kill the attackers before injecting Xavier with a suppressant and escaping. While on the highway, the trio helps farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident. The Munsons invite them over for dinner, and they accept under the guise of being a trigenerational family. When a nearby pipe springs a leak, Logan and Will leave the house to fix it.<br/><br/>While Logan is gone, X-24 stabs Xavier through the chest before slaughtering the Munson family. When Logan returns, Xavier succumbs to his wound and Caliban sacrifices himself by setting off two grenades to destroy the Transigen van in which he is being held captive. Logan engages X-24, which gains the upper hand, but Will impales X-24 and shoots it before dying, allowing Logan and Laura to escape.<br/><br/>After burying Xavier, Logan passes out from exhaustion. He wakes up in a clinic that Laura had driven him to, but refuses to get further treatment and wants to abandon the trip. Laura convinces him to complete it, and they arrive at Eden, a safe haven run by Rictor and the other Transigen test subjects that managed to escape. Logan learns that the children plan to journey across the Canadian border and decides to part ways with them. However, when the children are intercepted by the Reavers, Logan intervenes. Dr. Zander Rice, the head of Transigen, pacifies Logan and reveals that the destruction of mutantkind is due to a genetic dampener created by his corporation. Logan shoots Rice dead.<br/><br/>Logan and Laura fight X-24, with Rictor using his seismic powers to help them. However, X-24 brutally impales Logan on the branches of a fallen tree. While X-24 is trying to finish Logan, Laura shoots X-24 dead with an adamantium bullet Logan had been keeping. Fatally wounded, Logan tells Laura not to be the weapon she was made to be before dying in her arms. Laura and the other children mourn his death and hold a somber burial. Laura adjusts the cross on his grave to form an ""X"" before continuing on their journey across the border in search of a new beginning."

For the first time since the first X-Men movie came out you find yourself actually pitying Logan. He's tired. He's just done.

Without spoiling anything I will say that this movie simply wouldn't have been the same (or as good) had they been force to really hold back.

What really surprised me about this film is that you can go in to it completely blind, you do not have to have seen any other X-Men film, it stands on its own. <br/><br/>I did feel the movie could have been a bit more sentimental. Considering the fact that it's the finale for Wolverine and Charles, there is little reflection. There is one beautiful moment where they speak about first meeting each other, I would love to have had more moments like that, to showcase the history they have with each other. <br/><br/>It is certainly sad watching this movie knowing that this is the last time we will ever see Hugh Jackman and Patrick Steawart in their very famous roles, but they certainly went out with a bang. The connection between them here is stronger than ever, they are both clearly at ease with one another and it makes for pure, natural acting. Dafne Keen also shines as Laura, for such a young girl she seemed well capable of holding a strong character throughout, and her chemistry with Jackman and Stewart is very sweet. Stephen Merchant also surprised me, I was expecting him to be comic relief and thought that he would have felt very out place in this universe, but he is actually stellar in this role, delivering little humorous dialogue, he completely transforms. <br/><br/>You will walk away with great sadness, but also feeling like they could not have closed off these characters arch's any better way. Dark, action packed, well acted and grounded, Logan is a must see for all X-Mem fans, as well if you are looking for a good action or drama. <br/><br/>When Logan and Charles discover a young mutant, they must hide her from dark forces and search for more of her kind. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Hugh Jackman"
"account-184-125611","6","4","10","31 March 2017"," Not bad, yet pretty flawed
","At first it may seem like a perfect match - a Wolverine-movie rated R/16. After all, Wolverines iconic claws are rather violent weapons, and he is a rather hot-tempered, brutal fighter. Even in the comics, him using those claws has resulted in some more and more bloody results in recent years, so it makes sense to have him in an R-rated movie.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 2029, and while there are hints, we are not sure exactly what happened to the other X-men. The world does not look as dark, sinister or dystopian as we might expect , but then again, its obvious that mutants are pretty much gone, and Logan and Xavier have aged. <br/><br/>The movie looks great, and IMO, both Jackman and Stewart put in a very heartfelt performance... I guess because for both of them, it's their swan-song in the Marvel-movie franchise after many years of being part of it. <br/><br/>X-23, the other protagonist, works great. The actor portraying her does a great job, and some of the action-scenes involving her look impressive. YMMV, as some may be bothered by the scenes of a young girl brutally obliberating others. <br/><br/>The ending is quite touching, and is a great send-off for Logan. Sure, it would have been nice to have an equally nice ending for the other X-men, yet, after all, this is a movie mostly about Logan, his attitude/outlook on life and his relationship to Xavier. <br/><br/>Now, unfortunately, this movie has quite a few flaws. <br/><br/><ul><li>The plot is INCREDIBLY CLICHÉ! We have seen this SO many times. Gruff hero is introduced, appears to be aimless/hopeless. New protagonist enters, usually looking for help. The gruff hero is unwilling to help at first, then is either forced to or changes his mind for some other reason. The bad guys appear, usually they are borderline sadists, enjoying their job way too much, so the viewer wants them to fail and hopefully get punished/killed. The heroes escape, seem to find a peaceful spot. The villains return with more/better weapons, the heroes get hurt, lose one member of their team, have to flee. Eventually, it looks as if all hope is lost, until they turn the situation around. </li></ul><br/><br/>This is incredibly cliché, yet this is what happens. Logan is asked to help X-23, is unwilling to do so, yet is forced to eventually. The bad guys are right out of the ""cliche book of movie villains, 1986-edition"". Sadistic, smirking, arrogant, enjoying their mission way too much. There also is the brainless, almost unbeatable henchman, plus the cold-hearted, grim leader who has to have his little speech at some point, wasting too much time so the hero has time to prepare a counter-attack or at least get in a good punchline. <br/><br/>So the plot and the villains are very VERY clichéd. Now add quite a few plot holes. - Logan doesn't seem to care much about killing people. The threatening (and arrogant, yawn) villain is knocked out, Logan asks his buddy (who is allergic to daylight, and this is during the day in the desert) to put him into a car and kill him somewhere else. He could have done this himself, and even though he wants the guy killed, he doesn't kill him while he is knocked out to make sure he doesn't wake up in time. So at this point, you know what cliché is up next. Of COURSE the villain wakes up just before the sidekick manages to kill him and captures said sidekick. 1964 called and wants its plot-twist back. <br/><br/><ul><li>Logan and X-24 fight each other, and due to their adamantium- augmentations, they can't kill each other so easily. Yet, X-24 manages to rather easily impale Logan on a branch... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole thing about Logans healing factor faltering and, as a doctor hints at, something poisoning him isn't explained well enough IMO. So the whole time, one is left wondering what happened to his amazing healing factor. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After Laura/X-23 easily beat up a ton of ""mutant hunters"" earlier in the movie, when those guys start to hunt the children on the way to the border, she is apparently unable to easily take those guys out... even though she had some other capable young mutants with her now. However, a few minutes later, she takes on the much stronger X- 24 and even holds her own against him for some time. </li></ul><br/><br/>There is more, but that is not the point. Even with plot holes like that, a movie like this can work quite well. The problem, to me, is the insanely unimaginative plot itself... the ""been there, done that 8000 times"" type of plot we have seen so often, mixed with clichéd villains. Sure, its a superhero movie, yet there have been several better and more creative plot lines and antagonists in the Marvel movie franchise, so this is rather disappointing. <br/><br/>So, to sum it up: + R-rating fits Logan and his powers/approach well + Some rather great and apparently heart-felt acting by Stewart and Jackman. + X-23 is done well and actually works, and who knows, the character might get developed more. + Nice send-off for a popular superhero + Not too much unnecessary reliance on CGI/blue screen, it's rather easy to follow the fights instead of them being a total, confusing mess. <br/><br/><ul><li>Horribly clichéd plot, going by a movie blueprint that appears to be from the 80s at best. - Horribly clichéd villains, so very boring and predictable. - While it's nice to leave some things to the imagination or not explain every tiny bit of backstory, several things IMO weren't explained enough.</li></ul><br/><br/>6/10 unfortunately, and those are mainly for the acting of Jackman, Stewart and Keen, and for the ending."

","Ever since his breakthrough role as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X Men (2000), Hugh Jackman has played the claw brandishing mutant a whopping 9 times total. Now fed up of those egg white omelettes that have kept him in shape for the role, Jackman has decided to retire from his infamous role after 17 awesome years. Logan marks Hugh Jackman's last time round as Wolverine and is directed by James Mangold and also starring Dafne Keen, Stephen Merchant and Professor X himself, Patrick Stewart. Finally we get the Wolverine film we have been waiting for and fortunately Jackman goes out on a high.<br/><br/>As a whole, the acting was great. Dafne Keen was brilliant as the young mutant Laura, playing the role with such maturity often unheard of from child actors. I genuinely forgot I was watching a 12 year old girl. Patrick Stewart was also great in his seventh appearance as Professor Charles Xavier. Portraying a version of Charles plucked from our nightmares, a sick, weak and lonely man in need of care but who is still that hopeful, good willed professor at heart. It is with Charles' predicament that the emotional impact is most effective, he was a man who looked after many, but in his time of need only Logan is there for him. The X men series began with Charles and Logan, it's only fitting that it would end with them.<br/><br/>The film is of course called Logan, so the focus of the film is all on Wolverine himself. Hugh Jackman did very well in this film, bringing us a Wolverine that we haven't seen before. Now older and unable to heal, Logan is more human than ever and Jackman transitions from brutal murder machine, to a sensitive and dying man perfectly. But as Good as Jackman was, a lot of the credit is due to writer/director James Mangold, as well as screenwriters Scott Frank and Michael Green for bringing this version of Logan from the comics to the screen. It was very refreshing to see characters I grew up watching be humanised, showing a side to them not truly seen in 17 years. This was fantastic is upping the emotion of the film, and having grown up watching Charles and Logan's cinematic relationship, this film was rather hard to watch.<br/><br/>As well as brilliantly showing off Logan's soft side, James Mangold does an outstanding job with showing his barbaric side. Thanks in no small part to Deadpool and its success, proving that there is a market for R rated superhero movies, we finally get the Wolverine action scenes we have all been waiting for. When you have a hero whose superpowers include growing adamantium claws from your knuckles, you kind of want to see those claws in action. Finally we get to see Wolverine slice up people in full gory detail with no cutaways. I have long awaited this day and it did not disappoint. The opening fight sequence was satisfyingly brutal, giving closure as to what an adamantium claw can do to people and what the aftermath looks like.<br/><br/>The villains in this film were weak and the film in a way acknowledged this. The main villain shifts throughout the film from; Pierce, to Dr Rice, to Wolverine Mark 2. The film knows its villains are weak so opts to have Hugh Jackman be both hero and villain when they wheel out the X-24. But, at the end of the day it was more about the journey and character of Logan himself, so villains were always secondary.<br/><br/>Also as Wolverine gets weaker, there is a lot of him passing out, then becoming conscious, only to pass out again. Although I understand this reinforces the weakened state of our once self healing protagonist, but it made the latter parts of the film feel a little boring and repetitive.<br/><br/>Overall, Logan is a wonderfully acted, directed and written film that takes these mutants and humanises them perfectly, showing the sensitive and barbaric sides of Logan in a respectable final movie. The R rating was needed in order to fully respect the source material and finally deliver a Wolverine standalone movie that fans have been waiting to enjoy. The end of an era, so this is what it feels like."

","Logan is a movie where we finally meet the real(comic book) wolverine someone who is hurt,angry and selfish yet still good inside .When ı was watching the movie ı felt his agony, this was possibly Hugh Jackman's best performance as an actor.X-men universe always more dramatic than rest and this movie was most dramatic of them.We finally get to see two very powerful mutant aged and now trying to survive ,I almost feel sad for them even though ı didn't know that ı had such a bound to them.I guess after watching them for decades ı had to have such a bound.I'm hoping Hugh Jackman will be nominated for academy award.Towards to end of the movie Logan regained his powers for a short period and he was running in the forest that scene showed audience what he really was once.It was good to see that powerful side of him and how he falls.Yet final scene was not super good ıt could be better.I guess we didn't understand why those kids never helps Logan but at the end when Laura turns that wood to make it look like a X ıt was just perfect.Thank you, Hugh Jackman."

","One of the best movies I've ever seen. Deserves all the praise it gets. I honestly want to go see it for a third time. Soundtrack is amazing, just like everything else. I nearly cried, its very emotional and heart wrenching. It also is very intense and good old Hugh chops a lot of limbs off, which makes it even better.. Definitely one of the best comic book movies ever made with the Dark knight. If you haven't seen it, SEE it"
"Dmagic5000","10","4","10","27 March 2017"," Logan is another milestone in the Comic Book movie genre
","The comic book movie has seen a number of milestones throughout the past 17 years. In the year 2000 X-Men was released and stunned audiences with creating well- rounded, dynamic characters. It showed that a comic book movie could be more than just campy. 2004's Spider-Man 2 took that even further by creating what I still say is in the top 10 comic book movies ever. It delved deep into the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and it served as a great character movie. The Dark Knight elevated the comic book movie to an entirely new level that may never be surpassed. It took the camp and silliness that usually fills those movies and instead told a serious and gritty crime movie. It essentially was a crime drama that so happened to have Batman. Logan has once again elevated the comic book movie and is another incredible milestone.<br/><br/>It's the year 2029 and nearly all mutants have disappeared. A mutant has not been born in 25 years. Wolverine is older now, he's been beaten, he's a bit rougher. He lives in hiding with an even older Charles Xavier who is suffering from seizures, and whose powers are dangerous now that he doesn't have as much control over them anymore. One day they come across a mysterious young girl that needs help. Together they must take her across the country to help her.<br/><br/>This is the third movie of a somewhat underwhelming Wolverine trilogy. It's rare after two underwhelming movies a good movie yet alone great movie comes along, but Logan is that rarity. It not only exceeds expectations and is the best of this trilogy, it is the best X-Men movie in the entire franchise.<br/><br/>The X-Men movies have always relied heavily on the characters. Part of what separates the X-Men movies from other comic book movies is the incredible characters the franchise contains. The good ones, and they're almost all good, have well rounded, great characters. We already have 9 movies with the character Logan/Wolverine, but Logan develops the character even more. It's evident that he's seen a lot of terrible things in his life. He's at the end. Enter Lauren and things start to change for him. This is the best character piece for any comic book character.<br/><br/>The performances are all around great. This is the best Hugh Jackman has ever been. He's really giving it his all. You see it in his face and in his body language. This is a character he loves and he wants to do it right one last time. Patrick Stewart gives, what I think, is a nomination worthy performance. I know it's early, but I hope his name is getting thrown around come Oscar season. He is that good. The movie requires a lot from him and he gives it all. Dafne Keen who plays the little girl is also very good in the movie. She has to perform between two giant screen presences in Jackman and Stewart and she still manages to nearly match their screen presence. The movie requires a lot from her both emotionally and physically. She might be my favourite part of the movie. She is so good and so convincing in the movie. It's not a cringy child performance. You believe every second of her performance. She even steals a few scenes from Hugh Jackman, and that's saying something. The performances are all top notch.<br/><br/>There is a very good pace to the movie. It never drags and it always seems to be progressing to something. Each scene builds to the emotional and incredible finale. The last 20 minutes of this movie are absolutely thrilling. There is one incredible long take of Wolverine tearing through the forest on the attack. It's amazing.<br/><br/>What elevates this movie though is the choices it makes throughout. There are a lot of bold choices the movie makes that 5 years ago would have probably not worked. I don't think audiences were ready at the time. Now that we are well into the slew of the comic book movie genre, I think audiences are ready for some of the choices it makes. Other comic book movies lately have attempted at doing some of these choices, but have used under developed, poor characters, or have back tracked right at the end almost as if to say, ""just kidding!"" Here they make great decisions that I think will push the genre to a whole new level that will cause people to say, ""hey they did it in Logan, why not in this movie now?"" To me, that shows an evolution.<br/><br/>Just like The Dark Knight was a gritty crime thriller that happened to also be a Batman movie, Logan is a character drama that happens to be a X-Men/Wolverine movie. This is, in my opinion, the best comic book movie since The Dark Knight. It's emotional, thrilling, contains great acting, and it makes very bold decisions. It's one of the best movies of the year. Do yourself a favour and watch this movie.<br/><br/>Just remember, it is very brutal."

","Logan is the final film Hugh Jackman will be portraying this iconic character of wolverine that he has ingrained his portrayal into fans of the Xmen and the wolverine for 17 years,this film marks the end of an era and is quite gut wrenching to think about growing up along side the movies,in my opinion this movie is the best way send off the character in a satisfying and emotional film that every fan has truly been waiting for in a faithful adaptation of the character and loosely based on the old man Logan story line.<br/><br/>As a fan of these x men films(although not all great)i have grown to become invested in these characters and that one character is wolverine,wolverine is poster boy for the Xmen movies and has got a spin off series of movies due to his popularity and in my opinion if it wasn't for Hugh Jackmans portrayal of the character he probably wouldn't be as successful as he is nowadays.<br/><br/>Logan is that movie that appeals to the fans of the character and hits fanboys in such unexpected ways that its actually a painful experience in that satisfying,emotional almost empty feeling by the end of the film,this film hit me harder then expected and for that experience alone just left me with very high praise for this film.<br/><br/>This film deals with a lot of different aspects and has a very fitting tone of gritty and serious but also has moments of levity with slight humour and really invests the audience in the characters,the aspect of character in this film was very prominent and is really the main focus as in this film is a very character driven and doesn't rely on big action scenes but very small and quiet scenes that explores the characters way of thinking and their motivations,this comic book film separates itself from what people expect from those types of movies for something fans can really respect.<br/><br/>Although this film is character driven and its main focus is to explore them as human beings and not as the ""mutants"" that people in this film has a hatred,it follows aging Logan and senile Xavier in a world where they are alone with no hope left and nowhere to go which gives the tone of helplessness and the need to escape from the cruel world a very powerful and emotional feel.<br/><br/>Overall this movies as an absolutely amazing experience that allows the audience to experience every emotion and sympathize with an aging and brutal Logan in his final outing,it offers amazing and investing character development and absolutely beautiful brutal fight scenes that perfectly depicts the true character,but the one true problem i have with this film is the pacing but even a fan like me cant dwell to much on it with the fact that it was such a great conclusion and send off.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"andrewcreer","9","4","10","24 March 2017"," Believable Brutality Makes Logan Outstanding
","Not since the first Iron Man have I left a superhero movie as satisfied as I was after seeing Logan. There are a few factors that pull this hero flick into an exclusive group of its own - and for good reason.<br/><br/>It may sound typical, but basic brutality and gore are what hero films have lacked in recent years. How many times can we watch an Avengers fight scene and feel a tad underwhelmed? Logan's intense and at sometimes dark violence makes you actually witness the pure epic slasher that the Wolverine is supposed to be. Time after time I found myself actually putting my hand over my mouth in pure awe during the fight sequences of this absolutely shocking take on the Wolverine. <br/><br/>But it isn't pure blood-soaking fight scenes that put this film over the hill. Logan in all actuality has a story, a good story - and in relation to most other superhero movies, a great story. Not once did I find myself waiting for the dialogue to end in order for the action to begin. This movie is the perfect action thriller that has a story that keeps you engaged until the very end.<br/><br/>I only have a few minor complaints that keep this movie from earning a perfect score. I do not mind ""inappropriate"" language in movies; in fact I think that different examples of crude language can greatly add to the effect of a film. However, I think with Wolverine earning the ""R"" rating - they went a little over the top and in some moments were just lazy with dialogue. The other very minor thing, is I thought Dafne Keen was slightly annoying. In terms of child actors she was fine, but her repetitive screams and yells were irking.<br/><br/>Logan is the closest thing I've seen to a perfect superhero movie in a long time. The characters are dynamic, the story inviting, and the action brutal. I couldn't have asked for more out of this film."
"dan-willi84","10","4","10","23 March 2017"," The Best Film of 2017 So Far. Jackman and Stewart deserve Oscar nominations.
","Logan is the best film of 2017, so far. The darkest and most violent X-Men film ever. It's dark, violent and emotional. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart both deserve to be nominated Oscars for their performances which was outstanding and newcomer Dafne Keen made an impressive acting debut as Laura Kinney/X-23 and she was fantastic in the part. The film was pretty hard to watch and the world of Logan was really dark and depressing and it shows you how cruel life and the world is, especially how bad the world in real life has gotten and how much rubbish people like Donald Trump, the drug lords, corrupt politicians and terrorists are giving to the world. However, I was real confused about if the film took place in the original or the reset time-line. I am glad Deadpool didn't appear in the film or made a cameo, he would had ruined it. If you plan on going to see Logan, I strongly advise that you bring tissues with you to the cinema, the real gets really emotional. Hugh Jackman gives the farewell you will never forget."

I'm 48 years old so the wolverine comics came out just after I graduated high school, I stopped reading them sometime after issue 50, got a job and a girlfriend I guess, but I never finished reading them, don't know if they continued after all these years but if they had a final issue to wrap things up This would be that story. It is near perfect, I would give it nine and a half out of ten, there are some slow spots, at times a bit too long of a slow spot but I've been fed a steady diet of quick flashes of explosions for the last thirty years.

"RforFilm","9","4","10","7 March 2017"," The Claws are Drawn for One More Time. Logan is an Amazing End for Wolverine
","With a set of metal claws, an ability to heal from wounds, and a Clint Eastwood-like attitude, you get the superhero animal known as Wolverine. Within the X-Men comics, Wolverine has become one of the most iconic and popular characters of not just that team, but for Marvel in general. While some of that comes down to a neat design, the character of feels the roughest of personalities. This has allowed him to confront his enemies with more of a street-smart mindset that the other X-Men lack. It also helps that his regeneration practically makes him the perfect shield for the other heroes.<br/><br/>His cinematic outings have worked thanks to the casting of Hugh Jackman. He manages to carry the necessary roughness with the combination of the actor's charisma. What this makes is a Wolverine that remains popular even though he has never worn the famous costume from the comics. This is simply excellent direction. It makes sense that the actor wouldn't be able to play the character forever and had to exit at some point. Had it not been for the critically acclaimed Old Man Logan comic, writers might still be searching for a good idea. What comes for Wolverines final cinematic story is Logan. <br/><br/>Set in 2029 sometime after X-Men: Apocalypse, the mutants are close to being extinct due to no new ones being born in a while. Logan (played by Hugh Jackman) has aged considerably now that his healing is much slower and the metal that's attached to his skeleton and claws is poisoning him. He works as a chauffeur and caring for Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) who is retired and suffering a disease that causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities and memory loss. A nurse approaches Logan asking for safe transport to North Dakota for her and her child Laura. <br/><br/>Logan agrees for a payment, but finds that nurse murdered the morning they were supposed to leave. When he returns home, he finds Laura in the trunk. Not too long later is when Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) comes with a security team to kill Laura. During the battle, it's discovered that Laura has a similar set of claws and a similar regeneration power like Wolverines. Logan, Xavier, and Laura escape and hit the road to drive north. What they're hoping for is the last chance for mutants to continue. <br/><br/>Not only does the movie contain a lot of story elements that I don't want to spoil, but it contains a lot of acting moments that are also worth keeping secret. It's rare to find a ""three"" movie that's the best of a series, but Logan seems to be that specialty. Not only is it the darkest and most violent (it takes full advantage of the R rating), but it's also the most mature. What I mean by that is that this feels like a very adult story regarding aging, politics about minorities, and even genuine drama between Wolverine and Laura. <br/><br/>Out of all the X-Men movies, Logan is the least superhero of all, and that's a good thing. Hugh Jackman's Logan plays off more like a cowboy as his character practically refuses to be the hero that most audiences have identified him as. He's more weary and damaged then before, and his performance reminds you of a scar that contains a good story. By the end, you'll not only be fighting off tears, but feel that the song use of Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" is worth it. Logan is without a doubt, the best of the X-Men series (yes, even over Deadpool).<br/><br/>I'll give this nine Wolverines out of ten. In the ages of capes and super villains, it's refreshing to see something that's more grounded. It takes inspiration from the right places (Shane, Children of Men, etc) and uses it's action to it's full advantage to make the perfect last ride for good old Wolverine"
"sujanfaster","10","4","10","7 March 2017"," An Emotional And Hard Hitting Send-Off For The Immortal Superhero
","The X-Men franchise has seen its ups and downs. Many characters have come and gone. But there was one character that most fans loved the most; The Wolverine.<br/><br/>Wolverine is known for his sheer power, brutality, and rebellious attitude. Australian actor Hugh Jackman carried the role brilliantly for seventeen years in such a way that it is very difficult to imagine any other actor filling his shoes. Yet all good things must end and his character finally signs off in the just released film Logan.<br/><br/>With recent X-Men movies being completely revamped with different timelines and new characters, it was time to let old characters go. Hugh Jackman's age and recent health issues also made him feel that he wouldn't be able to give his best in the coming years. Here he teams up with James Mangold, director of the 2013 film 'The Wolverine', to give the best possible send-off with the intense and emotional Logan.<br/><br/>The previous Wolverine movies 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', and 'The Wolverine', were not critics' favourites, nor did they create much havoc at the box office. After being slammed by the critics and some fans for his previous Wolverine venture, Director James Mangold gives us the best Wolverine this time. Being the first R-rated movie of the X-Men franchise, Logan justifies its rating in every possible way. The frustrated Logan and Professor X do not shy away from cursing. The action sequences are raw and not heavily dependent on CGI. The film neatly captures the emotional and physical hardship of Logan as he battles through his inner self and external evils while feeling the responsibility of doing what's right. The movie is not about the mutant Wolverine, but rather the human Logan, which makes it both different from and superior to the rest of Wolverine's films.<br/><br/>Logan is set in the year 2029. The timeline follows events after X-Men: Days of Future Past. Mutants are having a tough time surviving, and the Logan's powers are wearing off. He is living an isolated and disastrous life as a limousine driver, while also looking after Professor X whose health has worsened. The tone is gloomy and dark.<br/><br/>Logan is approached by a lady who seeks help to protect Laura, a 'special' kid who is being pursued by the evil organization Transigen. Laura is part of their experiment. Circumstances bring Logan and her together as they escape along with Professor X, and Logan slowly learns a dark and bitter truth. What follows are some raw, hard-core action sequences, brilliant performances, and a scintillating climax.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Logan, Laura, and Professor X, and their unexpected journey together. An ageing Hugh Jackman fits the role. The character of Wolverine gave him his fame in Hollywood, and he makes sure to do it justice one last time. Fans are bound to experience mixed emotions watching Logan putting on his reading glasses, but there are also many action sequences which remind us of the Wolverine of old. Patrick Stewart as a tired and unstable Professor X also gives his best.<br/><br/>The movie has its funny moments thanks to the brilliant chemistry between Logan and Professor X. It almost feels nostalgic watching them arguing over little things and nagging each other, but it is the young Dafne Keen who is the show stealer with her portrayal of Laura, whose actions speak more than words. The sequences with her and Logan fighting together are jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>Logan is the perfect ending to one of the great legendary characters of recent times. The only catch is that this film is very violent and not at all recommended for younger kids. Logan is an action-packed emotional ride, whether you are an X-Men fan or not. I walked away with a heavy heart, as I expect most of you will."
"curtroo32","6","4","10","6 March 2017"," Disappointing with one redemptive scene
","I was hooked into watching this movie because of a combination of seeing every other X-Men movie and because the preview for the movie was incredible. I thought this was going to be above and beyond better than any other X-Men movie. While it was not bad, it was not very good.<br/><br/>I did enjoy large portions of the movie and several of the themes. However, it did not seem to finish any main theme. The themes of age, decay, and sorrow are very clear, but they were not well concluded. The movie just leaves you hanging. The movie seemed as lost as the characters, which if intended, then they succeeded.<br/><br/>The language was completely unnecessary and distracting. The same movie could have been made and the same points could have been brought up without any of the language. It was as if the writers just wanted to make the movie dirty for the sake of being dirty.<br/><br/>God was pointlessly brought up unless the point was to make subtle jabs at theism.<br/><br/>There was one very good scene toward the end of the movie that for me was the main redemptive aspect of the movie. I will probably forever remember that scene.<br/><br/>The movie leaves a lot to the imagination which is both a good and bad thing. Viewers could definitely leave the theater very confused about the development of the story.<br/><br/>Finally, unfortunately like many action movies, it eventually gets rather silly in regards to its action."
"chitreshgupta","10","4","10","6 March 2017"," Hugh Jackman delivers brutal, touching swansong to Wolverine
","""Guys, you don't want to do this."" We've been in this situation before. Logan is surrounded by half a dozen goons. They're usually armed. Depending on where he is at that moment, he could be attacked by katanas, revolvers, or like this time, with monkey wrenches. But he warns them. It's only fair. They don't know who he is, what he's capable of.<br/><br/>This is how Logan begins. But this time, events don't pan out like they used to. Wolverine doesn't have a wry smile on his face as he hacks and slashes his way out. This time, he gets beaten to a pulp, the blows break his bones, rip out his flesh. The wounds that once used to heal immediately are left gaping. There's blood everywhere. And lot of swearing. This time, unlike the countless times before, Logan almost dies.<br/><br/>From the first moment Johnny Cash's mournful voice graced that terrific trailer, there was a sense that Hugh Jackman and director James Mangold were not going to play by the rules anymore. For Jackman, it was his ninth time playing Wolverine, and for Mangold, it is another shot to perfect what he almost achieved in 2013, when he sent Logan to Japan.<br/><br/>For both of them however, it was now or never. Jackman's missed no opportunity to tell everyone that this would be his last time playing the Wolverine, the character that defined his career, and would probably continue to define him for the rest of his life. Perhaps it was this pressure to do well, to erase bad memories (hopefully, after this, X-Men Origins will be forgotten), or perhaps it was the freedom afforded to it by the success of Deadpool, but Logan is unlike any superhero film you have seen. Like that Cash song, it is minimalistic, meditative, melancholy, and has nothing to lose anymore. We've seen him go through hell, we've seen him watch on as everyone he loves dies, and all he can do is keep living. All Wolverine can do is keep fighting. But what for? The reason comes in the form of a girl, no older than 10.<br/><br/>When we catch up with Logan, grizzled, visibly older, the scars on his body like haunting memories of the past, it is 2029. No mutants have been born in the last 20 years. They've become folktales, legends passed on in comic books, and perhaps even movies. Logan scrapes a living driving a limo near the US-Mexico border. The little money he makes goes into buying medicine for his friend Charles, Professor X. They live in the desert, away from everyone else, together, like they have been for so many years. They're all they have in this world.<br/><br/>And then, Laura arrives. She's a lot like him, Charles tells Logan. She's a mutant. The first one to come along in decades. And she's the only hope they have. It is rumoured that thousands of miles away, in North Dakota, there is a safe haven for others like her, like them. That is where they must take her, away from the bad men.They do the only thing they can. In a subtle homage to the first X-Men movie, Logan takes the girl under his wing. They steal a car, grab some snacks, and take to the road.<br/><br/>It is said that the superhero movie will soon go the way of the movie Western (not by me, but by better minds, like Spielberg and Lucas), how it has arrived at a saturation point, how the six-shooters and cowboy hats made way for spandex and force fields as they journeyed towards their final destination. For an uncommonly grim film which would much rather contemplate mortality than gleefully demolish a city, the idea of Logan reviving a dying genre – two dying genres – is almost poetic.<br/><br/>There is only one way to push this genre forward, to prevent it from becoming obsolete. And that is to deconstruct it, to rip off all the excess CGI, all the capes and cowls, and exhume the essence of what makes these movies so great. Logan does that. And then it does it again.<br/><br/>It takes cues from classics like Children of Men, The Wrestler, and even the great video game The Last of Us. It is uncompromising in its brutality and fearless in its reverence of these iconic characters. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, and what creative freedom can produce.<br/><br/>Logan's cinematic journey began 17 years ago in a forest. He was making money fighting in cages. A young girl saved him then, she showed him what it was like to have a family, what it felt like to be good. In Logan, it takes another girl to show him who he really is, to remind him that his life was worth something.<br/><br/>It is the perfect swansong he could've got."
"deepak-zeest","10","4","10","5 March 2017"," The easiest 5/5 I have ever rated. The best Wolverine movie till date, and arguably one of the best Superhero movies to come out of Hollywood.
","LOGAN is the best Wolverine movie till date, and arguably one of the best Superhero movies to come out of Hollywood. This movie is everything we wanted from this genre and more. <br/><br/>The drastic shift of this franchise towards an R-rated film, as well as the first Red-band trailer was enough to draw its fans crazy. The morbid serenity and the macabre loneliness exuding from the trailer accompanied by that painful country music hooked us up to the movie from the get go. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie itself showcasing an old, wearied-out and tattered Wolverine when the majority of the mutants in the world have been flushed out is extremely fascinating and honest. As fans, we all know that although Wolverine has an extremely prolonged life because of his powers, there must come a time when all of his friends have lived their life, and he is left with the scathing memories of days past, friends lost, people he has harmed, and the pain he has suffered. <br/><br/>Oh man how beautifully they have depicted all of it! What better than the same material which was injected in him to create an invincible weapon, could be the device of his slow but sure deterioration. Add to it the emotional turmoil he has gone through for centuries, he has nothing to lose. Hugh Jackman does what he does best : Be that character which no one could dream to do better than him - the Wolverine. Perhaps better than he has ever done it before.<br/><br/>Words fell short of praise for the little girl (Laura) who is the proverbial legacy/daughter of Wolverine and has gone through the same fate (or worse) Logan went through once for the Weapon-X program. Dafne Keen, the actress is so beautiful and so vicious in her portrayal that it melts hearts and conjures fear in our hearts both at the same time. Case in point : The scene which shows her walking forward with a severed head of a soldier which she had ripped out of his body while being attacked, as if it is some kind of a prize, and rolling the head out in front of the villain. She is the evolution of madness as well as purity in a Wolverine-like character, both at the same time. <br/><br/>Not to forget, the gore and violence which was one of the many reasons why Fox planned to shift to the R-rating, and man it did not disappoint! Wolverine is one character we innately recognize to have the ability to exact extreme physical damage - his adamantium claws and beastly instincts are enough persuasion to the point. But, since the X-Men franchise started in 2000, all we got to witness of Wolverine were the physical blows, and not what happened to the opponent because of that. The maximum those movies had to offer was extreme damage to objects which Wolverine complied with efficiently. Now, we could not complain as all those movies were supposed to look and feel that way for the general target audience which subscribes to the comic-book movie genre. But what Deadpool did with an R- rating changed history. More and more people subscribed to that specific genre, so much so that it became the highest grossing R- rated movie till date. And what Logan did with it takes it one notch above. The violence presented in the movie reaffirms our perspective of Wolverine's abilities with great shocking visuals and underlying humour. Both Logan's and Laura's abilities to be precise.<br/><br/>Sir Patrick Stewart does an ineffable job with his portrayal of Dr Charles Xavier who is a nonagenarian with a cancerous tumour in his brain, which, to quote the movie line, is a weapon of mass- destruction in itself. The potential disaster his brain could unleash has been depicted in a manner which creates dread in the audience, forget what happens to the people around him. He has outlived his peers, and he is on the verge of departure, but he has to do this one last thing for the people he cares and lived his life for : the next generation of mutants, and especially Laura. The camaraderie of Charles and Logan has been depicted so warmly and humorously, that one could not get enough of it. <br/><br/>The father-daughter dynamic of Logan and Laura has been under-played so beautifully that it does not seem imposed on the audience. It is only until the last act that we witness Logan rising up as what the movie portrays him to be. The passing on of the mantle from the father to his daughter, as portrayed in the movie poster, is much more realistic than it looks, and encompasses various layers of emotions unprecedented in this genre.<br/><br/>What takes the cake for me was the ending : That depiction of the cross being tilted by Laura into an X just gave me goosebumps, and the whole journey of the X-men flashed in front of my eyes (I would not explain more).<br/><br/>Lastly, I have found people who are not happy with the villains in the movie and are of the opinion that the villains were bland and weak. Well, I agree with them on the opinion, but I also feel that the movie was never about the villains in it. Good villain, bad villain - I never thought it mattered much in this movie.<br/><br/>For me, Logan did everything I expected of it from the trailer, and much more. I could not be more obsessed about an X-men movie as is evident from this long-ass review I have wrote which I rarely do. I simply adore this movie. <br/><br/>The easiest 5/5 I have ever rated. Salutes to James Mangold and respect."
"akarmiotis-94922","8","4","10","5 March 2017"," Logan is what Marvel isn't and what DC wants to be
","Drama. Western. Road movie. Logan is far more than just another superhero film, grounding the genre to satisfy a wider audience but not losing the charm and fun that's made it such a success. Learning from the mistakes of DC, Logan creates a dark and cruel world without sacrificing colour or a sense of humour.<br/><br/>Closing the door on his definitive role, Hugh Jackman is finally allowed to unleash the ferocity and bloody carnage of the character trapped for so long by the blockbuster intention of the franchise. With Deadpool proving the box office potential of R rated superhero flicks, Logan goes full throttle with some of the most brutal violence you will see in a mainstream picture; blood soaked and torn limb from limb, the body count rises steadily throughout and finally allow us to see the obvious results of a manimal with 3 unbreakable claws. Director James Mangold brought a sophistication to The Wolverine that was shackled by the expectations of a family audience but here he creates a perfect portrayal of the X-Men character in a barren, hopeless future. Logan rises above a lot of its competition as it's a character piece first and an action film second, using the brilliant fight sequences to compliment the splintered psyche of an older, broken Logan.<br/><br/>Wolverine has worked in the past as a father figure to the likes of Rogue but here it is most apparent in the form of Laura, a young mutant who drives the plot and proves to be just as savage and thrilling as Logan when it comes to taking out the enemy, as lacklustre as they may be. Jackman continues to be perfect as the titular mutant but the standout performance belongs undoubtedly to Sir Patrick Stewart as a very different Charles Xavier from the wise mentor we know; elderly and cranky, Xavier is both an object of pity and admiration as a source of both tragedy and comedic relief from the consistently angst ridden Logan. In terms of world building, Logan depicts a dark conclusion for the X-Men universe that is tragic but realistic; adding a layer of grittiness that sets it apart from the idealism of Marvel and the grime of DC.<br/><br/>Logan is a fanboy dream come true, sending off Hugh Jackman in a blaze of blood and guts while further creating hope for the future of the stagnating superhero genre. It's gory, a tearjerker and, well, any film that gives Stephen Merchant an action movie one liner deserves at least some credit.<br/><br/>SWEET<br/><br/>Visit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more."

","I wasn't really excited seeing Logan. I went in expecting just another generic X-men movie. What I got was far beyond my expectations. In my opinion this is Hugh Jackman's best performance and also his last as Wolverine. The directing was great especially during the tense and action-packed fight scenes. The movie had a number of epic and thrilling scenes with a few touching and sad moments. It was good to see Patrick Stewart come back as Professor X. It was a great send off for the character Wolverine. Overall, Logan is a thrilling action-packed ride with sad moments and a ton of gore. Recommended for people that aren't afraid to see a little blood."
"dfbairn","5","4","10","4 March 2017"," Putting the X in X-Men
","In what may be Hugh Jackman's final donning of the iconic adamantium claws, James Mangold's Logan marks the ultimate chapter in the stand-alone wolverine trilogy. Having played Wolverine for an astounding 17 years, the character fits Hugh Jackman like a knuckle-less glove. However, that is as good as it is bad – the character hasn't progressed, he's just older. Patrick Stewart, on the other hand, manages to bring a welcome freshness to the dementing Charles Xavier. His simply stellar performance portrays the much-loved character in a vastly different light, whilst maintaining him in essence. Finally, Dafne Keen's performance can only be described as intriguing. It's difficult to fall in love with her character, or even determine her acting talent, as the 11-year-old killing machine spends the greater part of the film grunting, groaning and goring baddies. Logan has been praised extensively for its unique premise: in a future where few mutants remain (X-Men: Days of Future Past), a less immortal Logan (The Wolverine) reluctantly protects a young female mutant (X-Men) from a government agency bent on creating their own killer mutants (X-Men 2, X-Men Origins: Wolverine). However, Logan is much more bloodthirsty and violent than any of its predecessors; although every cut and slash is done purposefully, and for a reason: to mutilate, maim, and murder. If you're wanting a superhero film, then Logan is not that film. It's merely a film that happens to have one person with insane mental abilities, and two others with retractable claws, metal skeletons, and self-regenerating bodies. That, and the same number of super-powered individuals as Captain America: Civil War. But, to be fair, half of the mutant children seem to forget they have these powers anyway. On that note, it seems unfortunate that the vast majority of the film's mutants won't be able to watch the film due to age restrictions. Likewise, Logan is not an action film. Actually, no, it kind of is. It has three major action sequences – including the climax – and some smaller fight scenes throughout. But aside from those negligible details it is essentially a drama. A very bloody drama. While it may be some time until we get Deadpool vs. Wolverine (if ever), Logan has – for now – topped the class with his rendition of 'Another One Bites the Dust'. If indeed this is to be Logan's last outing, then what better way to end than in a blaze of gory?"
"CANpatbuck3664","9","4","10","4 March 2017"," Logan is a Dark and Gritty Swansong to Hugh Jackman's Excellent Portrayal of Wolverine
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a hilarious and random opening from a fan favourite X-Men character, we join Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in the year 2029. The mutant population has largely been obliterated and there aren't any new mutants being born. Logan is being employed as a limo-driver, he runs random people here and there for work. His plan is to eventually save up for a boat so he can take his mentor/friend Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and isolate them from the world. We know Xavier has telepathic powers but they're starting to decay and with his mindset deteriorating, he's become a danger to not only himself but to society. Logan is looking a little worse for ware, he has to violently deal with a couple of thieves and he doesn't heal like he normally does. His age is starting to show and he's constantly drinking to deal with his pain.<br/><br/>Things are looking pretty bleak until he runs into a creepy representative of Transgien Corp. named Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) who is tracking a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen). Her mother tried to stop Logan and offer him a job escorting them to the North Dakota border for $50,000. Logan turned her down but reconsiders and when he goes back the next day, he finds her murdered and Laura climbs into his car looking for help.<br/><br/>The biggest headline when it comes to Logan is that its Hugh Jackman's last performance as Wolverine. Through thick and thin, he's always been committed to the part and he's consistently been a bright spot in the X-Men franchise. He's just as good in Logan if not better. He does a great job showing Logan's inner pain and his ruthless energy carries this movie. He obviously threw his all into this and he's awesome as this dark and tormented version of Wolverine. Patrick Stewart gave a different kind of performance as Xaiver in this movie. His dignity and intellect are largely stripped away and he does a great job showing Professor X as this shell of his former self. Dafne Keen was excellent as X-23, this was one of the better kid actor/actress performances I've ever seen. Her intensity is crazy and she holds her own completely against Jackman and Stewart. Boyd Holbrook was fine as Pierce, he does a serviceable job and he's effective in his part. I also really like Stephen Merchant as Caliban, he's normally a comedic actor but he's pretty solid in a fairly dramatic part. I applaud him for stepping out of his wheelhouse.<br/><br/>Logan continues a trend in blockbuster movies that I really like where its not afraid to tell a more intimate and condensed story. It doesn't always have to be about saving the world from some overly elaborate threat. This story is essentially about Logan protecting Laura and Professor X from this corporation and they set this story up as more of a western. Some of my favourite moments in this movie are away from the action (the scenes where they take shelter at a farm were some of my favourites) and the interactions between these characters were easy to get swept up in.<br/><br/>The tone of Logan is pretty bleak and for those who are going into this expecting more of the same from Wolverine and X-Men franchise, you'll end up either very surprised or very disappointed. This movie is really about Logan's inner turmoil and his struggle to come to terms with what he's done over the years. The action matches the tone by being very violent. I actually liked that about this, Wolverine has always been an edgy character and seeing him brutally deal with his enemies fit. The action is well-filmed and capitalizes on our hero's abilities. X-23 is something to watch in those scenes too. She mows through people and yet due to the film making, it never seems too implausible.<br/><br/>Logan isn't my favourite X-Men movie, it holds 2nd place for me behind X-Men: First Class (I also liked Deadpool a little better but I feel like that one belongs in a different category). I have very little to complain about when it comes to this. I do feel like the hype for this movie has gotten a little out of control. Logan is great but I wouldn't say its the best superhero movie ever. I think this is a stellar movie that gives hardcore fans of Wolverine what they want. I'd give Logan an 8.5/10"
"brendanhughes-46593","9","4","10","4 March 2017"," Berserker Rage on Screen
","This is an excerpt from Nerdent ""dot"" Net.<br/><br/>Logan is Hugh Jackman's last movie playing the character many cannot break apart and making the movie based off of Mark Miller's renowned Old Man Logan. I had my doubts about this film only due to the fact key characters in the series are splintered owned by separate companies. However, the way James Mangold has crafted the story he was able to jump over many of the major hurdles holding this movie back.<br/><br/>The tone of this movie is gritty and real though scene can tug at the heartstrings with that family undertone. This might be the most realistic X-Men movie in existence with all the glitter stripped away from the characters no mansion, on the run, and bodies breaking down. I forgot about the movie being R rated until being carded at the theaters but it was well deserved as the action in this movie was bloody gruesome and just plain animistic. Even though this is based on Old Man Logan I was surprised to see so little attempt of Logan not using his claws, except hinting at it in one scene and instead often sent into Berserker Rage.<br/><br/>Though there is plenty of rage, crudeness, and substance use there is still some wholesome qualities such as family qualities. We've seen Xavier and Logan go at it in previous movies as they know much about each other. Charles might have the best grasp on Logan due to knowing where he came from and what he has done which is why he wants Logan to have a normal life with Laura. Similarly, Logan despite being hesitant of having a daughter, in the beginning, is soon a father figure in her life. Logan slowly becomes what Xavier wants from him a father as he places his life on the line as X-23 and her siblings as they make their way to Canada.<br/><br/>Logan was the perfect standoff to Hugh Jackman's run of the character he has been playing for the last 17 years. Though the film is Rated R and full of adult content ranging from substance use to bloody gore Mangold ties it together with a family vibe with all the characters. I believe it could've been more faithful to the source material though splintered fractions of Marvel characters hindered it. Stylistically the movie was a work of art from the cinematography to choreography. Where Wolverine will go from here is still to be seen but he will pop up sooner than later due to the character's popularity."
"hegedus_dani02","9","4","10","4 March 2017"," The stunning end of Hugh Jackman's 17 years old career defining role
","I was extremely eager to watch Logan, the farewell of Hugh Jackman to the X-men cinematic universe. It quite surprised and upset me that Patrick Stewart revealed he is departing also. So I sat into the cinema with my friends and with my high expectations, and I got what I expected. Nothing less, but neither nothing more.<br/><br/>Firstly we should state, that Logan is not the X-man universe's Dark Knight. I believe, that Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece is a remarkable milestone in movie history, and we just can't compare Logan to it. With this I'm not saying Logan isn't great, I just saying that it isn't a masterpiece like The Dark Knight, it's a masterpiece in its own way among its own franchise. <br/><br/>Then to what films can we compare Logan? Well, we can certainly compare it to the previous Wolverine movies. And it is absolutely obvious, that Logan surpasses it's predecessors in every possible way. The main difference between the first two and the last installment of the Wolverine franchise is the age certification. The R rating created a violent and dark atmosphere for Jackman's character which were missing for X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and Wolverine (2013). The three film's titles are also remarkable. X-Men Origins: Wolverine focused on the creation and early-era of the most popular mutant, while Wolverine's plot revolved around the character's struggling with it's non-human capability and it's mutant enemies. On the other hand, Logan's story centers around human side of the x-men. The additional new mutant we get in every X-Men movie has much more human characteristics than any other previously. Caliban (Stephen Merchant) has got realistic emotions and feelings which is new but definitely great in this franchise. We also see that even the most powerful humans are mortal: *LARGE SPOILER WARNING* Both Wolverine and Professor Xavier finds their bane in this flick. <br/><br/>And finally some sentences for the technical aspects. The direction is just simply amazing. James Mangold managed the composite the cinematic elements in a fascinating way. I would glad to see him direct some less action-oriented realistic dark mooded feature, something like Christopher Nolan's The Prestige or Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners. The cinematography and the editing is astonishing. Both the fight scenes and the simple dialogue scenes are visually beautiful. This is probably the most perfectly edited Marvel movie to date, and only the Russo brothers' Captain America: Civil War beats it the case of camera-work. Last but not least, the soundtrack is awesome. We finally got a Marvel movie with proper score and songs that you'll remember and want to listen to them long after you finished the film. I highlight this thing because I think Marvel movies had a shortage of great soundtracks till this movie, possibly except Tim Miller's Deadpool. <br/><br/>To sum up, Logan is a must-see flick for any movie fans. Though don't except a film as great as The Dark Knight, this will be a movie you won't forget soon. After it you'll be probably sad that Jackman and Stewart is finished with this genre, but you'll totally understand it seeing their performances and character development. Logan is definitely the peak of the Wolverine franchise. It is a well-deserved farewell for Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>'You either die a hero, or you'll live long enough to see yourself become the villain.'"
"connorbbalboa","10","4","10","3 March 2017"," ""Logan, you still have time...""
","I had a hard time just coming up with a title for this review. Because, honestly, how important is that when talking about a film like Logan? It's probably one of the few superhero movies I've seen that deserves to be called perfect. I just went to see this with a friend, and we agree that this film excited us, shocked the hell out of us, and presented us with characters that we love and are now all broken down, and a genuinely great story that follows how they spend their final days.<br/><br/>The plot here is that Wolverine, or James Howlett, or Logan (Hugh Jackman) is spending his days driving people around the city for cash to buy medicine for the now emotionally-broken and physically declining Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with the help of fellow surviving mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant) who can't go out into the sun without burning severely. Logan himself is declining too, with scars forming on his body and his healing factor working much slower than before. Everything changes when Laura (Dafne Keen) walks into their lives and asks to be taken to a place called Eden in North Dakota. All the while, they are pursued by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and Dr. Zandar Rice (Richard E. Grant), who want Laura back.<br/><br/>What I will say right now is that this movie will break the hearts of anyone who loves X-Men and the character of Wolverine. I can't give anything away, but I will tell you that there are moments that show you how much people like Logan and Xavier can screw up and how they have to live with their mistakes. Logan himself is at his lowest point and he convincingly acts in a way where you wonder who the man was underneath that Adamantium skeleton and those berserker rages. Xavier himself plays off Jackman very well. He talks like a bitter old grandfather at times who is unhappy with his ""son"" and yet acts like a grandfather who has the opposite personality: loving, understanding, and sharing his wisdom of the world with Laura. A scene where they watch Shane (1953) is especially touching.<br/><br/>Despite what other critics have said, the villains are great here. Holbrook is properly cruel and twisted and Grant plays the kind of villain you want to hate. The fact is, neither of them play super-powered bad guys who want to take over the world. This is one superhero film where I wouldn't have cared if the villains didn't get much backstory or dimension, because it is not their story; they are just forces that Logan and co. keep running into and are part of a less tolerant and more unfriendly government.<br/><br/>The violence is done well and Logan slicing his enemies up in a gory fashion is something we finally get to see. Here, Wolvie stabs people in places we haven't seen him stab before and whenever those claws do strike somebody, there's always blood. Logan shows that even though he's old, he's still a pro, and even then, we see that every new wound he receives in his state just slows him down even more and makes him worse.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen is definitely something of a complete surprise in terms of child acting. Even though she doesn't say much for most of the film, she nails the aggressive stares and animalistic and child-like tendencies very well. When she cries and is frightened, it feels very real, and not annoying like with many child actors. In fact, some may consider this a stretch, but she might be the best child actor I have ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>The film seems to take a lot of cues from something like Mad Max, with similar desert landscapes, and the story of an aging iconic character who needs to get past his emotional pain and redeem himself is still exciting here. It worked with Rocky Balboa and James Bond in Skyfall, and it works here. It's clear that Logan feels pain and through his conversations with Xavier, it's obvious that he needs redemption. Its great script (filled with numerous earned curse words) drives one in to see if Logan actually achieves it.<br/><br/>To end, Logan is a fantastic movie. Period. Not ""superhero"" movie. This film will most likely make you question how good other superhero movies that you've seen really are, as it's doing to me now. I'm not kidding; this film will provide you with emotional satisfaction and leave you feeling like you had seen not a superhero movie, but something else entirely.

","As you most of you know,this is the last film in which we expect to see Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine,who has become an icon for many people.Joined by Patrick Stewart they are reunited once again in a film with a tremendous impact on all people have followed the course of Wolverine all those years and to those who see it for the first time.So lets take a look where the events occur.<br/><br/>It is 2029.All the mutants are gone.The last survivors of the mutant kind are Wolverine,Professor X and Calliban.However,none of them is the same person who once was(well except for Caliban maybe i am not sure).Logan's powers have been greatly diminished.He is old,grumpy,scarred and his temper is bigger than ever.His healing ability isn't as strong as it used to be and the proof is the scars all over his body.Charles Xavier(prof X) has Alzheimer and he is having mind crises.Logan tries his best to take care of Charles,but he is caught up in a chain of events that include a young mutant named Laura(Daphne Keen) and some bad guys chasing after her.<br/><br/>Most of or all the fans of wolverine wanted an R-rated movie.This movie certainly lives up to their expectations,as the violence here is way beyond anyone would think for the x-men series or any other superhero movie.The fights here are brutal,savage,bloody with gruesome images that will shake you from your seat.Wolverine here literally goes berserk.He is finally releasing the beast that has long buried as he slashes,maims,decapitates his enemies.But the credits for that cannot only go to Logan,because he has lots of help from Laura.<br/><br/>However,this film adds most of its strength from the character development and the acting.Wolverine is not only physically,but emotionally devastated.A mere reflection of his past self.An old relic.He has almost lost the will to live and you will see in the movie how far he went on this matter.But,as the movie progresses he discovers a new purpose that gives him enough will to carry on.Charles has become miserable and sad because of something terrible he did in the past.In spite of that,with the founding of Laura we see a resemblance of our old,caring professor as he tries to take care of her like he did with his former students and teach Logan the meaning of life.As for Laura,in the beginning she is insecure and quite bitter.Later though, she begins to trust and like more both Charles and Logan.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives the best performance as the Wolverine and he doesn't have to anchor this movie by himself this time.Credits must be given to Patrick Stewart who delivers an enjoyable yet emotional performance.The standout of this movie though, is Daphne Keen who despite her young age is able to stand here ground to the A-list actors mentioned.Thanks to their performances,they ""force"" you to root and care for their characters.When they are wounded,you hurt.When they are happy,you feel relieved and happy as well.You develop an emotional tether with them during movie that doesn't break even after the end.<br/><br/>Although,what kind of superhero would Logan be if it didn't have a villain?This movie's main villain is Donald Pierce(Boyd Holbrook).This isn't the kind of villain that tries to scare you.He just messes around with you but he will become lethal when needed.He is a suitable villain for this movie.But,he isn't the only threat that our characters have to face,as more challenges stand in their way:inner struggles and more foes to fight.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie for all those reasons mentioned because it distinguishes itself from the usual superhero movies.Notably,i was so touched by this movie,that it brought tears to my eyes.I have watched all the x-men films and i liked most of them but none of them managed to reach this movie's level of emotion or action.This was meant to be Hugh Jackman's final chapter as the Wolverine.If it is,please let it be the final and don't replace him because there won't be another actor that can replace Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in people's hearts."
"ryanskywalker-87402","10","4","10","2 March 2017"," ""so this is what it feels like""
","If there was any film likely to leave me in tears this year in the cinema, it was going to be Logan. Hugh Jackman's swansong to the X- Men franchise and to the character of Wolverine he'd been playing for 17 years. Logan is a character I've been watching since I was 4 years old back in 2004, so in many ways it felt like the end of my childhood.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Logan is a film that has matured with it's audience that had been watching X-Men since their early years. It's a dark, miserable and depressing film and barely resembles a single superhero film of recent years. I'll also say seriously that this is the best superhero film since The Dark Knight, possibly even better.<br/><br/>This was a beautiful, powerful and violent send-off that worked far better than I ever possibly could have imagined. Hugh Jackman plays a far older, broken and worn down Wolverine whose healing powers don't work very well anymore and has to look after a dementia stricken Professor Xavier who is prone to dangerous psychological outbursts. Logan ends up reluctantly having to look after and take a clone of himself in the form of a young girl to sanctuary while being hunted by a military group.<br/><br/>Where Logan differs itself from other superhero films is its tone and content. While Deadpool was a violent and crude film, Logan is far more mature, resonate and powerful. This is not a kids film, not just due to the adult content, but the bleak and miserable tone throughout.<br/><br/>It's really sad to see these characters you grew up with in such a broken state. Logan is a borderline alcoholic reduced to being a limo driver, while Xavier is a shadow of his former self. It's heartbreaking stuff that works so well thanks to the incredible performances from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. They manage to mix superhero nonsense with genuine heart, warmth, tragedy and even comedy at times. It's all so bittersweet, but it works.<br/><br/>They're joined by a star making turn from Dafne Keen as 'Laura' a near mute clone of Logan who is on the run from a military group. While barely saying anything, Keen brings so much to the role, delivering a really touching father-daughter relationship Logan had been unable to have throughout his whole tragic life. What's even more impressive is the fact this is only Keen's second role in her entire career and she nearly stole the show from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. This is probably the best child performance I've seen since Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass.<br/><br/>The Office/Extras writer Stephen Merchant also gave a memorable turn as Caliban, a pale albino mutant who brings a lighter tone to some of Logan's more bleak outlook. He's essentially doing what he usually does, but with some makeup on. Anyway, it was nice to see him a huge blockbuster film for once. He earns it more than his co- writer Ricky Gervais. And now I just imagined an alternate universe where Gervais was in this too...<br/><br/>James Mangold takes on directorial duties as he did with the previous Wolverine outing 'The Wolverine' in 2013, which was great until it's third act, but still 1000x better than 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Logan thankfully does not suffer from the same pitfalls as Mangold's last effort with the Wolverine character. Probably due to the fact he was allowed creative control to make a violent, R- rated send-off that lacks a bombastic CGI heavy finale.<br/><br/>All the action in Logan feels small and contained, but is brutal and hard-hitting at the same time. It was so satisfying to see Wolverine actually cut people up into gory messes. While extremely violent, it all works within the tone of the film. I wasn't a massive fan of the frequent swearing at the beginning of the film, but that soon wore off and they toned it down.<br/><br/>Mangold directs the action scenes with kinetic beauty, making use of both Wolverine and Laura in some visually beautiful action scenes. The cinematography of Logan feels closer to No Country for Old Men than it does a superhero film. Logan has the vibe of a neo-western and looks gorgeous, full of nice looking deserts and even a trip to Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, I'd honestly be okay if this was the ending to the X-Men series as a whole. It leaves things in such a powerful and perfect way that I was tearing up. While is the end of Hugh Jackman's run as Wolverine, it also feels like the end point of the X-Men we all grew up with, and it managed to do it all perfectly.<br/><br/>Logan is a powerful, violent and beautiful send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as Logan. It's also one of the best superhero films of all-time and likely to be one of the best films of 2017. I really hope there's Oscar considerations for Logan for next years awards."

","I saw the movie 2 days ago. It premiered here in Taiwan before America, so I simply got lucky to be in the right place at the right time. I've been an X-men fan since issue Uncanny X-men 129 and the original run of the Hell-Fire Club was nothing short of stunning with it's Dark Pheonix ending. But alas, I gave up comic collecting in 1992 and moved on to other things. Still loved most of the movies... but most of them were based on stories I already knew and loved.<br/><br/>Then came this.<br/><br/>I knew nothing about X-23 before I entered the theater. 2 days of research and I would have to say that I missed out on a very intriguing character. The backstory given in the movie is nearly the same as you would expect it from the books / TV-Show, so there are no surprises there. But what makes this stand out is the performance of one young (OMGOSH SHE'S TWELVE YEARS OLD!!!) actress -- Dafne Keen.<br/><br/>From the moment she bursts onto the screen in full primal fury, you know you need to buckle your seat belts, cause this movie is going places fast. The sheer ferocity of the character is so amazingly well channeled through Dafne's performance that you find yourself stunned as she becomes a brutally lethal killing force. Her performance is so perfect, so incredibly much so, that one of my biggest problems with this movie stems directly from it: Child violence. The movie brims with it. CHILDREN.... killing as if it really meant nothing to do so. As if it were just another video game. <br/><br/>I understand --- they are in the fight for their very survival and thus you do what you have to do --- but seeing it play out is unnerving and at times unsettling.<br/><br/>And yet... still.... Dafne.... wow.<br/><br/>Watching Logan and Professor X bicker like the two old men they actually are (Professor X is in his 90's during this movie, which is said to take place in 2029), you can't help but wonder what put them in the situation they are shown in --- Wolverine a stumbling alcoholic and Charles Xavier on the edge of dementia, suffering from Alzheimer's. It will break your heart to see these once great heroes at the end of their days.<br/><br/>Sir Patrick Stewart's performance is top-notch. You honestly want to cry for his situation throughout the movie. And Hugh Jackman, well, this movie will more than make up for the last two duds. As a final turn for their portraying these characters --- they go out fighting and give us a movie worth seeing again and again, so as to enjoy the subtly of brilliance that is their performances.<br/><br/>There are questions still remaining from all this:<br/><br/>1) What happened in West Chester? 2) Where are all the other mutants & why are there no more being born? 3) Just how did X-23 (and the others) escape and find their way to safety.... and just what safety is there? (It's never shown) 4) What became of the ""Days of Future Past"" time line set up in the last X-men movie? 5) And if Adamantium is truly the source of the poison that is affecting Logan's healing ---- won't the same be true for X-23 (Laura) at some point?<br/><br/>There are other questions.... but I want to end on this: <br/><br/>It's not often that a movie will surprise you and leave you wishing that they had made it longer... maybe even doubled the time it was presented in.... this is one of those rare movies. It could have been 4 hours long... and it still wouldn't have been enough. You'll understand when you see Laura and Logan in action. It's like pure poetry.<br/><br/>Go see the movie... you won't regret it."
"themadmovieman","8","4","10","1 March 2017"," An exhilarating and bold new take on the superhero genre
","It's third time lucky for the Wolverine, because we've finally got a solo movie for the X-Men's most beloved character that fully achieves what it sets out to do. Intensely violent and gritty from start to finish, Logan is a thrilling and powerfully dramatic film that finally brings the gravitas and depth worthy of such a great character, making for an utterly exhilarating watch.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about Logan, however, is the fact that it's not a superhero movie. Yes, there's some amazing action and allusions to the X-Men universe, but at its core, this is an out-and-out character piece focusing on Logan as he grows more tired and weary of his long and guilt-ridden life.<br/><br/>However, that makes it absolutely fascinating to watch, and brings a level of dramatic depth and intrigue that we've never seen before in the comic book genre. From start to finish, Hugh Jackman does an incredible job at bringing his character's exhaustion to light, giving a gritty and battle-hardened performance that fits in perfectly with the film's heavy-going tone, and makes the dramatic assessment of the character all the more powerful.<br/><br/>And what's more is that the Wolverine is a very different person in this film than the one we know from the main X-Men movies. Whilst he's still got a gruff strength and personality, there's a lot less focus on his charisma as a superhero and more on how he has begun to struggle quite seriously with his inner demons over the last decade or so, something amazingly apparent on screen, and finally achieving a compelling detailing of the character's guilt, unlike the previous two Wolverine solo outings.<br/><br/>Alongside Hugh Jackman are two other fantastic performances. Patrick Stewart is stunning in a very nuanced and often even hard-to-watch turn as a Charles Xavier struggling with a degenerative brain disease, verging on death. His performance matches the dramatic heft of Jackman's, and adds significantly to the film's tender and emotional core, which was brilliant to see.<br/><br/>Also, Dafne Keen is unexpectedly brilliant as the young mutant who Wolverine and Xavier take in. I won't give anything away, but I have to say that the young actress does a fantastic job in a very wide- ranging performance. She brings some excellent comic relief at moments, she barely speaks a word throughout the movie, instead bringing the darker side of her character's story through in a subtly powerful performance, and she works fantastically in the action sequences.<br/><br/>One other person that we mustn't forget ti commend for this film is the director: James Mangold. Although he brought a fun, blockbuster image to The Wolverine, what he does with Logan is truly stunning. This movie's main objective is to be a quiet, intelligent and powerfully dramatic experience whilst mixing with an action and crime-oriented plot. It may sound simple, but the only time we've seen such a feat pulled off before is Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>However, Mangold does the job exceptionally with Logan, and brings that powerfully gritty and emotionally heavy-going atmosphere to the film in such a bold manner. This movie has no qualms about being exceptionally violent and dark, nor does it ever cheapen its quieter, more human story with superhero movie tropes, and that's what makes it such a compelling, exciting, powerful and thrillingly original film."

They end up creating another experiment to wipe out our main characters: Barakapool, Robot Samurai, Lady Deathstrike, and Clone Wolverine. This movie is just another same ole same rehash that Fox has a fetish for. Fox studios at this point is just as guilty as Disney.

The worst things said were that 'x element was different to the old man Logan story', followed by ""but it was so good!"". I saw Avengers Endgame with these friends too, they liked it, but that same enthusiasm for having just seen something truly satisfying wasn't there.

","This is the best film about X-Men. Good story, lots of action, tense to the very end. After so many years of shooting and after so many movies, this movie is definitely what I've been waiting for all this time. This is the first movie in which we see Logan really using his weapon, every movie with Logan should have been shot like this, but instead we had to watch movies in which he is scratching his enemies like a cat. It is sad that I had to wait so long to see the real X- Men. Because of this and because they killed two people who definitely did not have to kill I would give a lower rating, otherwise they would be 10 regardless of some ambiguities in the movie. I hope they will continue to record X-Men, although I do not know if it will be as before. As the next sequel will be a new acting team, I think movies will not be as before, but it is still waiting for us to see. They need to make use of Hugh Jackman while he is still alive to record another quality continuation. Definitely the best sequel of X-Men. I recommend watching the movie."

"MaximumMadness","10","3","7","30 October 2017"," ""Logan""- A devastatingly emotional and deeply satisfying conclusion for one of cinema's greatest heroes...
","When Hugh Jackman announced his intention to retire from the iconic role of Wolverine, you could cut the tension in the air with a knife. The sorrow felt by fans of the delightful ""X-Men"" film franchise was palpable. It rocked you right to the core. And for very good reason. Even with the passing of nearly two decades time, there was one thing of which we thought we were certain... that no matter what, Jackman would continue to be the tie that bound the series together, as he appeared in virtually every single film and always gave his entire being to the part that made him a star.<br/><br/>But for his own very valid reasons, he felt he said everything he could possibly say. He felt he had accomplished what he could accomplish after playing the legendary comic character for seventeen years. And thus, the choice was made- 2017's ""Logan"" would be his final turn in the franchise, and he would endeavor to make the best film he possibly could to reward all those who followed from the beginning and kept coming back to see him time after time. And he did it. ""Logan"", directed and co-written by James Mangold, is an absolute revelation. And it has emerged as not only one of the best films of the year... but also one of the greatest comic-book movies of all time. A devastatingly emotional and deeply satisfying conclusion to a character we've been following for many a year now.<br/><br/>Some time into the future, the world has changed once again. No new mutants have been born in almost twenty years, and what population remains has started to die off. This leads many to question just why they even existed... and if they were just some sort of cosmic mistake that was corrected by time. Logan (Jackman) has fled from society with the ailing and dying Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) after the end of the X-Men, and has created a new life as a limo- driver in West Texas. However, when Logan is approached by a mysterious woman, he finds himself thrust into what might be his final adventure- he is forced to protect a young girl called Laura (Dafne Keen), whom is being pursued by the devious Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and his 'Reaver' task-force. And through their journey to escape to the Candian wilderness, Logan will learn dark and treacherous secrets that might hold the key to his salvation and Laura's safety...<br/><br/>There really is no single thing one could point to when talking about the great success of ""Logan."" It's one of those perfect machines where everything comes together to function as a whole. From the remarkable and hard-hitting story, through the many shocking twists and turns, to the solid and slick visual direction and the absolutely fabulous performances... it truly is the best possible note that Jackman could have gone out on in every way imaginable.<br/><br/>The script and handling of character is amongst the best I've seen across the entire ""X-Men"" movie franchise. The story crafted by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green is thoughtful and poignant, yet also dark and morally ambiguous. The characters rich and complex, but not always inherently likable. And the stakes raising ever higher and higher constantly... yet also always managing to feel intimate and personal. It's a remarkable piece of work that often seems contradictory, but always comes together to form a cohesive whole. This is further aided by a simple and elegant sense of pace and structure, as the film wisely never goes too far. They keep it self-contained and never take their focus off of Logan and the journey he's on, nor bog it down with excessive action and effects. And Mangold tells the tale with a grim and gritty visual style that compliments it perfectly.<br/><br/>I'm often not a fan of studio-manufactured ""gritty"" visual direction. It's all too often used as a crutch, and leads to an unfortunate feeling of style over substance. But this is one of the rare cases in which it's not only warranted- but indeed necessary. Mangold's keen eye for visual storytelling allows him to tell this tale with gusto and ease, and the low-down, dirty aesthetic he gives to the film aids in its almost apocalyptic tone. It places you right into the story, and it never lets go, making you feel the same stark desperation that Logan and the others feel on their journey. It's masterfully handled, beginning to end.<br/><br/>And the performances are absolutely sublime. Stewart gives what might be his best turn as Xavier in a very sensitive way, as the man who once lead the X-Men has began to succumb to age and dementia. The role has an air of finality to it, and Stewart nails it. Keen is absolutely jaw-dropping and displays a talent far beyond her young age as a volatile figure that is ultimately a frightened and lonely child, and will melt your heart over and over again even as she lashes out and uses her abilities to do terrible things. Holbrook is adequately slimy and diabolical as the lead villain, and you can't help but love to hate him. And Jackman's final turn as Wolverine... is perfection. This really feels like the culmination of all that has come before, and Jackman knocks it out of the park in perhaps the greatest performance of his career. He's vulnerable, strong, cunning, scared, alone... he's just magic in the role, and you'll find yourself teary eyed as the film nears its end and the fact this is his final time playing the part starts to sink in.<br/><br/>""Logan"" is a revelation. It's complex and heartbreaking. Conclusive and satisfying. And it truly is the best possible film they could have made. It truly is one of the year's best films and one of the greatest comic-book movies ever made. Period. And it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10."

","Logan is one of those rare superhero films that does so much outside of the superhero genre this film was great from start to finish telling a bleak depressing story about a man at the end of his life all the performances where great Hugh jack-man gave his best performance as wolverine/Logan the little girl who played Logan's daughter was surprisingly great and she managed to hold her own with two other talented actors and of course sir Patrick Stewart was great as well. what i love most about Logan is the fact that this film stands out from the rest of superhero films we currently get where as most of them are bland safe stupid unfunny and only exist to set up another film Logan stands out because Logan has a end it sets you in realty and it has a story to tell and best of all its emotional and when you leave the film you will still be thinking about it the film does such a great job cinematography wise every shot looks really great all the characters are memorable and the film is pretty subtle to which is surprising to say the film doesn't really feel like a superhero story either which is a plus in my book the only complaint i have is with the noir version of the film and the poster mainly because the noir version isn't as impact full as the normal version i mean there are some really good shots from both versions off the film but the noir style just doesn't fit but i guess its just for big fans of the film i didn't hate it i did like it but i feel the normal version is better the poster is a bit disappointing its just Logan standing there i have seen way better fan made posters on the internet but other than that those are the only complaints i have trust me you will love this film if you see it for the first time so go see it"
"avik-basu1889","8","3","7","9 October 2017"," The Legend of Wolverine/Logan !!!
","The R-rated comic book movie as a concept isn't as new as some think it is. Be it the 'Blade' films or 'Kickass', bloody comic book movies have existed before too. But in modern pop culture due to the somewhat homogenization of the comic-book genre due to the big bloated cgi- heavy spectacle filmmaking that the audience has been subjected to with the MCU and other franchises, when Deadpool was released, it became a major box-office success. 'Deadpool' was deemed to be a representation of what could be done with the super-hero genre. However while 'Deadpool' was about dissecting the super-hero genre in a meta- comedic, self referential way with a heavy dose of juvenile humour, 'Logan' is about dissecting the super-hero genre by attempting to add a sense of maturity to the films by introducing elements of existentialism and mortality, themes which most comic book/super- hero films of this era tend to shy away from confronting or exploring in a serious way. There is a scene in 'Logan' in which Logan, Laura and Professor X are trying to escape from a group of men in their car(limo). During that scene, there is a moment where Logan tries to ram the car through a steel fence. In a general MCU film, he would've been able to successfully ram it through the fence and get away. In 'Deadpool', he would've again managed to do it successfully, but this time it would've been followed by a self-referential joke about how that shouldn't have happened in a realistic sense, but since this is a comic- book film, anything is allowed. However in 'Logan' not only does he NOT manage to ram the car through the fence, the steel grills get awkwardly stuck near the front wheels of the car. That moment in the film visually represents the mature sense of slightly elevated realism that 'Logan' is striving for. The film and its themes work to a great extent due to the performances. Hugh Jackman has always been good as Wolverine, but this is probably his best performance as the aforementioned mutant. His general demeanour, physical appearance and overall presence exude a sense of world-weariness, a sense of exhaustion and emotional surrender complementing the usual rugged, hard-boiled grit that Jackman is known for in his Wolverine portrayals. The father- son-like dynamics between Sir Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Logan felt very realistic in the way they constantly bicker and argue even though there is a clear sense of mutual love simmering beneath. Daphne Keen is also very good as Laura. 'Logan' keeping in tune with 'Deadpool' attempts to be meta to some extent. There is a moment where Logan pulls up an X-men comic book and talks about how the comic books fabricate reality and add sensationalism to make everything look magical. He specifically states that in real life, people die unlike the make-believe world of comic books. This might make someone believe that the director James Mangold is trying to completely sever all ties that the film might have with its comic book roots. But with the way the concept of Eden gets played out here, Mangold makes sure that he pays a tribute to the feeling of hope, wonder and fantasy that comic books can offer to the minds of the readers.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I don't think the film is flawless. There are a number of moments where the film unnecessarily reverts back to some conventional comic-book tropes and simplistic conveniences which somewhat undercut the mature sense of gritty filmmaking that Mangold is trying to attempt to pull off. There is a very cheesy use of mobile phone footage for exposition. The film itself does feel like a revisionist neo-western in the way it balances both the destruction as well as the reassertion of myths. However there are some very explicit and unsubtle western references made here to drive home that link which felt really clumsy and contrived. The film devotes so much effort in underlining how unlike comic books, in real life all the physical conflicts and fights have physical as well as morally triggered emotional consequences. However Mangold betrays some of that very theme by upping the cool quotient in many of the fight scenes with Logan and Laura slicing up and devouring faceless thugs. Even the reveal of the main villain that Logan has to go up against in the eventual fight initially felt a little hokey, but pondering over it later on made me come to somewhat accept it since it serves a metaphorical purpose in the narrative.<br/><br/>So it might seem like there were a lot of things in the film that I didn't like which might make the 8/10 rating seem contradictory. The generous rating is mainly down to the fact that I love the idea of the film and its ambition and what it wanted to achieve, and I believe to a great extent did. It's such a refreshing aberration to see a modern comic book movie that doesn't end with a portal in the sky or a video game like virtual fight. It felt good to see a film about such a beloved comic book character have the guts to be just about that, the characters, instead of spectacle and special effects. The admiration that I have for the film has made me to some extent overlook some of the elements in it which to me are flaws. Big Recommendation."

"JRCmilla","8","3","7","23 August 2017"," 'Logan' draws a triumphant close to lackluster series
","The X-Men have had a turbulent experience acclimating to the big screen. Since the turn of the century, nine movies have been produced as a part of the X-Men series, each providing varying results. Installments such as ""Days of Future Past"" and ""Apocalypse"" have shown and fulfilled the potential of the series, while others such as ""X-Men 3"" and ""The Wolverine"" lay on the opposite end of the spectrum. Due to the uncertainty that comes with each new release, there was a tangible anticipation leading to the release of ""Logan."" Being the final addition to the series, this was the filmmakers' last opportunity to give their fans a movie they can appreciate. And fittingly, their last venture was definitively the best. After 17 years of reprising his role as the Wolverine, Hugh Jackman has capped it off with his best performance yet. A wild and ferocious, yet tender and human beast lies within Logan, and Jackman portrays this with amazing clarity. Physical characteristics of the scenery and characters were obviously essential to the set directors, as every scene was strikingly realistic and every face finely detailed. Personality exuded from each and every character, not only due to talented makeup artists, but to the enormous talent shown by almost every actor who was given screen time. Stephen Merchant gave a particularly chilling performance as Caliban, which was memorable to say the least. Apart from the previous films, ""Logan"" has a much more dramatic, emotionally-driven tone, going against the usual superhero movie archetype. Perhaps what gave the film the final push past its predecessors was the plot itself. In previous installments, it was at times difficult to find any genuine connection to the story, instead being forced to comprehend outlandish relationships between heroes and villains, family members, or others. In this edition, the plot was arguably the best part of the movie, during which one can't help but shed a tear once closure is drawn and the curtains close. Unlike many other long-running sequels, ""Logan"" was able to properly conclude the X-Men series. The story ran smoothly, logically, and at points, unbearably forward. Before its end, the film was able to forgive the X- Men of all their past transgressions, and tied all strings together for a grand finale of the ages. ""Logan"" deserves every bit of the high praise it has received since its release, and has wholly fulfilled and even heightened the reputation of the X-Men series."
"mochteam","6","3","7","10 August 2017"," From a life Long X-Men Fan...
","This movie is bitter sweet. These Hollywood X-men films always feel like they miss the mark and never quite make the characters from the comic book pages what they're supposed to be and mostly jumble up their story lines.<br/><br/>Logan is no exception to that. First I'm just going to get my small rant out the way as to why I didn't enjoy this film as an X-men fan. Some things in the X-men universe/timeline you just can't tamper with. This movie is based around a comic book that doesn't even occur in the same comic universe as the previous Wolverine & even X-Men movies. It's a stand alone comic book series and while Old Man Logan is a great comic book it doesn't tie in with the regular story of Wolverine that all the other X-Men and Wolverine movies are based around. So the continuity is the major flaw of the film and trying to tie the story in to what happened in the past that got them to where they are and it's never really revealed.<br/><br/>The story is that Professor Xavier had a mental melt down that killed the X-men and injured hundreds of people. This is the problem with these films they act as though they forget their own selves or other characters. Professor Xavier would have never been able to kill all the X-men or wound hundreds of anybody because Jean Grey one of the main X-men and his Protégé' is more powerful than him and in many cases is the only one that can calm Xaviers mind. This happened in the movies and it happens endlessly in the comic book in similar circumstances. It's just really hard mistake to ignore because it's a major plot in the X-men especially in the X-Men Apocalypse Movie.<br/><br/>So back to Wolverine. He's old and he's sick and he also has adamantium claws. Universe continuity...wolverine doesn't age and is practically invincible. He's already hundreds of years old before he makes his first appearance in the first Wolverine Movie. 20-30 years to 2029 when this movie takes place wouldn't even make a strand of his hair turn grey in that time frame.<br/><br/>Wolverine is sick and is losing his healing factor. In the comics there is a disease that kills mutants but Wolverine is one of the mutants that can't get sick because of his healing factor it's one of the reasons he's nearly immortal. It's only explained that his adamantium is making him sick but if that were the case his mutant ability would be healing the sickness so he would never know. Just another plot hole in the movie.<br/><br/>The biggest sinker in this movie for me is that Wolverine still has adamantium claws and generally adamantium at all. Considering this is in the future. Magneto would have long since removed all the adamantium from wolverines body leaving him with only his original bone claws and healing ability. That is the story line of the X-men universe that these movies take place in and the kicker for me was in a scene where Charles Xavier jokingly spoke about Wolverine leaving his school a time or too. I didn't laugh at the joke because it didn't make sense in this film. Wolverine left the X-men shortly after Magneto ripped his adamantium from his body. He became depressed and left the X-men because he felt that he would be a burden to them. It's not just a small story but it's a MAJOR turning point in the X-men comic series and when he becomes Bone claws Wolverine.<br/><br/>These are all major points to Wolverines character and Story line in X-men and for whatever reason they bounce back and fourth taking elements from it that clash with the story line in ""Logan"" which is why the movie really takes a lot of ""forgetting"" to enjoy.<br/><br/>The move... If wolverine never pulled out his claws from time to time I honestly would have never knew I was watching an X-men movie. With such a huge universe of characters to choose from that fans of the series would recognize they don't ever pick any. It's the usual save the little girl from the bad guys and take her to a place where she'll be safe movie.<br/><br/>You've seen it a 1,000 times this movie isn't much different but it's not a bad movie it just doesn't feel like it relates much to the X-men or Wolverine at all.<br/><br/>Professor Xavier dies and that's it. The last time he died in the comics it had a catastrophic result. Him just dying seemed uneasy and strange without the mutant world falling apart like it does every other time he died in the comics. I mean you have mutants that literally travel back in time from years beyond 2029 just to save him from death so that's another plot hole in the X-men universe...<br/><br/>The movie just doesn't work because it doesn't fit in with the rest of the movies or even the comic universe those movies are set in. This is a stand alone movie loosely based on the stand alone series ""Old Man Logan"" with a plot of X-23 thrown in.<br/><br/>Looking at the movie from that perspective the movie was decent. Kind of like the last of us if Ellie and Joel had claws and an old Psychic man in a wheel chair with them to tag along.<br/><br/>It was entertaining. Predictable but entertaining. 30% Comic Book 70% Hollywood storyline."

","I must say Logan was quite an entertaining film and that is what I expected from marvel since they are brilliant at making movies. <br/><br/>To start, I'd like to say that if this is Hugh Jackman's last role if the wolverine then marvel is doomed. Hugh has been the perfect actor for the fictional character for over ten years. The role fits him quite well. I'm curious as to who will be his replacement. <br/><br/>However, a new character being a female hero X-23 introduced. I think it was cute to see a little super hero girl but the disturbing part of the movie which i wasn't comfortable with, was how she got engaged with very dirty action scenes in the movie, for instance, holding the head of a villain she killed. She wasn't the only, other mutant kids had done dirty stuff to villains in the movie. <br/><br/>The action and content was good and in all, it was great."

And still in how many X-men character movie experimental story has to come along with the storyline?. In every Wolverine story either he is being experimented or other mutants like no one is going to stop them doing whatever they can. There are many ways to end the story by giving respect to the characters by ending them with peace after all they did for the planet and humankind by facing utmost challenges by sacrificing their life many times.

The fact that the movie was Rated-R, made a huge difference and allowed them to have no restraints in making the movie the way it should've and was made. I definitely recommend this movie, as it wraps up Logan's story in way that makes justice the many years Hugh Jackman played Wolverine."

We left Wolverine around our time (present) and we ""jumped"" to... 2030, without almost anything to explaining us HOW WE GOT THERE, how X-MEN disbanded, how (and WHY) Logan ""loosing his power"" (seriously?...

"Anthony89","10","3","7","8 June 2017"," Best superhero movie since the Dark Knight
","Logan in my opinion is the best superhero movie since the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>The films story begins with Logan as a limo driver and with a very old and fragile professor X, who Logan must provide him with his medication to basically sedate him, as his powers cause people & xmen to be temporarily paralyzed, as he is suffering from a form of dementia.<br/><br/>That is until they come across a little girl who changes everything when her 'guardian' asks for Logans help.<br/><br/>The decision to make this move rated R was a brilliant idea as the action scenes in this movie were not only brutal but wildly entertaining & feel that they should have made this decision a long time ago in all Wolverine movies.<br/><br/>Laura (X23) managed to give a great heartfelt performance even with her minimal dialogue, as her & Logan continue to grow closer & closer throughout the film and she provides some exciting action/fight scenes of her own. If you have ever played the Last of Us game, i couldn't but think of Joel & Ellie whenever Logan & Laura were on screen together.<br/><br/>Logan was a fantastic ending for the Hugh Jackman portrayal of the Wolverine character and will be a hard task for whoever tries to take on the role of the wolverine next, especially after this movie."

","I give this a 9/10...because its just too awesome not to.<br/><br/>First the good: Hugh couldn't be any more gritty and engaging than he was in this film. The film itself was GORGEOUS...just a beautiful display of sheer movie magic. (I warned of spoilers no?) The little she-wolverine is freaking rabid! A REAL wolverine! She couldn't possibly be more ferocious than she is in this movie 100 cheers for her efforts! And whats not to love (and simultaneously hate) about Xavier in this film? As always the classiest and profoundest portray of Prof. X that could be given...as always. But to see him come to his end...is just WRONG ON ALL LEVELS! <br/><br/>The bad: Why on god's green earth did these kids not attack from the get go? They could totally whoop that entire little army...and do so with terrifying success! I don't know why they didn't even give that a go....some of those kids were teens...surely they would have given it a go!?!<br/><br/>Now for the politically bad: Getting a little tired of the progressive need to wipe out straight white males from the ""future"" as seen in so many films and comics these days. The new mutants contain NO WHITE MALES...<br/><br/>..and the little Latina girl was seriously phenomenal; but there's a definite problem when Hollywood keeps dumping on straight white males wherever they can...<br/><br/>The OVERT racist bottom line of the movie; the old-class white male mutants are done (Prof X and Logan; as the rest of the mutants have died)...now it's time to move on to a ""new breed""....which, invariably progresses WITHOUT straight white males. The bad guys? Oh they are white males! What about the good regular farmer family that helps Logan and Prof X? A Black farmer and his family...but that Black Farmer had some mean enemies...guess who? White males. Yup, the entire movie is poised at killing off white males.<br/><br/>This is not new. They've changed many of the straight white males in comics to other races, other genders and other gender-identifications... Whoever these puppet-masters are behind the comics and movies in general...are definitely TRYING HARD to erase the straight white males from entertainment. pretty racist and sleazy if you ask me."
"timdalton007","8","3","7","29 May 2017"," An Instant Classic?
","There is the old saying that tells us that ""all good things must end."" For Hugh Jackman, the actor who has played Marvel's comic book character Wolverine since 2000, now would seem a good time to say goodbye to the character. Thus Logan, released earlier this year, was announced to be his last time in the role. Not only that but the film looked to be quiet different from any of the previous X-Men films or even the solo Wolverine outings. The resulting film is an interesting piece of work to say the least.<br/><br/>A large portion of what makes the film different is its tone from the script through to the performances. If previous films in the franchise had been largely overblown pieces of work more interested in set pieces than in its large cast characters (see last year's X- Men: Apocalypse), this is the film that set out to turn that whole notion on its head. For all of its action sequences, this film is first and foremost a character piece as we follow not only Wolverine but Charles Xavier (played once again by Sir Patrick Stewart) in a somewhat dystopian world not too far removed from our own where mutants are on the brink of extinction. The film then is something of a third act for both their characters and the results are fairly dark and bleak with Jackman wonderfully portraying a man who was apparently immortal now coming to terms with his own mortality while also being given something his life has apparently lacked for many years: a purpose. The flashes of humor, well played by both Jackman and Stewart, stop the film from ever going too far into the darkness though and help keep it on a more level playing field. That being said, it is far and away the darkest film the franchise has yet produced.<br/><br/>It's also a far more bloody and violent film than one might have expected as well. Though the character has featured in eight previous films where Jackman has played the role (not to mention several animated TV series), none of them showed the level of violence that this film has with liberal amounts of blood flying and no attempt to shy away from gore. Having read the Old Man Logic comic that helped inspire the film, this didn't come as too much of a surprise. What did come as a surprise was that the film set aside the decidedly over the top violence of the comic and instead portrayed as being far more realistic than one might have expected. While it is never gruesome, Logan as a film never shies away from blood and the consequences of violence which definitely separates it from the rest of the franchise without a doubt.<br/><br/>Speaking of Old Man Logan, it is perhaps because of that comic that Logan the film bares far more similarities to an entirely different genre of film: the western. It is comparable to something like John Wayne's final film The Shootist which touches on many of the same themes of an old legend coming to terms with his morality and legacy while also passing on the torch to the next generation. The cinematography even evokes the genre in the film's opening and closing acts to a large extent with sweeping vistas of often bleak landscapes. There's also scenes set in a casino, horses, and the modern equivalent of the little guy being squeezed out by the rich cattle baron's men. The film even goes so far as to feature footage from and to pay homage to one of that genre's best known works in the form of the 1953 film Shane. Also, taking a cue perhaps from the aforementioned Old Man Logan, the film is something of a road trip film that gives us a tour of the US in the post-mutant age. The result of these factors coming together is a film that is far different in tone and better made than any of its predecessors. <br/><br/>Yet, one left the cinema without the sense of ""Wow"" that a film like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight left me with. Maybe it's the lack of a thoroughly menacing antagonist (though the combination of both Boyd Holbrook and Richard E. Grant is quite effective) or the fact that, if one stops and thinks about it, the action sequences become repetitive after awhile. For a reason or reasons I can't quite put my finger on, Logan didn't leave me with the same sense of having watched a genre being reshaped in front of me that I was left with at the end of Nolan's seminal film (which this film has often been compared to).<br/><br/>While it is not perhaps the instant classic that some have made it out to be, there is plenty of reasons to see Logan. It is far and away the best X-Men related film we've had to date and one of the strongest comic book films out there at the moment. There's also its performances and its overall look and tone, something which makes it that rare film that defies expectations. Above all else though, it delivers a worthy last act to Hugh Jackman's long career in the role. For those wishing to see how to give a performer a proper exit from an iconic role, this is a prime example of how to do that right."
"cosmo_tiger","8","3","7","22 May 2017"," Not as good as the Dark Knight, but like that movie this one can appeal to more than just the core comic book audience.
","""The world is not the same as it was."" In the future mutants are scarce and Logan (Jackman) is trying to hide from the world while caring for an ailing Professor X (Stewart). When someone finds him and asks for help he does his best to ignore them, but then he sees something that changes everything. Now Logan, Charles, and a girl are trying to find their way to Eden and finally find a peaceful life. This is one of the best comic book movies I have seen. The fact that this is R rated really helped the movie. The brutality and in-tenseness of the violence really helps you get fully invested in the film. My big hit against the Marvel/Avenger movies is that there is never any real drama and they are all cookie cutter and repetitive. The new X-Men series has continued the standard started by the Nolan Batman saga in that it is possible to make a comic book movie when the characters have real depth and emotion and a gripping adult story line. This movie contains all of that and more. You almost forget this is a superhero movie, and that is a good thing. The movie is brutal and very bloody, but again it really adds to the feel and the movie needs to show that Logan has changed. The previous stand alone Wolverine movies have not been good at all, but this one more than makes up for them. This is a movie I highly recommend whether you are a comic book movie fan or not. Overall, not as good as the Dark Knight, but like that movie this one can appeal to more than just the core comic book audience. I give this an A-."
"bbr00ks","5","3","7","13 May 2017"," Not Good
","I am going to go against the prevailing sentiment and judge this movie ""not good"". Performances are mostly strong (not sure I feel that way about Patrick Stewart) but the plot is convoluted and choppy, hard to follow, and the ultimate ending is massively disappointing. It starts well enough with previous characters having fallen on hard times but like the 2013 Wolverine movie it descends into an utterly ridiculous plot which i'm not sure I can even describe here - suffice it to say (SPOILERS) that the last 1/3 is like watching MadMax Beyond Thunderdome with kids living in a treehouse before trying to make it across the border (Canadian) to a rumored Eden. It is hyper violent which would not be a problem except the movie introduces lots of sympathetic characters - kids (lots), families, maternal types, then kills most of them in disturbing ways with little rhyme or reason. We once again get an endless supply of gov't mercenaries as the meaningless bad guys then kill them one by one with lots of killing being done by a banshee-like screaming child. I wanted to turn it off but I was already an hour and 45 minutes in and thought I would finish it - not a good decision."

The emotions are full-bodied and heart-felt. The plot is a stand-alone classic.

","This was an unusual comic book based story in as much as we get to see popular characters grow old, feel useless, and watch the world pass them by, seemingly with no purpose or logic. So when Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) dies, it just feels wrong considering his importance to the Marvel universe. Then, with the passing of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) himself, I didn't know what to think. The scene didn't leave room for any other interpretation, or some logical way for the character to be resurrected for future consideration, unless one were to have a retrospective story.<br/><br/>Leading up to those events though, you had your classic Wolvie battle scenes against a host of formidable Reavers led by a relentless guy named Pierce (Boyd Holbrook). The new kid Laura (Dafne Keen) played her role like she was made for the part, and I have to admit, she creeped me out with her feral look and the way she skulked around the early part of the story. When she first spoke though, her voice had a sharp juxtaposition to her otherwise stoic character, almost sounding as if she were dubbed. I guess I expected a deeper voice for the new mutant.<br/><br/>In accord with the somber mood of the story, I missed seeing Marvel comic creator Stan Lee in a cameo appearance, and the absence of an after credits scene was a downer. But then again, it seemed the movie was about endings and not new beginnings. The X-Men tribute at the finale was creatively done, but I'd rather that the story had left things on a more positive note."
"kortulsgameroom","7","3","7","21 March 2017"," Good disappointment FULL SPOILERS
","FULL SPOILERS<br/><br/>This movie is just a short step from good to great. It is crippled by a disappointing finale for the iconic character.<br/><br/>One of the most attractive qualities of the Wolverine is that he can destroy an army on his own, without any help, because he is the ultimate badass. And while this quality was addressed throughout the X-Men franchise, it is disappointing to see the final fight of his life, literally the final action scene in this movie, to show him as a barely standing piece of meat who can't win without some kids help. <br/><br/>By just literally cutting the scene IN the Eden out of the film and not introducing other mutant kids to the final fight, the movie could have had more meaning, be more like an actual western and paid a fair farewell to the character. <br/><br/>Just imagine how much more impactful the movie would have been if after the scene where X23 takes the wheel and drives to Eden, instead of reuniting with her friend the forest action scene happens from the end of the movie (which is just 8 miles from Eden. Wolverine and X23 fight off everybody without any other mutant kids, focusing on Wolverine kicking butt. Logan dies, she (alone) buries him and then, with the camera blurring, she goes to Eden, that, it turns out, actually exists.The End.<br/><br/>That would have provided a much needed final showdown for the film and the character and fully pay respect to final appearance of Hugh's wolverine. Otherwise, this is a sad disappointment with a good foundation.<br/><br/>PS: Also the villains, who felt promising at the start, were not fully developed and the X-24 was kind of cheesy/ cheap."

This is a lot more profane and violent than the other movies, so don't take your kids to see this one. There's still a great purpose with all the insanity going on. It's a bit too long, but the action scenes are mostly amazing. I thought the Wolverine clone was Sabretooth at first. I feel bad for not recognizing the X-23 kid from the comics. One awesome thing is how this movie actually features real X-Men comics. Yeah, X-23 reads them and Wolverine dismisses them as being fantasy. Well, they're still in fantasy, right? I have to tell you how this movie ends and a bit before that.<br/><br/>Professor X dies and stays dead this time and so does Wolverine. Yes, they actually die and it shows them being buried. I thought I knew there'd be a brief scene where Wolverine is shown to come back right before the credits, but it never happens. Then I thought, oh, they're showing that after the credits. I think every ""X-Men"" movie had a scene after the credits setting up a sequel. This one does not.<br/><br/>Yes, Wolverine actually stays dead. Hugh Jackman has stated this will be the last ""X-Men"" movie he'll be in. The ""X-Men"" series has finally ended after 17 years of giving us such beloved movies. I truly am sad that this great franchise has ended. It's too bad we don't see the other characters in this, but it's still a great movie. Goodbye once and for all, Wolverine and thank you for giving us such great movies for all these years. ***1/2"

","The final movie to feature Hugh Jackman as Logan. After 17 years, Jackman finally sheathes his claws for the final time.<br/><br/>And what a movie it was.<br/><br/>This movie was just great. Logan is old and tired and sick, poisoned by the very Adamantium that laces his skeleton. His healing factor isn't what it used to be, so his own bones are essentially killing him. We find that Mutants are near extinct and the X-men are dead, later revealed to have been killed unintentionally by Charls Xavier and one of his seizures. Logan is just biding his time, waiting for Charles to die and then debating about whether to put an adamantium bullet in his brain and ending it all. When he ends up being tasked with getting a little girl to a place that is a safe-haven for Mutants called ""Eden."" She ends up being revealed to be a result of scientists using Mutant DNA to create their own mutants to use as soldiers, the girl in question, named Laura is revealed to have been created from Logan's genes. Thus effectively making her his daughter.<br/><br/>The emotion in this movie is heavy, as we see Logan dealing with his own mortality and the kind of man he is.<br/><br/>We see Charles Xavier die, murdered by a clone of Logan named X-24, a soulless killing machine that is everything Logan is, minus the heart.<br/><br/>Logan ultimately faces down his clone, protecting Laura and the other kids she was raised alongside in the lab as they try to make their way to the Canadian border, and Logan is mortally wounded, giving Laura enough time to load the adamantium bullet into a gun and taking off part of X-24's head.<br/><br/>Laura's scene with Logan as he lay dying made me choke up. I'm man enough to admit it. When he was telling her goodbye, she called him ""Daddy"". Made me get misty eyed, then Logan passed. Laura's friend helped her bury Logan, and as they walked off, leaving Laura behind, she turned the cross on it's side, making it into an X. Almost as if putting the stamp on the end of the era that Hugh Jackman helped start when the first X-men movie made comic book movies a success.<br/><br/>This movie was great, and it's easily the best thing with the Marvel logo attached to it that I've seen since Spider-man 2. It's everything I could have asked for. It was serious, and it gave Logan a proper send off.<br/><br/>Everyone is talking about who should play Logan next, and frankly, after this movie I believe they should wait a decade or two before even considering it. Because this movie, and Jackman's performance are going to be very hard to top. So don't taint it by trying too soon. <br/><br/>Well worth the price of admission."

","I really didn't know what to expect from this film, as I have been lukewarm in most of the X-Men franchise so far, and not too enthused about the Wolverine-specific films either. But the word around suggested this would be different, and it is.<br/><br/>Yes, its packed full of violent action, with metal claws impaling craniums often, and severed heads keep hitting the floor. In this respect, the way Logan is portrayed is with the brutality that he has in the comics. Here, for the first time (in my opinion) its not watered down. The R rating has made this an adult film.<br/><br/>With all the violence, one might think that it would not be possible for it to elevate itself into a deep thinker's film. That would be wrong. I rank this film nearly as good as Leon (The Professional).<br/><br/>And now to the part(s) of the film that appealed to me the most. I think its unique in the way it handles ageing, and the ignominy that goes with it. Whether its problems with mobility, or a serious disease, its portrayed accurately. Patrick Stewart gave a performance of depth and gravitas. If you're over 50, you might not normally go for this film, but you really should. Its pitch is so well placed - I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the film ends with hope, for the future. Beautiful. Go see it in the cinema."

","Logan is high quality entertainment and is the best movie of the X-Men series. This picture has a vibrant style characterized by a dark creepy atmosphere, expressive lighting, interesting locations and good camera work. The film's plot has original ideas and grips the viewer throughout the film.<br/><br/>The main gripe which the critics had was excessive brutality, but this film is R-rated, and the violence is not vulgar or disturbing like in many films of today. The casting was excellent, all the main actors played very well, especially Hugh Jackman and Dafne Keen.<br/><br/>It is obvious when watching Logan that the director together with the crew watched many classic films and created a film influenced by the best of cinematography.<br/><br/>Many pictures are made purely on a green screen with excessive quantity of SFX which makes these films unrealistic, unimpressive and claustrophobic. In this respect Logan avoids this cinematographic dead end. The film was shot in many fascinating locations and the landscapes were chosen very well. The details were chosen with good taste and attention. The special effects are present, but are reserved and not intrusive like in many other pictures. The film serves as a good example on how to make a superhero picture without sacrificing artistic integrity.<br/><br/>Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2017/03/logan-review/"

"ThomasDrufke","10","3","7","4 March 2017"," The Perfect Send-Off to a Legendary Run as Wolverine
","The main issue with the first two Wolverine films were that they weren't Logan's stories. Stories that just happened to star Hugh Jackman with claws and healing ability. Luckily, James Mangold rights the ship with 'Logan'. Deservingly brutal and heartbreaking, 'Logan' is the perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17-year tenure playing the character.<br/><br/>'Logan' accomplished one of the hardest things the third in a trilogy can do, get better with every outing. But 'Logan' isn't just better than the previous two Wolverine films, it's one of the greatest comic-book films of all time. Ironically, besides a few references and the appearance of an actual X-Men comic, it's far from your usual run of the mill comic-book adventure. 'Logan' sees a man just waiting for his time to come while taking care of the man who once took care of him, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). It's beautiful symmetry that way, as is the appearance of the clone, X- 23/Laura. Laura, equipped with the same healing ability and adamantium clones as Wolverine, makes for a nice counterpart to Logan. And really, all 3 main characters have great chemistry as some of the few mutants left in the world.<br/><br/>Neither Jackman or Stewart has ever been better as their respected mutants. Giving these characters their own mortality is the best thing the script could have done. It's one of the reasons people have given up on most superhero-related films, they tend to be predictable and without consequence. Yes, it's always been fun to watch Wolverine rip through dozens of bad guys without a second glance, but it's about time we see his body struggle as much as his mind has through the years. Losing all the people he has through nine films doesn't exactly put his mind in the best place.<br/><br/>Which is why having Laura be in this film is so integral. Logan needed to see someone with similar abilities, but at a time where she needs guidance and a father-figure. Which again, mirrors Logan's first trip to the X-mansion back in 2000's X-Men. Which brings me to the next brilliant thing about 'Logan'. It's uniqueness make seeing all of the previous X-Men films only recommended viewing. It's connected in a way, but you don't need to see the other films in order to feel the weight of every moment. With that said, knowing everything that this character has gone through certainly enhances the experience. Without spoiling the 3rd act, I don't think there will ever be anything quite like 'Logan'. Perhaps not since the ending of The Dark Knight Trilogy have I felt this kind of emotion.<br/><br/>It's been well documented just how ultra-violent 'Logan' is, but I never felt the violence over took the characters and story. For once, we got a Wolverine story that was actually his own story, and it paid off. I don't need to see any more of Wolverine in the X-Men universe, at least for a long time. I got the violence and emotional payoff that I wanted from this character. Words cannot describe this experience, and only time will tell just how well this film holds up.<br/><br/>+Perfect send-off<br/><br/>+Separated from the universe but honors what came before<br/><br/>+Laura/X-23<br/><br/>+Ultra-violent<br/><br/>+Mortal Wolverine and Professor X<br/><br/>10/10"
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","3","7","3 March 2017"," The Wolverine masterpiece we deserved and needed.
","The third time is the charm where we I can finally say we have a Wolverine movie that is memorable and tonally right for the character. This isn't just the best Wolverine (which is ironic that's not the title) or X-men movie but arguably the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. James Mangold's The Wolverine I thought was close to being great but was held back by the pg-13 rating, weak third act and an awful cgi boss fight. Mangold this time is no longer constrained by a studio's need to feel like past superhero films and makes the movie that is a perfect reflection of the title characters's dark history. If this movie came out just a few months before the 2017 Oscars and wasn't labelled as a comic book film, I think this movie could seriously be in the nomination for Best Picture.<br/><br/>This is probably the bleakest and most realistic movie set in the X-men universe. While both films had an R-rating, Logan is a different animal in tone compared to last year's Deadpool. Logan uses its swearing and violence to elevate the seriousness and drama of the situation rather then for laughs. The bleak future that Mangold shows isn't a post-apocalypse setting like in Days of Future but a slightly heightened version of today's post-2016-election times that just so happens to take place after mutants became infertile. Mangold shows how harsh reality can be especially when it comes to characters that we've known from so many past X-men movies. These aren't the happy endings where the heroes save the day and live happily ever after. This shows what happens when the heroes are no longer who they once were. They learn to face the reality of their own consequences and mortality that every regular person deals with from Logan's decreasing healing factor to Charles Xavier's unstable powers caused by his seizures. <br/><br/>This is by far not only the best performance Hugh Jackman has given his mutant character but arguably one of the best performances of his career. The mature themes of Logan allows Jackman to unleash his full acting skills to show how flawed and damaged the titled character really is. Rage and frustration are not just present in his character but also this sadness and internal (as well as physical) pain that we have not seen before. This is Logan at his lowest and most desperate point in his life. The same can be said with Patrick Stewart as Professor X. Stewart gets to take his character in a direction never seen before. Like Jackman, he gets to show more range in his character as a mentally unstable senior Charles who becomes a more dangerous and unpredictable person then even Wolverine himself. Also a shout out to the new talent introduced like Dafne Keen, Boyd Holdbrook and Stephen Merchant. Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 is a force to be reckoned despite her young age. She shows so much ferocity and wit with just a single stare without needing to say a word which doesn't come until the latter half of the film. As far as the usual predictable villain that comes in these superhero movies, Boyd Holbrook is an improvement. His character Pierce is not a complex mastermind like Heath Ledger's Joker but works very well as this slimy, cruel henchman thanks his charismatic performance. Stephen Merchant surprisingly worked very well as Caliban with some great back and through dialogue with Logan.<br/><br/>The pacing of this movie is slow and probably has the least action of any X-men movie but works because it puts all of that extra time into exploring the characters and the way they evolve throughout the movie. The action, however, when it finally comes is worth it because this is what makes the r-rating the most exciting. When you got a guy with blades coming out of his hands, that's when the violence and gore are expected. It is so relieving to finally see a Wolverine impaling, dismembering and decapitating those that get in his way.<br/><br/>As far as flaws, there are very few. I do wished some characters could have been explored more because they are given so much backstory and there are some X-men products that I feel were forced in.<br/><br/>This is the best conclusion I have seen to any comic book character on film. This does not end with a bang but with a whimper. By the end you will feel like you have reached the end of this long and emotional journey with Logan and it becomes hard to say goodbye. There will be new actors to play Wolverine but I think Hugh Jackman will always be remembered for his portrayal of the character especially with how he brings it full circle in this final chapter."
"virindra","6","9","32","1 March 2017"," Good movie, but very overrated on IMDb.
","As a father of a seven years old girl I like to watch father-daughter movies like Kick-ass, Maggie, Taken, The wrestler. I had to watch this one to. On IMDb people rated it a 9.2 so my expectations were very high.<br/><br/>Acting from Stewart and Jackman was magnificent. In the film there were some surprising elements, but when you think about films that already has been made, they were not original. The story was flat. Film felt like a mixture of Universal soldier / Kick-ass / Terminator Genesys. In my opinion Kick-ass had more power, more feelings to touch the viewers heart.<br/><br/>The little girl kind of let me down in acting being a mute a big part of the movie. It is easy to say the last movie in the line of the x-men movies, is the best. It does not Always has to be. That a movie is new does not mean it is the best. I am still fond of x-men days of future past. But that's my personal favorite."
"Rendanlovell","6","6","19","2 March 2017"," Despite the action Logan is an unimpressive superhero movie.
","'Logan' is the first movie (minus Deadpool) in the X-Men universe to receive an R rating. Unlike 'Deadpool' this film is not a comedy. Far from it actually. This film is a brutal action movie filled with excessive violence resulting in a surfeit of blood, gore, and cursing. Which, surprisingly enough, is what any fan of Wolverine as a character has been waiting for. Finally, we get to witness Hugh Jackman tear people limb from limb in glorious, graphic violence. For this film, the biggest selling point, aside from the R rating, was the fact that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are hanging it up after this film. This film will mark their last performances as their respective characters.<br/><br/>So naturally, people want to see the only Wolverine they know be Wolverine one last time. And, thankfully, this film features an all around superb cast. Every actor in this movie is great with Jackman anchoring the film with his magnetic performance. Patrick Stewart also does a great job despite having fairly limited screen time. Even the young girl (X-23) did a fine job with what was given to her.<br/><br/>But the crowning achievement of the film is the action. This director also directed 'The Wolverine' which was equally strong action wise. The difference between the two films is that 'The Wolverine' feels stifled by its PG-13 rating. 'Logan' does not have this problem. All the action is well handled and horrifically violent. Every time someone gets stabbed blood sprays all over the place in glorious detail.<br/><br/>And it should be shown in glorious detail because the rating is the biggest selling point. Which is why you should see this with a crowd. It's the perfect movie to see with people and reveal in the excessive violence we have all craved. Every time Jackman and his little girl whip out their claws the film gets a burst of life and energy that really resonates with a crowd. So, while I would recommend seeing this with a crowd to experience the impressive action, I can't say that I liked this film.<br/><br/>It's perfectly fine but the biggest problem comes in the form of the script. There are literally three screenwriters penning this movie. Writers who have such hit films as 'Marley & Me', 'Green Lantern', and 'The Wolverine' under their belt. Despite having three people looking at this script for who knows how long, it still feels like a first draft. Why? Because there is basically no story. Where the last Wolverine film was almost incoherent with its bloated story, hardly anything happens in 'Logan'.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes is set up followed by an action scene that all works very well but the next 45-60 minutes is nothing. They go to a place and then leave and then go to a place and leave over and over again. It gets so repetitive and dull to the point of me actually falling asleep. In an R-rated X-Men movie. It's in this hour of time where we are left with so little story that you start to realize that there wasn't really a story to begin with.<br/><br/>It goes something like this: ""Take this girl to this place Wolverine."" ""No. OK, fine I'll do it."" And that's it. After he takes thirty minutes to accept this job he then takes two hours to complete this thin plot and that's the movie. It's nearly an hour of filler in a two and a half hour movie. If the film had this hour of filler cut out we would have had a great, straight up action movie. Instead, we have an uneven, poorly paced, thin story where not much happens.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, this is a perfectly acceptable action film. It has all the blood and gore you could ever want. It really pushes its R rating in the way we all wanted it too. Couple that with great performances and we should have had a great action movie. But, instead, the film is horribly bogged down with poor writing. Three screenwriters is never a good sign and it really shows here. There are endless action scenes followed by even more endless filler scenes. What results from this is overlong, thinly plotted, and an unevenly paced the film."

","Logan sets a new bar for what super hero movies should strive to be. As a movie that has established its characters through other media forms and other marvel related movies, it gives a fresh take on the immortal wolverine showing him as much more of a broken man at the end of his days. It drives home the point that Logan is just a man and has great character development throughout the story for many of the characters that does not leave too many unanswered questions. The camera work in Logan was amazing as it followed every action scene rather than relying on too many jump cuts, and really made the characters the focal point on the screen most the time really focusing on what is really important, the transitions were smooth and nothing jarring as they would switch between scene to scene. Dafne Keen did not have much of any dialog throughout the first part of the movie, but as soon as she was given lines she delivered every part perfectly making the viewer really listen to what she was saying and feeling the impact of the words said, the ending lines that she was recited from ""Shane"" was a perfect endpoint the Logan as a character and really helped push the impact of her as a new prominent force in the MCU. The CGI was minimal at best as they did not rely heavily on it and much of the movie felt very organic and nothing really pulled you out of the experience, It was a very good take on what I would call a ""Modern Western"" as it felt very much like a Clint Eastwood movie. All in all it was a really refreshing superhero movie and movie as a whole with its gritty violence and flowing camera work, I hope to see James Mangold produce many more films as this was the perfect end to the immortal wolverines legacy."

The leads are sick and dying, and the fights throw out flying and weather control in favor of what is basically a series of violent martial arts blade fights. <br/><br/>This is a very dark movie with a high death toll and a consistent bleak sense of place. It is emotionally powerful and surprisingly uncompromising within the movie superhero world, although it's still full of exciting action sequences.<br/><br/>At the same time, I think it's easy to be overly impressed with this movie because it's so different from a typical superhero movie. Some viewers are responding to Logan as though director Mangold has created a movie for the ages. I think that's pushing it a bit. But it is an absolutely terrific movie."
"cassielPrice","9","4","11","15 May 2017"," Honestly it was a great ending for a superhero
","Logan, as we know, is a highly rich character in personality and background knowledge we know about him. Hugh Jackman, he has done his best in this movie I could easily believe his suffering and acting because he is drowned and became one with his role.Actually, the movie and the story had the certain smell of death since the beginning. When I was watching the first minutes of the movie the scenes and the locations also had been chosen wisely they could inform us of the death, of a dramatic ending. I could see regret in Logan's eyes he is like that's enough of heroic life just let me rest in peace I don't want to fight anymore. As a fan, I've never seen him running away from his enemies he just wanted to stay away from any stress for the rest of his life.He was hopeless until Laura came in he could barely see himself in the girl so he sacrificed himself for saving her.It's hard to describe how dramatic how beautiful the scenario was the love between a father and his daughter.This time we saw a different Logan there was no glory and fighting will in him he was calm he knew it is time for him to go.After all Marvel movies have lost a legend I don't know if its possible to bring him back on the scene because Logan is still alive in comics. I can't write more here the movie is so good that you can talk about its positive points for a whole day."

","Someone had a very dark day when they wrote this script. It's beautiful, depressing, and heartbreaking all at once.

","The moment everyone craved as arrived! No longer is there a wait for  the most simultaneously realistic, R-rated and miserable superhero film  of all time: Logan.  Seriously, they wanted a serious Wolverine movie. We got it. Just, as  always, be careful what you wish for.  It's hard to rate this movie low because of the production values,  acting and no-holds-barred R-rating. But, on the flipside, it's hard to  recommend this movie because it's so off-the-beaten-superhero path,  it's set 12 years into the future with about .0005% future proof and  worst of all: it's incredibly depressing.  Sadly, someone online spoiled two main points in  this movie, so I knew what to expect. What I didn't see coming, though,  was how sad this movie was. If you love superhero movies, hope and fun  X-Men unity, look elsewhere. This movie is the equivalent of sitting in  the hospice waiting room with your loved one a couple of doors down the  halland just patiently waiting.  BUT, I suppose everyone demanded it. Everyone wanted the Hard-R  Wolverine movie. So here it is. In all its surprising simplicity.  The supposedly invincible and ageless ""Old-Man"" Logan is feeling he's  finally on his way out, but he reluctantly agrees to one more mission:  take a girl to the Promised Land. Along the way, the two people he  cares the most about are just as hunted as he is.  While I cannot deny this was a well-made film, I doubt I will be  watching this again. I usually don't wish for reboots of series, but I  do now. Here. This was a perfect final X-Men filmof the Fox Age. Give  it up, Fox!  Also, I'm not all about Disney having supreme rule over the Earthor at  least, Earth's (Real) Mightiest Heroesbut, now, hand this franchise  over to capable hands. Reboot it. Call it, The Uncanny X-Men. I don't  care. But, see this as a true end to that long string of foX-Men films.  And remember what it's like to have fun with superhero films. Heck,  even Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, combined,  wasn't 10% as bleak as this.  ***  Final thoughts: Admittedly, I fell asleep twice in this movie. I'm not  going to go as far as to say this movie is boring, but yeah, sometimes  it drags, is too heavy, dark, melancholy and was way too long for such  a simple plot. So, being boringisn't the only flaw."

Meaning it was how it should be when you get a couple people coming at you with sharp metal claws.....MESSY! The action was brilliant. It had its comedy moments but not so much that it makes the film look less serious as this comes across as a serious film. <br/><br/>It just seemed like it was in a much higher league from all the other xmen/wolverine films.

","I think I was the last generation that grew up reading comic books rather than just watching them. As such, it gives me a different perspective than most. That being said, I believe this to be one of the best and most meaningful of the comic book movies made. It's dark, it's gritty, it's real and most importantly, it is NOT just another action movie. The story line brings to a head the struggles portrayed in so many other X-Men movies over the past 17 years and shows the development of characters that we've come to associate with certain actors. That being said, I would definitely not recommend this movie to younger audiences who have no familiarity with the characters or even foul language as this movie is dark but also real to life: People in Tough Situations Curse and Wolverine is Always in a Tough Situation."
"justin-fencsak","8","4","11","15 March 2017"," A fitting end to a 17 year legacy...
","It all began when Hugh Jackman starred in his first major American movie as Wolverine in the 2000 hit X-Men, and it ends with his final movie, Logan. Taking place in 2029 when the whole world is changing, this epic movie features Hugh Jackman as Logan as he tries to take care of an ailing Professor X, played with gusto performance by Patrick Stewart. Along the way (spoiler alert), he meets his long lost daughter, Laura (played by Dafne Keen in her first major movie debut), who shares the same traits as her father but speaks little English. In the end, Professor X dies, then Logan by a clone, leaving behind Laura putting a cross vertically like an X to honor his legacy. Some scenes in this movie might be upsetting for people since it's an R rated movie. There is lots of violence, blood, and some seizure inducing scenes yet there's no sex. Some scenes the movie drags along yet it makes up for it with excellent action scenes. I consider Logan to be the best X-Men movie ever and quite possibly the best super hero movie of the year, even though there are more coming out later."
"saseitz-705-31959","9","4","11","15 March 2017"," Heroes with a Heart
","You don't expect your eyes to start watering in a superhero movie, especially one as swift and violent as ""Logan,"" but that's what happens when you have a director and writers who care as much about craft and drama as they do about fight scenes and chases.<br/><br/>This film concerns people. There's minimal CGI; emotions are raw and real. Explosions are few and far between. The characters have to interact with each other. Some have mayhem on their minds. Some are learning what it is to care about others and to develop a heart under all their adamantium. Forbes magazine rightly compares this film to ""The Dark Knight,"" and their critic sees possible Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. I'm inclined to agree. Now that DC has given quality up for crap, it's good to see Marvel finally smartening up.<br/><br/>Action fans certainly won't be disappointed, but director James Mangold is going for more here. Set in 2029, Wolverine is getting old, and his powers are waning. It's harder to push the bullets out of his chest than it used to be, and healing takes longer. He spends his days taking care of Charles Xavier, now in his 90s, and he's not what he used to be, either. In fact, without medication, he's downright dangerous. They, and an albino mutant named Caliban (Stephen Merchant) are hiding in an abandoned complex in the Mexican desert, just south of El Paso. On most days, Logan makes money by chauffeuring a limousine for wedding parties and prom nights. Wolverine is a superhero brought low. <br/><br/>In this world, mutants have been pretty much eliminated from the human race, but a young mutant (and mute) girl named Laura is one of the exceptions, and she has become a commodity which a large genetics company wants back. They're willing to to dangerous lengths to get her. But she believes she has a destination where she will be safe, and Logan agrees to take her there. The chase is on!<br/><br/>I have to single out young Dafne Keen here. (Did they have to spell her name that way? God, I hate that.) She's the daughter of actor Will Keen, and acting is clearly in her blood. She has to balance her innocence and her unusual childhood with power than can be terrible to behold. Even without speaking, Keen holds her own against Jackman, who gives his best portrayal of Wolverine yet. She's touching and frightening, often at the same time. Keep an eye on her. <br/><br/>""Logan"" is more of a road Western than anything else. A clip from ""Shane"" turns up along the way, and Mangold uses some of John Ford's well known desert locations. In its sense of the ending of an era, ""Logan"" also has echoes of Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven."" Both those films concern the cost of violence, which may be a first for a superhero movie. For once, we actually see the destruction one of those fights leaves behind, and we see what the first responders have to deal with. That alone gives ""Logan"" a deeper dimension. <br/><br/>You'll never see Patrick Stewart better. His scenes with Jackman are pure gold, and their banter is wonderful. The film's ""R"" rating means that the characters can talk and act like adults, and they do. Seeing Logan, of all people, trying to get the old man to take his medicine and to see Xavier acting like a little kid about it, is human and funny. These are two professionals having a good time, and they've let the audience in on it.<br/><br/>Yet, once the action is done, what we have left is humanity and sadness; Laura gives us a touching tribute to Logan with a single gesture that had the audience I was in at the edge of tears. This film does not have the marketing department's fingerprints all over it, and nobody's trying to sell any toys. Both Stewart and Jackman have said this is the last time they'll play their X-Men characters, and we will miss them."

Hugh Jackman has always been my favorite actor to portray a superhero and this movie proved why. He definitely deserves an Oscar for his powerful and brilliant performance.

"DarthVoorhees","9","4","11","12 March 2017"," Ambitious and moving.
","It is hard to say exactly how I felt about 'Logan'. It is a movie that strives for a more visceral reaction than any of the recent Marvel or DC films. It has the benefit of finality. I think in some instances we are more prone to fall to some tricks with this being a part of the film. It features brilliant performances from Jackman and Stewart that take the characters to new places. I'll agree with some, it isn't a fun movie. Wolverine is not cracking wise at all. This is a depressing bleak movie. I admire it for it's ability to go there. It has weight and we fear for our characters. They aren't super humans who can laugh at danger. <br/><br/>I don't know if I'm putting too much on my personal expectations in against the film but I wanted more of the sociological commentary and satire that the X-Men universe delivers when it is at it's best. We get some interesting seeds of it but they aren't sufficiently fleshed out. It is in essence a chase film and it can't really stop for too long to asses it's world, which is a shame. I really like the subplot of Xavier suffering from dementia and the dangerous implications it has. The villain's motivation is delivered briefly and the way mutants have gradually become extinct is actually really clever. I guess I'd like to see an X-Men movie within this sort of bleak framework. <br/><br/>The R rating is deserved but the film is guilty of going for gratuitous R rated material. Logan is hiding out as a limo driver and a drunken Prom Queen flashes him. Isn't that just going for R material because you can?<br/><br/>The strengths are undoubtedly Jackman and Stewart. This is a film for people who appreciate good acting. Jackman is more isolated in his character. He doesn't have the same zest or humor. This is an angry and bitter man. I think this is why the film works and has resonated with people. We needed the other films in the series to get here. In comparison to other comic book films we've never seen a character change this dramatically or have war wounds over the course of a series. Logan does not want to reach out anymore. The only regret I have is that the script is incredibly vague about what illness Logan is suffering from. I think it would have been interesting to get an idea of what exactly is killing him. <br/><br/>Stewart may be the highlight of the film. Xavier was always superhuman and always composed. To have him lose that razor sharp intellect and wit is to make him vulnerable. The theme of Logan is mortality and Xavier's is believable. I honestly believed it and that is saying something given that this character has come back from the dead. There's a scene played perfectly by Stewart where Xavier recollects the fragments of his memory and realizes he has hurt a great many people. It is a real human moment that isn't over-dramatic or philosophical about superheroes. We see the humanity of a fearless character brought low to fear.<br/><br/>'Logan' isn't perfect in my estimation but few films of the comic book genre are. It is an example of the comic book genre done right. It is built on acting and brilliant character writing instead of spectacle. The MCU definitely needs to look at 'Logan'. Sequels can be fun but eventually a character has to be defined even if it means coming to a bitter end."
"tanishanand","9","4","11","12 March 2017"," They don't make films like this anymore.
","I watched Logan earlier today. I loved it. Whether it was the acting of each and every cast member, whether it was the tone, whether it was the script or the pacing or the action sequences or the story or even the well-timed humour, I loved it all. At the same time, Logan was heartbreaking.<br/><br/>It was indeed tragic to see that my favorite characters, my heroes being killed and decimated. It was painful to see X-24 stabbing Professor-X, who had just saying that it had been one of his happiest nights in recent memory. I cried when blood started to ooze out of the mouth of an utterly confused Professor-X, who had absolutely not the faintest of idea of what had just happened. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has proved that he was born for the role of Wolverine. This is his best performance to date. He might, and I hope, win an Oscar. Sir Patrick Stewart was at his best too. Just looking at what had become of him was instantly upsetting.<br/><br/>I salute the entire cast and crew of Logan. Thank you. Logan is more than just a movie. It is the best."

The same happened to Charles. Oh, yes, I love James Macavoy and he play a wonderful young Charles, but... it doesn't have that taste that Patrick Stewart give him.<br/><br/>So, I loved the movie, and loved each thing on it. From the script to cinematography, to acting, to music... to the end. Well done, Mangold. Well, done boy, and to all cast and crew that created this.<br/><br/>And, for clarifying something: what is a daughter/son but a copy of our genes and DNA? even a heart child is not more that the love they feel to a paternal figure.

I waited for this movie for a while and it exceeded my expectations. Yeah, we are all sad that this is the end of all Wolverine movies but it was a great ending nevertheless. I gotta give all my respect to Dafne Keen and her amazing act as X-23(Laura) as she did an outstanding role considering her age. This is by far the best Marvel movie ever did and every fan of X-men should see it. I was touched when Logan dies and seeing Laura bursting in tears for this man that she had known for just a week.

","There was once a time when superhero movies would never be considered as serious movies that anyone over the age of 12 would watch. Ever since X-men released in 2000, this changed. The man who unknowingly steered the ship and converted this shadow X-man into one of the most recognizable movie characters is now retiring.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman completes his 17 years adorning the adamantium claws and leaves with the perfect goodbye. This movie is perfect in many ways and flawed in a few. As a fan of the Mark Millar comic ""Old Man Logan"", I walked into the theatre expecting to see it come to life. But this movie surprised me easily as it was tough to make this story more emotional and yet not soppy.<br/><br/>The story is set in a dystopian future like the comics, but in one of the many flaws still uses technology and transport from 2017. The introduction of Laura Kinney with the talented Daphne Keen playing her is perfect, and it is truly sad that we will not get to see her continue. Despite being completely ready, we are still kept at the edges of our seats. One example for this is the inclusion of X-24 from the comic that we see in the movie as well, but the scene in itself enthralls us.<br/><br/>But no matter what our level of preparedness is, we will not be able to digest the ending. With elements throughout the story telling us of the impending doom for the titular character, the end is heavily influenced by the ""Death of Wolverine"" story-line.<br/><br/>When we walk out of the theatre we realize that the hero we grew up loving is no more and the level of sadness in the climax just heightens our own sorrow. It is surprisingly the best non-ensemble Marvel Movie till date (sorry Civil War)."
"mjpetty7","10","4","11","8 March 2017"," A True Masterpiece
","LOGAN is one of those films that, when it ends, you immediately want to watch it again.<br/><br/>As far as X-Men films go, LOGAN is the most brutal, violent, and bloody (I do not count DEADPOOL as an X-Men film simply because it isn't at all essential to the X- Men/Wolverine films & it really is it's own thing), in a lot of ways it's the Wolverine film that people have always wanted. X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE was a let down to many (it's a good action flick but that's about it), while THE WOLVERINE was received much better (with the exception of the film's final act). LOGAN is truly the Wolverine film that everyone has been looking for and, in many respects, the Wolverine that Logan himself looks for throughout the film.<br/><br/>Directed by James Mangold (3:10 TO YUMA, WALK THE LINE, THE WOLVERINE), LOGAN itself is a Western; technically a Modern Western, but a Western nevertheless. It's not just the western settings (Mexico, North Dakota, Nevada, etc.) that set LOGAN apart as a Western, but also the content of its characters. Logan was a hero, much like the Civil War heroes who come back home to find that they don't belong (I'm looking at you Uncle Ethan...), Logan was formerly one of the X-Men, superheroes that the world counted on and looked up to (depending on the X-Men film that is), as Wolverine. He's a classic example of ""don't meet your heroes"" as he's merely a shell of the man he once was. Sure, this isn't only a characteristic of the Western, but it is one of the common traits of Classic Westerns. The hero who has no place in society, yet fights, and even gives his life, to defend it. This is Logan.<br/><br/>And let's not forget that the basic plot of the film is the group traveling from Mexico to, eventually, Canada to run from a group of Reavers after a young girl and her friends. Sounds very Western to me...<br/><br/>Along with all that, the use of the film SHANE, a Classic Western from 1953, not only serves as a bridge for us to take a closer look into Charles Xavier, and the title character himself, but it also gives a clear picture as to what LOGAN is supposed to be. LOGAN shows Logan, Laura, and Xavier what it's like to have a family, much like SHANE does with it's title character. LOGAN creates a bond between the Western hero and the child he's sworn to protect, another clear characteristic of SHANE. And of course that ending scene, which I won't spoil one way or another.<br/><br/>All this being said, LOGAN is not only very clearly a Modern Western, but also just a phenomenal display of the character of Wolverine in a way that none of the other X-films have been able to fully grasp (although some have come awfully close). When watching LOGAN, I immediately compared it to two of my all-time favorite films that often fight for their place as my fourth favorite on in my Top 10: THE DARK KNIGHT and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY. It's not really the content of these films compared to LOGAN that stuck out to me, but instead the implications that come along with them. LOGAN is Marvel's THE DARK KNIGHT, it's the one big and important film that separates it from anything else the company has done before or will ever do again. LOGAN will become a standard for all X-Men, Wolverine, Marvel, superhero, and comic book movies out there, much like THE DARK KNIGHT is for DC, Batman, and the superhero/comic book genre now. Similarly, TERMINATOR 2 changed action and sci-fi films forever. In fact, outside of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, I can't name a single action film that has had the impact on the genre and film industry as a whole in the same way TERMINATOR 2 has, until now. <br/><br/>If LOGAN is Marvel's THE DARK KNIGHT, then it is also certainly the comic book genres TERMINATOR 2. Like the title of this review says, LOGAN is a masterpiece."
"jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","7","4","11","8 March 2017"," The Best stand-alone Wolverine Entry
","Hugh Jackman has played Wolverine for nearly 20 years now. He has promised that it's his last, and before hanging up the claws it's very evident he wants to go out on a high note. He has mastered the role by now and does it true justice in this third and best entry in the Wolverine franchise. <br/><br/>Everything seemed perfect by the end of Days of Future Past, the time-line corrected its self and resurrected all of the fan favourites from the first three movies that proceeded the events. Fast forward six years after the that film, it's now 2029. He is nearly 200 years old, he's a shadow of his former self, he's struggling to heal, drinks and curses a lot. He makes a living as a chauffeur to pay for his booze and medicine to prevent Xavier's frequent deadly seizures. He is hiding away in a desert outpost near the Mexican border, joined by mutant Caliban who is referred to as an albino by one character. They both look after Charles who is battling dementia. Without spoiling anything else, I'm going to stop blabbing on.<br/><br/>Logan isn't your typical superhero movie, inspired by the Mark Miller/Steve McNiven comic, it takes the sometimes formulaic and tiresome genre in many new directions. Tonally it feels like a western more than anything else with hints of horror and sci-fi elements. This is director James Mangold's second attempt at the hero and he is clearly given more creative reign of the movie than the 2013 outing of the famous character (which wasn't too bad, certainly better than the 2009 film). Oddly though, Wolverine works as a future-set western and the director isn't shy of making a good western (Copland and 3:10 to Yuma being fine examples) he delivers in spades with this. There's no spandex to be seen here, no build up to other films, no outlandish super-villains and no macguffins in the form of a stones. Instead it's a striped back, gritty character piece, that takes its time with its premise and doesn't throw everything in your face at once. <br/><br/>It doesn't hold back on the violence and when it's brutal, it really is brutal, no cartoonish nonsense. There's More blood, guts and bad language in this than the entire X-Men franchise combined. It doesn't feel like it was spliced together in the editing room, like many movies such as The Expendables 2 and Die Hard 4. It's very obvious that it was shot as a 15 rated film. It feels natural and fits the story well, the film just wouldn't work with a 12 rated certificate. <br/><br/>This film could have been very different if not for last year's Deadpool which arguably raised the bar for comic book movies aimed at adults. That movie proved producers wrong bringing in over 800 million at the worldwide box office. This film will probably make more as audiences are getting a craving for violent action movies. <br/><br/>Cinematographer John Mathieson (Gladiator, X-Men First Class) gives the film that unique look. Shot in anamorphic, it really does give the film that western look the director was going for. Each shot looks like the graphic novel coming to life with establishing shots, shots of Logan drinking in a rain drenched graveyard etc. The action sequences are filmed very well with no shaky cam nonsense or quick cuts. Composer Marco Beltrami also deserves recognition here too with his brooding, atmospheric score. His third collaboration with Mangold, this one is easily his best as it isn't your typical fantastical comic book movie score. It's very noticeable that everyone is on their A-game here to make this the best possible movie they can.<br/><br/>However there is some nitpicks, only minor. For instance Boyd Holbrook's cyborg arm villain isn't given much to do other than deliver monologues and give orders to his team. The last act does raise a lot of questions which make you scratch your your head, However it is a fitting finale for the claw wielding character and a lot better than the dreaded Silver Samurai ending in the last Wolverine film.<br/><br/>Verdict It certainly wouldn't be surprising if Hugh and co. get some awards recognition next year, especially Patrick Stewart who gives an emotional final performance as Xavier. By far the best stand-alone Wolverine movie and easily one of the best comic book movies in recent memory."
"allisonarf","6","4","11","5 March 2017"," The nihilism of Logan undoes the hope of Days of Future Past (spoilers)
","Basically, this movie undoes all the goodwill from the film Days of Future Past. In DOFP, the X-Men successfully prevented the Sentinnels from coming into existence and saved mutant kind. The time line was altered and all the X-Men who died in The Last Stand were brought back to life and had a happy ending. The film Logan undoes all that with it's need to be relentlessly depressing and dystopic. We learn that Logan and Prof. X are on the decline and aging badly. The X-Men have been eradicated, as has mutant kind. So all the work the X-Men did in DOFP was for NOTHING. The film is full of bad language and very gory violence. There is no humor or fun in this movie at all. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are to be commended for their strong performances and building a wonderful father/son relationship in the film, but the villains are so bland and boring and forgettable. I can't even remember their names! I kind hope Cable from the Dead Pool movies comes along and time travels and restores the X-Men to greatness again.

It has ramp-ed up the violence to the max and the end is quite good but too many problems mar this movie to make it a hit: - the setting never quite clicks: 12 years in the future they have the same phones and the same TVs? Mutantkind was eradicated? Not a big deal but it never seems right - the movie is a road movie? An action movie? A mix of the both with a lot of dead times and fairly filler moments - What it is not is a super hero movie. It has some of its tropes but lacks the overall sense of wonderment a superhero flick needs - The bad guys and main threat are really **meh** So yeah Hugh Jackman is OK, Patrick Stewart is OK, seeing a Wolverine unleashed on the screen has its moments but overall somewhat disappointed."

","No punches pulled in this one. All the fat is trimmed from the regular, ensemble X-men, end of the world plots that bogged down previous entries in the franchise. The action is realistic and the characters behave like real people instead of just vehicles for superpowers. The choice to focus on just two of the previous mutants, Logan and Charles, catalyzes the chemistry between them. Above all it celebrates what makes these movies entertaining: they aren't blessed with powers, they're cursed with mutations."

","Barely even a superhero film, Logan elevates the genre to new heights by stripping down the character to its essentials and presents them in a powerful and emotionally moving tale about a worn-out man who has to find the hero who existed within him before.<br/><br/>Logan has incredible direction. The standout is the R-rated action. All the gore and blood is utilized to visceral effect as the audience is carried from scene to scene following the characters. The western style and overtone of nihilism is perfectly captured by the barrenness and roughness of the production design. The score is a mix of melodies and orchestra capturing the essence of the moments and themes of the film.<br/><br/>Character interactions are at the center of the film. The development of the characters are presented through subtle and emotionally resonant dialogue. The minimal dialogue draws the audience to the incredible and moving performances of the cast. Hugh Jackman fully embodies the worn-out hero who lives just to survive and has lost his sense of heroism or purpose of living. His performance draws us into his broken down world where little hope exists. Patrick Stewart, as Professor X, plays the opposite character with lively optimism and enduring hope. Laura, played by Dafne Keen, is the symbol of hope in the film and the vehicle through which Logan changes as a character. Boyd Holbrook, as Donald Pierce, plays the unrelenting villain who chases the protagonists and drives the plot of the film.<br/><br/>Logan is not without its message. The film is a critique of unethical human experimentation and it hammers the point that it is more evil when done for the purposes of profit and power. X-Men related characters were created to highlight minority issues and the film is the best adaption of that purpose. It is also about the majority-minority power struggle and how each side acts and reacts against the other.<br/><br/>Superhero films as an artform are rare, Logan is one of them.<br/><br/>10/10"

In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb.

","This was the perfect sendoff for Hugh Jackman's most popular character ""James 'Logan' Howlett"" aka 'The Wolverine'. Many might say that there are plot holes with the film that things could have gone different but we as fans must understand the character enough to realize that this is how he was meant to go out as a hero. Not in a happy ""im retiring"" type of sendoff. This film needed the grittiness and dark violent tone because thats just reality for you. Because as depressing Hugh Jackman's character was in this film it was as realistic as James Mangold intended. This is the ninth film starring Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, forget all the plot holes and continuity errors with the timeline. Logan has persevered through everything from all the wars in the 1800-1900's to watching innocent people die, watching Jean(the love of his life) die, watching the professor die twice in two different timelines, the list goes on and yet he can't do anything about it, no matter who he gets vengeance from it'll be pointless in the end because he lost something deep and meaningful. His story arc has come along away, its perfect, he is allowed to be depressed.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes from the film that has a very deep meaning is when he is talking to X-23 and he is asked what the bullet is and he replies that it is made of the same metal that was used to code both of their endoskeletons, followed by that he says he was going to shoot himself with it, because he knows that he has no intention in living his life any longer because he'll just keep watching innocents and loved ones die.<br/><br/>He made the perfect sacrifice and experienced what he had been missing his entire life, and thats the meaning of life itself."

","Review: I loved this movie because it finally showed that even a mutant like wolverine can still kind of live the life of a human being. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. But, the clincher is that this was only the second superhero to have the privilege to be given an R rating making it much more viable to a broader audience and making it the right amount of violent to wrap up a violent superhero. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."

"byrann_gowan","9","2","4","27 August 2018"," Here's to you, Wolverine
","It's 2029. The mutant population is pretty much gone, with only Wolverine (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman), Professor Charles Xavier (played by Golden Globe Nominee Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (played by Emmy winner Stephen Merchant) left. Logan, aka the Wolverine, has aged quite a bit, is an alcoholic and even his healing powers are dwindling. The three live out the rest of their days in an old steel mill in El Paso, Texas. However, once a little girl (played by Dafne Keen) comes into play, the Wolverine is brought back into action. It turns out that this little girl has powers just like the Wolverine and she is being chased throughout the desert by dark forces - the dark forces that made her from Wolverine's DNA. With all this going on, the Wolverine must decide: should he live out the rest of his days in peace or is it finally time for one last fight?<br/><br/>I can't stress enough what a near-perfect movie this is. As a matter of fact, the only X-Men movie that surpasses this one is Deadpool 2. Make no mistake, though; this is a Wolverine film, through and through. While it is a superhero film, it is not a superhero film for the faint-hearted. That R rating is well deserved here and it is the only way to tell the final chapter in the Wolverine story. We finally see Wolverine's berserker rage in all its rated R glory and it truly is glorious! The writing in this film is also spectacular, even getting an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay (which it should have won for sure). James Mangold ups the ante from the previous Wolverine film ""The Wolverine,"" proving that he truly was the best director to bring the hardened Canadian hero to life.<br/><br/>But let's talk about our three starring performances. First of all, this is not just Hugh Jackman's final outing in an X-Men film. Patrick Stewart is also back as an ailing Professor X whose tragic past continuously haunts him. He is originally seen as a mumbling fool by Wolverine when he continuously says that he is waiting for someone (turns out he is right). It is kind of sad to see the Professor like this, but Patrick Stewart also gives his best performance in the series. He is more compelling than he ever was in the X-Men franchise; while he was a crowd favorite, this is his best performance by far. Also along for the ride is Dafne Keen, a newcomer who plays Laura, the little girl who Wolverine protects. Has she really only started acting last year? While she may be just a kid, she acted like she had been in the game for more than 20 years. I hope she gets more roles as she gets older; she is a sight to behold as Wolverine's daughter. She even shares a similar story to Wolverine: someone who has had it rough, who has been unfortunately turned into a monster, and who now needs the guidance that Professor X gave Logan. Only this time, it's Logan who has to guide her. She is just absolutely astonishing in this role; she nailed it.<br/><br/>But of course, who are we all here for? We are all here for the man himself, the Wolverine. Not only does Patrick Stewart give his best performance as Professor X, but Hugh Jackman gives his best performance as Wolverine. This is his last X-Men film, so he lays it all out there. He puts all of his cards on the table. He goes out with an unimaginable bang. Each X-Men film that stars Wolverine starts out with him having lost his hope, but this is different. Here we truly see a broken man who, until Laura comes in, seriously has nothing left to fight for. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine will go down as one of the greatest film heroes the world has ever seen and one of the greatest super hero portrayals ever. He is Wolverine. No one will ever even come close.<br/><br/>Here's to you, Wolverine. Don't be what they made you."

","I finally watched the latest Wolverine movie, Logan. It was the darkest, most depressing comic book movie I have ever seen. The vision of the human race portrayed is so dark as to be hard for me to contemplate. I am surprised at the high ratings so many people gave it. Logan is a foul mouthed, depressed drunken grump who doesn't want to help anyone anymore in a world that has killed almost all of the mutant heroes of earlier movies. Patrick Stewart (Professor Xavier) is also drugged into a stupor to prevent him from having seizures (due to some unexplained brain ailment), which, due to his powers, threaten everyone around him. Virtually everyone Logan befriends in the movie except one young girl is assassinated by some evil corporation or branch of the government (it is not clear to me which) In the very end, some young mutants do escape from Horrible America to Canada. Everyone else dies. I don't think I'll be watching that little patch of pitch black again. Whatever happened to Heroes and Optimism in Hollywood? I notice Stan Lee did not appear in this movie.

"JaysonRidik","10","2","4","14 May 2018"," Best Comic Book Film Ever
","Hugh Jackman has portrayed Wolverine since 2000 and hasn't impressed me once. I never understood why Wolverine was so popular and I think that's because he has always been in PG-13 films. Not that blood, gore and swearing make a character better, but when your powers involve constant pain and close up murder, it helps to be more mature about it. I finally get Wolverine because 'Logan' finally gets him. Hugh Jackman goes from a cocky and confident superhero to the depressed, suicidal psychopath that Wolverine has always been but the films have never taken advantage of. In this film, Wolverine stabs and slashes his way through bad guys in brutally painful detail between his constant drinking and swearing. His performance is extremely emotional and cuts deep. The story is consistently exciting and always developing. The action is well done and has a feeling of epicness, even when it's gory. X-23 AKA Laura is a standout as the little girl equivalent of wolverine, offering emotion and genuinely impressive beats of both action and comic reflief (although the comedy is kept to a bare minimum in order to maintain the intensity). There are three villains in this film, one is forgettable, one is entertaining as hell to watch and well written, and the third is absolutely perfect in terms of threat and execution along with being poetic and unbelievably cool. Without spoilers, the third act explodes in action and drama, to a level rarely seen in superhero films. 
 This is the best comic book movie I've seen and one of the best blockbusters ever made. This is far from a regular marvel children's film. This is a dark and mature masterpiece with amazing dialogue, direction and performances. 10/10"

","The new era of comicbook films has begun. After huge success of Deadpool, Fox agreed to make Logan R category. And thank Thor for that. Logan is such a fresh touch for actually any blockbuster. Even though the story is still somewhat predictable, there are a lot of small details which changes the film completely. I loved old and sick Charles Xavier the most. No one actually had done something similar before. James Mangold outdone himself, especially after such failure as Wolverine (terrible plot + plot holes + no logic + no comic correctness). Even though Logan kind of gave him a louder mic to share his (not so cool) opinions, the film itself got very high in my top films of all time, not only in superhero category. So I am really proud of this nomination. Maybe the Academy will finally take other kinds of films under consideration.<br/><br/>Logan is telling a story about a family. That it doesn't have to be conventional, that caring of people important to you can be done in so many different way. Meanwihile it is a story of getting old and sick, about sacrifice and moving on.

Professor X has dementia which combined with his psychic powers makes him a danger to every one around it. Wolverine's healing powers are fading too but he keeps looking after his mentor. A flicker of hope comes in the form of the next generation, the new mutants if you will. Jackman delivers his best acting performance so far, full of raw emotion, pain and sorrow. The action scenes are exciting and harrowing and the direction overall has a relentless gravitas. The crushing inevitability of aging and death couldn't be more clearly illustrated than in Wolverine's bloody battles with a younger, stronger, faster clone of himself. This is easily Marigold's strongest Wolverine script - truly worth of it's Oscar nom. Easily one of the best films of 2017 and comic movies ever."

It mixes the Comic Book Action and Character development perfectly.

(R)<br/><br/>Jackman's presumed swan song as Marvel mutant Wolverine takes place in a deteriorating near-future, the X-Men disbanded and mostly deceased, where the aging and slowly dying anti-hero has all but given up on life while caring for ailing Professor X (Stewart). Then a mysterious girl (Keen) enters his life, along with some dastardly pursuers led by shady scientist Grant and sinister merc Holbrook, and ol' Wolfie grudgingly rediscovers a purpose. The ""Shane"" echoes are laid on thick, the road movie clichÃ©s are plentiful, and the rote build-up to the climax spoils what should have been a superbly cathartic blow-out, yet there's no denying that after three attempts to give the character his own showcase, they finally got it right. Self-doubting and weary, Jackman plumbs even greater poignant depths to a character he's played numerous times before, while Stewart manages to evoke great melancholy without committing to resignation. Visceral, flesh-ripping violence may turn off the squeamish, especially when it's aimed at young Keen, but she gives as good as she gets, and it ought to satisfy all other parties to finally get to see the blood-soaked reality of Wolverine's berserker rage, cautiously neutered in earlier outings.

","""Logan"" turns out to be quite the interesting and satisfying closer on the saga of the Wolverine character. Wolverine, a.k.a. Logan (Hugh Jackman, giving a powerful performance), is now a very weary old mutant in the future year of 2029. Mutants are now all but extinct, yet he soldiers on, basically so he can care for the ailing Professor Xavier (a wonderful Patrick Stewart), who's suffering from Alzheimer's. Into Logan's life comes a mute little girl (debuting Dafne Keen) who's on the run from some very bad guys, including a smiling henchman (Boyd Holbrook) and a maniacal mad scientist (Richard E. Grant). He has just days to transport her to safety (with Professor X in tow), to a supposed ""Eden"".<br/><br/>Although not necessarily a big fan of comic book adaptations and superhero movies, this viewer was drawn to ""Logan"" due to what amounts to a very mature - and sombre - nature. This is a film that definitely earns its R rating (so parents be warned), with plenty of F-bombs and lots of hard-edged (albeit digitally rendered) violence. At its core is the struggle of its haunted main character to deal with this bleak existence, and what he believes to be the ultimate solution. Jackman is utterly compelling as Logan, making the most of the material as well as embracing the physicality of his role. Stewart provides additional heart and resonance; he and Jackman give emotional weight to the proceedings to add to the expected visceral thrills. Young Keen does a good job as the childish mutant (revealing her abilities in an explosive manner), remaining mute until well into the story. Holbrook and Grant are superb as unsubtle villains whom the audience will enjoy booing. Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse are appealing as a rural family whose fate is sealed when they make the acquaintance of Logan and company.<br/><br/>James Mangold does a solid job with the direction, also authoring the story and co-writing the screenplay. One of his most interesting touches is to heavily reference the legendary Western ""Shane"".<br/><br/>Although a very long film at two hours and 18 minutes, Mangold wastes no time, making every second count and contrasting the colourful life of the X-Men in the comics with the cold, hard reality facing our characters in this tale.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

The young girl in it is very good as well. This film benefits from its R rating. The action is great and the story is too. This film is heartbreaking, yet has moments that feel very happy.

","The best Wolverine movie, hands down. There's honestly not a single aspect of this movie that I didn't like. All the acting was amazing. The story line was great. My favorite thing was the screenplay. Every single line was amazing. Its one of the movies where every time I go back and watch it, I notice something I didn't before. For instance, when they are staying in the family's home, and Logan is talking to Charles who is laying in bed, Charles says ""this is what life looks like. A home, people who love each other. A safe place. You should take a moment and FEEL it"" I love this line because as we all know, Logan's last words are ""so this is what it feels like."" And after I first watched this, I assumed he was talking about dying. But as he was dying, he was holding his own daughters hand. He loved his daughter, and she loved him. They loved each other. Which is what Charles described as ""life."" So, maybe, when Logan said ""so this is what it feels like,"" he WAS talking about dying. But it could also be seen as him talking about life. It's just sad he didn't get to feel what living was like until he died.<br/><br/>Anyways, this really was an amazing Wolverine film. The R-rating definitely contributed to this a lot. We finally got Wolverine going all out, killing people left and right during that last fight scene. The villain was amazing. A lot of characters died during this movie, and the movie made sure everyone's death scene did them justice. I like how when Charles died, he said, ""the Sunseeker"" and when Caliban died, he said ""beware of the light"" before pulling the clips in the grenade, and killing some people in the van, as well as himself. The movie was just so amazing, I will never get sick of it"
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","0","0","8 March 2019"," A fitting end to an OK spinoff series.
","I'm not sure I know what to think about this movie. I mean, I wanted to like it inasmuch as I like a lot of the action-filled superhero movies that preceded it. However, the plot felt like it had less to do with these fantastic mutant abilities and more about just living life as normal people. Don't get me wrong: there are plenty of mutant abilities on display in this film, it's just that they weren't necessarily the focus of it. In fact, if you took away the fact that this was based on comic book characters, you'd still have a film about a father trying to care for a daughter he never knew he had. Almost sounds cliche to me.<br/><br/>Regarding the Wolverine spinoff series, Logan (2017), is a strong finish after the abysmal Wolverine: Origins (2009) and slightly improved The Wolverine (2013). I did appreciate the finality of it, especially considering the whole X-Men film series started seventeen years ago. Unfortunately, unlike Deadpool (2016), which thrives on the entertainment value of its title character, Logan left me confused with just how much abuse this character could take, especially since his regenerative powers weren't what they used to be.<br/><br/>I know many people were thrilled that this film was able to have an ""R"" rating, but I honestly don't see what's so special about it. I mean, we have had V for Vendetta (2005) and Watchmen (2009) before it, and even the aforementioned Deadpool fully used its ""R"" rating. Sure, it was fun to finally see the eponymous Logan essentially use his knives-for-hands to eviscerate the enemy in its bloody and gory glory, but I think my imagination could do that in the earlier, PG-13 versions without much of a jump. And it's not like Logan wasn't allowed to use strong language in previous films, it's just that he was able to use a lot more of it in this one.<br/><br/>A fitting end to an OK spinoff series, I give Logan 3.5 stars out of 5."

"BlueFox94","7","0","0","24 August 2018"," Mutant Sendoffs in Logan
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)<br/><br/>Many have credited 2000's X-Men for spearheading the second generation of comic book cinema that has largely taken over the entertainment industry today. Moviegoers acquainted themselves with other comic book properties arriving on the big screen while also making successful the eight succeeding X-Men installments. Then, when stars Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart declared that this year's Logan (inspired by the 2008 graphic novel Old Man Logan) would be the last time they each would portray the popular Marvel X-Men mutants Wolverine and Charles Xavier respectively, the hype for the film increased ten-fold - something 20th Century Fox likely appreciated, since 2016's Deadpool hogged all the success and X-Men: Apocalypse fell short of expectations. The result? Well, when the film begins with an F-word, ends with a somewhat sacrilegious final shot, and comes short in building up to a satisfying farewell for two popular actors playing two popular fictional characters, I am left wondering whether it was the Jackman-Stewart mutant swan song writer-director James Mangold and company had hoped to deliver.<br/><br/>The year is 2029 and the lack of new mutants born in the past 25 years have made mutants endangered. James ""Logan"" Howlett (Hugh Jackman, in his ninth and last appearance as the character), formerly known as Wolverine, goes about minding his quiet job as a limousine chauffeur around the southern U.S. border. Logan lives with tracking mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in a decrepit smelting plant just past the border in Mexico. There, he and Caliban care for a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, also playing the character one last time), formerly known as Professor X, whose mental instability leads to seizures that wreak devastation - a scenario Logan helps prevent by hustling for prescription drugs.<br/><br/>One day, Logan happens upon Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse from a powerful biotechnological corporation, who begs Logan to chaperone an eleven-year-old girl named Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen). Laura, known as ""X-23"", was one of a group of mutant children bred by the corporation as weapons, then deemed disposable once X-24 became the successful clone. Gabriela took Laura and helped free the other children before the corporation could terminate them. Now she begs Logan - who is actually Laura's biological father - to see that Laura makes it to ""Eden"", a mutant sanctuary in North Dakota, without falling into the clutches of Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), the corporation's enhanced security chief, who tried coaxing Logan into bringing him Laura. When Gabriela is suddenly found dead, Logan hastily takes Charles and Laura with him, fighting their way through Pierce's widespread detail and embarking on a long road trip north, while Pierce and his crew force the unlucky Caliban to track them. From there, it becomes a matter of whether Logan, Charles, and Laura can race to safety in time and with their lives, if that safety for mutants even exists at all.<br/><br/>Logan is a formidable superhero drama, easily one of the best of the X-Men franchise and even the superhero subgenre in general. Jackman and Stewart have spent the past seventeen years perfecting their iterations of the iconic Marvel mutants. Many have identified their faces with the characters to the extent that many wonder if any other actor could replace them. That Logan showcases both Jackman and Stewart's final appearances as their respective mutants makes it worthwhile. Also worthwhile is Dafne Keen in her feature-film debut as Laura/X-23. Ms. Keen demonstrates a strong physical and facial commitment, despite acting mute for much of the runtime, to her budding mutant character who can barely resist lashing out like a diminutive killing machine.
However, much of my appreciation for writer-director James Mangold's finished product starts to recede from there. Hugh Jackman reportedly took a cut in pay to ensure the film's R-rating, and while the generous addition of blood certainly matches up to that rating, the laced profanity throughout feels unnatural and forced at times. Meanwhile, the villains are rather unengaging and forgettable, from the leaders (Boyd Holbrook and later Richard E. Grant as Dr. Zander Rice of the same biotechnological corporation) coming off as typical villain stereotypes to their underlings functioning as mere bullet-and-blade targets for both Logan and the surprisingly vicious Laura.<br/><br/>The weakness of the villains hints at what really keeps Logan from being ""the next Dark Knight,"" as many fans and even professional critics have already declared. Jackman and Stewart's franchise swan-song performances are commendable, but they do not reach the heights of Heath Ledger's Joker back in 2008. A key disconnect lies between the inner, age-related regrets of Logan and Charles and all the typical X-Men chaos taking place outside of those regrets. The villains have little regard for such turmoil; they just want the mutants caged and studied, like in most other X-Men franchise installments. A bolder narrative would have both heroes and villains reflecting on approaching possibly the post-mutant era of humanity. Instead, this story amounts to a bleak road trip in which our heroes escort a special passenger to a safe place and protect that passenger from the formidable, organized antagonists, with gratuitous amounts of blood and severed limbs incorporated to satisfy its R-rating. <br/><br/>In a sense, then, I cannot help but feel disappointed in the overall product. Last year's X-Men Apocalypse failed to excite overall, but at least there the fun, the engaging, and the clumsy never mingled and fused together into a bland stew. Logan banked on the emotional sendoff for its lead actors and while it mostly succeeds in that regard, most other elements seemed to run parallel with that intention, thus coming off as solid but unspectacular action storytelling. Yes, the action sequences have a worthwhile, if immensely bloody and profane (and certainly not family friendly), punch to them, but for the overall product as a teary-eyed farewell, Logan should have been more. Instead of drying my eyes as I waved goodbye, I found myself shrugging and remarking, ""Well, it was fun while it lasted,"" before rejoining 2017 in cinema as it inched forward, anticipating that annual push of the summer blockbuster season.<br/><br/>R.N.B."

","Eighteen years ago, Hugh Jackman met a lonely runaway called Rogue and helped her to ultimately find her place (and his) in the mutant population with the help of Professor X.
Nine years ago he was part of Team X in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, ultimately leading to Weapon XI; Wade Wilson with multiple stolen mutant powers.
Now comes Logan, in which the infamous titular character has become a reclusive limo driver, seemingly spending most of his life caring for an ailing Professor X, when he's approached by a woman who seems to know who he is, and wants him to help her and the girl she's with to get to a safe location.
Unsurprisingly, given the franchise, this ultimately leads to a high body count. What's surprising is, Logan isn't the main cause.
The film does watch like a swan song. Jackman and Stewart have been holding this franchise together for so long they practically are father and son, though given the Wolverines healing abilities you forget who's the older. They are both great actors, able to portray a wide range of emotions as they decline in their twilight years. 
Annoyingly, they're joined on this part of the tale by Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who may have made his name comedically alongside Ricky Gervais, but seems lacking in the gravitas required playing opposite the wracked Jackman and in the situation they are supposedly in.
By contrast, Laura (Dafne Keen) plays the role of brooding misfit with a secret extremely well. Silent for most of the film, she still manages to convey huge amounts of emotion.
The script is probably the weakest part of the film. Going from the previous films, there does seem to be a lack of detail about how they got where they are and the cast aren't very forthcoming about what has gone on. But really the main reason for watching the film are the fight scenes, which may lack the finesse of the previous Wolverine films, but in an era of Disney superheroes, the Wolverine is an adult character that doesn't take prisoners."

It does not explain how or why. It does not give any depth to what has happened to mutant-kind - it kind of just lets you hang and decide to accept this huge void in the story arc. It felt cheap.<br/><br/>The young girl just plays mini-Wolverine - the same feral growls, the same random killing, the same stare, etc.<br/><br/>The only positive aspect is that Patrick Stewart adds some life to the film and has the only good lines.<br/><br/>The film was long, boring, a script full of holes, the same repackaged Wolverine story line, with a touch of foulness.

","Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are my favorite actors. Hugh Jackman cemented his role as Logan(a.k.a. Wolverine of the X-Men) whereas Patrick Stewart immortalized himself as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. As I am writing this review, Patrick Stewart is 76 years old. I don't think he will act in a film ever again. This film marks the departure for Hugh Jackman as Logan. <br/><br/>Back to the film. First of all, I should say that this film is violent. Perhaps one of the most violent X-Men movies I have seen. Also those of you expecting over the top C.G.I. effects will be disappointed. The effects are kept to a minimum to keep the film going. More emphasis is played on the relationship between professor X. Xavier and Logan. The professor has become old and has to be medicated because he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Logan has stayed behind to look after him. <br/><br/>Caliban an albino mutant who has the ability to track other mutants has also stayed behind to help both Xavier and Logan. He offers Logan a lot of good advice, however Logan snubs him in his usual gruff manner. <br/><br/>The film starts in the year 2029. mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine, spends his days working as a chauffeur in Texas. His healing factor has faltered and, as a result, his body has aged greatly. <br/><br/>One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela Lopez, a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called ""Eden"". After reluctantly accepting the job from Gabriela, Logan discovers that she has been murdered. Watch the film to find out what happens next...<br/><br/>Verdict: Superb and mature acting by Hugh Jackman. He gives his best performance in what should be his last X-men film. During the screening of the film he and Stewart held hands and wept. This is no doubt due to the long relationship they had during the filming of the X-Men series of films. The cinematography and sound effects are adequate to the film. The film has a sort of gloomy/dismal setting which no doubt lets us know that the theme of the film is that all good things in life come to an abrupt end. People grow old - even mutants. But I do hope that the next generation has a bright future ahead of it. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading this review. Live long and prosper.<br/><br/>More Superhero Films To See: Condorman(1981), The Incredible Hulk Returns(1988), The Punisher(1988), Darkman(1990), Captain America(1990), The Guyver(1990), The Meteor Man(1993), Blankman(1994), The Phantom(1996), Unbreakable(2000), Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut(2006)."

","Logan is the Wolverine movie that fans have always wanted, it packs in great emotional story telling and is littered with gritty, violent action sequences that only Wolverine can be worthy of, while at the same time handling the end and departure of beloved characters in such a great way. Humour was also very sparingly sprinkled in to Logan making it an overall amazing package.<br/><br/>It was a true sendoff for a hero as we tie an end to Logan's legacy and leave behind Laura (X-23) to potentially carry on the mantle of Wolverine. Unlike the usual action-packed comic-book superhero movie this was comparatively subtle but contains doses of insane fight sequences that tops many that we've seen perhaps due to the well deserved R-rating. But surprisingly this movie manages to not only succeed on that front but also in telling this story that is really a lot more meaningful than the classic or even clichéd good versus evil that is slowly becoming overused and boring, so Logan really was just a fresh of fresh air among many other accolades that is achieves.<br/><br/>The chemistry that develops between our trio of characters is great, the way Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman portray these old and worn- out characters is great. Especially Hugh Jackman as Logan, when you see this character, his posture and in his eyes there really is just the word 'tired' that comes to mind and the way that Jackman manages to get that across in this film is truly heart wrenching, the hopelessness that is felt by these characters can really be seen on these characters' facial expression. <br/><br/>This actress who portrays Laura should also be applauded for the way she portrays this character that would sure to be compared to the brilliant portrayal of 'Eleven' from stranger things by Millie Bobby Brown. Another class act from a child-actress. <br/><br/>The tone that is established through the actors and atmosphere is truly breathtaking and sombre. As a comic book fan it really is a blessing to see the ""Old man Logan"" title be explored and reimagined to the big-screen in such a way. This movie shows the other superhero movies what a superhero movie could be and adds another to the list of R- rated films that are necessary of that rating and delivers beautifully under the category. In my opinion perhaps this is the next direction for superhero movies as people are starting to grow tired of the colourful capes and Leotards, just look at the change that has been done in the comic book world, darker tales and growingly gritty violence, perhaps the next step for superhero movies to evolve and adapt is by going in this direction, targeting a more mature audience."

This Movie is incredible, especially when put next to the nauseating prequel X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which as hard at Hugh Jackman (wolverine) tried, he could not change the terrible plot and script with his acting. The movie starts with a drunk wolverine (Logan) in the back of a limo (which he presumably owns), he gets out to find some Latino terrorists stealing the rims off his limo. He proceeds then to beat the living crap out of them with his razor claws. The scene is very gory, but nevertheless well- done as you can see wolverines claws enter some of the thugs heads and realistically come out the other side, complete with buckets of blood (not for kids). wolverine looks old and does not heal as fast (or altogether heal at all) as he used to. This is because wolverine feels no incline to live. All Logan's old 'crew' are dead with the exception of professor X, An old mind reader mutant. Logan gets given a girl like him from a Latino women, and so has a new reason to live - to take care of this girl and get her to a safe place. Will Wolverine succeed?"

"gradyharp","Null","3","8","11 June 2017"," 'Take your friends and run... They'll keep coming, and coming... You don't have to fight anymore.'
","For those who have been following the Marvel Comic Books cinematic transformation, the character of Wolverine – that hunk with the blades that shoot out from his hands when he is angry – is well known. LOGAN represents the end of Wolverine, and surprisingly this is a very touching film and not just excessive gore (though that is certainly present throughout the film!). One line that underscores the mood of this piece is Logan's line 'Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.' James Mangold directs the story he wrote (transformed into a screen play with help form Scott Frank and Michael Green) with a great deal of empathy for the last of Logan and his return to a caring man.<br/><br/>The year is 2029 - the mutant population has shrunken significantly and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan (Hugh Jackman), whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his sidekick, the albino Caliban (Stephen Merchant) whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger (Elizabeth Rodriguez) asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures (led by Boyd Holbrook) working for a powerful corporation; this is because her DNA contains the secret that connects her to Logan. A relentless pursuit begins. This time around we see Wolverine as the superhero beset by everyday problems -aging, ailing and struggling to survive financially. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over. <br/><br/>Kindness prevails – as a family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse) provide caring and protection for Wolverine and his mutant daughter. The evil trackers are very well portrayed, the action is brisk, but underneath all the killing and mutilation is a story with a heart. Grady Harp, June 17"
"onestephenis","10","3","8","7 June 2017"," Must defend the 10 out of 10
","No movie is perfect and neither is Logan. However this movie deserves a higher rating than it has in my humble opinion. Logan is absolutely fantastic and I feel like it is the perfect send off for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.<br/><br/>I would have loved to see Wolverine in his prime tearing away through scores of bad guys, but the old man Logan story they went with instead was probably the better choice and it certainly better expressed all the torment Logan had been through in his incredibly long life without having to actually show it. Even if you had never seen a single X-men or Wolverine stand alone film you knew without doubt that this character had been through more than a normal man could ever survive. While on that subject if you'd never seen any of the previously mentioned films you could absolutely see just this one if you're not a particular fan of the comic book craze going on these days.<br/><br/>Logan is a great movie. Period. All on its own with no help from previous films or comic books required. I would go so far as to say that if you could barely stand comic book movies normally there is a really good chance that you'd enjoy this one... assuming you don't mind gratuitous violence and one very brief (and totally unnecessary) nude scene.<br/><br/>This movie is violent. Extremely violent might be more accurate. But, by god, it works in this movie. One of my biggest gripes with all the other Wolverine portrayals to this date (there are a lot of them) is that The Wolverine was never truly unleashed. He's more than a little run down now, he's way beyond his prime, but boy does he FINALLY truly get to unleash.<br/><br/>Fans of Wolverine rejoice. We may have never gotten to see one of our favorite characters go rage mode in his prime, but we did get, at least, to get a feel for what he was capable of. The fact that he isn't as invincible as he once was actually serves to make the movie better in many ways."

The story line itself was sluggish - with some unnecessary parts, I find myself asking a lot of why questions (why did he do that, why wouldn't he do that, who is that?)<br/><br/>If you have limited knowledge of the X-Men and Logan, you actually need to read the story line for the movie, because; A) it didn't feel/looked like 2029 ... B) you would never know there were mutant issues C) Logan is actually trying to hide? really? <br/><br/>If you're a huge fan of Logan/the Wolverine and the X-Men, not sure if this movie is for you, unless you really liked this perspective,<br/><br/>there's a lot of holes in the movie, a lot of things you just have to take at face value without really understanding why ... though understanding why would be a huge factor in understanding the character and the plot as a whole.<br/><br/>What I really would love to see is to get an actual writer that really knows and understands who/what Logan/the Wolverine is because this one was a huge downer, 3/10 because I'm feeling generous."

"greggs_nbacon","10","3","8","6 April 2017"," The best superhero movie since The Dark Knight
","The superhero genre has become pretty dull and generic. The DC Cinematic Universe has become nothing besides a flaming dumpster fire and although Marvel's movies are fun, the lack innovation and stick to the same formulaic approach that has made them billions of dollars. Before any of you say it, Deadpool was not an exception because it made a few dirty jokes. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy superhero movies, but I understand that they lack anything that makes them remotely interesting as films of substance. That was until I saw Logan.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has played Wolverine since I was five years old in 2000. The year is 2017, and I am now turning twenty-two this June. Throughout my life, I have seen four different Batmen, three Spidermen, two Supermen. However, there has only been one Wolverine. There will only ever be one Wolverine. Logan is Jackman's final farewell to the role that made him an international superstar. Jackman's commitment to the role has been admirable, even sticking with the X-Men franchise when it hit rock bottom in the mid to late 2000s with X3: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Eventually, the franchise rebooted itself to its former glory with X- Men First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past. Even the better X-Men films, which I give lots of credit to developing the modern formula for superhero films, really lacked a certain sense of pizazz. Every movie had the protagonists saving the world from (insert generic force here) at the last possible minute when it seemed all hope was lost. However, Logan takes a different approach. Instead of trying to save the world entire, Wolverine is only looking out for a single girl and an aging Professor X. As a result, the film is much more personal the consequences feel much more dire, even though less is technically at stake. Director James Mangold had obviously thought this through after the incredibly average showing that was The Wolverine in 2013. I always knew Mangold had the talent to deliver a truly excellent, character driven movie due to his magnificent work on the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line. Logan also fit into the aesthetic of a 1950s Western so well. When the comparison was drawn within the film to classic American Western Shane, I immediately felt the connection. Many films try to fit into a certain form, and fail so badly, (see my review of Kong: Skull Island). However, Logan fits the form so flawlessly, you forget you are watching a superhero film. The gruesome violence of the R-Rated Logan gives the film a certain grit that Shane does not have. In this way, the film explores the primitive side of Wolverine that is reminiscent of Spaghetti Westerns while maintaining the morality and ethics of the American Western<br/><br/>There has been constant praise to Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart over the years for their depictions of the seminal X-Men. However, it is 12-year-old Dafne Keen who steals the entire movie. If anyone knows me, I am incredibly critical of most child performers. I find them a giant nuisance and they have actually changed my opinion of a film due to a child actor's performance. (ex. The Babadook) However, Keen adds an almost Chaplin-esque quality to her performance as X-23. She is an absolute force to be reckoned with. Also, it is known by many that I am a giant opponent to the overuse of computer graphic imaging within a film. That being said, the CGI creation of X-24 had me absolutely startled. For maybe the first time ever in a movie, my cinematic eye couldn't tell whether a character was actually there. This is a sign of amazing visual effects, something that the Academy should not ignore come Oscar season.<br/><br/>I have roughly seen about 1,350 movies in my life. Of that list, I had only cried in 26 of those movies. Damn if Logan is only the 27th film to pierce my cold, cinephilic heart. I found myself crying like a small child I had not cried in a movie in a theater since 2012 at the midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. The film manages to be so personal and touching that it defies genre types. Very few superhero movies have actual consequences. I mean c'mon how many characters has Marvel brought back from the dead? Logan chooses to close out the X- Men of our childhood in about the best possible cinematic ending.<br/><br/>Logan is the best superhero movie in years. In fact, it would be fair to put it in the same class as The Dark Knight as an innovative and exceptional superhero film. I found myself scoffing at Logan's Oscar chances before the film, but I honestly believe this could be the first superhero film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and I would be perfectly fine with that. If any combination of Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, or Dafne Keen were nominated for Oscars for their exceptional performances, I would be their biggest supporter. If you only want to see one big budget action movie this year, do yourself a favor and choose Logan.<br/><br/>(Score: 10/10)"
"berserker-15015","7","3","8","5 April 2017"," ""So that's what is feels like . . .""
","For better or worse ""Logan"" does not follow this all-too-overused cookie cutter template that most superhero movies use. ""Logan"" does not lack from comic relief—Patrick Stewart is comic gold—or from over the top action scenes. Director James Mangold permeates the story with action: car chases, loads of bullets, and a few choice decapitations. But, it feels significantly more reserved than his others work in this universe ""The Wolverine.""<br/><br/>Fashioned much more like an old-fashioned western like ""True Grit,"" the baddies feel more like a throwaway sorry Boyd Holbrook, but the villain is the environment itself. Hugh Jackman's quote, ""Nature made me a freak, man made me a weapon, and God made it last too long,"" permeates the viewer with a deep sense of the pain. ""Logan"" is a story about regaining that humanity by fighting for what is right, albeit this fight is forced upon him when encountered with child female clone of himself. Dafne Keen's Laura character (X-23!!!) is arguably the most enjoyable performance in this film despite having very few lines or even screen time. Jackman's capability as an actor is apparent, often evoking an emotional response that continues to gnaw at you long after you leave the theater. If you are able to gloss over the few continuity issues (how does she reach the pedals?!) or the plot holes (you seriously want me to believe that all the x-men are gone because of GMO corn?), ""Logan"" is a very enjoyable movie. 7/10"
"agmoldham","8","3","8","31 March 2017"," Movie of the year?
","It's still quite early in the year, but it's quite possible that Logan will be my favourite film of the year. For the second time recently went into the movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. During the trailers realised that the film was going to be part of the X-Men franchise. The Logan in the title was Wolverine.<br/><br/>The film is set in 2029 and the time has been hard on Logan and Charles Xavier. Logan is effectively a carer for Charles and they are effectively in hiding to a world where mutants are a thing of the past. They are introduced to Laura who is in grave danger and needs to get across the country to a meeting point.<br/><br/>The movie is unlike the previous X-Men movies. It focuses very much on the relationship between the 3 main characters. Jackman and Stewart clearly enjoy the movie and are excellent. The real star of the show is Dafne Keen though. It is the finest performance I've seen by someone of her age since Natalie Portman in Leon(or The Professional) many years ago. The relationship between Logan and Laura is also somewhat similar to the relationship between Reno and Portman in that movie. <br/><br/>Great film!"

","Logan is the 10th movie in The X-Men saga, and Hugh Jackman's 8th film portraying the character of Wolverine (Logan). It's hard to not get invested in Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the character after 17 years of playing him. I recently rewatched the entire X-Men franchise, and seeing Logan age throughout the films, watching Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine become richer and more mature is unreal. With every movie he keeps building on the character, he makes it feel more and more real. Logan is a love letter to all fans of the X-Men series, watching a grown up version of the characters I've quite literally grown up with is an experience like no other. Logan is also the first movie featuring Jackman's Wolverine rated R, which only makes the movie better. The brutality of the action is outstanding; they really didn't hold anything back. Blood, gore and limbs are everywhere in this movie, which really benefit the intensity and tone of the movie, there is no possible way this movie could have worked if it had been rated PG-13. The plot of Logan is really simple, and we've all seen it a million times in all sorts of media, but that's not what makes this movie so special. What differentiates this movie are its characters. The humanization of Logan, Laura, and Charles Xavier in this movie is very clever, showing us the emotional journeys of both Wolverine and Professor X, both of which are now near the end of their lives, well past their peak, well past the point they were seen as invincible heroes. This movie does not feel like your standard superhero flick, and while the plot follows the same formulaic structure we've come to see with other films of the genre, Logan always feels overshadowed by Xavier, their acceptance of life's inevitable end and their struggle with oneself throughout the film; the drama and the action in this movie never feel particularly entertaining or exciting, at least not in the same way as other superhero films. The brutal action and intense drama are instead showing us the gruesome reality in which these characters have lived in, and not the same, un-realistic battles, toned down and censored like in the other X-Men films and most superhero movies for that matter; this is very clearly shown by how Logan describes the X-Men comics in the movie as being unrealistic and not invoking the real pain and the real suffering that actually happened during those stories. The characters are what make this movie so special, not the plot. Logan focuses on telling a tragic, gruesome and much more personal story. It is easier and more effective to relate to the struggle of two men as opposed to the ""end of the world"" scenarios that are usually present in most other superhero movies. And at the end of the day Logan makes the audience feel like they're not watching a superhero movie, but a heartfelt and character-driven drama."

","A movie with surprising depth and profundity that was able to make basic human emotions matter as much if not more than super powers.

When he realizes his crime committed to those he had spent so long nurturing and acting as a father figure to, especially as a senile old man, that truly was heartbreaking. Logan still has his hard-earned pessimism but you really get a feel of how exhausted of life he is. <br/><br/>My one gripe were the villains were kind of bland for me, though they do serve their purpose as vehicles for ideologies. I do have a higher expectation from Xmen to have villains be more than just bad guys in costume up to no good, and while that wasn't exactly the case here I did find their depth more on the lacking side.<br/><br/>In all, I felt the movie really did a great job focusing on characters and relationships and showed how the Xmen were not a superteam, but a surrogate family."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","3","8","22 March 2017"," Hugh Jackman's swan song at long last testifies to Wolverine's potential
","Hugh Jackman's 17-year ride as beloved ""X-Men"" hero Wolverine has been full of ups (""X2"") and downs (""X-Men Origins""), but his commitment to the character has never wavered, and that's undoubtedly a factor in what makes ""Logan"" a special superhero film.<br/><br/>Inspired by Mark Millar's ""Old Man Logan"" storyline, the film takes place in 2029 in a world almost completely devoid of mutants. A physically ailing Wolverine has concealed his identity and works as a private driver in El Paso. He commutes over the border to Mexico, where he's hiding a senile Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who has seizures that result in physical tremors. Their quiet life is upended when a woman pursues Logan with a request to take care of a young girl in her care named Laura (Dafne Keen). But some bad folks from a bad technology company are after Laura, who shows some mutant-like tendencies that resemble Wolverine's. The three are forced on the run with the hope of getting Laura to a safe haven in North Dakota.<br/><br/>The film both subtly and overtly resembles a Western. Director James Mangold, who also made 2013's underrated ""The Wolverine,"" also directed the strong ""3:10 to Yuma"" remake and the acclaimed Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk the Line."" Story and aesthetic elements of both make it into this film, as does the character-focused storytelling that made ""The Wolverine"" a strong entry in the character's lengthy canon.<br/><br/>It may seem crude, but what elevates ""Logan"" to the top of the Wolverine spin-off pile has a lot to do with its R rating. Although the violence adds a grit that better captures the essence of the character, it's equally about the maturity of the storytelling. The R rating also affects the style of the film, which is far more dramatic and introspective, and consequently much slower in pace. Freeing Wolverine from the restraints of PG-13 also means freeing him from the restraints of the cookie-cutter comic book blockbuster framework. Mangold and fellow scripters Scott Frank and Michael Green are able to populate the story with character-building scenes and dialogue that serves more than plot momentum.<br/><br/>The success of Fox's ""Deadpool"" would seem the obvious source of our gratitude for Logan's liberation, but Mangold's vision and Jackman's tenure in the role, which has raked in billions for the studio in the last two decades, had to inspire more confidence that if any character could carve its way out of the superhero mold, it would be this one. Mangold and Jackman reward the studio's trust – and our trust – with a one-of-a-kind riff on the genre, something becoming increasingly vital after two decades of Juggernaut-like forward momentum in Hollywood comic book adaptations.<br/><br/>Yet for the ways it tests the limits of the genre, ""Logan"" doesn't transcend it. It still ultimately feels like a comic book movie, namely in the way it gives in to action set pieces and gratuitous violence (albeit in a whole other stratosphere, stylistically speaking). Adding Western tropes to superhero tropes technically doubles the amount of tropes, and both genres have an overwhelming tendency to descend into violence. So ""Logan"" may not be formulaic, but it's still predictable. The script finds some nice moments that exist in service to themes and emotions, but the storytelling is simply good, not exceptional. Watching a superhero film play out in such a unique manner is more satisfying than following the actual story itself.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Jackman seizes his opportunity to go out on a much more profound note than fans of the character ever dreamed possible, especially in 2009 after ""X-Men Origins."" The story, the style – these components give an actor who was already such an effortless fit more opportunities to own the character, which is bittersweet given he's hanging up the claws. All the same things can be said of Stewart, who did it without ever having a solo film. He actually has the more demanding role given how different it is than his previous appearances as Professor X.<br/><br/>""Logan"" is refreshing and interesting, which means it might not hold up over time as superhero films continue testing the limits that once contained them, but it will undoubtedly stand out as one of the high points of Jackman's unprecedented legacy as Wolverine.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Marvel Studios without a doubt has told a great story with this film. If your expecting non stop superhero action then this movie isn't for you. Logan in essence is a modern Western that just so happens to be about the legend that is Wolverine. If you follow the comics then you know that this is a take on old man Logan."

","Logan is like god of war in the PlayStation games sick of fighting looking to be left alone seeking revenge and sick of people dying in this 2hrs and 17mins it just feels like he has not care in the world here is the best film of the year so far director James mangold who done the original wolverine does the opposite of what a superhero film should feel and look this is what an end to a superheroes life is like a risky look that might alienate people but it gets it right Hugh Jackman gets to the heart of wolverine where his friends have died he is a superhero carer for charlies Xavier in his cerebrum little box in the middle of the Mexico desert with an albino watchdog called Caliban Hugh has learned how to play a lone wolf in wolverine and in this he is conflicted tired and vulnerable not like the young wolverine with zest but there is some life in the old dog but he is on his last legs as he needs medicine for Xavier's nightmare seizures that rattle everybody brain and only a few can survive his brain is a w.m.d Logan expects us to take it seriously – and we actually can because the last two were good this just blows the rest them out of the water he was young showing how indestructible he can be this one he is lost but finds a purpose when a stranger comes along Logan's darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as in Batman v Superman Logan's darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as was the case in Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; it emanates from within the character. It's ironic that the title shares some DNA with the famously campy 1970s sci-fi film, Logan's Run, in which people are considered obsolete at 30 and murdered. In its way, Logan is just as much about the pitilessness of the aging process, and Jackman's battle-scarred, stiffening body is as expressive in this regard as his perma-scowl of a face. It's taking him longer to heal, his eyes are never clear and one of his claws won't fully extend. This makes him less Logan's Run, more Logan's Limp. He's as battered a superhero as we've ever seen, and for the first time his body bears exterior witness to the inner torture that has always defined him. His body is the story.we go on a road trip of sorts through the through the Midwest through to Dakota The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story But Logan does go defiantly against the grain by favouring melancholic mood and themes of mortality and deterioration over inflated, end-of-the-world stakes or grandiose action pyrotechnics So despite an almost pathological reluctance to get involved, Wolverine is drawn into the role of protector, in a manner that the screenplay, co-written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green, keeps from getting overly sentimental, while still providing the film with what little emotional uplift it has In an era of cinematic product homogenization there's no doubt that Logan is a risky proposition. But this is reportedly Jackman's last time donning those claws and chewing on that cigar. Considering it was his Wolverine, as the centerpiece of Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000), who launched the currently omnipresent superhero phenomenon in the first place, maybe the most appropriate thing would be that, with the brutal, melancholic elegy that is Logan, Wolverine remakes the superhero movie again, this time as a farewell. After 17 years and 8 other X-Men movies, Hugh Jackman returns as James 'Logan' Howlett aka Wolverine for one final time. Set in the near future, Logan currently makes a hopeless and depressing living as a limo driver for whoever gives him a call. No mutants have been born in over two decades and almost everyone he knows is either dead or doesn't care anymore. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is bedridden with a rapidly deteriorating mind and requires regular medication to keep his psychic abilities in check. These two have been surviving day to day and refusing to talk about the past until a young girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) comes along in need of Logan's protection. And as he finds people to help and hide out dark forces are never far behind testing Logan and the child out as well as her young gifted friends can Logan protect and get them to their safe haven but the journey is perilous To say any more would ruin one of the potential films of the year. You can definitely watch it having never seen an X-Men film before, but you just aren't going to get that emotional investment from knowing you're seeing an actor play a role he has become synonymous with for the very last time. Logan is full of surprises, not for kids, a great farewell to Hugh Jackmans role as Wolverine and overall just a fantastic film. We will miss Hugh in his iconic role but this is the definite role but I gave this a well deserving 10 its going to better at the box office that his other two wolverine"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","3","8","20 March 2017"," Great drama and action all in one
","Hugh Jackman's supposed last outing as Wolverine in Logan was quite the gamble for 20th Century Fox. Could they pull off another R rated superhero movie? Could they pull off a superhero movie with a low key story? I'm happy to say that Fox and director James Mangold pulled it off with flying colors. Logan is the perfect sendoff for Hugh Jackman, who has played Wolverine in nine movies over seventeen years, and it's hard to see how anyone can replace him (and you know they will eventually). Logan is a character driven drama that evokes classic Westerns like Shane and Unforgiven, while still being a superhero movie. With the market saturated with superhero movies, Fox has shown that you can still make superhero movies that feel fresh, and they should really make this kind of film their niche. <br/><br/>Logan takes place in 2029, and for reasons I won't go into here, mutants have not been born in years, and the X-Men have all been killed, except for Wolverine and Professor Xavier. Wolverine is at the end of his rope – his healing factor does not work as well as it used to and he is slowly dying. His most pervasive pain of all though is his mental pain – years of fighting have worn him down, and he wants all the pain to end. He just wants to make enough money to buy a large boat so he can just escape from the dangerous world with Professor X, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and can no longer control his powers. <br/><br/>But one day a woman with a little girl only known as X-23 comes pleading for his help. X-23 is a mutant who was cloned from Logan's DNA and is now being pursued by the scientists who created her. Logan at first wants nothing to do with the girl, but when a gang of criminals called the Reavers comes to take her, Logan reluctantly helps the girl by taking her to a mutant refuge in Canada. But it becomes clear pretty quickly that X-23 might not really need much protection, as she has the same claws and amazing fighting ability as Logan. <br/><br/>Wolverine was my favorite childhood superhero, so my standards are a bit high, and I can say that I've never seen a better depiction of him on screen. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best performances that I sincerely hope earns him an Oscar nod. He expresses such pain and frustration and you really feel it. His chemistry with X-23 is great as they end up forming a dysfunctional family unit with Professor X. The family aspect was surprisingly moving. I legit cried a little bit at the end of this movie and I don't think any comic book movie has ever done that to me. <br/><br/>Patrick Stewart also gives a wonderful performance as an old Professor Xavier. He has his own guilt to deal with and the movie ends up being a great sendoff for him too, as this is reportedly his last X-Men movie. <br/><br/>Finally, the action is spectacularly brutal, as a real Wolverine movie should be. I think this is clearly the best action movie in the X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>With Logan, Fox has reminded us that superhero movies can actually be films, and not just set- ups for a sequel. I hope they make smaller, more focused superhero films their model going forward. They might not make as much money as Disney, but they can be made for a fraction of the cost. I hope they abandon any notion of creating a cinematic universe. In fact, I don't even want to see a sequel to X-Men Apocalypse. Given the way this movie ends, it would be hard to care about the Phoenix Saga, and Deadpool and Logan are just so much more interesting than anything they are likely to come up with in the McAvoy/Fassbender X-Men universe. Fox really raised the bar here, and I hope they continue to have artistic success in the future."
"natefenlon","10","3","8","18 March 2017"," The best of the franchise by a mile
","This film exceeded all expectations especially when compared to the previous Wolverine movies which were boring. This movie ends the franchise on a high, with an emotional, and satisfying ending. Hugh Jackman's performance is the best of his career. This movie is jam packed with amazing action sequences which don't hold back one bit on the violence, rivalling Deadpool in the new direction superhero movies seem to be going. This is a movie which will stay in your mind and have a real impact on you."
"hacoach","9","3","8","17 March 2017"," A fitting end for a hero
","The idea is as old as time, take a once great hero, broken by tragedy , and then give him something to fight for, and watch the hero return. The idea of taking superheroes and moving them into the future and past their prime and having them deal with real world problems like aging and depression was refined by Frank Miller with his genre changing Dark Knight saga in the 1980s. but in regards to comic book movies only Christopher Nolan has dared to go in this direction with his own Dark Knight saga, now logan has joined the fray. The classic western arc of the broken down gun slinger who is just waiting for the bullet that will end his torment and wandering, who suddenly finds something to fight for is played out here to superb effect.<br/><br/>When we first see Logan, he is a shell of his former self, almost unrecognizable, beaten , cheerless, his face a stone mask of sadness, a smile never crosses his lips. The only reason he hasn't blown his head off (which he now can do, since his regenerative powers are on the wane) is because of his devotion to Charles Xavier, a man who is the closest thing to a Father that he has ever had. But Logan makes no bare bones that the minute Charles dies, Logan having nothing to live for will end his own life with an Adamtuim bullet he carries around for the occasion. As the story begins the only thought that logan finds comfort in is the thought of a quick death.<br/><br/>But Charles, battling senility, but still having glorious lucid moments, where we see the old Charles Xavier, the great dreamer of dreams, knows something is coming, something big, that will change everything. It's almost as if Charles is hanging around just to be there when it comes, to guide Logan in the right direction.<br/><br/>The big thing finally arrives in the person of a little girl, a little girl created out of Logan's DNA, she is more than a clone, she is his daughter, and she see's herself in that way. The girl, as well as the heroic nurse who saves her from being 'destroyed' along with the rest of the newly created mutant children. The bad guys have found the weapon they need in X-24 and all the other mutants are to be destroyed. Suddenly Logan is on a mission to get Laura to safety. <br/><br/>Slowly but inexorably he bonds with Laura, and yet he holds back, afraid to get too close , his history tells him that anybody he gets close to dies. The girl believes in him totally, she knows more about him than he knows of himself, she knows he is the 'Wolverine"" the hero of heroes. She also knows he is her Father. Though like him she holds back.<br/><br/>X-24 turns out to be perfect clone of Logan, an unstoppable killing machine. Faced with any other foe Logan would stand a chance but there is no way he can defeat his younger self. X-24 is like the terminator , a soulless killing machine, who never stops coming at you. It is pure genius that we see in X-24, Logan without Charles Xavier. Charles gave Logan a home and a purpose, and a family.<br/><br/>The film ends with Logan in full all out hero mode, outnumbered a hundred to one by fully armed cyborg villains with weapons that pump high caliber bullets into his flesh, Logan cannot be stopped, he will take on the whole world to save Laura. the last ten minutes of the film are filled with scenes of Logan fighting with all he has for his daughter, and Laura fighting with all she has for her Father. Neither will desert the other. in much the same way logan wouldn't desert Charles. That is the lesson that Logan teaches laura and the new Mutant children. heroes may know fear and pain, even depression but somehow when push comes to shove-you can count on them. When you are in trouble, when things are desperate, where others flee, or run for cover, a hero comes running to save you."

","as for the summary, it is merely a conjunction as to comparing my favorite 'comic book' movies of all time. none of that Dc vs marvel jargon.<br/><br/>***spoiler alert due to this being my first written review on IMDb<br/><br/>Logan... Logan, Logan, Logan.. How beautiful you are. Honestly, it may not have had a performance like that of heath ledger for dark knight, but cumulatively everyone gelled so very, very well together. Each actor and actress met the standard of a great modern film, 'comic book' movie or not. This in my opinion is marvels single handed holy grail to date. Lacking the big time budget like that of the avengers or previous Xmen installments, Logan combined Dead Pools Vulgarity, with a story line like that of Days of Future past creating (in my opinion) the most realistic comic book movie since that of the dark knight, maybe even on par. Logan being the ailing older more wise, but deeply torn from 'battle wounds' Wolverine delivers an insatiably realistic persona to the once young, charismatic and loving character. This being Hugh's final swan song, or Kobe Bryant ""mamba out"" 'mic drop' moment delivered in a grand fashion. I found the performance if anything for lack of a better term, believable... In saying that let me entail that believing a broken down wolverine longing for merely the end of the tunnel hurt... I felt the emotion, I felt the pain of all the loss, and I felt the redemption of saving the day in the end. on the grandest stage as per expected from one of our favorite characters of all time. There is an aura about this movie that simply resonates with both fans of cinema and fans of comics. from the very first line, that being Logan waking up in his limo with the line ""what the f***"" to little Laura pulling the cross out and tilting it to form the X at the end and every subtle to major nuance in between, Logan delivers.. Simply put it delivers, it is hilarious in it's vulgar realism, painful in tragedy, and heart warming with love. All in all when you put together the entire cast with such extraordinary execution you are left with a fantastically wonderful film that everyone should enjoy.. yes even mature children who can handle an f bomb without laughing childishly. Take it for what it is, breath the air of the extent and magnitude of what is going on. Logans family is gone, the end of an era, 17 years running Hugh was wolverine, no longer though sadly. Thankfully he went out right, on top and with a scintillating bang. It's not often films like Logan grace us with its presence. watch it and enjoy, simply put for the last time, it's great, it really is that good!"

"nickdanz","10","3","8","15 March 2017"," A masterpiece that can be enjoyed by itself
","Let me start off by saying(admitting) that I have never watched an X-Men movie. I do not have anything against them, but I have not given them a try yet. I fully intend to after watching Logan. The preview of Logan was enough to draw me into a movie with no prior knowledge. After watching it, I will tell you that you don't need prior knowledge to enjoy it. I found the film to be a masterpiece. That is to say, you should(possibly need) to have minor knowledge of the X-Men and Wolverine in general to fully enjoy it. This movie mad full usage of it's R-rating and is worth every bit. It is an emotional tale of an old battered hero way past his prime protecting a child just like him. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen steal the show, while the side characters are impacting and the villain is done well but not too exciting. There is a fun twist though and some PHENOMENAL usage of CGI. The movie hits every emotion but sticks mostly to a rough, sad tone. It is a long movie but, at this day and age, most films are. I never found it to get boring or to be dragging on, and the ending was satisfying while sad. I can confidently say this was one of the best films I have ever enjoyed. I would suggest watching the other films first, I wish I would have, but you will enjoy it either way. There is also a fun extra scene at the beginning, so make sure you make it to your theater on time!!"

(Hugh Jackman) James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine,from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with Cartels. Logan spends his days working as a chauffeur Limo driver and hustling for prescription drugs in Texas. His body has aged greatly because We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. Logan lives with mutant tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, where they care for Professor Charles Xavier, who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities to devastating effect witch he could not<br/><br/>control he is mind he loses it anytime. One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called ""Eden"". you have villain Donald Pierce(Boyd Holbrook) as Donald Pierce, Transigen's cybernetically-enhanced chief of security, tracks down Logan and requests that he help him find Laura that's what he request Logan for but he didn't expect it, but Logan refuses like he thinks she is totally crazy and mixed up with someone. she requested Logan for a job with good money he Expected it to do with her with some business and next day everything gone strange Xavier knows that little girl aka Laura / X-23 A strange mysterious young mutant, who is ""very much"" like Logan that's what Xavier said she looks like a lot like you. all Donald and his men come to Logan place his men i know the actor from Bloodsport II & Bloodsport III, Matrix Reloaded, John Wick (Daniel Bernhardt)Bone Breaker is only in it for 30 seconds shame for me because i wanted to see him fight with Logan he has a lot great Martial Arts fights i wanted to see that in this movie fighting Hugh Jackman but it didn't shameful happen. Donald men come over because they wanted the girl back but Logan is unsure to give her away but she ended using claws like Logan but it's expect its 2 claws in each hand killing a lot guys and Logan is kicking ass the all film is long but then it catch's up to action pace because it's last Hugh Jackman Wolverine it's full on him discovering what is going on about girl and everything i don't like too spoil never wanted to spoil film but it's a lot fun gore bloody X-MEN Wolverine film it's the best idea for his last movie because if it was PG in my opinion and everyone else is it would be bit less inserted to film but R RATED works for me that's why i loved movie and matter fact The movie is just over 2 hours. The first 45 minutes and the last 45 minutes are the best part of this film. I have never seen a superhero movie like this. It's brutal to its core. a lot hardcore action Logan is a film which I consider it a privilege to have seen. When you see the film, you'll understand. This is a FILM, not a super hero movie. like X-MEN Prequels these ones are for kids this movie is not made for kids it's true that's why it is hardcore R RATED film <br/><br/>ending of final showdown keeps you watching and watching like you don't want get your ass out of seat because it is in very edge of it. never take your eyes of it. it's expect for X-Men fans witch i am not X-MEN fan anymore witch i got tried of it when i heard about this film this what i expected it to have a style of Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, ""Logan"" is the Wolverine film that i was waiting for This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. ""Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men or spin of Wolverine film to date. This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. my opinion in future Hugh Jackman might change his mind comeback as Wolverine or next Wolverine should be Scott Adkins or Joe manganiello or Scott Eastwood or Taylor kitsch or Charlie Hunnam or Karl Ubarn or Jon Bernthal"
"SeakDub","10","3","8","15 March 2017"," Logan VS Deadpool, LOGAN DOMINATES!
","Logan was the Wolverine we needed. A long wait for an end of an era finale that hit all emotions. Deadpool was comical and funny and blew the box office in a slow February. Logan however was a very intense emotionally western feel that pummeled Deadpool in the end. Between the two, Logan came out victorious. <br/><br/>This movie will take you on a journey of high and low mixture of feelings. Logan is such an action pack, furious Wolverine that's sailor mouth, who anyone getting in his way will be six feet under. Logan is our hero who just wants to enjoy the remaining years of his life in peace with his friend Professor X who knows of a young mutant. A deadly young wolverine. Which brings trouble to Logan who has to decide to help the young mutant or turn his head. But what starts with meeting with someone who has a secret only leads into bloodshed and leaving Logan to do everything in his adamant power to shred his way to stopping the pursuers that are after the young child. James Mangold made sure to tell the story and storytelling of this film in such a beautiful way. From directing it and being the writer, he puts out such a strong story that focuses on Logan. Surpassing most superhero movies and action movies. This is unlike any film you have seen and cannot pass up Logan. A must see!<br/><br/>If rated PG-13, Logan, would still be a top notch movie. With a R- rating it gives more emotions the characters are going through, the violence they are enduring in which they want out. Because of the R- rating it does a lot more to the story, showing us the real Wolverine that people needed to see. To know what these characters were fighting for. Not a movie for children. Children should grow up watching the X-Men movies and animated shows. Then into the Wolverine movies. And finally when old enough to appreciate such an awesome character Logan is, then see this movie!<br/><br/>Old man Logan, The Wolverine, Hugh Jackman. The man who was perfection for the role, the man who we watched through 17 years playing one of the best comics heroes nailed his performance every time. But this time it had such more meaning and respect for him. To watch him portray old man Logan was quite depressing to see that we are at the end of the series and seeing the last time we will see Hugh Jackman play him. And by goodness grace went out with a bang on such an amazing film. Don't forget now of Sir Patrick Stewart who also was the perfect role for Professor X, Charles Xavier. Another depressing emotion that is the last performance by a man who made the character come alive. James McAvoy did a great job but Patrick Stewart just fit the character so much better. And to see his portrayal of old Professor X is another reason why this movie did such a wonderful job on bringing the story and elements to life. Let's not leave out the young actress Dafne Keen who was just supreme in this movie. Talented young actress who I hope see to become an even greater actress later on. She stole the film from everyone. Believe it when I say the look she gives should tell that you do not want to make this child angry. <br/><br/>Almost everything about this movie makes you wish it could keep going. Finishing Logan will bring a tear to your eye one way or another. A powerful movie that will or should make you appreciate the people and love ones you have around you now before it is too late. Not a flaw went through my head. A perfect 10 out of 10. Regardless in theaters or one point at home, check out this movie! And appreciate one final time Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's beautiful performance that we all know we will miss. Thank you two and everyone else for the making of this film."

I truly Believe this will be the first superhero movie to be nominated for a best picture awards at next year's Oscars. The movie is that good. Please check it out and you will see this is the Wolverine movie we all been waiting for. I loved it so much that I'll probably go see it again.

","Logan, the last of the Wolverine Trilogy, is actually Fox's / Marvel's answer to DC's The Dark Knight Returns written by Frank Miller.<br/><br/>Logan's grit, brutality, realistic cinematography, excellent writing and the actors' compelling performances which separates itself from being a comic book movie and will definitely end up being a cult classic gem.<br/><br/>Sadly enough, despite numerous rumors surrounding Jackman's contract extension, this will be his last appearance as Wolverine, but the good news is, we are in for a ride in the most enthralling X-Men movie to date.<br/><br/>I like Director James Mangold's vision of the film, and its not very often that the third movie of any franchises will come up on top, despite the Wolverine Trilogy's start was a bit shaky and full of viewer and critical backlash, Logan finally emerged from its ashes and broke the third installment curse.<br/><br/>Both Jackman and Stewart already established the acting efficiency, but its a great wonder to see Dafne Keen's X-23 and she's a total badass kid.<br/><br/>(SPOILER) Another thing Logan got right, that MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) can't do, is that they can kill their heroes. (Let's forget about the Quicksilver death in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) because that's just plain stupid) A death of a superhero isn't a bad thing, the message is, No One Is Safe, to show us what will happen if mutants really exists. They don't need a big violet murderer in the galaxy to push them, instead this film made us realize that our biggest villain is ourselves.<br/><br/>I personally don't see Logan as a comic book movie but rather an interpretation of what's happening in the real world. The government's or the big companies selfish agenda for power and control for their personal gain and the few who risked their lives to save millions."
"saulius-dziugelis","10","3","8","13 March 2017"," A great ending to a great portrayal of a great character
","The first X-men movie I saw was Origins: Wolverine. I wasn't much of a comic book or superhero fan back then, but I've had a love for antihero characters for as long as I can remember, thus, I took an instant liking to the character of Logan. While Origins is widely regarded as one of the worst movies in the X-men franchise, but for me it was the first, and it showed me the beginning of Wolverine's character. And now, years later, this movie has given that character great closure. <br/><br/>And what a movie it was. I do not wish to ruin the experience for anyone, so I'll keep this review spoiler free. Let me just say that not only is this the best movie based on a comic book character since the Dark Knight, it is also one of the best movies of 2017 so far, and will likely remain so. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart give the performances of their lifetimes, and the girl, damn did she nail her part as well. I have never seen such pure savagery on a kid's face before. This girl has adamantium daggers for eyes, but those are not the only acting chops she displays throughout the movie, so much praise for the young actress to whom no small part of this movie's success is owed.<br/><br/>This film is brilliantly paced and varied too. The action scenes look great, they look realistic and gritty, thanks in no small part to the movie's R rating - the rating, I felt, Wolverine always deserved. Logan always seemed like an R rated character trapped in a PG-13 rated movie universe, and it's great to see him unleashed in the character's true potential in this (presumably) final appearance. And in between the brilliant action scenes, the film has a wonderful mix of tenderness and drama to it, as well as well-timed comic relief, which never feels cringy or unnecessary. Like a well balanced meal, this movie is just pure pleasure to consume, ensuring you taste every ingredient. <br/><br/>I'd say the only reason this movie did not fully dethrone the Dark Knight for me is because I feel that the Dark Knight stands better as a movie on its own. Don't get me wrong - Logan is still a powerful movie by itself. But it's so much more powerful if you've been with Logan's character for the entire journey - therefore, in order to get the full kick out of Logan, previous X-men movies, at least the ones heavily featuring Wolverine (so, basically, all of them sans First Class and Apocalypse) should be watched. While the Dark Knight doesn't require the viewer to have seen any previous Batman titles in order to deliver its messages. <br/><br/>That is to say, Logan is an amazing movie, it took my already high expectations and blew them out of the water. It is a crowning achievement not only for the X-men saga, but for the superhero genre as a whole. Bravo."

Jackman gives an astonishing performance as a hurting Logan; he's no longer Wolverine, just a man who's lived a hard, hard life and is looking at an unforgiving, grim future.

","Logan is a great movie and could possibly be named Marvel's greatest. It does numerous things with a great amount of precision and perfection such as action, character development and emotional connection. It also has a few minor problem which I noticed.<br/><br/>Action: Wolverine is known for his rage and healing factor, leaving him pretty much immune from attacks by anyone. This calls for great action, as Logan sprints through the battlefield he slices and dices his enemies like ham on a chopping board. In the split seconds you see Wolverines enemies you see blood and guts spill from there limp bodies, with such realistic effects it is hard to see why this movie isn't a 10/10.<br/><br/>Character Development: At the start of the movie Logan is portrayed as a arrogant drunk who is stubborn beyond belief and doesn't care about other people. He doesn't care about Professor X or Laura. By the end of the movie he weeps for Professor X and realizes that Laura and the kids are more important than he thinks, and ultimately risks his life for them, one of the last scenes shows Logan saying ""This is what it feels like,"" referring back to when Professor X said something along the lines of ""This is the closest to family we have had in a long time."" This shows that he actually cares for X-23, realizing that she is the closest to family he has.<br/><br/>Emotional Connection: In this movie you gain an emotional connection with the characters, you feel their pain, and gain a sense of empathy when professor Xavier, Caliban and Logan die.<br/><br/>Problem: I only have one problem with this movie. In the scene when Logan dies and the actor of X-23 was crying, you could tell it was fake but this is understandable as she is a child actor."

His intensity, honesty, power and pain in a role that could not be done by anyone else now is just effortless. The girl who plays Laura too is going to be a massive star, her future has been cemented by her performance too. Her intensity and power will make her a terrific addition to any future Marvel films including the new Wolverine<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart is also a fantastic actor and it will be a shame not to see him in any future films, although James Mcavoy has made the role his own.<br/><br/>Every single part of this film, the acting, the cinematography, script, characters and action is Oscar worthy.

"svorva","7","3","8","10 March 2017"," The Next Generation of Superhero Films
","The X-men might be the next step in human evolution, but until now, they were certainly not the next generation of superhero films. With the exception of Magneto, these mutants are a pretty forgettable bunch. They have a host of generic superpowers and equally unremarkable personalities. King of this bunch is the Wolverine. This character dominated the core franchise and spinoffs, ripping enemies to pieces in PG-13 glory. But even after a half a dozen movies this antihero never really grew beyond the loner among rejects persona. Honestly, the only character-centric scene I remember is a dialogue free montage of the immortal warrior fighting in American wars. I have seen enough movies that I know after the first twenty minutes rarely do things change for the better. By this standard, Logan (the 8th film featuring the Wolverine) is a miracle.<br/><br/>Logan takes place in the near future were no mutants have been born for decades. With his race virtually extinct, Logan/Wolverine works as a limo driver earning enough to support Professor Xavier. Xavier is suffering a degenerative brain disorder and is further addled by medication. To keep civilians safe, Logan conceals his former mentor in an isolated Mexican dump. Logan is also seriously ill and detached from the world, so when he is contacted by a stranger who knows his identity he wants none of it. This woman wants Logan's help in escorting a child to an ""Eden"" in North Dakota. Wolverine grudgingly accepts for cash, but when he finds the woman dead he returns to Mexico and Xavier. However, the child stowaways and with a small army in hot pursuit, Logan is inescapably involved. This mute child is Laura, an experimental subject. She is a product of the Wolverine's DNA, effectively Logan's daughter and a mutant with similar powers. Obviously, the corporation that created Laura wants her back. After a close escape, Logan, Xavier, and Laura head to North Dakota in search of Eden.<br/><br/>Logan is the conclusion of Jackman's Wolverine saga, equal parts superhero movie and contemporary western. Action sequences abound, but set to a background of dying old men driving across America's wastelands. One can sense director James Mangold's vision beyond the norm. His love for the genre has been expressed before in the 3:10 to Yuma remake. Here the approach works because of new vulnerability. Xavier is infirm and, like many elderly, he is stripped of dignity. His seizures and bouts of incomprehensibility recast the man, formally a paradigm of erudition and control. The classic wheelchair takes on brand new symbolism. When Xavier achieves moments of lucidity his reflections reach a profundity that was never matched in earlier films. Speaking of never before seen, this old man Logan. Even the fight sequences are not the same. With Wolverine's regenerative abilities hampered, finally bullets and beatings have consequences. The R rating also helps on this front. I could never quite ignore how a man could eviscerate enemies with metal claws without blood. Freddy Krueger must have been ashamed. But really this improved action is just an incidental upside. The mutants facing inevitable extinction is a scenario that allows for the character to thrive. The immortal veteran never fit comfortably in a boarding school for wayward children. A fight for survival where Logan has nobody to lean on is more reflective. Logan can finally assume the mantle as caretaker for what is left of his family. The best manifestation of this tough love is between Logan and pseudo father. It's shocking, watching Logan assist formerly omnipotent Xavier use the bathroom at a wayward gas station. Although less enthralling are scenes portraying a failed father and lost daughter. Logan has learned love, but he is used up, always drinking and practically coughing up a lung, finally beat. A classic western hero. There is a scene of Xavier and Laura watching the film Shane, but enthusiasts will recognize the tone and tropes without the direct reference. Hired hands, vast empty landscapes, the innocent family. The genre gives the film a familiar structure and ascetic core. Recognizable, but unlike any superhero movie before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, character and tone brake down in the final act. I don't know what I expected, maybe an operatic twenty minute standoff? The film finally devolves into the been there seen that, dashing a chance at greatness. It's not that the end is even particularly unsatisfying, just that by then expectations had been raised. Still the ride was worth it, and I even walked out the theater optimistic. Logan suggests the potential of these massive multi-movie universes. Usually squandered sure, but with any luck Logan's success will open doors for directors, writers, and actors with fresh takes. Let's hope Logan is not an evolutionary dead end in the superhero movie genre."

"superbrendan715","10","3","8","10 March 2017"," A superhero movie for everyone!
","""Logan"" is the newest addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise, and is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Dafne Keen. From the beginning of this film you can tell how gritty and dark this movie will be as all of the mutants from the previous ""X- Men"" films have died tragically except for a few. The main character Logan takes care of a very old Charles Xavier as he is diagnosed with Dementia. However, their lives change after a young girl named Laura comes into their lives. This movie truly is special in every way, and may be the best superhero film of all time. This film deal heavily with a emotional theme as these characters that we have learned to love have become severely depressed and are in great pain due to previous incidents that have happened to them and others. This film was made to explore the human condition, as this movie lets the audience feel like superheroes do not always have the best life or the best conditions. In fact, this movie lets the audience know that the world is not always fair even to superheroes, and sometimes bad things can happen to good people.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly special to me, as I have been going to the theaters to the ""X-Men"" films since ""X2"" came out in theaters in 2003. This movie is definitely worthwhile for anyone who loves the ""X-Men"" movies and even for those who do not. As I have told many people this film does not feel like a superhero movie, instead it feels like something that is very real. This is mostly due to the very dark tone of the movie, as people die left and right in very brutal and real ways. This movie also takes on very rough topics such as, dementia, child abduction, child slavery, alcoholism, and of course lose of loved ones. This movie not only takes on these topics in very real ways, but the characters also feel very real as well as the story that is based around them. The editing in this movie is absolutely flawless, as the movie felt very fluid and nothing felt out of place at all. The camera work is also incredibly, especially in the end fight scene, as Logan will be fighting someone with Laura in the shot, and the camera would then follow her fighting someone else. The CGI in this movie was very well done, especially with the budget that they had of 97 million dollar, which looked even much better than ""Star Wars: Rogue One"", which had a 200 million dollar budget. Overall, I would say this movie is absolutely worthwhile in every way! This movie definitely goes in my top 10 favorite movies of all time, and I really hope that many people do get to see this movie as it is really good."

"dfle3","9","3","8","10 March 2017"," Emotional. The best X-Men movie of the series (that I've seen). 85+%
","I became interested in seeing this film after I saw Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart interviewed on ABC TV's (Australia) ""Lateline"" programme. Here's the link to that interview (01/03/2017), with a transcript and video of the segment:<br/><br/>http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4628874.htm<br/><br/>I'm surprised to see that it looks like I've only reviewed ""The Wolverine"" at this site, which I scored 72.5+%, however, I have seen the first X-Men film in the series, at least. Which is to say that I'm a casual viewer of this franchise and I'm not particularly invested in the characters, so for me to like a film in this series so much speaks volumes for what they've accomplished here. It's a movie which effectively manipulates your emotions, in a way that other, lesser films, attempt to do, but fail, for example ""Star Wars: The force awakens"". <br/><br/>Seeing as ""The Wolverine"" was the last X-Men related film in this franchise that I've seen, I can't say that I've kept abreast of what's happened in this universe. By the looks of it, the mutants of this world are no longer a force. The reasons why are, presumably, covered in previous instalments of this franchise. In any case, there seems to be a little expository dialogue by the characters to help you understand what's going on better.<br/><br/>Logan (The Wolverine) and Charles Xavier (Professor X) are living in less than ideal circumstances. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are both very good in the physicality of these now older, more feeble mutants (maybe that's not so much ""acting"" from Stewart!). Jackman's Logan looks a bit like Saddam Hussein, just after he's emerged from his ""spider hole"" (foxhole)!<br/><br/>The major narrative arc of this film concerns Logan having to – unwillingly – escort a young girl to safety from what looks like a paramilitary operation which desperately wants to capture her. Visually, the film has touches of movies like Mad Max 2 for its vehicle action and it probably has similarities to an American Western which is regarded as a classic, but which I don't think that I've seen. In case naming that film might provide some spoilers, I'll refrain from doing that, but this film does show clips from that old movie and even reiterates dialogue from it. There's a scene with Logan and his ute which reminded me of a similar scene involving Basil Fawlty from the TV series ""Fawlty Towers"", but stripped of the hilarity of that earlier Britcom. There are actually some amusing scenes in this film...an unintentional example of that was Logan at a funeral near the start of the film...seeing what he does with litter, the phrase ""Keep America tidy"" popped into my head! It should also be pointed out that the film does get ""meta"" at times...there's an interesting series of comic books which appear in this film!<br/><br/>There was an enjoyable interlude in this film with a family which invites Logan, Charles and the girl to dinner. Seeing as what the family looked like, I did wonder how things would develop and my hypothesis was borne out, as far as the family was concerned.<br/><br/>Back to the topic of emotion in this film (as a viewer response)...it's delivered. Near the end of the film, there's a scene where Logan enters the fray. Whilst it didn't fill me with joy, it was pleasurable, which is unusual in these kinds of Hollywood superhero or action movies where they aim to produce this feeling in you...but fail. The last scene featuring Logan also produced an emotional response in me, of a different kind. Again, the contrast with ""Star Wars: The force awakens"" is marked, where the scene designed to produce that feeling in you failed to deliver it, again.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous observations:<br/><br/>* A Johnny Cash song opens the closing credits. For a moment I thought that the song was ""A boy named Sue""...which would have totally spoiled the moment! Firstly, I'm not that familiar with Cash's music, but I did realise that I knew the song that he was actually singing (vaguely). Interestingly, the credits list the song's writer as ""John R. Cash"" and the performer as ""Johnny Cash""! Also interesting was hearing the line, perhaps for the first time, concerning what the singer was kicking against...I had heard it before with regard to Australian alternative artist Nick Cave...but looking up that phrase now on Wikipedia, it seems that perhaps both Cash and Cave were referencing a bible quotation, surprisingly, rather than it being a case of Cave referencing Cash. Just looked up the name of the song that Cash sings in the end credits, ""The man comes around""...it mentions that Cave actually sang on that Cash album of cover songs!<br/><br/>* I have no idea how or if this film differs to any comic book treatment of the life of Logan. Whatever the case, I do like how this film deals with his story.<br/><br/>* It's possible that the Lateline interview has Jackman mentioning that he wanted this film to be rated ""R"", for artistic reasons. Here in Australia, it has an MA15+ rating, which means that children under 15 years of age can't see the film except with an adult accompanying them. Interestingly, the ""R"" rating which this film gets in the US means that children under the age of 17 can't see the film, except with an adult accompanying them. As for this violence, the film does get quite bloody but doesn't reach the point of requiring the next restriction in Australian ratings, ""R"", for people 18 years of age or older. Not even being accompanied by an adult would allow somebody of under the age of 18 to be able to view such a film.<br/><br/>In closing, I appreciated the sombre, gritty nature of this film and the lack of the previous instalments' risible elements, such as bizarre mutant abilities (like controlling the weather, ffs!)."
"andreas-biehl","4","3","8","9 March 2017"," A highly anticipated but disappointing adaptation
","Looking forward to a ""back to the roots"" movie after the disaster that ""The Wolverine"" was, the emotional curve watching this latest installment of the franchise went from anticipation to shock to utter boredom.<br/><br/>A story-line as simplistic as could be is tried to be made more interesting by a lot of gory elements - decapitations, severed limbs and exploding body parts to name just a few. This is NOT a movie to watch with your kid or teenager. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and a great Dafne Keen do their best to keep the viewers interested but in the end can't hide the shortcomings in editing and storytelling of this movie. As much as I love the X-man series, this is not the send-off I would have wished Hugh Jackman to get. He can do and deserved so much more. Spare yourself the time (close to 3 hrs) and money for a cinema visit and rather wait for a streaming if you have to watch it."
"arnieiam","Null","3","8","9 March 2017"," The last film with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine just happens to be a borefest
","Look I'm not trying to be non-conformist here. It seem's like I've been crapping on every X-Men film since the 3rd one. However there are actual good things to say about this film. The acting and the script are really good, and the tone is actually pretty consistent here. Its also very nice to finally see a Wolverine film where there there is a good amount of blood.<br/><br/>But for every scene where Wolverine hacks away at the bad guys does it have to be filled in with 40 mins of snail paced scenes? There are so many scenes of just... talking and... driving and...drinking and... pill popping and... sleeping and driving and talking DEAR LORD! I know this is supposed to be a gritty, almost western like film based off the Old Man Logan comic where its more about the character arc than saving the world but... no that's still no excuse. The studio threw a budget into this and this is Hugh Jackman's last outing as the character, it could've done better.<br/><br/>The plot could've been better. It could've been about Wolverine renouncing the use of his claws (just like Old Man Logan) but something from his past comes back to haunt him and he must fix this before his time runs out and in the process hacks away at some armour-clad gunmen. Instead we get a weird Last of Us ripoff mixed in with a road trip movie where Wolverine, the badass mind you, is a baby-sitter and nurse. <br/><br/>And the villains suck by the way. The first one is played by the guy from Narcos, and I don't remember the character's name at all that's how forgettable he was. He didn't really do anything menacing. The second is the first one's boss. A scientist who just happens to make stuff happen with little to no explanation. There is a huge bit of exposition regarding the second villain and in essence the film's premise but it was all condensed into one throw-away line. <br/><br/>Let me compare this to another R-rated superhero film with a brooding protagonist which also kick-started the Marvel boom: Blade. I remember there were actually a lot of quiet slow paced scenes. But why do I like that film way more? Well actually even the slow paced scenes served a purpose, they weren't filler. The protagonist was consistently badass and stoic and had a mission from the beginning and wasn't thrust into a situation. The villain was a lot of fun. The movie had a lot of atmosphere and world building. And most of all, every character tried to be pro-active.<br/><br/>I'm sorry you had to read this but this is film. It's subjective. I understand there are some emotions attached to this as Hugh Jackman will say goodbye to this character and I think X-Men will start fresh. But take off those goggles and watch it as just a film and you will see just how boring it is. Hey at least that opener with Deadpool was fun."
"joshteggert","9","3","8","9 March 2017"," Amazingly gritty, full of gore and shamelessly crude, but at its core 'Logan' is all about the characters
","After 17 years in his iconic role as Wolverine, Hugh Jackman's time in the X-Men universe is at an end. The fan favourite receives the perfect send-off in 'Logan', standing as one of the best, if not THE best film of the franchise. It demonstrates further the point made initially by 'Deadpool' that the superhero genre can benefit immensely if they take the risk of a more mature approach to comic book films. Moreover, 'Logan' succeeds in being distanced from the archetypal ""city/planet/love interest in danger"" monotony of other modern superhero flicks, showcasing a much more personally captivating foundation for the scenario of the film.<br/><br/>Beginning at the Mexican border, Wolverine (going by his original name of James Hewlett) is forced out of retirement to safeguard a young girl, Laura (Dafne Keen) who is the first mutant to emerge in years. Incentivised by his lifelong friend, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), whom he now also cares for in his old age, the three venture north to Canada to save Laura from some dark forces.<br/><br/>Wolverine is finally illustrated in his true colours (yet ironically still excluding his classic yellow and blue suit seen in the original writings); 'Logan' is gritty, full of gore and shamelessly crude, everything that this character should have been from the start. Watching him tear through his enemies with a 15 rating is a wholly fulfilling display, reaching new heights in the franchise with the blend of grounded realism and awesome action sets. Alongside this however, 'Logan' also conveys the Canadian's inner turmoil and self-loathing better than any previous instalment. It never holds back: from a terrifying rampage by the titular character, to poignant moments exploring his alcoholism and unwillingness to be the hero, 'Logan' is unhinged in all aspects. It can only be questioned why he hasn't been seen in this way before.<br/><br/>The setting is mesmerising - the environments mirroring how stripped down the concept of the film is. Plus, certain desert car chases feel like sequences from the 'Mad Max' series, filmed expertly and going full-throttle with the higher age rating. But at its core, 'Logan' is all about the characters. Jackman provides us with a career highlight, absolutely entrancing as the 'Old Man' Logan (reference intended). Stewart is enticing as the deteriorating Professor X, but it is Dafne Keen who is most alluring. Being her first film, it is amazing the amount of conviction she expresses in her mostly speechless (but by no means silent) performance. She herself more than compensates for the expendable villains and the predictable nature of their scheme, which is 'Logan's principal weakness, despite the outcome of it enhancing the emotional impact in the final sequence.<br/><br/>The previous mishaps of the Wolverine series are ratified in this truly emotional and overall electrifying final chapter, and as 'Logan' is also Stewart's final outing, both him and Jackman end on a series high, a fitting end to their long and commendable run in their respective roles."

"hcarljohan","9","3","8","6 March 2017"," An incredible achievement
","This is one of the best superhero movies that I have ever seen, and the reason for this is because it is a great film that just happens to have superheroes in it. The Dark Knight was a crime drama with Batman in it, The Winter Soldier was a spy thriller with Captain America in it and now Logan is a modern western with Wolverine in it. <br/><br/>Logan is also a great example of what you can get when you let artists be artists, and the studio can sit in the corner doing nothing except promoting the film. Clearly James Mangold was given leeway to execute his dark, slow-paced and gritty vision of a final chapter to Logan's story, and man does it work well. The impact of the R rating during the action scenes is felt and lends way more intensity and realism than any of the other Wolverine action scenes could ever hope to accomplish without showing any blood or guts. <br/><br/>The real reason Logan is so fantastic though is the story. I can't remember the last time a superhero movie left me this emotionally devastated, in fact I don't think it's ever happened. I was so invested in the events and the characters, thanks in no small part to the amazing performances. If this truly are the last performances of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart as these characters then I would be very happy with that cause I can't imagine how they could ever top the amazing performances they both handed in here. I would actually want for them both to be nominated for Oscars at the end of this year although there is unfortunately no chance of that happening.<br/><br/>Logan is not a movie for the faint-of-heart. It is violent, dark, depressing, bleak and really slow-paced for a superhero movie. But unlike the recent DC movies where those things were implemented just for the hell of it, here it serves the story in a meaningful way which is the reason it pays of so beautifully. I can recommend this movie to anyone who think they can handle the tone and the emotional gutpunch it packs. As it stands it is easily one of the best superhero movies ever, and it is precisely because it's not like any other superhero movie, it's just a great overall film."

","""Logan"" is the fierce and touching elegy of the hero's redemption. ""Logan"" is amazing. The movie is bloody, inspired, and sublime. Hugh Jackman is powerful and nuanced. As the aging and fading Logan, Jackman remains the sinuous beast, but with boldly reinvented vulnerability. Newcomer Dafne Keen with her innocent wide eyes possesses the child's truth. She is a star. Director and writer James Mangold's hero's journey moves us, and will make you cry. I read an interview with Hugh about his last incarnation as Logan after being him for 17 years. He said that he will miss Logan as a best part of himself. Jackman is transcendent in ""Logan"". <br/><br/>""Logan"" is set in 2029. Mutants like Logan are no longer—possibly having been exterminated in this future. Logan is aging and grayed; his powers are fading. He heals much slower—the bullets and his retracting Adamantium claws are bloody and hurt. He is no longer the hero he once was. He is a limo driver, who drinks way too much. Logan is dying, and faces his own mortality. <br/><br/>He and his beloved mentor Charles, played by powerful Patrick Stewart, are among the remaining Mutants. 90-old Charles was the most powerful telepath is a hallowed shell, now bed ridden suffering mind altering seizures and dementia. Logan along with Mutant albino Caliban, played by compassionate Stephen Merchant, care for Charles. Perhaps, there is another Mutant still out there? <br/><br/>Charles tells Logan that he is ""A disappointment..."" Logan has lost his purpose. Logan struggles with who he has become—something I can empathize. <br/><br/>""Logan"" opens in stark tone. Thugs wake sleeping Logan while stealing the rims from his limousine. The thieves dismiss his warnings. Though riddled with bullets, Logan slashes and maims with skilled savage rage. ""Logan"" has the feel of ""The Road Warrior"" or ""Unforgiven"". Mangold even does homage to ""Shane"". Those stories were about the redemption of the nihilist or anti-hero; however, Mangold's Logan profoundly fights for love. After having a beautiful dinner with a family they helped, Charles tells Logan, ""This is what life looks like""<br/><br/>The hauntingly calm Pierce with eerie mechanical hand played by charismatic strong Boyd Holbrook, tracks down Logan in El Paso asking him for information about some 'missing property'. Pierce is an agent for Transigen Corporation that does unspeakable experimentation with Mutants. Logan has no idea, until she finds him.<br/><br/>She is wide eyed and silent little girl Laura—the other Mutant. Logan and Charles must take Laura to North Dakota so that she can find sanctuary with other young Mutants across the border in Canada. Charles tells Logan, ""She's like you she's very much like you."" Pierce and his mercenaries are relentless and find Logan, Charles, and Laura at their refuge. Laura announces her presence unleashing her merciless fury upon her enemies. She has great agility and strength, also possessing Logan's Adamantium claws and warrior skills. Keen and Jackman are spectacular battling together against their underestimating opponents. Initially, Charles and Logan suspect Laura may be a clone of Logan. <br/><br/>In an eloquent touch Logan discovers Laura is a fan of the ""X-Men"" comics and Wolverine. He dismisses telling her most of the stories are ""bullsh**"". Meanwhile, a figure from the past Dr. Rice played by the reserved evil Richard E. Grant as the head of Transigen is about to unleash his most ferocious creation. <br/><br/>Logan becomes Laura's protector; she is like family, like blood. She needs him to be her hero. Charles reminds Logan of what we already knew. His fading powers and claws aside, what makes Logan the hero, is the man he is. He just needs to remember that, and reclaim himself. This fight is different now: Logan fights for love. <br/><br/>In ""Logan"" the battles are fierce, vicious and costly. Before the climactic battle, Laura and Logan share. Logan says that everyone he ever loved gets hurt. He has hurt people. Laura says, ""I hurt people, too Bad people."" Logan confides, ""You are going to have to live with that, too."" <br/><br/>Jackman and Keen are the beating hearts of ""Logan"". Jackman's Logan tragically weeps over his loss; Keen's Laura holds his bloody hand with her own. Keen's closing moments as little Laura speaks to our very humanity. Jackman as Logan poignantly says, ""So this is what it feels like"" <br/><br/>The hero deserves to find his own measure of peace and love at the end of his journey. We honor this as well, because we deserve the same. ""Logan"" is the hero story of amazing grace and power. It is one of the best. Thank you, Hugh Jackman for being our hero."

The Wolverine: Magneto & Charles want Logan's help.<br/><br/>2023? Off-screen: Magneto gives Logan his metal claws back, to fight the Sentinels.<br/><br/>2023 DOFP: Logan is 1 of the last few surviving mutants, they are being hunted by Trask's sentinels. These sentinels use Mystique's DNA to adapt & kill mutants. They kill people they think may have mutant children in the future. Logan goes back in time to 1973.<br/><br/>The New Timeline:<br/><br/>1973 DOFP & Origins: Logan ""officially"" meets Charles & Hank.<br/><br/>1973 DOFP: Mystique saves the president & is never caught.<br/><br/>1973 DOFP: Logan gets rescued from drowning by Mystique.<br/><br/>1973-1983 Off-screen: Logan gets Adamantium skeleton & claws & amnesia from Stryker at Alkali Lake. It's unknown when this happens.<br/><br/>1981: 2nd half of Orgins: Never happens, no Deadpool or Stryker.<br/><br/>1983 X-Men Apocolyse: Jean frees Logan from Styker & gives him back a few memories. Logans DNA is used to make X-23.<br/><br/>2000 X-Men 1: Most of these events did happen, according to Logan movie. He still has the same dog tag & fights Magneto in NY.<br/><br/>2003 X-Men 2: Most of these events probably don't happen.<br/><br/>2006 X-Men Last stand: Never happens, Logan never kills Jean.<br/><br/>2013 The Wolverine: Logan isn't depressed & never kills Jean, but he does have his Samurai sword in the Logan movie. Don't know why!<br/><br/>2016: Deadpool happens!<br/><br/>2023: DOFP: Logan is slowly aging & happily teaching History at Charles School For Gifted Youngsters. No more mutants are being born. Why? Because Dr. Rice's corn syrup has suppressed the mutant gene.<br/><br/>2027ish: LOGAN: Charles is suffering from seizures & brain problems & accidentally kills some X-Men at his school.<br/><br/>2029 LOGAN: Logan is the only one who Charles can't accidentally kill, so he is taking care of Charles trying to buy a boat to sail to the middle of the Ocean to keep the world safe from Charles.<br/><br/>2029: LOGAN: Since Logan watched some X-Men die, he is depressed & wants to die. (He felt the same way in the original time-line back in 2013.)<br/><br/>2029 LOGAN: The adamantium has been in Logan's body for 50 years(?) & it's slowly killing him.<br/><br/>2029 LOGAN: Logan dies.<br/><br/>It's interesting that in both time-lines after Logan watches his fellow X-men die, he gets depressed and wants to die. Also in the original 2023, even though Logan isn't really aging, in the new time-line he ages drastically during those 6 years to get to the sickly state he is in by 2029. Why does he age so quickly in those 6 years?<br/><br/>In the old time-line Logan has Adamantium in his body from 1981, until 2013, he loses his metal claws but still has metal elsewhere in his body. Then sometime before 2023, Magneto puts metal back on his claws. In those 42 years Logan barely feels the affects of the adamantium. Why? Perhaps having his metal claws out for almost a decade decreased the affects of the metal poisoning? We don't know.<br/><br/>In the new time-line, we don't know when Logan got the adamantium, we just know he finally escaped in 1983. So it could be possible that it happened anytime between 1973 & 1983. Which means that it's possible that in this new time-line Logan has been living with adamantium poisoning his body for an extra ten years! Fast forward to 2023 where we see an aging Logan as a history teacher. We are never told if he notices a difference in his body. Is he slower? Does he notices when he wakes up in his older body that he has scars & doesn't have the same stamina he used to? We don't know.<br/><br/>We just know that by 2029 Logan's regenerative abilities have been declining for sometime. It is very likely that in the new time-line Logan has actually had his adamantium in his body for over 56 years, instead of the original 42. If you didn't catch why, let me explain...<br/><br/>It is possible that when Logan saved everyone in Days Of Futures Past, he unknowingly set off a chain of events, that caused him to get his adamantium implants nearly 10 years sooner, which in turn cut off almost a decade of his life. This causes him to age rapidly in his last 10 years and die in 2029, instead of what might have been 2039, had he never altered the past. That is of course, assuming Trask's sentinels hadn't killed.<br/><br/>Which means that even though Logan changes the past, the future still finds it's way to destruction. In both time-lines the X-Men still die, the mutants never get treated as equals & they still become extinct. Also Logan still gets weary of watching his friends die and longs for death. His act of changing the past, may have prevented a darker future, but it only gave his friends an extra 10 to 30 years of life. In the end all that was accomplished was that Logan traded years of his own life, so that his friends could live longer."
"ctrilling","7","3","8","5 March 2017"," A breath of fresh air, but far from a masterpiece
","I've wanted a rated R wolverine movie since X2. This film certainly wet the appetite for R-rated wolverine violence. I applaud the performances and Fox for finally taking the plunge after a decade. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie as good as it is, is not the masterpiece fanboys are heralding it as. I like the movie and am not trying to be overtly critical, but its certainly not flawless. <br/><br/>One, it was a missed opportunity by Mangold not to wait on the slashing and dashing. There was a missed opportunity to ratchet up the tension to a moment that could have felt more earned for the claws. Instead they dish it out in the first two minutes. A perfect example of this is the X2 mansion scene. The tension is boiling and the payoff of wolverine's fury is felt and a bit more awesome, even with the PG-13 rating. <br/><br/>The second biggest mistake of the film was the X-24. It added nothing to the narrative of the film and I think was its biggest misstep. The film didn't need a mutant bad guy and we have seen wolverine face off against someone similar to himself on multiple occasions. This felt like the Deadpool scene in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, or the Silver Samurai in The Wolverine. It was unnecessary and for me, took me out of the real world that had been already established. <br/><br/>The movie loses its steam in the third act and the intrigue in where the story is headed dwindles. Its a weak third act rather with no narrative surprises and little character development. <br/><br/>Lastly, the film would have benefited from a more involved score to ratchet up the tension and the emotional stakes. I don't know why Hollywood has consistently chosen the minimalist approach to scores. There is a hint of one in a few scenes at the end, but its quickly drowned out by the action and violence.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was really good. Its new, its refreshing and its unlike anything we've seen yet in the superhero genre. Kudos to the film making team. But just because its unique does not automatically make it a classic. More like a welcomed step in the right direction."

Then I saw all these reviews praising this as a great film, and I thought I might like it.<br/><br/>After seeing it, I don't see what all the hype was about. Does making a movie dark and depressing make it good? Personally I didn't need to see Wolverine Professor X all washed up, old and sick. Sure, it's ""real"", but I don't go to a super hero movie to see that kind of thing.<br/><br/>There was some great action, and it was fun to see Wolverine not held back by a PG-13 rating, but there were too many plot holes and things that were inconsistent with previous things established about Wolverine. I did like what they did with the comic book references though.<br/><br/>Ultimately it was just OK, and ranks somewhere in the middle of all X-Men movies for me. <br/><br/>It's sad when the best part of the movie was the Deadpool teaser before it."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","3","8","3 March 2017"," A Very Well Made Redemption Story
","Logan hits its audience with the hardened fist of a seasoned prizefighter in his last match. The feeling is elating, intense and at times too brutal to bare. At once the film feels like a last hurrah and the culmination of every claw, every jab and every wound the Wolverine has received or doled out over nine films. Embodied in its solitary, grizzled and tired titular character however is an uncommon weight. Movies like this have been made before, that much is obvious - and while it's easy to predict Logan's every plot-point to a T, rarely has a movie like this been bolstered by so much, already laid cultural cache. In that specific regard, this latest X-Men movie (2000-Present) is a resounding success.<br/><br/>Logan takes place in a distant future (we think), where all of mutant kind has been wiped out (we think) except for a few unfortunate souls. Among them is Logan (Jackman) who at this point works as a part-time limousine driver and full-time caretaker for the ailing Professor X (Stewart). Apparently something serious happened back at Xavier's School, forcing the nigh untouchable Professor to take refuge in a hollowed out water tower south of the border. Only the Wolverine and a mutant named Caliban (Merchant) are there to witness his slow slip into senility. Things however take a sudden turn, when a desperate nurse (Rodriguez) tasks Logan and his compatriots with taking care of a very special little girl; a girl who just may hold the key to Logan's ultimate redemption.<br/><br/>Redemption is an ongoing theme in this film, not just for Logan but seemingly for everyone involved. Logan takes care of the aging professor not out of compassion it would seem, but rather as a form of penance for regrets of the past. Likewise, Caliban, Xavier and even the nurse are trying their best to right past wrongs and ultimately put a lot of their stake on the mute and instinctual Laura (Keen).<br/><br/>She comes, of course, with a dark and complicated past which is likely to put fans of the comics in a tizzy of anticipation. Those not in the know however will see much fault in the myriad of plot details that, on their face, are as patently ridiculous and as they are cloyingly persistent. Anyone who has ever listened to more than five minutes of conspiracy theory radio or knows anything about the Birch Society will be rolling their eyes as the big baddie comes in to explain his complicated web of intrigue.<br/><br/>Yet what makes Logan so refreshing, so new, and ultimately worth a recommendation is its fidelity to story and character. Aspects of characters' powers, an all-important fixture in superhero films, could just as well be replaced by guns or samurai swords. The things this film actually cares about - the internal conflicts, the understated pacing, etc., exist and persist regardless of how many times Logan bares his claws or X reads people's minds. There are frantic chases and grizzly fight scenes, sure, but they're just icing when compared to Logan's gradual shift from a man of solitude to a man of compassion.<br/><br/>This of course frees up the movie to move at a much slower pace than its briskly-paced predecessors. There are a handful of moments where the movie just seems to stop and smell the fertilizer. These moments don't so much serve the plot in expected and slavish ways, but rather gently bends to the film's weighty themes, in a way feels like a reward for sticking with the X-Men for so long. And while it's not necessary to know everything about the other films to enjoy Logan, those who quite literally grew up with the character well get everything they ever dreamed of and more.<br/><br/>This includes of course, a hard R rating that enamored fans will likely point to as decisive proof that these kinds of movies are more than just entertaining trifles. And yes it's true while DC movies like Batman Vs. Butthead (2016) folded under the pretentious smuggery of fanboys screaming ""look mom comic books can be smart too!"" Logan actually takes that same ball and runs away with it.<br/><br/>Kinda like when critics reference old movies no one has seen! Yet I wouldn't be so fast to mark Logan as the best comic book movie since The Dark Knight (2008). We have come to a point in the genre where shared universes and constant sequels, prequels, spinoffs and post-modern Deadpool (2016)-like meta-commentaries have yielded a nearly closed ecosystem. One in which those outside of the hype may not get some or even most out of the story. Within that context, those on the outside will simply see a pulpy, competently made if ultra-violent redemption story that overstates its importance with one too many Shane (1953) references.<br/><br/>In today's throwaway culture finding a comic book movie this outwardly risky is actually quite a surprise. It antes up most of its cultural stockpile and bets big on a forcefully adult story, then bets big on fan's goodwill and patience. What results is a movie that doesn't ""transcend (the) comic-book genre,"" as USA Today so carelessly asserts but rather transforms the genre in new and exciting ways. I'm anxious to see where this leads and worried the inherent goofiness of the genre will be wiped away completely like so much Spider-Man 3 (2007). For now though I'll just say Logan is worth a look and keep my sense of dread to myself."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Logan"" (2017) is, to put it simply - the best ""X-Men"" movie I've ever seen (and i saw them all). This is not as much as ""X-Men"" movie, and it doesn't even feel as a third part in its own ""Wolverine"" series - ""Logan"" is a standalone movie, which you can safely see even if your first and the last seen ""X-Men"" series movie was the first X-Men (2000). From start till finish, it is a blast. <br/><br/>Now i'm not a huge fan of ""X-Men"" series, but i saw and enjoyed all of them. Strangely, when watching ""Logan"", i barely and even very hardly remembered that i have seen first two movies - they were so forgettable. But after credits of this movie started to roll i was sure - i won't forget this movie for sure.<br/><br/>This is a superhero movie for those who think that all Marvel studio movies are to formulaic and plays it to safe. This is a superhero movie for those who think that DC movies aren't to focused and are all over the map. This is a superhero movie for those who lost their track of a countless of ""X-Men"" sequels / prequels / spin offs / reboots who works as a prequel and sequel ... wait what? ""Logan"" is arguably the best superhero movie i saw since the ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. It is not as epic as ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, not to mention all other superhero movies in a market. This is a bloody, gritty, realistic, down to earth approach to this ""genre"" and so involving that at running time 2 h 15 min i was involved from the first minute till the closing scene (and it is a great, great scene). Acting by all involved were great, with Hugh Jackman giving one of the best performances of his carrier (seriously). ""Logan"" shows very clearly and without turning camera away of what happens when Wolverine claws hits the human flesh - it doesn't look so ""superhero cool"" anymore - and i loved it. There is no doubt of why this is an R rated movie. The story itself kinda reminded me of ""The Last of Us"" - it is that simple yet powerful tale. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Logan"" is a blast. This is a superhero movie like i haven't seen before, even in ""The Dark Knight"" movies but i'm not saying its better - no, those were better but i'm still giving this movie a 10/10 - please, 20th Century Fox - bring this quality movies more often, do not go in a formulaic and safe road, bring us something different, fresh and bold. ""Logan"" is the best movies of the early 2017 so far."
"wmplatt","8","3","8","3 March 2017"," 'Logan' Is Not Your Typical Superhero Movie
","Expectations are more often than not the critical factor in judging the success of a cinematic experience. Walking into a movie with high, or particular, expectations can often lead to disappointment when it fails to deliver. On the other hand, some of the greatest movie experiences have come simply from not knowing what to expect.<br/><br/>Marvel's newest blockbuster ""Logan,"" and the final chapter in the ""Wolverine"" saga, epitomizes the importance of audience expectations because it breaks so sharply from the standard of comic book movies. Audiences expecting to see the gratuitous action, cosmic villains, and invincible superheroes of previous ""Wolverine"" films may be disappointed. Where ""Logan"" unexpectedly succeeds, though, is in sublime character development.<br/><br/>To be fair, ""Logan"" does have its share of graphic violence, but these sequences take a backseat to the characters themselves. Director James Mangold takes us farther than ever before in his attempts to humanize the iconic heroes of our childhoods. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the leader of the X-Men, suffers from Alzheimer's disease, a case made much more severe because of the incredible psychic powers he wields. Sporadic seizures cause him to unleash paralytic waves of psychic energy that can injure, and even kill, the very people that he once championed so mightily.<br/><br/>Logan (Hugh Jackman) himself is a shell of his former animalistic glory. Age and a vaguely described illness have atrophied his healing powers. Nor do his adamantium claws have the same pop they once had; at one point, he literally has to pull his claws from his knuckles to full extension. Perhaps the most telling detail of his deterioration is his gasping wheezes as he runs through a forest, a scene that epitomized his rage and prowess in previous films.<br/><br/>Even the minor role of the mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant) is a depiction of humanized imperfection. Caliban is an albino whose sensitive skin cannot endure direct sunlight. Far from being a mutant deficiency, Caliban's disease shows that mutants remain, at their core, offshoots of humanity, and are susceptible to the same flaws and unfortunate determinations of fate and chance as the rest of us.<br/><br/>The three make a flawed and unlikely trio in a world that is largely removed of mutant populations. The human-mutant wars seem to be over, and Logan's sole concerns are the safety and caretaking of his companions. This, of course, is interrupted by the arrival of Laura (Dafne Keen), a deceptively innocent-looking girl who is pursued by military and government bad-guys Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). The villains are largely underwhelming, with cool-looking but ultimately useless mechanical hands, and typical villainous egomania. That's okay, though, because the story was never really about them; ""Logan"" is first and foremost a revelation of the limitations of our heroes against the backdrop of our expectations for them.<br/><br/>Mangold has crafted a terrific experience in ""Logan"" filled with a number of poignant and dramatic moments. The pacing does plod at times, but more than makes up for it with well-placed and effective action sequences that reminisce Wolverine's claw-slicing heyday. There is a real and visceral enjoyment in watching him literally shred his enemies to pieces, but these moments are not what defines the movie. These moments are simply contrast to the aging, diminished hero who occupies the rest of the screen time.<br/><br/>Fans of Marvel, and of the superhero genre, will likely come expecting the gore and violence that the film's R-rating promises. They won't be disappointed, but make no mistake. These are not the invincible, perfect superheroes of traditional comic book movies. There is no grand, cosmic enemy to stand against. Audiences should temper such expectations with the understanding that these are flawed and imperfect people. Just like us, their greatest battles are waged internally, against themselves. And yet, somehow, that makes their heroism that much more heroic."

","One cannot help but feel a tinge of sadness when the end credits role for this movie. The realization that we will never get to see Hugh Jackman in this role again will set in when the screen fades for the final time on the role that Hugh Jackman has made so iconic over the years. What also pains me is the fact that we will never see Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's wolverine pair up on screen. Hugh Jackman was always the perfect choice to play the Wolverine and it will be hard for anyone to fill out those shoes. The movie itself though might not be perfect or novel, the performances by the cast are excellent. Sad to see Professor X go too. The violence in the movie was graphic but it wasn't a distraction, it helped build up the tension. Added to the fact that Logan cannot heal as quickly as he used to, every action sequence adds an element of vulnerability to his character. Hugh Jackman as always has acted very well and I feel that he should be felicitated for this effort. For die hard X-MEN fans this movie is a must see. It might be a little confusing for people who haven't been following the series but on its own as well it is a powerful movie."
"rogerdarlington","Null","3","8","3 March 2017"," One of the best in the franchise
","This is the ninth movie in the X-Men franchise (I've seen them all) and the third of the stand-alone ""Wolverine"" films, but this really is an X-Men movie like no other. In characterisation, narrative, location and style, it stands apart but is entirely consistent with the others and brings the story to a most satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>Set in 2029 when mutants are all but extinct and located in a bleached terrain on the Tex-Mex border, we find adamantium-clawed Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackson) and wheelchair-bound Charlers Xavier aka Professor X (Patrick Stewart) as we've never seen them before: fragile, failing, vulnerable and ultimately in terminal decline. In thespian terms, this raises the bar for both Jackman and Stewart who are able to deliver more nuanced performances than one usually finds in super-hero movies. They are being chased by the bad guys from Transigen in a fleet of heavy, black vehicles commanded by a metal-armed cyborg, so this is part a road movie (with elements of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and part an elegiac western (with echoes of ""Unforgiven"" and clips from ""Shane"").<br/><br/>But this is the most viscerally violent and outright bloody X-Men work of them all with perforated chests and rolling heads, not just from Wolverine and X-24 but also from 11 year old girl mutant Laura/X-23 (played amazingly by English-Spanish child actress Dafne Keen).<br/><br/>It's 17 years since we first met the X-Men on the big screen and Jackman as Wolverine has appeared in them all. The three stand-alone Wolverine films have been ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009), ""The Wolverine"" (2013) and now (2017) ""Logan"" (note the human name). James Mangold directed the last two and this time originated the story and co-wrote the screenplay and he can be proud of a truly exciting and entertaining piece of work that is one of the very best in the franchise. Although possibly a little too long, ""Logan"" opens strongly, it is well paced, and the ending is poignant yet uplifting.

And yell at those who don't like this movie.<br/><br/>A title of movie decide the main concept about movie. It is Logan not Wolverine. So we know this is a story about Logan not wolverine. This is not a heroic story, this is a story about one man.<br/><br/>What we know about Logan. For me, it is best closer in X-Men. If anything is wrong just call Wolverine. He is unwilling but he will help you clean up all mess. He is the only guy to remember all the story from X-Men to X-Men: Apocalypse. He is the guy watch X-Men rise and down.<br/><br/>In this story. There is no more mutant but himself and Charles Xavier. Charles is sick and was lock by Logan. Cause he is sick and lose ability to control his power.<br/><br/>Like road film, they take ride from south to north. Charles, Logan and Laura. Grandpa, father and daughter. When Charles talking about Logan is one of his student. Logan's face look a little awkward. Cause they are family. You always feel a little uncomfortable when your parent talking about you. Logan is a disobedient but most reliable.<br/><br/>When Logan lose Charles. He break down. He has no way to express his angry and his sorrow. The only way he can do it wave the shovel. We know Charles important to him. We know that is a person will do when he lose his father, his mentor.<br/><br/>In the end we say goodbye with Logan. When Laura left she move the cross. In the beginning I thought it is not let other people find his tomb. But when I realize she move the cross so that it look like a X. It is X for X-Men. It is X for mutant. It is X for Wolverine. <br/><br/>We know Laura and her friend might bring us new story, new X-Men. but for those character company with us for so many years we need to say goodbye.<br/><br/>The song in the end. It is a song for good bye from Logan."

","After I left the Theater, after all the emotions I experienced, I could think if but one word to describe what I had just seen: Phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. I cannot say enough good about this movie. Logan is perfect. If you are on the fence, go see it. Just do it. No movie is without sin, and there were a few things in Logan that didn't make too much sense, and a couple of plot holes, but this does not detract from what the film is attempting to do. I generally measure a movie's success by one parameter: Did it accomplish what was intended to be accomplished? That is why I give Logan 10/10. You feel all the emotions it wants you to feel when it wants you to feel them. Heck, this is a rare modern movie that actually succeeds in making you FEEL. I haven't cried in many movies, but Logan certainly got a few tears out of me. There are several heartbreaking scenes in here and the last one was just too much. Right from the opening scene, you get a sense of what kind of movie you are in for, as Logan tries to stop some thugs from stealing the wheels off his car and is shot by a shotgun. In any other Xmen movie, that guy would have instantly been toast. But, with a decreasing healing factor, Logan goes down and stays there for about 30 seconds. If you are a fan of the character, this is absolutely heartbreaking to see. He then gets up (slowly) and gets smacked around by these guys as he slowly kills them, then finally goes rage mode to finish them off, having sustained several injuries that don't seem to be healing too quickly. And the killing is extremely violent. Claws going through heads, blood spurting everywhere, arms and legs being chopped off, the whole shebang. It is, in my mind, the perfect way to start this movie, and the ending is just as perfect. Some minor disclaimers for those with children: This movie is rated R for a reason. I DO NOT recommend this movie to small children at all. It deals with heavy, depressing themes, it is SUPER violent, is full of f-bombs, and shows a woman's breasts briefly. This is a mature, adult movie. Know your kids and what they can handle, and proceed with caution. That said, for those mature enough to handle the themes of Logan, it is unequivocally and triumphantly phenomenal."
"megadethdragoncrimson","10","3","8","3 March 2017"," A Game Changer for The Genre
","My short review: <br/><br/>""Logan"" transcends the confines of the superhero genre by embracing a gritty stripped- down approach and tone that pays homage to classic Westerns in the backdrop of a dystopian future that in turn transforms ""Logan"" from being just an ordinary comic book film to a film that elevates the bar for other films in the genre as well. It's part Neo-Noir, part Western all in the confines of a comic book film. In all honestly, it surpasses that genre. It's a spectacular piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Maybe The DCEU and MCU should look into this for certain properties because Fox has hit pay dirt."
"alex-klein2424","9","3","8","2 March 2017"," A Brutal Masterpiece
","I knew I was going to enjoy this movie because as you all know I am a huge comic book nerd but this time around enjoyed it not because of that, but because it was a stellar movie. Logan is now the bench mark that Marvel has to deal with when it comes to serious super hero movies. This is the Dark Knight for them and I know that is a bold statement but it needs to be made. Having this movie be rated R made it so much better, seeing Logan lose his mind and start swearing as he hits his car with a shovel is brilliant, as is seeing him slice and dice men like they are cheese. <br/><br/>James Mangold directs and writes what succeeds both as an serious drama with action peppered in, and a western. The year is 2029 and mutants are all but extinct. Logan lives on the Mexican border and honestly just go see the movie because the thrill of it all is not knowing what will happen next. Knowing my comics, this movie is loosely based on the comic Old Man Logan but only in title and location, the story is completely different so we are treated to what I hope is the future of comic book movies where original stories are told in lieu of adaptions of the source material To be clear, I love the adaptions but I also love not having to worry if it is staying true to the material and not once did I feel like I was checking boxes off of some comic I have in my closet.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman stated this is his last go as Wolverine so with the story being about an old man Logan, there is a poignancy to his performance that you can feel in every single scene. This is Jackman's movie through and through and if any superhero was more deserving of an Oscar nomination it would be him. Patrick Stewart also returns as an ailing Charles Xavier who is both hilarious and haunting as you can tell he is close to the end. The breakout star, as anticipated, was Dafne Keen, who plays Laura, aka X-23, aka Wolverine's clone/daughter. She is ferocious and innocent and better be in more movies. <br/><br/>The score and the cinematography also stand out as well as western type music plays to wide shots of desolate wastelands and old decrepit locations. I can't stress enough how professional this movie looked in terms of a comic book movie. The action was warranted and earned every time, character work was the main focus. It is truly a display of substance over style, but the style is also beautiful. <br/><br/>If you have followed Hugh Jackman's X-Men career this movie is for you. If you are a fan of super hero movies, westerns, or great movies, this is the one for you. It's the perfect movie to see twice or you could also see it once and then buy it later on Blu-Ray. Other great ways to view this movie would be to see with friends, family, or neighbors, but I don't recommend this movie to my worst enemy because he or she doesn't deserve this caliber of incredible."

","Logan was released in 2017 and was directed by James Mangold. The film is a new instalment in the X-Men universe and is the final film starring the centre characters of Logan (Wolverine) and Charles Xavier, showing them tasked with protecting a young girl.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is that it doesn't feel like your average superhero movie (evident from the trailers) and is instead a very human story, hence the title going for Wolverine's human name of 'Logan'. Over time we've seen people's expectations for comic book change quite drastically and we're in a period of time now where expectations are changing rapidly. However, this film bravely ignores the trends and goes for what it wants to be and I highly appreciate it for that.<br/><br/>To start off with, this movie does indeed have an R rating and is very brutal. I knew this was going to be something before I even saw it and I was kind of afraid whether or not this would be too big of a change from the previous X-Men films. Thankfully, the R rating felt necessary and required and if the film was PG-13 it would have nowhere near as much of an impact. The fact that more strong language is included too was another concern I had for it being too big of a change but it makes sense for the characters to use this language considering what stage they are at in their lives and didn't feel like it was there just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The main three characters of the film are brilliant; Hugh Jackman gives a great performance as Logan and also Patrick Stewart gave a unique, emotionally deep performance as Charles Xavier, showcasing a side to the character I never thought I'd see. Newcomer Dafne Keen was also very promising as the new character Laura Kinney. Showing these characters at the dark point in their lives made for an overall more emotionally involving story and makes them discover each other in a much deeper way than they ever had before and for once the main characters feel like a family instead of just a team. The way they all interact was amazing to see and adds up to the overall 'human' theme of the story.<br/><br/>What I probably loved the most about the film (like I mentioned just then) is how it was a human story, ignoring the trends other comic book movies are going for and being what it wants to be. It's also clear that this is a film not made solely for the money but one for the fans; you can tell they aren't adding things in simply for extra money (for example the film wasn't shot in 3D), there's no big beam in the sky for the characters to fight at the end and it also takes into consideration what films do for people in real-life too, as in the end credits it says that the film help supply thousands of jobs and it's amazing to see when a film goes the extra level with thought like that, especially nowadays when most movies are made for the money.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved how much thought was put into this film and the fact that it was what it wanted to be, especially for the time period of superhero movies that we're in at the moment. The main cast give brilliant performances and was a great send-off for the characters we know and love. I did have one or two problems with the film (which will be in my spoiler section), however they weren't enough to hold down the film in quality. Even if they don't continue to make superhero films like this in the future, we'll always have Logan.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"diand_","6","11","48","21 February 2017"," State of the Union
","This is the third and final installment of the Wolverine series and the tenth X-men movie. In a post-apocalyptic near-future no mutants have been born for some time. Professor X (or Charles Xavier) is seriously ill and dependent on medication. He lives with a weakened Logan (or Wolverine) and Caliban in a rundown factory near the US border in Mexico. Logan has a job as limo driver and smuggles prescription drugs to Mexico for Charles. Disillusioned, their ultimate dream (and last wish for Charles) is buying a camper or boat and make a final retreat.<br/><br/>James Mangold has a typical directorial style you can almost instantly recognize: Relatively long tracking shots, slow in tension building, meanwhile freeing the camera to explore the space beyond the characters. Rest assured however that the action scenes are fast-paced and on the firm side of the R-rating, a bit gory here and there. In my opinion the movie could have been cut by some minutes, as it is overlong.<br/><br/>Jackman and Stewart are well known, but the real revelation here is the kid Laura (Dafne Keen), with a stunning performance reminiscent of Jodie Foster in Scorsese's early works when she had about the same age. At the world premiere I attended she also stole several moments.<br/><br/>After 9/11 we saw an outburst of movies that directly or indirectly referenced the event. The ascent of the current US administration will be another such watershed moment where movies will directly or indirectly criticize new policies. Although this was shot before the election there are several eerie parallels in the script to the current themes in US society and politics: Disillusionment (simple wishes of Logan cannot be realized), availability of health care, illegal immigrants, border politics, Canada (not the US) as Eden, the promised land. Medical experimentation by US companies inside Mexico and most striking: the dreamers. There is a central theme throughout the movie about dreams and reality, made more poignant here by the reference to the X-Men comic books themselves.<br/><br/>Most of the time Marvel movies are too predictable and straightforward for me; this is (like and again unlike Deadpool) different. See it for yourself!"

","The violence in this movie is so graphic that it is truly disturbing. And the worst part is that some of this disgusting, graphic, violence is perpetrated by a child. What have we come come to in our society when we celebrate a pre-teen child slicing up and killing people with razor sharp claws in a film that is supposed to be entertaining. I have lost all respect for Hugh Jackman because he participated in this disgusting movie. Honestly, I do not understand how anyone could rate this movie above a 3. It should have been X rated for the child violence."
"ButterJuggets666","4","5","17","3 March 2017"," Meh
","May contain Spoilers!!!!! You have been Warned!!!<br/><br/>The Following rant comes from the green mind of a young novicebe afraid. 
Positives: I really liked how they treated the future in this film -- it's not so much a futuristic future, but more like the film makers did their homework and actually checked the news to see what the world might be like, and then only slightly did they tweak the futuristic elements to make a very present feeling film that could still be in a believable future. The whole arc of the original mutants was a bit touching and upon hindsight is quite a sign of the passing times. 
Organization: Not to be said of the visuals, the organization of certain plot elements of the film felt somewhat realistic though there were elements that felt tacked on. 
Half Positive/Half Negative: The realism was impressive but I have to wonder what ever happened to the days that an unrealistic movie could do well in theaters. 
Negatives(Because I like negatives.)
Predictability: Whereas I said before that the Organization was good -- it was also very obvious at parts and I can even remember guessing correctly how the movie was going to end before I even saw it -- because studios keep using the same tropes. 
R Rating: The Film ( at least to me) seemed like it shouldn't have been an R rated film it and felt more like that was forced to be that way because of ""Deadpool."" The one scene with exposed breasts was gratuitous and pointless only to show that the protagonist's career choice was poor and that the director had an R rating. The Cussing felt tacked on as if the characters knew that they were in an R rated movie and had permission to drop the F bomb any time they felt. The violence was at times interesting but at other times cartoonish (in a cringe fake way) for a film that comically derides the comics that it is based on. The violence was also not really explained in context of the other films -- though I guess you gotta earn that R rating. 
Characters: Hugh Jackman does well as usual as this character though certain points seem somewhat forced emotionally. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is excellent in his role as a crazy nearly bedridden old fart. Hugh Jackman does sort of OK as a green cartoon eyed junkie type character on Bath Salts. The girl is a good actress for a kid and she should get more work after this. There is also a really white guy in there too and he does stuff!!!
The Action: Watch a Loony Toons short and imagine inked on blood -- it will look much more realistic. BRING BACK BLOOD SPURTS Hollywood -- JEEZ!
The Ending: It attempts an emotional poignancy and a somewhat of a passing of the baton to a new generation thing but (to me at least) it was just as weakening as Logan's booze to the pacing of the story. 
Plot: Think along the lines of a Mutant version of the ""Muppet Movie"" with ""Smokey and the Bandit"" just with more F*#ks and imagine a Kermit the Frog flailing bloody swords at Buford T. Justice and a lot of boring waking up scenes. 
Tone: Toward the beginning of the film It felt tense as it should -- by the end of the film it felt like an odd mix of some action film merged with a ""Power Ranger"" episode. My suspension of disbelief was breached due to the children's action scenes. 
Antagonists: The antagonists seemed somewhat one noted, not much development when it came to them, and it felt tacked on at times in attempts to give the characters some sort of -- relation to the Wolverine? I dunno. Otherwise they felt like your typical muscle bound hatable die like fly storm troopers -- been there-- done that. This is an R rated film so instead of giving me that bull about redefining Wolverine for a new generation -- you better quit worrying about the kiddos (IN R RATED FILMS) and get more creative for the adults. Oh -- and I don't care if its just supposed to be a dumb ""Block Buster!"" -- make better, more creative, more entertaining, magical movies again -- you got the money!
Impressions: If your going to make an R rated film don't worry exclusively about littering titties and f*#ks throughout it and try to be more creative than that -- especially visually, so much of the gore could have been a visual masterpiece if you had watched how it had been done decades ago and used practical effects! I guess the producers are too broke to spend a buck. Johnny Cash's music felt sort of tacked on at the end. The grittiness of the trailer is lost in tone at certain scenes within the movie. 
Laughs: The comedic scenes (those I can remember) were pretty good, the way that that one girl exploded this other guy was one of most hilarious cartoon moments of this year so far!
Thoughts on Marvel Fanboys: Dear comic nerds and studios -- QUIT RUINING THE F*#K*NG MOVIES!!
Goodies: The ""beginning"" is awesome!!!!! I would give that beginning a 20 out of 10!!!
One more thing -- the logic behind Wolverines actions in the movie didn't make sense, why did he listen to Professor X and stay with that family -- knowing full well that there were mercenaries after them? There's more but I don't think I have enough room to explain."

","I am huge fan of Marvel movies. Now that being i must say that i do not understand why this movies was ever released. The story/plot of this film is very weak. The movie is filled with plot holes, and too many scenes are predictable. I was bored during the movie, and was actually considering leaving the movie theater, but stayed to the end. that i do regret. The last part of the movie is even worse than the rest of the movie which was poor enough.<br/><br/>The story leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions. What happened to all the other Mutants, How come that there are no longer any mutant being born, what happened with the company producing the mutant kids. What was wrong with Logan, And the plot holes, Why is self driven trucks not hitting the breaks when there are people on the road, why was all the mutant kids, not using their powers when Logan was fighting, the ""number 24"", how did Laura learn to drive, how did she know where to go, how did the other mutant kids get there, How did Laura get Logan to the doctor, why did he suddenly get extremely sick, why did the soldiers not kill the mutant kids in the end, since that was their original purpose and their so many other plot holes and gaps in the story."

","I saw this movie yesterday, and I guess I was a tad too excited for it. The film is not bad, by any means, but also its definitely not great. There are a lot of plot holes (video of super top secret facility, edited hours before Gabrielle's death, with voice in off and such....), no deep explanation of why Charles is the way he is, or about what happened to the rest of the x-men. Boyd Holbrook delivers (as usually), as well as Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, not so Laura, to the point (due to script issues maybe) that me and the people who watched the movie with me did not care at all about her character. The emotional attachment you as the viewer are supposed to feel just wasn't there, unlike with Charles Xavier, whose death was a great moment.<br/><br/>I did love the brutality of the action and Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine. All in all, considering that this is their last movie playing said characters, it was fitting, but could have DEFINITELY been a lot better."

British actor Stephen Merchant plays the albino Caliban, a long way from his days on ""The Office"" with Ricky Gervais.<br/><br/>""Logan"" owes a huge debt to ""Deadpool"", which showed an R-rated comic book movie can be successful. While ""Logan"" is light on laughs, there's plenty of swearing and lots and lots of blood. <br/><br/>""Logan"" feels more like a road trip/adventure movie than a superhero movie, a refreshing change after the epic and elaborate comic book films ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" bombed. <br/><br/>While this is the last time Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine/Logan (barring any surprise cameos in ""Deadpool""), Logan will probably be rebooted by another actor in the near future, so let's savour Jackman's perfect farewell."

I knew very little about the comics but the few cast members that stood out to me where Halle Berry as Storm, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier and of course my favorite Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine. I never wanted him to leave the role, but unfortunately all good things must come to an end. In the year 2029 Logan is an uber driver and he gets tasked with talking a young girl named Laura to North Dakota. He takes Professor Xavier with him and they pretty much go on a road trip half the movie fighting off this task force that wants to get Laura and the rest of the unnatural mutant children. This is a much smaller story and even though I prefer bigger sets, stakes, action and adventure. I was not displeased I really loved all the action in this movie and all the scenes with Logan interacting with Charles Xavier. As soon as you see Donald Pierce coming for Laura at Wolverine's crib your just like oh doucebag alert. If there is anything we should give this movie its that whenever there's a movie with violence towards children they cut away no matter if it's R or Pg-13. But here they don't do that. Hugh Jackman puts his heart&Soul in this final performance as everyone's favorite mutant. Patrick Stewart should win an Oscar even though he won't but his performance had me in tears. Dafne Keen was an amazing little girl she was pulling in her own with two award nominated actors and this is just her first movie. After seventeen years and nine X-Men movies I don't need anymore I've seen this franchise at it's lowest and highest. All of the old X-Men cast have finished thee movies.

"paytonsapp","9","3","9","26 May 2017"," Spoiler Free Review: Logan (With Thoughts on Logan Noir)
","Before I share my thoughts on 'Logan Noir' I will first talk about the pros and cons of the theatrical cut of Logan. Out of all the films I've seen this year, Logan is probably my 2nd favorite (only behind A Monster Calls). This film has it all: Action, Drama, Comedy, ACTION, Etc. This was easily my most anticipated film of the year as I am a huge fan of the X-Men franchise and the character of Logan/Wolverine is one of my favorite characters of all time. While we can all agree that X-Men Origins was a disaster, I felt a lot of people were to hard on The Wolverine (2013). There were a lot of things to love about that film and I thought it was the first film in the X-Men franchise to actually get the character of Wolverine right. However there was still things missing. And everything that was missing in The Wolverine, Logan makes up for in a huge way. This film is damn near flawless, as far as super-hero movies go, and this is in my humble opinion, the best Marvel film to date. It is also the only other super-hero movie you could compare to The Dark Knight trilogy, this also being my opinion. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best performances and easily the best performance he's given in an X-Men film. He brings so much vulnerability to the character and you can see and totally feel his pain. Hugh Jackman is without a doubt the only actor who should ever play this character. Sir Patrick Stewart also is very good in the film. Charles Xavier is a very hurt and very sad man in Logan, I think Stewart really portrays Xavier as that hurt man very very well. You really feel both Xavier and Logans pain through out he entire run time of the film and it makes them the most vulnerable they have been during the entire franchise. However, the biggest surprise in the entire film for me, was Dafne Keen as Laura. This girl has an incredibly bright future and I pray that they allow her to carry on the torch as this totally new character instead of casting someone else as Wolverine because she really is incredible in this role and brings a savageness but at the same time a heartbreaking innocence as well. Bottom line, The whole cast really is incredible throughout the entire film. The camera work and overall production design is also fantastic. This is probably the best looking X-Men film to date hands down. There is little CG in the film but what is in the film looks pretty good. It didn't take me out of the story at all and I didn't really notice much. Except for a short 20 second moment where the CG is very noticeable, but again it didn't take me out of the story. Logan is a perfect send off for Hugh Jackman from the X-Men franchise and although it's very bittersweet, this is the way it should have all wrapped up for him. And in the end...<br/><br/>PROS: Acting, Camera Work, Directing, Great Locations, Action, Characters, and Great Drama<br/><br/>CONS: A 20 Second Portion Where the CG is Noticeable <br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>THOUGHTS ON LOGAN NOIR<br/><br/>It really doesn't add much to the movie. I mean it gives some really, really cool looking shots, but I don't think you get the same flare that the theatrical cut gives you. I did enjoy it overall and it wouldn't hurt to check it out on the Blu Ray."
"shubeilat","7","3","9","25 May 2017"," First Login and review..
","PG Handicap from prior Wolverine movies removed (check), deep husky comforting voices (check), carefully escalated tension and aggression in first fight scene (check). Environment blending in with the characters aging and deterrence; squeaky car/buildings/clothes etc.. (very nice touch). <br/><br/>But..<br/><br/>The overall impression was close to something like; your personal (DIY) home pet project, where you start off with the most accuracy in fixing that fence, or repainting that old mold infested corner in the ceiling, caring for the specifics and all the little details, until you find your self rushing off the job just for sake of getting it done!!<br/><br/>And that's what in my personal opinion happened with this assignment, where it felt as the pace climaxed at around the first 20 minutes then duplicated it self thus gradually losing any fertility for potential.<br/><br/>In what felt like a mash up between ""blood father"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", and ""mad max:, there could have been more done to what is considered as the finale for the evolution of the character on screen, especially after all the years of trial and error, instead of exhausting all the art at the beginning and cruising on the protagonists name for the rest of the screen using it for commercial advertisement to mobile phones, breakfast cereals and automobiles.<br/><br/>When maybe a cocktail of ""300"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Terminator salvation"" perhaps would have been more fulfilling in bringing out the protagonist's essence accumulated in the collective portrait of ""Wolverine/Logan"" fan boy generations over the years with his; instinctual beastly charisma, primitive confrontational manner, and repressed superego.<br/><br/>In conclusion aside from the artistic concentration at the beginning, Patrick Stewart's master performance, and some of the catchy paradoxes in the story line, I think the overall rating should linger between (7,4) and (7) on the IMDb scale."

","A movie, directed by James Mangold, tells us a story of Wolverine and Professor X who take care of young mutant with similar abilities to Logan's. You can see that both Wolverine and Professor X struggle with their health and they are not so young anymore. Both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart did an outstanding job. Also Dafne Keen as Laura was amazing. There were couple of things at the end of the movie that was not necessary and in my opinion ruined it a little bit. But all in all, it was really good movie."

","I had read that they pushed this one into the R-rated zone due to the success of Deadpool and the brutality it had. A very good choice, although a very different movie. (The Deadpool short that was before this I found very strange and fell flat. Not very superhero-esque.)<br/><br/>But back to Logan.<br/><br/>What stood out to me was the acting. I personally would put Jackman (lead actor) and Stewart (supporting) up for Oscars. Some very nice work from both, although the material gave them that opportunity. Both parts (especially Jackman's) were significantly physical and required displaying intense pain (and succeeded where DeCaprio's portrayal in The Revenant didn't come close. But to me that was more an overdue Oscar for him vs. an actual valid win.) The little girl was even very effective. The pairing of both her and Jackman was highly-touted but really didn't come into play until very late in the film, when they had the argument in the stolen truck after she takes him to the doctor.<br/><br/>The dark turn in this was refreshing vs. the previous sanitized versions of Wolverine in the past. Gritty and mean. Captured damaged characters well, although didn't give them a backstory about why they were like that.<br/><br/>(The element of the Nurse being killed was odd. The young bad guy thought Logan had killed her, and vice versa. But they never assigned blame.)<br/><br/>The purpose of the journey was lacking, though. Very vague on how the Eden location came to be. It was a bit odd that they introduced the supposed red-herring of it being from a comic book and then it actually being real. (We repeatedly saw the coordinates of the location but they never used them in actually finding it.) And no explanation why ""crossing the border"" was a cure-all to all their ills. No reason why the bad guys would give up after that and why they would not just chase them into Canada.<br/><br/>Didn't find the direction that significant. The brutality of the action was much needed but then the action became muddled when the baddies kept missing the girl when they shot at her and bullet holes appeared in the limo in the following scene, not at that moment. The scene at the hotel when Xavier had his seizure was vague as it seemed that not all the patrons were frozen. Didn't care either for the car strippers in the initial scene being hispanic. I would have err'd on the side of political correctness and made them white. Wouldn't have made a difference in the end product. The presence of a wall between the US and Mexico was an interesting turn. Probably inserted when Trump's nonsense came up in '16.<br/><br/>But, in the end, I found it very effective, despite its shortcomings."

","There are a few things I can agree with the negatives spewed by those who hated this movie.<br/><br/>1) Comparisons to The Dark Knight. Retarded. The two main factors The Dark Knight has that Logan didn't have is complexity and a story that is relevant to this reality. Logan is pretty much straight forward and fantasy driven. So, irrelevant to each other. <br/><br/>2) Predictable story. I don't feel that the story was a cliché comic book movie to the likes of Avengers or whatever but yes I must say; I knew the ending of the movie when it began.<br/><br/>NOW! For those who gave Logan a pejorative rating and review and like to call the people stupid for liking this film, please stop. Your narcissism is clouding your logic and you are not special. I liked this movie and I'll do it by the numbers.<br/><br/>1) It is R-rated. And to all you sissies who hated this notion, let us remind you that Wolverine IS an R-rated character. When I see a Wolverine movie, I want to see him ""snikt"" the **** out of people in bloody fashion. His claws are not for stylish appeal, they are for killing people, you dingle berries.<br/><br/>2) Story. Predictable as it may be, I still liked it. I know it lacks originality but so do most movies and I'm willing to bet you probably like those movies, whatever they may be so shut up.<br/><br/>3) Character development and acting. Logan excels in this department. The only disappointment was the Reavers. I wish they actually used Pretty Boy and Bone Breaker from the comics. I know it's petty but eh!<br/><br/>4) Action. Just the way the Wolverine movies should of been in the ****ing first place. Blood and brutality with sheer abandonment. Screw you people and your ""I don't like dark movies"" BS. <br/><br/>It is fine that some of you people don't like the dark tone of Logan and that you prefer him cutting and having air gush out of people but this ""I don't get why this is highly rated"" idiocy has to stop. It is only the illusion of your self-perceived high intellectualism talking."

","Brilliant, it's a sort of X-Men but done with an earthly bound, thriller type, sickening atmosphere. If I wouldn't know any better (the X-Men history), I would have said that it's a story developed into a near apocalyptic settings. In a way, I wouldn't be wrong, here's something you learn looking at this movie that doesn't harm knowing in advance: <br/><br/>1. The story is a spin off of the true X-Men, it's a sort of parallel world in which things have developed into a completely different scenario, a scenario in which hope for mutant kind has lost it's meaning. The brilliance of this movie relies in the fact that it makes you really feel the decay and despair in the aftermath of the failed mutant struggle through the characters of Logan and Professor Xavier. This is the most complex Wolverine you will ever see. I did not expect it, I expected an aggravated, savage and bloodthirsty demon like they show it in the trailers that cuts cars, trucks, railroads, whatevs. It's not like that, not like that at all. We see flaws everywhere we look, in almost every character, and yet we can't look away. <br/><br/>2. It'a a sort of Max Payne Logan, dark, confused, weary, brutal. Top performance. <br/><br/>3. The lil girl is a badass. Yet like the entirety of the movie, she seems real, not some cute transforming Barbie doll - monster shiit. None of that bull. <br/><br/>4.

But unfortunately the endresult is far from what I expected. Yes, it's a much slower and realistic approach to the whole super human topic, with feelings and stuff, but i wasn't really into it. SPOILER AHEAD!!!! and when I saw the little child Wolverine, that just made me laugh. there should be no kids in this movie! and it's way too many of them anyway. it's like the last entry in the ""old"" Mad Max Trilogy, when Max helps the little shits in the plane.

"spencergrande6","8","3","9","22 April 2017"," Almost great, anti-hero tropes pile on too thick
","This is nearly 2/3rds of an almost great film; a personal, brutal, honest, original take on the superhero myth. But the final act is a letdown; like something from an inferior mundane take and one that undermines some of that which was built up to that point.<br/><br/>What's strange and transfixing for a while is how deeply cynical this film is. The mutants are dead, Xavier senile and hurting those he loves, Logan is dead inside; an alcoholic husk taking care of his dying father in some abandoned silo in the desert. Until of course, life intervenes (through a child no less) and he's forced to find his humanity once again.<br/><br/>It is built into the structure of the movie that this is another one of those false hopes. That they lived their whole lives for this cause which didn't' work and which never truly saved Logan's soul. Xavier makes it his duty to try one last time. In this sense, the cynicism and brutality is earned and just. It doesn't just shock and awe, but conjure mood and distaste; it drives a stake through the ""angry dude with a heart of gold"" byline that normally accompanies Logan - here he's a bit of a sadist with no carnage filter anymore.<br/><br/>Yet, after a soulful mix of scenes involving an old-fashioned family and their farm, the movie kicks into manic superhero vs. villain let's save the world mode. The deaths pile up too fast; the poor Munson family is slaughtered, yet in the face of Xavier's death and all the other action we don't get to feel the full weight of this collateral damage and we are supposed to take it at face value and keep rolling with the nihilism.<br/><br/>Then there's a lot more mind-numbing violence at the end, too much and too chaotic for it to register as much more than useless noise (unlike the earlier fight scenes). Logan wants to save the kids from having to kill yet they do that just as well here and you're supposed to cheer. Logan gets a fitting death, finally at peace by destroying the demon within, though you wonder how much is really his fault at this point? Is this a fitting metaphor for him? <br/><br/>A good man who has killed many bad guys. The movie seems to say that bad guys have to die but you're still killing them, so that's bad so you're bad so beat yourself up about it and tell the kids this is conflicting stuff so don't mess with it. But the kids have to kill bad guys anyway (comic book antics and special effects...). The anti-hero tropes have been piled on too thick by now, and I think a little more sanity may have helped out in the end."

","Well, a lot has already been said about this movie. I just finished watching it, and I cried. It's beautiful, in the sense that wolverine's death is looming since the very beginning, a sort of painful decadence. Nevertheless characters hold on to their ethic and values, this is what I like the most, as if to say ""you see true colors when tough times come"" . Humanity is always ugly ad beautiful, we can see those sides in every movie. In this one we find them very amplified as per every movie of the x-men saga. death comes for wolverine in his style in his own turf. I thank the director and the writers for that. It is honorable and worthwhile. It's a movie I will keep. I don't care to say if it's the best from the franchise or not. I enjoyed it, and so it seems many people. That's enough."

"frank-wang-w-s","9","3","9","19 April 2017"," When Death Became Redemption
","""Logan"" is the third and the last movie of wolverine movie series which came out on March 3rd, 2017. Though it marks the end of Hugh Jackman's 17-year-long superhero screen image, it also brings up the superhero movie into a whole new level with a deeper main idea and more realistic characterization. <br/><br/>Logan, once the fiercest and most heroic superhero, finally came to the end of his legend. According to the background setting of the movie, in 2029, the X-Men organization (A mutant organization set up by Professor X to protect mutants and humans) were gone and there hadn't been a newly born mutant in the world for 20 years. Mutants were dying out. Professor X, the great man who once was like a teacher and a father to Logan, now had become a miserable ill old man with serious brain disease. Logan became a private driver to make a living for himself and the poor old professor. What was more unfortunate was that he even began to lose his most powerful ability of self-healing. At this very moment, He happened to meet a girl called Laura who had the exact same super power as him: Self-healing and Adamantium (One of the most powerful alloys in the world) claws, yet was in great danger of being chased by a secret organization. Convinced by professor-X and the conscience of himself, Logan, once again, gave up his reclusive life and undertook the responsibility to do this one-last-time superhero's job. However, this time he was no longer the great Wolverine. <br/><br/>On the surface, this movie is still a movie about a superhero. It still contains the elements of science fictions and actions. In fact, this movie is probably the most exciting superhero I've ever watched. Thanks to the R rating, you'll be able to appreciate the bloodiest fight and action scenes when Logan used that pair of claws to fight with enemies. As for the plots, ""Logan"" begins to show its innovations compared to other superhero movies. I'd rather call it a Road Movie because the most parts of the movie are Logan driving the car with Laura and Professor X, but this type of narration doesn't make the movie boring. It helps to enhance the tensions of the characters instead. Anyone who likes the superhero movie is just going to like ""Logan"" as well. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, when we look deeper into the movie, you'll understand that ""Logan"" is more like a private movie. Actually, the main idea of the movie is to portray a vivid impression of Logan and discuss how he fought against his miserable fate but never gave up. Since the character of Logan has been on the screen for 17 years in several X- men related movies, this single movie doesn't spend much time reviewing the history of Logan but goes straight to the new harsh situation, which explains why the director changed the movie's name from ""Wolverine"" into ""Logan"". To be honest, this can be a flow to the audiences who are not so familiar with the character Logan. To them, this movie is only about a middle-aged superhero who led a horrible life but sacrificed himself to save a little girl. <br/><br/>However, for those who know what Logan has experienced in the previous movies, they will understand that this simple story is not just about saving a little girl, but about a redemption of a man. They will understand what it means when Logan said: ""Bad sh*t happens to people I care about"". Logan's super healing power can be a gift but also a curse at the same time. On the one hand, this power keeps him alive from the crises. On the other hand, it also forces him to face the sorrow when he lost the ones that he loves. What does it all mean if you are the only one to survive but no one else does? Logan has experienced this for his whole life. Thus, when he faced his ""daughter"" Laura, he knew he must not fail this time even he was much weaker than before. In the end of the movie, though Logan died for Laura, but he passed away with a smile because this was the first time he broke the curse and got his redemption. The vivid characterization and the violent fighting scene not only make Logan more real than ever but also affect the audiences' feelings at the greatest degree when they saw character's reactions. This connection between the audiences and the characters is what makes this movie a great one. <br/><br/>Although the movie has a little high threshold for the ordinary audiences, but it is absolutely one of the best superhero movies ever as it proves that a good superhero movie can also be a good movie with vivid characters and touching plot, not just some popcorn movies."
"bdugan1998","10","3","9","18 April 2017"," This is the Wolverine movie we deserve
","SPOILERS AHEAD! This takes a totally different tone from the previous x-men movies. This movie is in a much more serious realm. We start off to see Logan now the caretaker of Xavier. It is a complete turn around from the first time we saw them together. It is heart wrenching to Xavier in his mental condition. We never get to know the complete story of the school accident but that is the beauty of this movie, giving us the illusion that Xavier most likely killed everyone he was trying to save. X-23 was a complete refresh! Once she started talking it was amazing! She is truly the perfect essence of Wolverine with her young kid attitude. Seeing Logan taking on all the responsibility and not being able to save the ones he loves is heartbreaking. The ending sets up nicely for a possible x force movie."
"orland1995","10","3","9","17 April 2017"," A remarkable film that happens to be about a comic book character
","Logan is the difference between a really good film, and a good comic book adaptation. The acting alone is enough to make the film worthy of the 2+ hours with both Stewart and Jackman performing award clinching performances, not to mention the breakout star in Dafne Keen. This film has more facial close ups than action scenes that allowed the audience a glimpse of character depth not normally seen in the MCU. They do so without going overboard and it's at par with what I would call as the best of its genre in the Dark Knight trilogy. I enjoyed it as a film, the Wolverine character was just layered into the plot of an amazing masterpiece. Don't' compare it to any X-men, Avengers, or Guardians of the Galaxy movie - those have their own place in cinema and are equally enjoyable in my opinion, but this is a great movie more than a comic book popcorn film. To give you an idea of how different it is – there are no end credit scenes! (not a spoiler!) There is nothing to connect it to and nothing better to look forward to because they executed the story with perfection and ended it the way a film should be ended without additional gimmicks. I will mention a minor spoiler so stop reading if you haven't seen it: I can see how they can fold Jackman into a future Marvel episode but still be technically correct with his consistent stance that this is his last Wolverine movie! That would be the biggest treat!"

","Hugh Jackman plays the title role in ""Logan"" (Wolverine's chosen name), a dark, violent story in the future where the surviving X-Men have disbanded; and Jackman takes whatever side jobs he can get to support himself and the elderly, frail Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart). It is a bleak existence for both men. Stewart needs drugs to keep him from having seizures that produce psychic blasts of energy that can kill people and level a small city; and Jackman's healing factor is severely diminished due to something poisoning his body.<br/><br/>The former teacher and student are barely getting by when both get the chance to become heroes again. A mutant girl (played by Dafne Keen) on the run from mutant-hunting mercenaries seeks the help of Jackman and Stewart to take her to a mutant safe zone. His spirit and body broken, Jackman at first couldn't give a damn about the girluntil he sees her in action, and notices a striking similarity to his own mutant abilities. But I believe what finally spurs Jackman into unleashing his Wolverine alter ego and helping Keen is seeing government agents hunting down an escaped experiment, which is what happened to Jackman a long time ago, causing him severe physical and mental pain that I don't think he ever recovered from.<br/><br/>The three mutants are now on the run from government sponsored mercs who bring with them a mutant who is every bit as ferocious and deadly as Jackman. It's not even clear to Jackman if this mutant safe zone really exists; but real or imagined, the two former X-Men and the girl mutant must go for it because it's their only hope.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Logan"" is the scene when thugs are trying to steal the limousine Jackman is sleeping in. Jackman is surprisingly calm, telling the thugs to go away. The thugs don't listen, instead shooting Jackman; thinking he's dead, they go back to stealing the limousine. Jackman gets up, extends his adamantium claws, and gives the thugs another chance at leaving! The bad guys clearly see that they are facing a mutant, but instead of running away they start kicking and hitting Jackman! The stupidity of people boggles the mind. Well, Jackman goes into his Wolverine berserker rage, and what follows is a bloody fight that shows the audience early on that this movie will deserve it's R rating.<br/><br/>I have read many comic books when I was in my late teens and early 20s, and Wolverine is one of my two fave comic book characters. It's been frustrating seeing X-Men movies that do not fully show the ultra violent side of Wolverine; but ""Logan"" comes very close. Don't expect cameos from numerous mutants, or ridiculous amounts of CGI eye candythis is a bare bones, feel bad story where heroes are either dead or dying.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

","""Let's go see the new 'X-Men' movie,"" your girlfriend suggests as you pull up to your local movie theater. While at first surprised that she wants to see a comic book movie, you take full advantage of this rare opportunity, grab some popcorn and make your way to your seat.<br/><br/>Excitement and anticipation sink in as the 20th Century Fox fanfare floods your ears and the ""Marvel"" comics logo flips down the screen. After enjoying the action fest of ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" almost a year prior, you wonder what grand cinematic spectacle awaits in ""Logan.""<br/><br/>From the opening shots, however, you realize that something is off.<br/><br/>The film begins with the introduction of a weathered, lethargic and washed up Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) passed out drunk in the front of a limo, an antithesis to his usual sarcastic, feral state. Awoken by outside commotion, he swears, and limps out to find a few lowlifes attempting to steal lugs from the wheels of his vehicle. He tries to settle the matter peacefully, but is quickly shot in the chest and beaten repeatedly by the thugs.<br/><br/>Within seconds, Logan becomes the Wolverine we know and love, except this time director James Mangold pulls no punches. One of the thugs loses his arm. Another is stabbed repeatedly in the stomach, and two have Wolverine's claws thrust through their heads in spectacular bloody fashion.<br/><br/>You and your girlfriend look at each other in shock, realizing you are in for much more than a typical superhero movie.<br/><br/>In my article, ""Dummy's guide to the Marvel cinematic universe,"" I said that it is the age of the cinematic superhero, and this is still very much the case. For some, this is the time to be alive, while others have been bogged down by superhero stories since the first ""Avengers"" film.<br/><br/>Like it or not, superhero blockbusters are here to stay, which is why small-scale, R-rated films like ""Logan"" are so refreshing.<br/><br/>The story picks up a mere six years after ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" which saw a dark, post- apocalyptic timeline and the poorly received events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" rewritten in favor of a new, bright future. In ""Logan,"" however, Wolverine's healing factor is wearing off, causing him to age and weaken rapidly. He drives a limo in Texas for funerals, businessmen and part alike to pay for medication to treat the neurodegenerative dementia of Professor Charles Xavier (Sir. Patrick Stewart). The X-Men have disbanded, and no new mutant has been born in 25 years.<br/><br/>So, what happened?<br/><br/>The answer, which is revealed in pieces throughout the film, is heartbreaking, yet realistic, much like the film that it's in. And as stated previously, Mangold's writing and direction are unhinged. The dialogue is profane, the violence is brutal and the narrative effectively portrays the humanity of its characters.<br/><br/>Jackman and Stewart's performances are equal contributors. Seventeen years after the first ""X- Men"" film, and Jackman has never been better as Wolverine. This is partially due to a story element found only in this film: Logan's mortality. The adamantium that made him into a weapon is slowly poisoning him from the inside out. Both he and Xavier recognize that their days are numbered, which is why when they encounter Laura (Dafne Keen), a young mutant being pursued by the government, it is of the utmost importance to ensure for her a more hopeful future.<br/><br/>In addition to the film's compelling story and gripping portrayals, its soundtrack – which features the likes of Brooke Eden and Johnny Cash – and original score by Marco Beltrami are impeccable. His compositions are modern, yet simple and eerie. This is exemplified well in the film's opening moments following Logan's violent encounter. A lone, desolate piano track can be heard faintly in the background as he wipes the blood from his knuckles and eases the shotgun shells out of his chest and arms.<br/><br/>""You are dying. You want to die,"" Laura tells Logan.<br/><br/>""How do you know?"" Logan asks.<br/><br/>""Charles told me.""<br/><br/>""What else did he tell you?""<br/><br/>""To not let you.""<br/><br/>As an emotionally-charged conclusion to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and a brilliant introduction for Dafne Keen as an actress, ""Logan"" is a triumph on all fronts. Its success, and the success of its predecessor, ""Deadpool"" (2016), have paved the way for future down-to-earth narratives in this genre. And in the age of the cinematic superhero, these stories are more than welcome."

I'm really impressed by the performance of everyone. Especially Dafne Keen surprised me. For some reason something tells me that I have seen her in a famous short film.

","If you, like me, escape to the movies to be entertained, unlike the previous X-Men and Wolverine movies, this one is not for you.<br/><br/>Why the script writers and producers decided to make such a depressing film, I do not know.<br/><br/>Given the wide canvas they had to paint on, they decided to have the film show Logan's demise. It is a bleak film with some action.<br/><br/>It uses a child actor to maybe hint at sequels, yet she is not trusted enough to have many lines. In fact, to begin with, we are led to believe she is mute.<br/><br/>This one child is a veritable Tasmanian Tiger of death, who can take on a squad of highly skilled soldiers, and kill them all. Yet near the end, when she is united with her fellow child mutants, instead of fighting the soldiers (something that has been instilled in all of them) they run.

However, since my other half felt precisely like I did after seeing this film, and he loves action and the entire Marvel film enterprise, I should voice that we found this movie almost unwatchable. I spent 2/3 of the film hiding behind my partners back (I'm in my early 40s - not a child).<br/><br/>I wonder why so many here think it's OK (and apparently even enjoyable) to be subjected to hours of non-stop intensely gory violence? I don't want to go to the movies and come out feeling close to traumatized by images that have taken days to shake. This film could have been just as powerful (I actually think much more powerful) with substantially less violence. Loading films with endless violence is a lazy way out of having to write a more sophisticated, thoughtful plot. Given the legacy of these two X-Men giants that were killed off, they deserved a bit more craftsmanship with how their stories ended."

"korereviews","10","3","9","5 March 2017"," Little Miss Sunshine meets Fury Road (...and it's totally awesome!)
","Many people are saying here that this is the second-best superhero movie of all time - putting only Nolan's Dark Knight out front. I have to disagree on that: the greatness of Logan is that it is brilliant human drama. By comparison, Dark Knight was superficial and forgettable. It had superb cinematography, clever writing, and a standout performance by Ledger. But was there a single moment that pulled at your heartstrings? Was there a message that stayed with you, or made you think? I don't think so. Dark Knight was style over substance. To the extent that it did have a message, it was Nolan's disturbingly neo-conservative view of power and authority (google it - I'm not the first one to notice). Logan, on the other hand - though it also was beautifully shot and expertly crafted, was about substance over style. That's a first for superhero movies. And it's why this film should be the first of its kind (and especially Jackman and Stewart's performances) to be (seriously) recognized by film awards.<br/><br/>The other major comparison is with Deadpool. Sigh. Yes, it's probably true that the success of Deadpool is the reason the studio was willing to take a chance with the 'R' rating for Logan, and allow for some of the grittier elements. But while Deadpool was generally enjoyable and did have a few clever jokes, on the whole it was (and I'm sure to make some enemies here) a movie crafted by and for men with the emotional maturity of 14 year-old boys. Most of the humor was either scatological or sexual, of the sort that evokes belly-laughs from psychologically-stunted males and alienates the other 51+ percent of the population of the earth. As such, it hardly represents an evolution of the comic book movie.<br/><br/>Here's my list of reasons why Logan represents a *genuine* departure from and evolution of the superhero genre: -The 'R' rating wasn't just an excuse to include foul language or sexually exploitative content. There was a lot of swearing, but it reflected the real feelings and experiences of the characters, and never felt cheap or gratuitous. Even the brief boob shot in the movie doesn't feel exploitative, but fits naturally into the (actually achingly sad) early scenes depicting Logan's diminished state - showing how he has been reduced to the role of a limo driver for drunken party girls and raucous frat boys. Those scenes are there to say: here is the great Wolverine, driving cab, and no one even notices... His resigned look and weary half-chuckle in the rear-view mirror perfectly punctuate that scene. The message is also very timely. It says: these days, even 'superheros' have to take whatever sh*t job they can get to make ends meet. There is a strong (but subtle and well-played) current of dystopic social commentary running throughout the film.<br/><br/>-This film is as - or more - violent than other comic book movies. Nevertheless - and this struck me more than anything - what defined *all* of the male protagonists in this story was the fact that they performed nurturing, caring roles. I can't stress how unusual this is - and not just for superhero movies. There wasn't a lead-female role in this movie (an adult one, I mean - the female who is normally there to provide the boobs and be an attractive distraction for the male lead). Rather, what we have here is three men taking on traditionally female duties: Xavier attempts to care for Logan's soul (as indeed he had in the past) and for Laura. Caliban tends like a nurse to both Xavier and Logan (even ironing their shirts!). Logan too has become a care-giver to the aged Xavier, administering his medication and helping him get to the bathroom. Think about it: in any other movie, *all* of those things would have been delegated to the token female character. Yes, Logan is still a hardened killer; but all his swagger and machismo are gone - worn away by age and mounting misfortune; what he does now he does joylessly, only to protect those in his care. And, most of all, Logan undergoes the sea-change of becoming a father (for all intents and purposes). What we are given in this film is a touching (and desperately needed) depiction of the evolution of our thinking about masculinity. And while there are many other things to praise about 'Logan' - most of which have been discussed at length by other reviewers - this is what strikes me as its most valuable contribution. Thanks, James Mangold, for having the courage to take it there. Let's hope it starts a trend."
"andywang_bj","6","3","9","4 March 2017"," Beautiful ending for Wolverine, horrible ending for the X-men
","The movie is a beautiful ending for the Wolverine series, but a horrible ending for the X-men story. Let me elaborate.<br/><br/>As Professor X said in the movie, Logan has always wanted liberation from his immortality, and the desire has grown stronger as he grows older, weaker, and lonelier. But how to let such an iconic, unorthodox character die with dignity without falling into the clichÃ©s of dying for love/friendship/saving the mankind? The movie does a great job in delivering that end. Logan died for a purpose, which is protecting a group of young mutants. But he was a reluctant savior, as he should be. He did not die for a noble ideal. He died for the simple reason that he did not want the miseries that happened to him repeat on the innocent youths. He fought a good fight, showing off some of his classic moves, and died like the lone hero that he is. It was truly touching and beautiful.<br/><br/>But in granting Logan a fitting death, the movie sacrifices the entire X-men sequel's sense of meaning. In the story line, all the other X-men died out. Professor X is old, broke, weak, and inflicted with a severe brain disease (okay, I see the irony, smart move, except not really). Anyone who appreciates Charles Xavier's wisdom, lovingness, and tireless effort to provide a home for the mutants, not even to mention his immense power, would be HEARTBROKEN to see him end up like that. Left alone in a shabby shelter, killed by a cheap robotic Wolverine, and buried like a stray dog next to the road. Professor X deserves better, and X-men for hell deserve better.<br/><br/>I get it that the director wants the extra tragedy to give the movie power and depth. But in giving Professor X and other X-men such an unfitting end, the movie is self-defeating. If neither Magneto's violent approach nor Professor X's peaceful ideal can give the mutants a happy-ever-after, what is the point of all the struggles and fights in the previous X-men movies? Moreover, what is the point of escorting the young mutants to temporary safety? Wouldn't the all-powerful pharmaceutical company collude with the Canadian government and wipe out the mutant youngsters in no time? Once you put this movie into the big picture of the X-men universe, you immediately realize that the movie gives up too much of the sequel's significance to complete a single character. An iconic and important character, but a single character nonetheless.<br/><br/>Any Wolverine or Hugh Jackman fan, as I am, would be happy for this version of the end of the iron-clawed X-man. But as a X-men fan, I question the movie's interpretation of the sequel."

","The X-Men movie franchise had its ups and downs, and Logan is perfect.

"harrylosborne","8","2","5","7 May 2019"," Gritty, dark, and everything missing from the rest of the X-Men franchise
","Superhero films typically have to go down one of two avenues: colourful and humorous (e.g. Avengers, GotG) or more realistic and tough (e.g. The Dark Knight, Watchmen). Logan opts for the latter, producing a film worthy of Hugh Jackman, an actor typically starved of decent screen roles when playing Wolverine. Previous instalments in the Wolverine franchise have been average to poor, making Logan an important film for multiple reasons (especially given X-Men's loss of ground to the rest of the Marvel universe). By stepping away from the rest of the Marvel universe, the story doesn't become saturated with other characters crowbarred into the plot, giving Wolverine what he deserves.<br/><br/>To merge these two themes of darkness and lightheartedness is near-impossible, as pandering to child and adult audiences is more than difficult. Logan does as good a job as can be expected, using humour sparsely without ruining emotional moments that make up the core of the film. Jackman is unshakeable in his titular role, bringing the same intensity he has to the Wolverine role he had for the previous 16 years; this film allowed him to flex his acting muscles slightly more freely, not constrained by superhero films' typically wooden scripts. Patrick Stewart is also excellent as Professor X, reduced to an ambling shell of what he used to be, but ultimately Logan's only friend.<br/><br/>The storyline of Logan isn't a world-beater (Wolverine seems to suffer from a lack of decent plots), but for someone who has stuck with the franchise for its duration, it will surely satisfy any hardcore fans. As a standalone, Logan holds itself in higher regard than almost any other superhero film, delivering emotional punches successfully without cheapening scenes using ill-timed humour."

","Logan is the follow up to 2013's the Wolverine and the final film apart of the series. This film takes itself to new heights and is very much so better than the previous films of the series. Having not too high expectations but seeing constant praise and word of mouth surrounding this film, as it was being considered a ""classic"" and ""one of the greatest superhero films"", one was not too much to have expected, but overall Logan lives up to the hype and exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Noticeably different in this film compared to previous films of the series and X-Men films, is the R-rating. This apparently gave the studios a higher risk as they went all out. Most notably because of the success of Deadpool, an R-rated Woverine probably would not have happened. But we are lucky as it did as this film completely fulfills with its R-rating. The violence is top notch, much more realistic and we see Hugh Jackman use stronger profanity (some were forced in the beginning but it fits). Logan really is brutal and overall violent which is what makes it work, we see a lot of strong violence where his claws are stabbing through peoples limbs, their eyes and face, heads being ripped apart and just overall strong much satisfying violence.<br/><br/>The overall story line and plot is compelling and interesting in the least. the film's tone is very mature, serious and doesn't try for comedic relief or unnecessary punchlines, jokes or any silliness (like in the Last Stand). What makes this film work and succeed is not only the constant great chemistry between Logan and Charles, but the introduction to Laura- who very much so steals her scenes and is captivating to watch as the film goes. Logan has some very well done action sequences but with a running time of over 2 hours 17 mins, the story here is what keeps the film entertaining and on gas.<br/><br/>This film is emotional at the right times, unpredictable and will have leaving with a sense of greatness, that if this is Hugh Jackman's final appearance as Wolverine, then it was well deserved. Though, one thing which could have been better slightly was the handling of Wolverine's death. We see the rare emotion from Laura but it felt very quick and not too satisfying. Overall, Logan succeeds as the best Wolverine film, one of the best X-Men films (along with Days of Future Past), and one of the best superhero comic book films in general."

"rs403404","8","2","5","7 March 2017"," 'Logan' Has Claws and Not Much Else
","Nearly 17 years ago, ""X-Men"" debuted in theaters. While it wasn't the best reviewed movie ever by any stretch of the imagination, it did show that the well-known Marvel comic book properties could earn solid box office numbers. Since then, the likes of ""Spider-Man 2"", ""The Dark Knight"", and ""The Avengers"" have evolved the genre from something of interest to only comic book fans to the general public. We've had 3 Spider-Mans, 2 Batmans, 2 Supermans, and 3 Hulks on the big screen. Despite all that change, the X-Men universe has remained somewhat intact. Sure, they've had cast changes but only to show younger versions of characters. Meanwhile, the older cast still manages to pop-up occasionally. The closest thing to a reboot was merely a soft reboot that didn't involve any cast changes.<br/><br/>A large part of this could be attributed to the brilliant casting of the first ""X-Men"" film. Individually, Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Ian McKellan's Magneto created the kind of spot-on portrayals a comic fan dreams of. But even they pale in comparison to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. The 6'3"" Australian was a last minute replacement to play the 5""3"" Canadian character. To say he wasn't comic book accurate would be an understatement. But what he managed to do was improve on the comic book character by bringing it humanity while staying true to the original gruffness of its roots.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has played Wolverine in more movies than any other actor playing a superhero. Jackman has appeared as Wolverine in 9 movies and had a starring role in 7 of those. ""Logan"", by all accounts, is his, and likely Stewart's, swan song to the X-Men universe. It's bittersweet in two ways: 1) because it's sad to see these actors leave iconic roles that they've been at for so long, and 2) because while it's a serviceable outro, it's not nearly as strong as these characters/actors deserve.<br/><br/>Further, this movie seems to ignore both ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" in the continuity. I will happily admit this movie is a fair bit better than those, nevertheless, it's important to follow the rules previously set up in the universe. Especially when within the post-credits scene in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" there was a teaser for Logan. To discover that this tease went nowhere was disappointing at best. Particularly since it indicated a classic X- Men villain would make an appearance, when in reality the villains of this movie are essentially canon fodder to be shredded by Logan and company. Eventually, near the end of act 2, a villain appears that could actually be a threat to the team.<br/><br/>The ""Logan"" movie has a solid setup. It's the not too distant future (kudos to the makeup department for convincingly adding a couple of decades to Stewart and Jackman) and mutants are dying out. No new mutants has been born for 25 years and those that are left are seeing their powers diminish in various ways. As a swan song, this is perfect. With most of the heroes gone and forgotten, the heroes that remain have to prove they might still be able to do some good in the world.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, acts 2 and 3 become little more than a road trip movie with Logan, Xavier, and a young girl named Laura (played very well by Dafne Keen), as they travel from Mexico to North Dakota. There are various stops along the way that usually result in the group being discovered by the bad guys and having the slash their way out. Throughout the trip it's impossible for the audience to know how far they've gone. Have they gone 50, 100, 1000 miles? As it is, the audience has no way to judge if the journey is almost done or just beginning.<br/><br/>I'm not sure this movie intends to have a moral, but if it did it almost certainly would be, ""no good deed goes unpunished"". Of course, it might also be ""no bad deed goes unpunished"". Perhaps, the moral is simply ""no deed goes unpunished"". It does seem as though Wolverine could've prevented a lot of death by simply minding his own business. It honestly gets to the point where death is so prevalent in this movie, it makes it very hard to develop an attachment to any character. Why would the audience become invested in characters when the movie is obviously willing to kill anyone at anytime?<br/><br/>However, even though this movie was a disappointment, I can't be too harsh on it. If nothing else, seeing Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in these roles one last time is worth the price of admission. These are two actors who I doubt could give a bad performance if they tried. The story, even with it's failings, is strong enough not to diminish their performances. Additionally, James Mangold's direction is solid enough although the pacing of the movie can get fairly muddy in act 2.<br/><br/>I probably could've been more forgiving of the errors within the movie if they had given some thought to developing the relationship between Wolverine and Laura. What should have been the beating heart of this movie is all but overlooked. Still, as far as outros go, this is a solid one. Further, it's great to see Wolverine exit in an explosion of gore that a character with claws would almost certainly manage.<br/><br/>It's sad to see an end to this chapter in comic book movies, but, on the other hand, we still have Deadpool."
"nocpan","7","2","5","5 March 2017"," Not a super hero movie
","Opposed to all previous X-Man productions this one does not come across as a super hero movie at all. If you expected this to be a brutal, in line with comics Wolverine hack and slash action flick, well its just not it. Wolverine was made human, a limping, broken down drunk driving a limo for a living one a path to self destruction. Professor X was turned into an old man, half senile half demented unable to control his powers and has to take pills that ""mentally castrate"" him. No mention of the other x-men, aside from one other no other mutants. Most of the movie is filmed in remote, unpopulated locations common to low budget productions which this movie is not. A predictable chase and run motive throughout the movie separated by long no action, time for reflection sequences. Jackman and Steward performances were flawless, total contrast of characters to what was done previously. You metaphorically and physically see your favorite characters die. Naive plot with sanctuary for mutants was predictable from the beginning. Ending was sadly anticlimactic and foreshadowed from the start. This production is a total opposite to all other movies and in an attempt to bring Wolverine to the adult audience a lot of this comic magic was lost in favor of more down to earth concepts."

""Logan"" is the supposed final appearance by Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine, and if that is indeed the case, he went out with one hell of a bang. ""Logan"" is unlike any comic book movie that has ever come before it, its real, gruesome, unapologetic take on the genre is commendable, but most importantly of all, it has a big, hefty heart that it wears proudly on its sleeve, it's an emotionally gripping film that provides genuine surprises, this is a comic book film where no one, I repeat, no one is safe from the grasp of death, which is another commendable trait of this film. Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as The Wolverine, delivering his most refined performance as the character, other series vet Patrick Stewart and newcomer Daphne Keen are excellent as well here.

","As the Wolverine James ""Logan"" Howlett (Hugh Jackman) is fighting his nearing death, a young girl named Laura (Dafne Keen), who shares his mutant genes, becomes his saving grace.<br/><br/>Within this brief description lies the foundation of James Mangold's ode to comics, westerns and tragedies of Shakesperean proportions. One character in ""Logan"" is even called Caliban and he shares a similar function of sorts as Shakespeare's creation in ""The Tempest"".<br/><br/>With a tightly structured script by Mangold and his accomplished screenwriters Scott Frank (Minority Report, Out of Sight) and Michael Green (Heroes, Everwood), beautiful photography by John Mathieson (Gladiator), spectacular fight choreography and action set pieces, one almost gets the feeling that this film would be just as thrilling without the heft and legacy of its source material.<br/><br/>The strong performances by Jackman, Keen and Patrick Stewart, who reprises his role as Charles Xavier, are the logical extension of a well thought out movie, that tells a gripping story about parents and children, while making not too veiled statements about the world we live in.<br/><br/>The most existential questions, desires and goals are woven into a strong narrative, that by the end not only our thoughts are ignited and our hearts touched, but also our believe restored that if Hollywood makes an effort, it can produce works of great entertainment and staggering clarity.<br/><br/>This final chapter in the Wolverine saga, which Jackman carried on his shoulder for almost two decades, is now put to rest with a resounding measure of integrity and maturity. It has deserved its resting place among many other great genre pieces."

And that's the problem with this whole movie. Its no superhero/action movie. Its about adults who decide to die and make place for the younger ones. It has no real story. There are no real twists. You only watch an old man dying. The villains (Dr. Rice and Pierce) are not really deep characters and are boring. Not really enemys. The whole movie is a drama with a over-painted wolverine and with a crazy and stupid story. It is not a classic superhero/action movie with no cool lines and fun.<br/><br/>POSITIVE: + The movie has dark, brutal and very gory scenes (most brutal wolverine movie so far). Who likes blood will love this and i think thats the reason why its hyped. + Good performance of Hugh Jackman as Logan. Its his last appearance and he did great (Patrick Stewart too). So I think this is the second reason why its hyped.<br/><br/>NEGATIVE: - No Wolverine - The movie is a goodbye drama/western BUT no superhero movies (dont know why many people call it a superhero movie. It isn't.) - No funny lines and popcorn action - Many plot holes and no twists, this is very predictable"

"dave-mcclain","4","4","15","3 March 2017"," ""Logan"" brings Wolverine's story to a satisfying conclusion, but it's only somewhat entertaining.
","The Wolverine is one of the most popular characters in the history of comic books. He has been ranked #4 by IGN (Imagine Games Network) and #1 by ""Wizard"" magazine. The brooding X-Man mutant with the long, retractable claws and healing powers has been featured in several Marvel comic book series since the 1970s, not to mention video games, TV series and, of course, films. Hugh Jackman has played the character in almost all of the X-Men films, including three based solely on his character. In 2009, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" takes the character from his childhood in 1840s Canada through several wars and into league with Professor Xavier and the X-Men. 2013's ""Wolverine"" is set mostly in modern Japan and sees the title character struggling with the ""curse"" of his invulnerability. 2017's ""Logan"" (R, 2:17) is inspired by the 2008 graphic novel ""Old Man Logan"". It takes place in the near future, shows an aging Wolverine as anything but invulnerable and is intended to be the character's final appearance on film.<br/><br/>2029. El Paso, Texas. Wolverine / Logan (Jackman) is working as a limo driver. He's not the mutant he once was. Far from it. The alloy adamantium, which gave his skeleton and claws such strength, is poisoning him. He's slowly dying. And he's not the only one. For a variety of reasons, mutants everywhere are dying off and Charles Xavier / Professor X himself (Patrick Stewart) seems set to join them soon. Logan has Xavier stashed at an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Juarez, Mexico. A mutant called Caliban (Stephen Merchant) is caring for the ailing Professor and Logan brings him medications that he purchases illegally in El Paso. Xavier is suffering from a form of dementia and, when he has one of his seizures, the powers of his mind that had served him so well in the past, cause tremors and considerable discomfort for those nearby. It's not a happy life for any of these men, but it is a quiet, anonymous and relatively peaceful one. That is, until Logan's past catches up to him once again.<br/><br/>Logan is surprised to encounter Laura (Dafne Keen), an 11-year-old mutant who needs Logan's help, but he wants no part of her problems. Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse at a secret surgical clinic called Transigen, begs Logan to help Laura get to North Dakota, to a place called Eden, which is supposed to be a refuge for young mutants. Laura is being pursued by Transigen's evil surgical head, Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), and his ruthless head of security, Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), who has with him a private army of cybernetic soldiers called the Reavers. Soon, Logan has no choice but to step up and protect Xavier and Laura. What follows is a road trip from hell, with Reavers in hot pursuit, Logan and Xavier both suffering physically and mentally and with some major revelations along the way.<br/><br/>""Logan"" brings Wolverine's story to a satisfying conclusion, but it's only somewhat entertaining. The tone seems darker and more violent than previous Wolverine movies (if that's possible). There's plenty of action, including fight scenes with generous amounts of blood and gore, but the story is smaller, more personal and more emotional. It's a good mix of action-driven and character-driven, but can be difficult to watch. It's almost overwhelmingly depressing, the extreme violence cheapens human life more than most action movies and the frequent use of adult language (all of it involving children) is disturbing. Wolverine fans may enjoy this final chapter, but there are better action movies out there. ""C+"""
"nodlimax","6","3","10","18 July 2017"," Good movie - dragged down by politics
","I thought this movie did actually pretty well up to a certain point. One can relate to Logan and why he wants to stay away from other people. The R rating was also a good choice for the movie so it was possible to actually go all out with the action and gore during the fights. And let's be honest here. If you are hit by Wolverines claws you would bleed a lot and lose quite a few body parts.<br/><br/>His ""daughter"" did also quite well as a character and her being partially hispanic made sense to me after they said they picked up random girls of the street.<br/><br/>It fell apart for me when I saw the rest of the kids that have been used, because I quickly noticed one thing.<br/><br/>1. We had Asian boys and girls 2. Black boys and girls 3. white girls<br/><br/>Where was the average white boy? It looked to me they wanted to play the diversity game which means that they put as many minorities into the kids cast as possible (also opening plausible reasoning for later films with these new heroes) and therefore completely removing the average white cis male. <br/><br/>I don't like when people push identity politics into movies and I will call it out accordingly. For me this will also affect movie scores. If it wasn't about the kids cast I would've gone with an 8 or 9. To bad."

It's a brilliant drama as well as action movie and makes you care about the characters and feel emotion. All the cast was stellar and the action was, yet again, brilliant. It's a heartfelt and beautiful send off for Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as the character and a brilliant ushering in for the new generation of X-Men.<br/><br/>The type of people who will like this movie will be fans of drama, fans of action, fans of X-Men, fans of more emotional and dramatic comic book movies, like 'The Dark Knight' and fans of Wolverine.<br/><br/>Would Recommend.<br/><br/># POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was phenomenal as Logan and I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if he was nominated for an Oscar here because it was honestly brilliant. Patrick Stewart was magnificent as Charles Xavier and provided a much better and more heartfelt performance than McAvoy in 'X-Men: Apocalypse'. We all know that(hopefully) this will be the last time Jackman and Stewart reprise their roles as these characters and in honour of that, they made their friendship seem so genuine and emotional and doesn't seem forced at all which was amazing. Dafne Keen was excellent as X-23 and I can 100% see her being in future movies. Boyd Holbrook was great as Pierce and provided a fierce opposition to Logan. Dr Zander Rice was a really weak villain but that is my only real flaw in this film.<br/><br/>Beautiful and character driven story that neatly wraps up the Jackman saga and ushers in a new age of X-Men. The ending was flawless and pulled at my heart strings but I think that was because it had 17 years of emotional baggage backing it. Gritty and realistic setting which was really well done. It was kind of grounded in reality which is, yet again, similar to 'The Dark Knight' and made it more human and gave it more feeling.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent and some action segments were really well shot.<br/><br/>The effects used are passable but the minimal use of them makes it even better. Great costume and set design.<br/><br/>This movie was the perfect end to this era of the X-Men and while simultaneously closing this age, it ushers in a new one which looks very, very promising. It perfectly introduces X-23 so that everyone can understand her character and understand her emotion. The action scenes were phenomenal and making it a 15/R rating was such a welcome change and is very commendable. <br/><br/>The music was very good and, as previously stated, the change to 15/R didn't feel forced, felt genuine and greatly benefited the movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I adored this movie and it competes with 'The Dark Knight' and 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'The Avengers' to be my favourite Superhero movie.<br/><br/>10/10"

"sossevarvo","9","3","10","1 March 2017"," Logan - everything you want and more (and thank God it's rated R)
","Few anticipated the mammoth success of Deadpool last year. With a fraction of the typical budget for superhero fare, an audience-prohibiting R-rating (presumably box-office poison), and the lack of a Summer release date, it had none of the hallmarks of reliably profitable cinema. And yet, Deadpool hit a nerve. Positive reviews, gargantuan box office takings, and the collective adoration of most who saw it. It seemed that people didn't want their violence sanitised, and their action films humourless - who'da thunk it? <br/><br/>As with all unexpected hits, Hollywood learns from its mistakes and dutifully attempts to emulate the success of these breakout box office anomalies. After Star Wars destroyed the box office, countless ripoffs emerged, and similar things occurred after The Matrix, Jaws, Indiana Jones, American Pie, Paranormal Activity (blegh) and the list goes on. In the case of Deadpool this is a very good thing - Hollywood seems to be putting far more faith in producing big budget films with big R ratings. <br/><br/>Logan is the first to follow Deadpool's wake, and like its predecessor, it wears its R rating like a badge of honour. The curiously bloodless stabbings of Wolverine in his previous PG 13 outings are out - now we are treated to spectacularly gory Adamantium-fuelled fight scenes that are utterly thrilling and cathartic. Importantly, the violence isn't just cheap thrills - it actually serves to contribute a real sense of stakes to the plot, making you really feel and understand the mortality of these mutants, that violence is ugly, brutal and most importantly painful. We are also treated to profanity, which once again is not exploited, merely a reflection of Logan's age and weariness, as he approaches the latter stages of life. Aside from some uncharacteristic swearing from Professor Xavier (which felt gratuitous) and a scene with totally arbitrary bare breasts, Logan's R rating is effectively utilised for the service of its story, which is far darker, meaner and more mature than other X Men related films. <br/><br/>An aspect that really worked well was the inclusion of Laura, a girl with formidable powers that prompts Logan to seek heroic redemption and rediscover his sense of purpose (albeit rockily.) Steely, tough and mostly mute, Laura is the antithesis of a cute movie kid - she takes no prisoners, and leaves no throat unstabbed, a terrifically entertaining character. As such, her uneasy union with Logan is believable and unexpectedly emotional, grounding the film in pathos usually absent from superhero movies. Also adding emotional resonance is Patrick Stewart, in fine, gracious and ever so fragile form as Charles Xavier, who is reduced to a consuming neurological disease stemming from his telekinesis - he has easy chemistry with Jackman, complemented by the years of baggage contributed by almost 2 decades of X Men films. Finally to Hugh Jackman himself - he is a stellar vessel, playing Logan as he has never done before, with vulnerability, brusqueness and a surly resolve, he carries the movie amply with a layered, sophisticated performance that is worthy of end of year awards consideration (unlikely as that may be.) <br/><br/>In the first act villainous characters are effective, because they appear only as hired guns led by a menacing Boyd Holbrook. This simplicity feels appropriate for James Mangold's pared back, realistic vision of the X Men-populated world, a factor achieved through the grounded nature of characters, and very cleverly through the existence of X Men comics, almost implying that the films that preceded are an airbrushed, more idyllic, fictionalised version of the truth of the X Men. Critics have called the film like a Western, considering its setting, its brutality, and a particular scene that directly references Shane (1953). On these bases, the film proceeds with gusto, yet falters when far more melodramatic, far-reaching elements to the films antagonists are introduced. As followed through by a wasted Richard E Grant, the villains, and their back story, while interesting, feels incongruous with the gritty, realistic main narrative and its effectively more concentrated scope. It also adds more fat to the already bulging story, which feels bloated and not entirely coherent, at a slightly overlong 2 hrs 17 minutes. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a sequence involving a family who invites Logan, Laura and Xavier to dinner after they assisted them on the highway, and its culmination was profoundly irritating - as a result of the morally iffy actions of Xavier in particular it is very difficult to sympathise with him immediately after, despite the fact that the film seems to want you to do so. Nonetheless, the film builds towards a satisfying climax that feels like a fitting end to Logan's journey, that is unless Jackman decides to return once more. <br/><br/>In all James Mangold's film is bold, brash, gloriously mean and feverishly exciting ride that is certainly the most audacious and enjoyable superhero film I've seen in quite some time, perhaps since The Dark Knight or Watchmen, and few who see it will be disappointed. Logan delivers what you'd expect from a rollicking action flick starring Wolverine, but what you might not expect is an equally satisfying drama of characters and relationships, which explores age, regret, duty and redemption in powerful fashion."
"NerdUK","9","3","10","1 March 2017"," LOGAN - A blood stained, emotional triumph!
","LOGAN (Spoiler Free Review) Logan is a testament as to what can be achieved when a creative team is given the freedom to stay true to one of the most beloved comic book characters of the last 30+ years. In a world where Deadpool set the gold standard, Logan grabs the genre by the balls & delivers a master class in how it's done, even without all the bells and whistles, blood and chaos (of which there is a lot) that comes with it's R-rating. For fans of the Old Man Logan graphic novel, Mangold delivers on that familiar tone and feel in what ultimately plays out to be a gritty yet emotive character driven piece. We get to see both Hugh Jackman & Patrick Stewart give the finest performances of their often overcrowded & muddled X-Men careers and can only be saddened at the thought of the things that could have been if this was something that the franchise had offered in the beginning. However, we do get to see a passing of the torch so to speak with the introduction of everyone's favourite adamantium wielding, blood thirsty, pre teen clone Laura Kinney aka X-23 who is not just the catalyst to the entire story but the glue that holds it together in the most explosive and violent of ways....and we loved every second of it. Dafne Keen is a shining light in the blood stained emotional triumph that is Logan. This film is everything a Wolverine fan could ask for and more. 9/10"

","Stand out performances by all three main protagonists(Watch out for Dafne Keen), its a shame the script or the director didn't give them anything to work with.<br/><br/>I see where the movie wanted to go, An amazing character piece like the title implies, but unfortunately the movie didn't get there.<br/><br/>Wolverines character has always been heavily rooted as a selfless guardian. The movie set out to embody this theme whole heartedly. The problem is this theme, which had the potential to be amazing, doesn't get explored like it should have.<br/><br/>When the movie starts we see Logan(Jackman) broken down. He's resorted to alcohol and later we find he is intentionally letting himself die(Even though it is never explained how, other than that he is somehow ""poisoned"").<br/><br/>This is where the movie flops. It's safe to assume that his character is falling apart because of his failure as the mutant races protector. His character has a long history of struggling to come to terms with loss. BUT THIS NEVER GETS EXPLORED! The closest thing we get is one line near the end of the movie somewhere along the lines of ""Everyone around me only gets hurt"".<br/><br/>We never saw him come to terms with his failure, to reconcile or to even acknowledge that this is what is destroying him. Instead the only progression we see with his character is that he once again assumes the role of protector when seeing young mutants in danger.<br/><br/>We could have seen it explored in his relationship to mentor Professor Xavier. The one thing they share in common, the protection of mutants and how Xavier weighs Logan on his achievements and not just his failures like Logan himself does. They almost had a moment sharing a kinship over their failure to protect in the farm house. But once again, it never gets there.<br/><br/>Or the endless potential with his relationship to his daughter, which I would say is completely flat. (Throwing the word ""Daddy"" as a last ditch attempt didn't work) Instead we see Logan being reluctant throughout 90% of the movie, without any explanation as to why.<br/><br/>Its such a shame because there was such a golden opportunity for us to see Wolverines character fully fleshed out and to see the inner workings of his self-sacrificing psyche. The regenerating man, who sacrifices himself over and over, endlessly protecting the vulnerable and having to live eternally with the weight of the ones he fails to do so with.<br/><br/>But we just don't see any of that in dialogue.<br/><br/>All we see is wolverine being reluctant like he always does then finally coming to peoples aid, and not the reasons as to why he does it or how it affects him.<br/><br/>Which is what the movie should have been all about."

Charles dies in a totally meaningless way, and Logan dies in a nonsensical way. The girl hero and her young friends goes off into a future that is completely unknown. Are they the franchise reboot...replacing such great actors as Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, and Patrick Stewart? If so, we're looking at another waste-of-movie Power Rangers. So many questions are not addressed at all, and there is not even the typical Marvel trailer I was waiting for to do even a little bit of that. The gratuitous violence was simply disgusting, especially watching a little girl slice and dice people's body parts with apparently glee-- multiple heads included. It reminded me of the slasher horror movies of the 80s, truly, and children or young teens should NOT see this film. I can say this girl is likely scarred for life, doing this film. And it was all really unnecessary...other than promoting America's unholy virtual obsession with violence...domestically and abroad. Did the military contribute to the making of this film?

People are already comparing it to The Dark Knight, hopefully only because of it's quality and not because it has any kind of resemblance to Nolan's masterpiece. <br/><br/>Logan isn't just about Logan.. it's about Charles, Laura.. a new breed of mutants. Everything really. Sure, Logan is hurting and he's only a shadow of his brutal old self (which is funny, as this movie is as R rated as any marvel movie can go, aside from Deadpool of course) But he's not necessarily the one carrying the movie or even the team (which consists of him, Charles and Laura). Laura is absolutely amazing. The acrobatic brilliance she possesses, along with her raw power is reason why Logan can keep on going. Prof X however, is more an obstacle than an ally. He means well, but he has lost full control over his abilities and needs help in every area, including taking a bathroom break. <br/><br/>One thing Logan still has is timing.. amazing timing at that. Especially with the humor. It's dark, but brilliantly placed and i laughed a LOT during this movie. Which says something as the trailer suggested the ultimate darkness in the franchise was now reached. In some ways that is still true. But for a good laugh you will enjoy this as much as Dpool, just in a different manner.<br/><br/>Let me keep it at that. The movie is amazing and stands alone on a pedestal of greatness. It is worthy of all the awards it will be nominated for and has little weak points.<br/><br/>+ A very vulnerable Logan + Superb new role filled by Dafne Keen in Laura + Sir Patrick Stewart delivers a top notch, Oscar winning performance + Surprising cameo, which is not a real cameo but you'll get it later on + New mutants + Great humor<br/><br/><ul><li>Maybe the villain and the Doctor. They're not very interesting but i doubt it was the movie's main focus anyway. They did play their roles well though</li></ul>"

"slightlymad22","10","2","6","25 March 2019"," There Should Have Been Oscar Nominations
","Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to his last appearance as Logan/Wolverine in James Mangold's Logan (2017)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: In 2029, mutants are nearly extinct, an elderly and weary Logan leads a quiet life. But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he is reluctantly drawn in to his old life, as he attempts to get her to safety.<br/><br/>I love this movie. Heartbreakingly sad, so I do not watch it often, but every time I do, I love it. Personally, I think Jackman and Patrick Stewart should have been nominated for Oscars here, I was hoping for a nod for the movie and Mangold too, but it's sole nomination was in the adapted screenplay category.<br/><br/>Comic book movies, are a gamble if they're rated R. Which is why Jackman took a massive pay cut to make sure that this movie was rated R. It was Mangold who revealed he took a salary cut because he wanted to do an R-rated movie, he said the studio were not happy with the R Rating Jackman and Mangold wanted, so Jackman offered to drop his salary, to ensure they got to make the movie they wanted. And I'm glad he did. How many A-List stars would do that, these days??<br/><br/>Jackman was involved in this movie from the beginning. In December 2013, he said he was on the phone to Mangold talking about ideas for the final movie. Mangold later revealed ""Hugh and I have been friends for twenty years now, and he was there every step of the way. For Hugh and I, the first goal was to construct something more intimate. Hugh often brought up Shane and Unforgiven and The Wrestler as examples. I used those references, then I pitched to both Hugh and the studio that I had an idea for an extremely bloody Little Miss Sunshine.""<br/><br/>You can see the parallels with both Unforgiven and The Wrestler, whilst the characters are even shown watching the movie Shane. It's influence is all over it.<br/><br/>I have watched Hugh Jackman grow as an actor during this look back at his filmography. He has added layers of depth and films like Prisoners (for which he should have gotten an Oscar nomination) and Les Miserables (which he was rightly Oscar Nominated) have challenged audiences perceptions of him. Yet, in playing a character he has returned to over the years, he has now given his finest performance, a complex mix of regrets and self-doubt that reveals a Logan we have never seen before. Patrick Stewart is heartbreaking and has never been better. Newcomer Dafne Keen is all passion and truthfully, I would actually watch a spin-off movie/TV series if the filmmakers choose to go in that direction.<br/><br/>Is Logan more powerful because of what the superhero genre has delivered over the last decade or so?? Does it seem such a classic because it doesn't feel like a modern superhero movie??<br/><br/>There is no denying the modern superhero movie is mostly CGI, particularly in the finale acts which are almost entirely an end of the world, apocalyptic scenario filled with loads of destruction and plenty of explosions, but no real danger to the heroes. Logan has stakes that feel very real, brillint fight choreography instead of just computer-generated effects. Most importantly, Logan has characters you care about. It's not just a great superhero movie, it's a great movie in general. And don't get me wrong. I love a good popcorn superhero movie as much as the next guy, but Logan shows how deep one can go in the genre, if they just approach it in a different way.<br/><br/>Logan grossed $227 million at the domestic box office, to end 2017 as the 11th highest grossing movie of the year."
"harakolok","2","2","6","15 September 2018"," Why do they even call it ""Logan""?!
","I am very dissappointed by this movie, as from the most Xmen movies. This one was miserable, sad for no reason and inaccurate. Why did they even had to call it Logan? They should have named it John or Mark or whatever else because this had nothing to do with a superheroe we loved through Xmen. 
However, I have to admit that Hugh Jackman is an amazing actor. 
PS. Too pity they did not manage to make a movie that X-men deserve... They should have done amazing movies, like Avengers, but unfortunately, Xmen movies were all mediocre... :(("

"NormanCroucher","7","2","6","22 October 2017"," Uncompromising comic book neo-western packs a punch
","This down-and-dirty 'X-Men' spin-off takes its cues from classic westerns, specifically 'Unforgiven', and presents a compelling and surprisingly emotional take on cinematic comic book characters who had started to feel somewhat worn out. Ironically, this final chapter of the old guard rejuvenates what had become a stale and predictable franchise.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman reprises his animalistic icon and the role now fits him like a well-worn boxing glove, only this time he imbues Wolverine with such a sense of irreparable brokenness and emotional gravitas that it ranks as one of his finest performances to date. Patrick Stewart also shows us some of his best work as an ailing Charles Xavier, no longer the stable source of wisdom and serenity, but instead a fragile old man suffering through an illness of the mind that has robbed him of his dignity. If you strip away the fantasy then this is about two ageing men – one a fallen war hero turned washed-up alcoholic and the other a former community leader turned lonely, Alzheimer's-ridden geriatric. Together, Jackman and Stewart make for the most compelling and unexpectedly touching double act. They turn a comic book western into something of a fragile buddy movie cum pseudo father/son story and their chemistry makes the film work.<br/><br/>There are issues with 'Logan' that stop it from realising its full potential though. The first hour is almost without fault: it's affecting and tense, full of pain and anger and grit and snarl, punctuated by salty dialogue, soulful performances, and bloody, brutal action set-pieces that pull no punches. However, as we switch gears into the third act, things begin to fall back on formula, especially once we meet the 'big bad' of the piece and lose an old friend in the process. The film loses something as a story after that and devolves into more standard comic book action adventure fare, particularly with its woodland-set climax that looks closer in spirit to the ramped-up silliness of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' than the dusty, dirty western-inspired imagery of the previous 100 minutes.<br/><br/>But I won't get too bogged down in the negative because there is much to celebrate here. This is really brilliant stuff, commendable for the risks it takes, more so because it is produced by a candy floss factory of blockbuster entertainment that usually assembly lines its products to be sweet and light. And there ain't no candy to be found with this flick. It's bloody, it's brutal and it's emotional. It's everything you could want from a mature comic book film really. 'Logan' engages with its key theme of growing old both in tender and tough ways, so much so that you forget you're watching an 'X-Men' film half of the time, while director James Mangold finally fulfils the promise he once showed (20 odd years ago no less) with his own magnum opus and neo-western 'Cop Land'. Even with my reservations about the last 30 mins, 'Logan' is still a magnificently made, uncompromising superhero film that has absolutely no interest in being a superhero film."

With much less flashy CGI and colorful tight latex suites, and above all: ""Death"", finally! watching a superhero film not thinking: ""Nah.. all the good dudes will make it at the end"". to whoever took the decision inside Marvel to make this rated and focus on the story even if that could risk the huge ticket sales to kids..

","Wolverine is a character that has been loved and adored since his first appearance in marvel comics, but only one actor has given the character justice and that is the incredibly talented Hugh Jackman.He has been in many great films like Les miserable and the Prestige but many fans will always see the character of wolverine as his one defining role That he played incredibly. Out of all his x men films Logan is his most emotional and powerful outing as the character of all time. It is not just Hugh Jackman that shines but Patrick Stewart is also utterly fantastic as professor X. The Characters show frailty and vulnerability that the character has not shown in previous films. Dafne Keen is phenomenal as X 23 she says very little in the way of dialogue but she brings a father Daughter dynamic to the film that I think the film needed. The action sequences along with cinematography are fantastic and and it gives this film the grit that this film needs a good antagonist But Logan sadly has pretty cookie cutter Antagonist Boyd Holbrook is not bad in this film but his character feels generic and shallow and could stand a little more time dedicated to the antagonist overall but in the en this film is not James Mangold's masterpiece but a brilliant send of to the character that the fans deserve."
"thecrafts-66710","Null","2","6","5 August 2017"," Not What I Was Wanting to See
","Being a big Wolverine fan, I was very anxious to see this movie; even though I was saddened by the fact that it would be Hugh Jackmans last role for this iconic character which he brought to life. It bothered me a bit that it was going to be R rated because I know there are many younger fans who have watched all the previously PG-13 rated X- Men movies. The R rating was certainly needed. Parents beware. Besides the fact that the F*** word is used in almost every sentence, the gore is about what you'd expect from closeups of Wolverine combat. In the past you only saw a splattering of blood; her you see the heads getting lopped off. OK - that was to be expected for this rating. What bothered me the most was the grimness and darkness of the entire movie. Not the scenario or the enemy, but Logan's disposition and outlook on life. It hurts to see your hero reduced to a washed up drunk with no purpose or hope in life. Kind of like Batman in the last Nolan Dark Knight Trilogy. I""d have rather seen Wolverine in his prime, fighting for what he believed. It was like watching a different character. The same for Xavier. A sad finale for a great anti-hero."

When Logan first gives Charles the two pills and says, ""why don't you blow on them to make them safe."" That's when we were all surprised to hear Charles reply, ""F*ck off Logan."" LOL!!.

","As I read through the reviews I see a lot of polarity but very few 5's. My guess is the die hards are calling out the inconsistencies and newbies enjoyed the movie at face value. As a rookie to the franchise I realized fast that I should have probably not started with Logan but whatever,I did. Logan had appeal almost immediately. I was shocked at how fast the 135 minutes went by. The action, sound effects and lack of Michael Bay'ism was fantastic. (Michael Bay'ism = fast screen switch with explosive and incomprehensible scenes) I understand there are holes in every story that is stretched across a franchise. The most glaring one to me is that if there is a special bullet that can kill the Wolverine and his new daughter then why on earth is the military not using them?? IDK maybe this is explained in previous episode(s) but even if it is, I don't see why the good guys and the bad guys have a combination of one deadly mutant bullet between them. The acting was really good. I didn't realize how good Hugh Jackman can sell the tough guy role. I also didn't know that I could ever take Stephen Merchant seriously. Some of the kids could have used some lessons but hey they still did 1000 times better than I could ever do. Finally, for the people saying it is the ""worst movie ever"" just please shut it. Go out and get laid because Logan is an above average movie. I wouldn't call it very innovative but it is executed very well and it keeps you watching . So go see it but leave the kids at home."

","Logan/Wolverine is by far my favorite character, followed very closely by batman. i have read several comics on different time lines. He as a character is several centuries old, his regeneration not only applies to his physical body but to his brain as well, he is able to repair any harmful or degenerative mental memories, which is why his origin is extremely unclear. <br/><br/>Having said that in move into this universe of wolverine, one in which the admantium skeleton is poisoning him, and which for some reason protected him during a mental attack of the degenerative professor x. At this point the only reason i ask myself why this ending, the only reason seems to be that patrick stewart and hugh jackman could no longer prolong their characters and marvel must look at other artists to carry this legacy forward. <br/><br/>With this assumption at hand i am able to give this movie a rating of 9, for its captivating coherent and powerful in producing a decaying professor x and wolverine. I have read several comics in which they are almost killed especially wolverine, but his regeneration is too-superior and kicks in a few minutes after him being dead.<br/><br/>the director is extremely skilled and music is exemplary and suits into the background. am amazing movie a must see for 2017"

","It's been a very long time since the last movie can really touch me and definitely, this is the most emotional super-hero movie I've ever seen. I saw all parts of the X-men series and have grown up with it. But lately parts was not good as the others. I came to Logan with doubts and it blew me away! I couldn't stop from the first second to the last, all the feelings came to me, I hold my breath when they fought, I cried, I smiled, I was surprised, so many many emotions. Especially the moment Charles died, I cried (like I did 8 years ago when Dumbledore died), and I was sad for a while after that. Charles, the biggest brain of the human kind, died. Logan, the immortal hero, died. They died to save Laura and the other mutants, to give the children a new change to live a different life, the life that they desired. Logan likes a goodbye for a part of my childhood, the end-up for a stage of my life in order to create a new one with brand new hope."

Did my time go fast and with Logan, it went really fast. I loved it and it entertained me. <br/><br/>All the characters are great! Dafne Keen is awesome X-23 times infinity! She does it perfectly. <br/><br/>Now, I would have done a few things different. <br/><br/>1. I would have given more information on what happened to mutants and the status of what is happening to Logan. Is he sick...is he terminal....is he ready to die....is he lonely....does he miss the old days. Something, I just needed a little more. <br/><br/>2. More information about the comic books. Who is writing them and are they secretly being written by a mutant that tells the future or is trying to communicate to mutants and tells the future? Are they secret code to mutants? <br/><br/>3. All the F bombs weren't needed. It changed the characters from past movies. I applaud them for not thinking that Logan had to have a romantic interest because that gets so predictable. It wouldn't have fit in at Logan's stage in his life, I don't think he would have much feelings in that area anymore as he is cold and tired of it all. The extra gore wasn't needed either. No point in it, just didn't fit in those scenes. <br/><br/>4. I felt bad for the farming family. Wow...thanks a lot Charles! They should have known better than to stay there. Not that I need the happy ending, but I would have thought Logan, Charles and the girl should have saved them. <br/><br/>5. The kid mutants were too scared. They should have been more barbaric in the end. If the movie wanted gore, that was the time to bring it in. The kids were just like any other kids running from the bogey man and it was like they didn't know their own powers. <br/><br/>6. And did I miss something, but what was up with the robot arms?"

"Misha_A","9","2","6","14 April 2017"," Of broken men and broken dreams
","After watching the first X-Men film 17 years ago, I left the cinema thinking that this was going to be the greatest movie franchise of all time. Bryan Singer created a movie that wonderfully weaved reality with fiction, and managed to successfully imbue the gravity and threat of mutants to humanity. In the scene when Cyclops and Storm made their first appearance in the film, you can genuinely feel their extraordinary power. When Senator Kelly spoke about mutants who can enter the minds of humans, you could feel the menace of Charles Xavier when the camera slowly panned to the back of his head.<br/><br/>Alas, in the decade and a half since, the X-Men franchise never reached its promised heights. Characters like Cyclops, Rogue and Storm were butchered and trivialized, while Mystique (yes, Mystique) became the focal point of the X-Men film universe. The franchise's continuity and development also suffered tremendously with weak plots built on weak characters, time travel (!), and again, Mystique. I became jaded with the franchise, and I didn't even feel tempted to watch Logan in the cinema upon its release. Huge mistake, because, as it turned out, James Mangold and Scott Frank blew it out of the park, and Logan is the finest X-Men film since the original.<br/><br/>Logan is a stunning piece of storytelling. It is a story of broken men. It is the story of shattered innocence and the dreams of the young. It is the story of a father and a daughter. It is a story of a father and a son. It is the story of the last two X-Men with nothing left to live for aside from their convictions."

"Kingslaay","Null","2","6","28 March 2017"," Decent and enjoyable but lets not go overboard
","Logan is very entertaining to watch. We look at an aged and more vulnerable wolverine and later introduced to an even more vulnerable Charles Xavier. The maturity in terms of language, violence and darkness definitely works well and adds to the realism. The child actress, Laura, who plays Logan's unknown daughter also does a great job. The setting and story line also deserves to be commended as it was a unique look at the world of the X Men. We have gone from the limitless possibilities of the heroes in X Men First Class and Days of Future Past to a more fragile existence for the last remaining mutants. We are informed there are no mutants and Logan and Xavier are possibly the last of their kind. Unlike previous films that have seen Wolverine as a dominant force he is portrayed as a dying and often weak hero who is often on the receiving end. <br/><br/>However as entertaining as this film was it is not deserving of the over the top praise from critics. Some have cited this as the best X Men movie and some said it was in the same league as the Dark Knight. This was a good film but not one that was better than its predecessors such as X Men First Class or even Apocalypse. The X Men films have improved significantly in recent years but Logan would not be its best. The film often felt slow at times and the plot seemed disjointed. There was nothing overly unique about this film to set it apart. The story about creating future soldiers with abilities has been done before and there were no twists to be seen. Essentially it was a film about survival and when that fails we wait to see Logan die. <br/><br/>Critics and users can sometimes act like sheep and rather than see a movie purely for its worth their minds are made up in advance. This is a good film but not an iconic film, a strong 7/10."
"CountJonnie","7","2","6","27 March 2017"," Jackman and Stewart steal the show. A solid 7 !!
","Many might agree that Jackman is a perfect Wolverine, which he showed mainly in X-Men 1 and X2. Those same people might even agree that X-Origins: Wolverine and 'The Wolverine' might be terrible movies. The filmmakers defied the odds and made ""Logan"", an homage and farewell to the one and only Wolverine we know and love.<br/><br/>They made the brilliant move to stay away from the past and deal with the here and now (which is the future - no pun intended). Few mutants are left, but they created one brilliant and memorable part, flawlessly portrayed by Patrick Stewart: an old, sick and vulnerable Professor X.<br/><br/>The filmmakers gave Prof X and Logan more character and more depth, than any X-related movie has ever done before. The story is not complicated, but delightfully simple and focuses on character development and final choices.<br/><br/>Small spoiler: The only flaw in this movie, is that the real villain besides a hunky (and weak) Donald Pierce, is a clone from Logan. Logan himself has a variety of fan-favorite villains, such as Sabretooth, Sinister and so many others. I wish his farewell would have been a fight against one of those.<br/><br/>Even with the lack of that opponent, Logan is one of the better and more honest and watchable superhero movies of today."
"eden-rabatsch","9","2","6","27 March 2017"," Children of X Men - a fitting finale for The Wolverine
","When you have seen the world imperilled by blue lasers shooting into the sky for the millionth time and motley crews of superheroes destroy as much of the city as they save, we finally get a film that looks at what the humanity of being a superhero feels like. In so doing, James Mangold has created a masterpiece. ""Logan"" is the third film in the Wolverine trilogy but depending on the count, the 10th film that Wolverine has appeared in the X Men universe.In saying that, this film gains all the history and the depth that the viewer feels in seeing an actor like Hugh Jackman playing the same character for 17 years. This is important. When the film scales down to a relatively small gritty story one of the reasons it can operate so lean is that a lot of the hard exposition has already been done. It allows the film to focus on story and character and to do so beautifully. The setup is that it is the year 2029 and Logan is succumbing to years of adamantium poisoning. Despite his healing factor, he is slowly succumbing to the effects. Holed up with Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) they try to make ends meet and prevent Professor X's telepathic power ravaging the world as he slips into dementia. We also realise that it has been 25 years since the last mutant was born. As a species they are facing extinction. Logan is called upon to protect some children who were genetically altered to create a new form of X Men. However, they were an interim step to a wholly born lab creation, the X 24. One of these children needs protection and it soon becomes apparent that Laura (Dafne Keen) has a much more personal connection then first thought. James Mangold co-writes and directs and if you know Mangold's filmography the difference between the works he has written and the ones he just directs is light and day (I nearly wrote Knight and Day, one of his poor directing efforts). Mangold scales down the action but ups the reality - for the first time you see what those claws on a superhuman fighting machine would actually do to a human body. Mangold has taken direct inspiration from westerns, in fact there is a whole in film homage to ""Shane"", and that is the boldness of this film. It smashes the genre because it tells a story which could be told in a million ways but with superheroes, thus avoiding many of the usual clichés. If anything, it is when it falls back on them that the film missteps, such as the second act event when they take refuge at a ranch. The action which follows is not as resonant because we have not had time to connect with these characters. Jackman was born to play Logan/The Wolverine and being brave enough to show his degradation and every wrinkle just adds to it. Stewart is brilliant as Professor X and if this was November, it would not be too much hyperbole to think Academy Award. Caliban is a character I have seen a few incarnations but Merchant makes him his own and steals every scene he is in. But, ultimately the real star is Dafne Keen as Laura/X 23 who is amazing as li'l Wolverine. The attitude and physicality she exhibits is exhilarating. I only hope they make a sequel and allow her to bridge this to a more mature career. There is a resonance in this film that is beyond X Men. A film set in 2029 which opens on boorish Americans heckling Mexicans as they try to cross the US border and The Wall that Trump finally built, sets up a feeling of despair beyond the X Men dying off, like the great westerns it marks that the US is also withering away. It is why it is no fluke, that the next generation of superheroes are all born of Mexican mothers. Mangold is making a statement of what happens to cultures who don't embrace change. The closest analogue is the great Eastwood western ""Unforgiven"" in which at some point all the violence must present a price but I also loved the echoes of Children of Men. Great and interesting films often have lots of mothers and that is the case here. It is no exaggeration to say that this is not only the best X Men film ever but arguably competing with ""The Dark Knight"" for greatest superhero film of all time."
"altugozhan","7","2","6","27 March 2017"," Loosy ending for a great movie
","I think that nobody was expecting such a dark movie from marvel. Logan was like the dark knight of the marvel cinematic universe.<br/><br/>It's not a fully action packed adrenaline movie. Instead it was realistic, gory, pessimistic and post apocalyptic. You will be shocked to see such savage scenes from Marvel.<br/><br/>The movie shows you its dark pessimistic slow moving intentions from the first fight scene(a depressed drunk Wolverine).<br/><br/>The story is not great but okay. Hugh Jackman is okay, Patrick Steward plays one of his best. 'Laura' character is perfect. In my opinion much cooler than wolverine and you guess it's hard to be cooler than him.<br/><br/>The story gets tense towards the end. Mutant kids with super powers, wolverine, Laura and a superior genetically modified evil Wolverine. And you expect marvelous battle scenes in the end.<br/><br/>But unfortunately it fails to deliver such. Just kids, soldiers and wolverine running around playing tagging and slashing game.<br/><br/>And the emotional scenes in the end doesn't fit. Laura crying as wolverine dying calling him daddy daddy daddy. Definitely not good.<br/><br/>Long story short it's a good movie. I liked Logan more than other wolverine movies but it definitely deserved a much better last 15 minutes and ending.<br/><br/>Go and watch you won't regret it if you like Wolverine."

","An intense performance by Hugh Jackman was combined with an excellent character study of the Wolverine to deliver both a heartfelt and brutal film about mortality, aging, and family. The movie earned its R rating thanks to the visceral and vicious onslaught of blood, violence, and even gore. Without exaggerating, this is one of the best comic book films ever made and will resonate with viewers everywhere."
"Aly200","8","2","6","22 March 2017"," Brutally Triumphant Send-off to a Beloved Mutant Hero
","At long last the Wolverine film we have awaited was delivered to us this spring with James Mangold's second time as director for ""Logan"". The film delivers as much violence as it can muster in this action packed drama while giving us an honest glimpse into a much more aged Logan than we have seen in the past.<br/><br/>In 2029 most mutants have gone extinct and those who remain are in hiding from the human population. This is where we find Logan, now a chauffeur driver, retired from his glory days as a hero and with a chronic addiction to alcohol. He is also caring for a suffering Professor X when a runaway mutant girl named Laura enters the aging heroes' lives, commanding their protection despite Logan's bitterness and resentment in the dying world around him.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman returns in one of his most dynamic performances to date as the mutant hero he has portrayed for seventeen years. Whereas in days past we have become accustomed to the robust and powerful Wolverine, in this futuristic film we are presented with a world-weary and embittered Logan, a man who has given up and is resigned to his impending fate. When little Laura enters Logan's life, at first the grizzled mutant is resentful of the young girl and refuses to do much for her as Professor X bonds with Laura. However as the film goes on, Logan begins to see how alike he and the young child are and he begins to risk his own life for her. Jackman brings his usual bravado to the role as it is now the final time the Australian thespian is to play the famed clawed hero and his costar chemistry is undeniable from his father-son style relationship with Patrick Stewart as Xavier and at first a hesitant and resentful to a father-like protector to newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura.<br/><br/>Also appearing for the final time in his acclaimed role as Charles Xavier is the legendary Patrick Stewart. The English thespian is given a chance to shine alongside Jackman's Logan as the shell of his former self compared to earlier X-Men films. This Charles Xavier has become a delirious and frightened shell of the former teacher of mutant students, but there are still glimpses of his trademark wisdom midst the unhappy exterior. Xavier is the one who immediately takes the terrified and mute Laura under his wing while Logan continues to act disgruntled and resentful of the powerful little girl. However when Charles can no longer continue with the duo on their journey to take Laura to her companions, it is Logan's task to protect the little girl from harm while remembering his former teacher's wisdom.<br/><br/>A shout-out to little Dafne Keen in her feature debut as young Laura. The young actress is mute for the majority of the film's run-time, emitting only grunts and mutters. When the child does eventually speak, she speaks in an accent that is easily understood though her dialogue is a bit stilted in delivery but this is forgivable as Keen is a first-timer in the acting game.<br/><br/>""Logan"" finally does amp up the violence that had been missing in the past. There is no shortage of gory moments and brutal battle scenes that might make the squeamish viewers a little nauseous, but for the action lovers there won't be an issue. The run-time could have been shortened by twenty minutes or so. The story is taut and pretty well executed with tense moments galore while it does drag from time to time.<br/><br/>For all you ""X-Men"" fans, go and see this last Wolverine outing because you are gonna see something special in its own right."

","I thought this movie was great, it was a fair end to the Wolverine character! Logan/ Hugh Jackman did a great job as a actor you always can expect the best of him! The young actress was amazing too. I have the whole X-men collect and would add this one to the collection too but I was happy I got to see this on cinema too. I wont spoil anything but I really think all the x-men fan will enjoy this one too! Its a bit different then previous but in a good way. You meet an older Logan with all the new challenges that come with. Also I wanted to cry a few times at the cinema but didt thought I would just look awkward. I am really not the person that goes to cinema every month but some movies are worth it so this one was one of them anyways for me. Hope you all the rest enjoy it too. Thank you for doing this great collection of movies and for hiring the good actors that really did it justice!"

After Nolan's The Dark Knight, The whole idea about superhero film was completely changed.After that it's not just about some great action or chase, it's way beyond that.James Mangold's made us feel that again.Though people will say it's Marvel's Dark Knight, but it's not its Marvel's Logan.From the beginning the character Logan seems to be brutal merciless and powerful but you can feel there is something in him which will touch your heart again and again.I think the plot of the film is normal but what makes the film great is the way Dir delivers it.Everything is in rhythm.At any point of the film, this won't let you feel that it is lame or it shouldn't be done here.Jackman gives everything to portray this aged wolverine.From his movement to his loss of healing power, Hugh Jackman just nailed the character.If you ever have this feeling about wolverine ""There is something missing""(Well I never have), this movie will complete your desire. To conclude all I can say Logan is a very special film as it should be.Jackman' job appreciable."
"boyband-64483","10","2","6","21 March 2017"," Beautiful
","Make no mistake, Logan earns its tears. Jackman and Stewart are why Logan works-why the film doesn't feel like a cheap exercise in bloody violence, but a beautiful story. Strips away the spandex, the posse and the chaos, distilling the story down to the essence of the man, Logan.You don't need to like superheroes to enjoy this film, you just need to know that it will leave you welling up with tears and clutching your loved ones, which is a momentous achievement for any blockbuster indeed."

Finally a mainstream superhero movie for those who don't really care about superheroes, or have grown tired of all the clichés of the genre.<br/><br/>It's got R-rated action, it's got characters with some depth and also memorable acting, it's got heart. <br/><br/>It still is not deep enough to be compared to the quality superhero TV series, of which there are many. And it loses some of its dramatic heft near the end due to lack of variety (not enough different stuff happening, the same type of events are always recurring).

"gogarrett","7","2","6","21 March 2017"," Major violence, foul language and sadness abounds
","I read a few other reviews and cannot imagine how this movie could be called a beautiful swan song for Logan or Xavier. Logan is a grumpy old alcoholic with lethal tendencies who is soured by the horrors of his life. The story in this movie confirms that he has good reason to be this way. It was not my kind of comic book material. I only give it a 7 because it wasn't horrible as a movie. Just really over the top with swearing and horrific reality-based violence compared with other X- Men movies. I rate it less than other X-Men movies because the mutant powers are not shown as much as I think they could have been, other than the heavy use of claws. For example - Caliban was a pretty important character and I don't feel we really ever knew what his mutant power was. Certainly it wasn't just being sensitive to sunlight.<br/><br/>On a side note about Xavier. We saw him die in X-Men: The Last Stand. Then we saw him alive at the end of The Wolverine, at a time Logan was grieving dead Jean Grey. Logan looked surprised at Xavier's appearance but there was no explanation other than ""I have a few tricks up my sleeve"". I am wondering if this was explained in Days of Future Past and I just don't remember it. His death back in The Last Stand really hit hard and he was dead a good 7 years between movies, only to be alive up until the year 2029 and well, you will know when you see the movie."
"darkguardian-99861","9","2","6","20 March 2017"," Great movie
","So, while I have heard good words for the movie I was genuinelly distrustful at first. However, upon going to the movie, I can agree that all the good words do the movie justice.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays really nice his role. While the girl playing Wolverine Jr. doesn't talk too much, she seems wide-eyed and pretty believable. Also, Patrick Stewart plays an awesome older professor X that suffers from mental illness.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straight-forward and the action is raw, but amazing. There were also some emotional moments that will probably get you. Only flaw I can think of, is that it doesn't get too much into how the mutants got practically extinct.<br/><br/>To summarize, a really nice movie, that I can recommend and a proper send-off to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine."
"tlacoman","9","2","6","19 March 2017"," A blockbuster with a vision
","2013's ""The Wolverine"" is a dumb film with a brain, you can tell James Mangold tried to make something more than just the dumb blockbuster. Logan is that movie, without the dumb. It treats it's audience intelligently and never once panders to the mainstream. James Mangold really made the film he wanted to make. It feels fresh and full of spirit, unlike last years ""X-men Apocalypse""."
"oblais","9","2","6","19 March 2017"," Growing old, in blood and gunfire.
","First, you must know that I have not seen any other X-Men movies aside from Deadpool. I knew who Wolverine was and understood the basics as I went into this film but my prior knowledge was very limited. So I walked into the Cineplex and I watched the movie.<br/><br/>I honestly feel as if that is the only Wolverine movie I ever need to see. It was ridiculously good.<br/><br/>I'm sure the other movies are very worthwhile but the oppressing and dark atmosphere of Logan caught me by the throat and did not let go until the very end when it was now tears that threatened to choke me. Everything feels old and painful, the characters a shadow of their former selves. Hugh Jackman portrays a tormented Logan with such depth and power that you can only marvel at his fantastic performance. Before us stands not Wolverine, but Logan. Broken. Done. Dying.<br/><br/>The cast itself was flawless. Patrick Stewart's Xavier is saddening to see as an old and infirm man. Stephen Merchant shows us a very intriguing Caliban, not quite as pessimistic as Logan in his portrayal or attitude despite everything happening around him. And last but not least, Dafne Keen who interprets Laura with power, savagery, beauty, empathy and with much more talent then a twelve year old girl should have. And yes, it is violent and bloody. Extremely bloody. Lots of red. This is definitely an extremely violent movie, but in no way is the violence unnecessary. The atmosphere of the movie is so much more intense with your fear of seeing someone's head flying. Also, yes, Laura kills, and it's disturbing to see a twelve year old be so brutal. But never does the movie condone this and as Logan says, Do not be the weapon they made you. She is shown killing not to shock the audience, but rather to demonstrate how childhood can be lost.<br/><br/>There is so much more to say, but it would be futile for me to try to describe this movie any further. Go watch it. You wont regret it."

","In the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine, is dying from Adamantium poisoning due to his healing factor fading and spends his days working as a chauffeur in Texas. Logan lives with mutant tracker Caliban in an abandoned smelting plant across the Mexican border, where they care for Professor Charles Xavier, who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities to devastating effect. One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela Lopez, a nurse for the biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and a 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called ""Eden"".<br/><br/>After reluctantly accepting the job from Gabriela, Logan discovers that she has been murdered. He, Xavier, and Laura narrowly escape from her killer, Transigen's cybernetically-enhanced chief of security Donald Pierce and his enforcers, the Reavers, but Caliban is captured and forced to use his powers to track them. Logan and Xavier learn through a video on Gabriela's phone that Transigen was breeding mutant children using DNA samples from several mutants for the ""X-23"" project. Upon completion of the ""X-24"" project, the children were deemed obsolete and were to be terminated. Gabriela helped several children escape from the Transigen compound before smuggling Laura, who is revealed to be Logan's biological daughter, across the border.<br/><br/>While staying in Oklahoma City, Logan finds Eden referenced in one of Laura's X-Men comics and concludes that it is purely fictional. The Reavers catch up with them, but Xavier suffers a seizure and telepathically freezes everyone in the hotel, allowing Logan to kill the attackers one by one before injecting Xavier with a suppressant and escaping. While on the highway, the trio helps farmer Will Munson and his family round up their horses after a traffic incident. The Munsons invite them over for dinner, and they accept under the guise of being a trigenerational family. When a nearby pipe springs a leak, Logan and Will leave the house to fix it."
"cmerrittphantom","9","2","6","18 March 2017"," X-emplary!
","I was inspired by this film. I don't say that lightly. Most films I like are merely entertaining, but this one was something special. After hearing it compared to The Last of Us, I was ready to write off this critically acclaimed flick as a pretentious gloom fest with nothing important to say other than ""isn't it entertaining how screwed up the world can be?"" But after watching and completely losing myself in this movie, I really felt the weight of what I was seeing.<br/><br/>Lots of F-bombs, gory bloodbath sliced meat special effects, and general depravity gives this movie a punch that the character of Logan can thrive in. Hugh Jackman is a boss, and the little girl is just as savage. Patrick Stewart is heart-wrenching to watch as he reprises his role as the Professor, a lovably sad character who drags his heels at every shred of humanity left in the cruel cold indifferent world this story is set in. I found myself feeling for these characters like I never thought I would watching the other vapid adaptations of the X-men stories. I felt the characters were connected to previous iterations built in previous installments to the continuity. I saw the cynicism of James McAvoy's young Professor in ""Days of Future Past"" biting at the fray of this aged broken old man as he struggled to keep hold of everything he'd learned to value through the chronology of films. I felt the weight of all Logan's failures pressing down on the tired, broken old man Logan has become.<br/><br/>There are a few really cool concepts utilized as plot mechanisms; but the real meat of this story are the themes: Getting old... living through life, enduring failures, growing sick and tired of the fight and the grind to survive, being too tired to take care of loved ones...<br/><br/>We see the question posed which no one asks and the unsought answer bids us to. What is it that makes life worth all the suffering? The answer is a subtle theme that grows to culmination throughout this film.<br/><br/>We watch Logan gradually deteriorate, his health and will to go on fading, and we see him lose the ability to enjoy anything good. But if you lose yourself in that sadness you can easily miss the message of this movie, and come away grieving your own mortality. Yes, this movie is THAT potent. Unless you're a soulless monster with a complete lack of empathy, this movie will affect you.<br/><br/>Almost Star Wars-esque, ""Logan"" left me contemplating the concept of generations. It's the idea that even if I lose everything I've loved, even if I waste my final days sulking in my own misery, unable to bear the things I've done and the people I've failed... there's a final hope in the next generation. Even if you lose it all, you can still impart everything you've learned to cherish to the next generation, so they can have their time. We can teach love in a degenerative world ripe with hatred and indifference, even when we've come to that final resting place, having lost our own strength to love.<br/><br/>This is a powerful movie. I won't say it's changed me, but I will say it got me thinking about my priorities in life as of late. It's one of those movies. I didn't cry, but I know people who did, and it hit them hard. I was definitely more grateful for everything I take for granted when the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>It's not a flawless movie. There are times where I found myself bored and my mind wandering, mostly when the situation gets predictable. But the movie powers past its more tedious moments with quiet humanity and visceral action sequences, well shot, very well edited, and well-written... despite a nuclear holocaust of colorful vocabulary. The score isn't particularly memorable. I recall a couple big moments when I was wishing there were more of an impacting melody present, but the thought was a vapor in the midst of mastery.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece at its very best, and a compelling watch at its worst. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even when it lost me, I was thinking about the ideas at hand. The film challenged my philosophical resolve and was a sobering experience. This is the very best you can get out of a work of fiction. ""Logan"" is truly exemplary art."

","""Logan"" has created a gigantic expectation, and managed to overcome, a film of superhuman hero that you will see in life, with characters that go beyond your healing factor or claws, but rather characters who think, suffer and leave the box . ""Logan"" sacrifices a little of the dynamics and the factor of impressing in exchange for metaphors in his script, he is very good at not only creating an extremely charismatic character from scratch like Laura, but also in giving a three-dimensionality to Logan, since now he Is no longer a simple anti-hero, he is also hero, father, son and human, and also spectacular use of Xavier and the clever way Calliban is used, pity that for the villains the script does not have a room of the same care, We have a first definite act, a second that mingles with the third - which is very short - and obvious, full of reference to the other films in the saga, we see the story of Logan, a completely discredited mutant who constantly thinks about death, until A new hope arises, we have all the call of the hero, but it is that cliché of beginning that in the end surprises, and much. We have a photograph that has even westerns, always pulling for a warmer palette, a good soundtrack, although it leaves the country just for the credits, the set up is good and the way James Mangold uses the open plan is great, especially In the scene where Logan carries Xavier in his arms. In terms of acting, my favorite in the film is Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, even in a wheelchair, he is completely wonderful and at certain times until the rhythm of the film, Hugh Jackman is also great as always, and Daphne Keen owns a gigantic charisma even though his face is always closed, and congratulations to James Mongold, who has recovered from immortal Wolverine and did a great job. Obviously the movie is not perfect, far from it, using a clone of Logan reminds us of every philosophical question of his struggle being the interior, and I love it, but to the great public this sounds like laziness and even breaks the Rhythm, and the fact that the film follows a recipe created by himself also bugs a little, but his daring to show violence, kill without mercy, the animalistic way as Laura struggles, Logan having to stop for breath, are details that Composes the work and greatly diminishes its defects, ""Logan"" is a worthy film for both comic book lovers and the general public."
"jasonsharden","10","2","6","18 March 2017"," This Is How Hero-Flicks Are Done
","""Logan"" is the hero-flick we've all been begging Hollywood to make. It's visceral, honest, and uses the R rating not to exploit it, but to carry the story in ways that resemble that of the graphic novels these films are based off of. The characters feel organic and relatable despite their mutant abilities, and the action they get thrown into, though graphic and entertaining, don't come off as a distraction, but rather drive the story and provide growth for its characters. The acting is the BEST I've seen for a movie of this kind, with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart reprising their respective roles and giving the most passionate performance they can give, but the real MVP is the young and talented Dafne Keen. Her character is full of complexities, yet she plays this character with such ease as if she were born to be X-23. The film is beautifully written, with each element dedicated to telling this difficult story with as much grit and soul as a Western. This is how it's done, Disney."

It was not just a brutal action movie as it appeared to be, but the combination of a lot. And I was so happy about Patrick Stewart having so much screen time in X-Men again as well as I was charmed by his acting too.

It's a blistering installment in which Hugh Jackman gives his absolute all.<br/><br/>Although the screenplay here does have some occasional lulls, they are exceedingly rare, as the film regularly picks up the pace again and reverts to being the rip-roaring thrill ride that it opens up as. A sense of dread creeps throughout the film even when the soundtrack seems peaceful. You never feel in a completely safe place here, which is what gives it its intense edge.<br/><br/>This film makes no bones about the violence quotient. My friend who saw it with me described it as ""unpleasant"" which made me laugh. It's certainly not for the squeamish but if you enjoy fierce action sequences, you will love this film.

","So let me first say that I did love the movie, I've always liked the X-Men and it's been a fun ride with how many movies we've been blessed with over the years. That being said I was only disappointed that it felt like the end of an era / end of a run. We've got so many movies since 2000 with the X-Men that I've almost felt like I've got to experience this ride with them and it now feels like heartbreak to be done with them. I don't cry much from movies but I was brought to tears for this one, I was so sad to see how it all ended. I know not all movies get happy endings but I really was wanting to see them sail off into the sunset on the boat he was trying so hard to get.<br/><br/>I know it's just a movie but I haven't felt this emotionally attached to characters in a movie since the original Star Wars came out. I think it's because I've lived half my life and realize how short life actually is that it made me emotional as life could end any day out of the blue for anybody. Actually made me appreciate the time I have left and my health more. Life sure is strange to connect to a movie so emotionally like that."

","Hats off to director and screenwriter James Mangold for putting a real- life, gritty spin on the Marvel Universe. The film is about as real as you could ever expect a comic-book movie to be. Anyone who has seen an elder suffer from the effects of dementia can appreciate Mr. Stewart's performance and the interaction between he and Wolverine. And the young actress who plays Laura is incredible, her character's edge makes the movie tick. I just hope we don't read about her 20 years from now, her life spiraling downhill. I can't see how a young person can't be hugely affected by these roles. As one who spent time in El Paso in the Army, I can say that having the movie backdrop in this area of the country (as well as Juarez) really added to its gritty, edgy quality.

"thadpreslar","10","2","6","13 March 2017"," Hugh Jackman Does It Best
","There are lots of great actors that have convincingly portrayed comic book characters. However, I think Hugh Jackman is the best in my opinion. Especially, after watching this latest installment. I think this is mostly because he's a great actor, but also because he had fun doing it. He wasn't like many Hollywood actors that fear being typecast. I think he knew how lucky he was to get to play Wolverine, and never took it for granted.<br/><br/>I think even in a couple of the other X-Men films that didn't receive as high acclaim, his portrayal of Wolverine was spot on. He was and is The Wolverine. Logan gives the fans what they have been waiting for though it's pretty tough to watch at times.<br/><br/>My only fear is that to make a few bucks, some studio will try to redo Wolverine with another actor. That would be tragic and poorly received I think. It would be like doing a Dirty Harry without Clint Eastwood or a Forrest Gump without Tom Hanks. Bad move. I think Hugh went out on top but if by some chance anyone else plays Wolverine even in a cameo it should be him. Even if he's 60. He's earned the right to have his jersey retired."

","There seems to be permeating trends for comic books coming from ink and word-bubbles to being thrown up on the big screen. One of which, is to add a darker theme to an adapted, comic film. The Batman appeared more cynical than usual in his last flick, and the comic book company, Marvel, recently release Deadpool, the film about a foul-mouthed ninja slicing through hordes of bad guys to meet the end. The film itself was the first R-rated comic book film -- the 2nd R-rated comic book film being Logan.<br/><br/>Before viewing the film in theaters the other night, my only understanding about the movie is what I saw from 2 different trailers. I felt the same impression from the both of them: the main character is older, worn, and beaten, there is a young girl with physical abilities similar to him, and his mentor is even older, more worn, and more beaten. Furthermore, it appears the 3 of them are traveling somewhere for some reason. The whole thing was ambiguous for me.<br/><br/>So, there I was -- sitting there not knowing what to expect. The intro scene immediately caught me off guard in a way that said, ""Tighten the harness"". The first act took configuration to see the inherent story for why these characters are in the position that they are in. Not long into the film, the main theme of the movie was established and continued to pull me through the story-line. The acting was remarkable, and facilitated my journey with these characters. It was as if I was with them traveling to our destination in hopes of finding what was needed. I coveted more angles for fear of not seeing what was around the characters: danger or a shred of help.<br/><br/>As this movie is a 3rd installment, I expected to see familiar ground from its predecessors. Certain actions the characters make and the outcomes could have been originated from scratch rather than refreshing an old scene. At the same time, they were parts that seem natural in the real world – so it's hard to see them happen any other way. Next to that, the theme about a few people traveling great distances with pending death chasing them day and night, and no outside help has been an occurring one throughout media. Logan is a great example of a collaboration of artists using ideas from other artists, incorporating in their style, and coming up with something fresh and innovating. Again, you might see unoriginal moments, but sometimes the old is required to provide the new. The action scenes make no surprise for why is has an R-rating, and the profound story-line will grab your attention, intrigue you, and then pull you to the end-credits of Logan."

","""The world is not the same as it was"", nor will we ever be able to make it back. 'Logan' is the third and final chapter of the 'Wolverine' trilogy, and the very last for Hugh Jackman himself. James Mangold returns at the helm for the defining chapter, but does the movie deliver a satisfying end?<br/><br/>1. Following the present day events of 'Days of Future Past', there is no longer a threat of the mutant-terminating Sentinels, but that does not mean the future is bright. Set in the year 2029, the aged Logan, Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and Professor Xavier have isolated themselves in a deserted area near the Mexican border. With the sudden arrival of a mysterious young girl with powers identical to Logan's, they find themselves on the run and being hunted by forces with a devious agenda. The first positive thing about this, is that the plot is easy to follow. It honestly helps to have kept up with the franchise.<br/><br/>2. 'Deadpool' was the first X-Men related film to have ushered in a new age of comic-book violence, but 'Logan' certainly pushes it to a whole new level. The squeamish beware, cause when the claws come out, the bodies hit the floor in the most gruesome way. All credit to the effects team and James Mangold's direction, because the action is precise and you see every stab and slash when Logan or Laura/X23 engage in a fight. Apart from featuring an aged Wolverine, the story here is completely different. Also, even though it's set in the future, no apocalyptic events have taken place nor does the world need saving. The story is as personal as it gets.<br/><br/>3. No one should solely go see this movie for the bloody action, but for the superb performances and character arcs in this film. Hugh Jackman and of course the legendary Sir Patrick Stewart, deliver the best performances (as these characters) that we've seen in this franchise thus far. Compassionate yet heartbreaking is how I would describe the relationship between the two. Having known each other for many years, there is an obvious but silent father/son notion as we watch them interact with each other throughout. Another great thing, the movie isn't afraid to show the harsh realities of life, even for powerful mutant superheroes. There were so many times in this film in which my heart just went out to all these characters, simply witnessing their pain.<br/><br/>4. I hate to say a film as touching as this has flaws, but unfortunately it does. The first two-thirds of this film is absolutely brilliant, yet even with a simple story, things become convoluted. Firstly, a subplot is introduced in which Laura isn't the only child having been experimented on, and she herself has a mission to travel north and regroup with the other child refugees. This element does not lend a whole lot but rather distorts the personal story introduced in the beginning. Even though the children play a hand in the film's climax, I can't help but think it was only used to hype the action. When casting confirmed that actor Boyd Holbrook would be playing the vicious 'Reaver' leader Donald Pierce (as he is in the comics), I was ecstatic.<br/><br/>5. However, Holbrook's potential as a villain is completely wasted. Not only does he get little screen time, he is not at all intimidating nor does he feel like an actual formidable threat. Richard E. Grant as doctor Xander Rice turns out to be the true bad guy seeing as he is responsible for the forced experiments on the escaped children. However, the big reveal is that Dr. Rice has successfully created an exact clone of Logan, except under his control. This aspect comes out of left field and it's really up to the audience how they receive it. I personally thought this was a bad idea to introduce a clone as the antagonist seeing as they could have capitalized and not waste Donald Pierce as a character.<br/><br/>6. Lastly, it's hard not to talk about this movie without mentioning the scene-stealing performance of Spanish actress Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney/X23. Not only was she created with Logan's DNA, she definitely is the female version of him as in the comics. Their bond during the trip to find refuge is he only piece of thread that binds and saves the ending from being generic. The 'Reavers' end up being a faceless group of guys with robotic arms that are only there to be sliced and diced especially during the climax. With his body no longer bearing the capacity to heal, Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies not before Laura accepts him as her father. The sheer emotion of that scene captures you when Laura holds his hand as he lays dying.<br/><br/>7. Having been teary-eyed throughout, the final scene broke me like a twig. They gather around as she says goodbye to her father, but with Laura being the last to leave the site of his grave, she removes the wooden cross and positions it like an 'X' as Logan's headstone. That last moment caused the tears to streams down my face, with all that emotion came the realization that this beloved character that was a joy to watch since the year 2000... was now gone. As much as one might wish for a continuing story for Logan, this was the perfect end to which there is no coming back. Despite it's flaws, 'Logan' delivers and is undoubtedly the best 'X-Men' film we have gotten thus far. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine will forever be one, and his performances as this character can never be erased from our minds and especially our hearts. It surely hurts to see a beloved icon resign from glory, but as long as dedicated fans are alive....'The Wolverine' will never die."
"BecauseIAmBATMAN","8","2","6","12 March 2017"," Wolverine's last stand!
","Although Hugh Jackman was at his best in his final outing as the clawed mutant and Patrick Stewart's was great in his tragically powerful performance as a demented old Prof X, it is Daphne Keen as Laura Kinney (X-23) who stole the show. She was a cheeky little bad- ass.<br/><br/>While the action sequences with all the bloody slashing are intense and entertaining, the film mostly shines in its smaller character moments. At 2 hours and 21 minutes I never really felt the length, if anything I think it would have improved with more moments regarding the bond created between Logan, Charles and Laura. The film is atmospherically grim, quite bleak and the stakes here are more personal. This is purely an action drama in a western setting that never feels familiar with any other superhero film with some world ending beam to the sky scenario.<br/><br/>Although the film isn't without its flaws, the villains in particular are generically boring. But it doesn't matter too much in retrospect with Logan's journey. This is probably the best film to come from the X-Men verse.<br/><br/>8/10"

","With Logan, the wolverine trilogy comes to an end and it could not end in a better way. We can realize this only from the very first scenes that it's nothing is the same, many things have changed but Hugh Jackman is back to the role that defined him better than ever.<br/><br/>The trailers showed a different side of wolverine and in the end it proved to be fully enjoyable, mature and at the same time one of the best from the world of x-men. Finally we see a wolverine movie that it has an R rating and it earns it fairly. There are a lot of bloody scenes! (especially 2). The director James Mangold does maybe his best work so far while in the previous film i think he didn't give everything! It was a great movie but compared to this it's far from perfect. The drama aspect of the film makes a great combination with the action scenes that tie perfectly. The movie will definitely make you cry at some points and in particular as the end approaches.<br/><br/>Patrick Steward is once again excellent as Charles Xavier. He is just like Logan, tired and old but we can see even at these times that he still hopes for a better future for new generation of mutants. Oh and of course one of the greatest part if not the greatest part of the film the new addition to the universe of x-men, Dafne Keen as Laura - X23 gives her all and I'm very thrilles to see what's next for her character! As for the one and only Hugh.. what can i say.. we will never find a better wolverine no matter who will be next! <br/><br/>So my final thoughts are: Logan is a gem to x-men movies and it will stay in history of cinema for its diversity and guts. I think everyone will enjoy it even if you are a fan or not but as for the fans they will scream from pleasure!"

And when there is struggle to see its degradation is suffocating, when we expect a reaction, a return to the top, a sense of a new hope, everything fails. Only the girl who saves the movie, and the other children, besides, of course, good action scenes, but a sad and depressing film for such a vigorous character at its end does not live up to the franchise,"

To fully appreciate the movie, you have to grow along with the characters. This movie is not all about Superhero and Superpower (Although there's tons of gore blood and actions, trust me) but also a very human side too. I never cried in a superhero movie before, but this absolutely deserves it. I really really hope Hugh Jackman gets considered among the contenders for best actor in a leading role.

Much better than X-Men Apocalypse, where I could literally make out the set pieces and green-screens in the final act.<br/><br/>It is sad that Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart have both announced that this will be their final outing as their iconic characters.

"stroggos","8","2","6","8 March 2017"," Hyper-violent and grim successor to Wolverine 1 & 2
","LOGAN is a great successor to the previous Wolverine movies. It sets a darker and more personal tone, focusing in much more depth on an ageing and sicklish Wolverine who doesn't quite know what to do himself in a grim 2029. He ultimately finds purpose in protecting a small mutant girl, helping her to reach a sanctuary hidden away from the evil company that is chasing her.<br/><br/>The girl reminded me much of Saorise Ronan in HANNA, a movie that had a similar theme of a gifted and violent ""product"" being chased by her creators. Otherwise, the LOGAN combines the ""America's backyard"" imagery of movies such as HELL OR HIGH WATER with moody tracks and suspenseful plot. The screenplay has a lot of room for character development, but at times I felt the story was a bit trodding along, with sometimes no clear sense of immediate purpose. The action is great, but unfortunately the most powerful action scene is early on when the girl's powers are being revealed—the action after that is still entertaining but it doesn't quite live up to that first scene.<br/><br/>Of all X-Men-themed movies, LOGAN clearly is the most violent one, at times bordering into splatter. The body count is steadily rising and there certainly are quite a few beheadings, cut-off fingers, arms and legs, as well as many, many broken bones—brutal killings galore!! I abso-freakin-lutely loved the violence, but be warned: It might not be for everybody.<br/><br/>All in all a great movie, albeit with a few minor flaws!"

The movie has everything including: action, drama, comedy, tragedy, strong moral lessons, etc. The characters are much more down-to-earth and realistic. This is the most realistic ""superhero"" film that I have ever seen; as realistic as you can be in a world full of amazing powers anyway. If this movie does not win an Oscar or Golden Globe award, then something is definitely wrong. You will not regret going to see this movie because it has everything that you could want in a movie. Just be prepared to shed a few tears, because this movie is quite tragic. I grew up watching the X-Men movies, so this one really touched me. I can't put down everything that I feel for this film in writing because it was too well done. I was quite sad when the movie ended, and I will definitely be going to see it again.

"ericrnolan","9","2","6","7 March 2017"," A review of ""Logan"" (2017)
","I'm not sure I agree with quite all of the accolades that ""Logan"" (2017) has been receiving. (It's being compared with Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight,"" for example, as well as Frank Miller's medium-altering 1986 graphic novel, ""The Dark Knight Returns."") It's still a damn good movie, though, and easily among the best of Fox's ""X-Men"" series. I'd give it a 9 out of 10, and I'd firmly recommend it.<br/><br/>This absolutely doesn't feel like a ""comic book movie."" It feels more like a brutally violent, sometimes introspective, road-trip drama — though all of the comic book elements are still there. I'd caution comic book fans that ""Logan"" was actually much darker than I expected — and, no, it wasn't just because of the visceral violence that could only be afforded by this movie's unusual ""R"" rating. There was a lot more that went on here that got under my skin  I just can't say more for fear of spoilers.<br/><br/>There is one thing I can tell you — there is none of the escapism of past ""X-Men"" films. (C'mon, for being about a supposedly oppressed group, those movies always made being a mutant look fun as hell, and even glamorous.) This film follows an aging, ailing Wolverine, and an even worsely afflicted Professor X — subsisting in secret in the Mexico desert. What's more, they and their aging friend, Caliban, appear to be among the last of their kind, thanks to an unexplained, decades-long absence of new mutant births. And what little exposition is given about the other X-Men suggests that they are dead. If you've been a fan of these iconic characters for a long time, then seeing Wolverine and Professor X being so painfully not larger than life is jarring, and even sad. No matter what is the outcome of its story, this movie's plot setup alone can make an ""X- Men"" fan a little despondent.<br/><br/>The action is damned good. The movie surprised me by how smart it was, too. Its examination of violence and its consequences is unflinching. Also, we've been instructed through so many ""X-Men"" movies that humans should not seek to contain the mutants out of fear  yet ""Logan"" adroitly and subtly questions such one-sided moralizing. The acting, across the board, is extremely good — predictably from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, and surprisingly from 11-year-old Dafne Keen. She's perfect as the young, imperiled, yet ferocious Laura.<br/><br/>My complaints with ""Logan"" were minor. One thing that irked me was my own confusion about whether it was ""canon."" Are we to assume that this takes place in the ""X-Men"" movies' ""main continuity?"" Or is this a parallel universe or a different timeline? The feel of this film is so radically different that I found it difficult to imagine it following the previous films (although the post-credits sequence in 2016's ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" seems to set up ""Logan."") I thought that this was based on Marvel Comics' ""Old Man Logan"" storyline  wasn't that an alternate universe story?<br/><br/>Maybe adding more to my confusion, ""X-Men"" comic books actually exist in the universe of this film. Laura carries a bunch of them, and they are a minor plot point. Does this mean that the humans in this universe have finally accepted mutants, enough to create comic books about them being heroes? How did that come about?<br/><br/>My second criticism of ""Logan"" is that the character of Laura is thinly rendered. Saving her is the plot device for the entire film, and Keen is absolutely talented. Shouldn't we know more about her, and about her relationship with Logan and Charles?<br/><br/>All in all, this was a superb film, though — with an unexpected tone and a surprisingly sober, risk-taking approach to Jackman's avowed last appearance as Wolverine. If you like the ""X-Men"" movies at all, then you should definitely see it."
"Return_of_the_Porg","9","2","6","7 March 2017"," Emotional, transcendent and a powerful farewell
","Emotionally charged, violent and emotional are just some of the words that can be used to accurately describe this spectacular sendoff to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Logan transcends the comic-book genre to tell an emotional and rather beautiful story of family. Behind all the metal claws explosions and action set-pieces Logan's true strengths are the characters we've come to love for more than 17 years. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart give some incredible performances. But Jackman's work is nothing short of spectacular, he is at his absolute best portraying this beat down and old version of Logan. The movie does an excellent job of showing how Logan is tired of being Wolverine and alive in general. We get to see why his character is so destroyed internally and this helps us sympathize with this version of Wolverine more than any previous incarnation. The writing in this movie is also excellent, the interactions between Professor X and Logan are handled with so much care and attention to detail that the numerous references that are mentioned seem natural and unforced. The film also presents a great dynamic between Logan and Laura (the little girl). One of my initial fears is that she would be a sort of drag or an plot device kind of character. But not only does she have a purpose, every interaction whether dialogue or action that involves her is great and brutal. Speaking of which the R rating is more than deserved, this film is brutal. It does not hold back any punches and truly fits the narrative and the story that is being presented. My only complaint with this movie is a part where a lot of exposition happens, this isn't what bothers me, what bothers me is how the information is delivered. I don't wanna spoil anything but it is nonsensical and it took me out of the movie for a while. Overall I consider Logan as my favorite comic-book film ever made. It was a fitting,beautiful and emotional send off to one of the most beloved actor/character combination in cinematic history. I'm curious to see where the character will go from here. 9/10"

Fighting crime holds no appeal these days and would rather suck on booze and mindlessly drive a limo for God knows who.<br/><br/>Enter Dafne Keen as Laura.<br/><br/>What a treat. I can't think of many supporting actors at such a young age who can knock it out of the park as she does in this film.

","Trying to find a great film in the midst of all the cliché films of modern times is hard to do sometimes, even among my favorite genres, and sadly yes, even within my favorite franchises.<br/><br/>The Marvel Films are generally pretty good, and that is a lot of material. There's the Cinematic Universe with Avengers, then of course you got the Fantastic Four movies and Punisher films...did I leave anything out? Oh yeah...the X-Men movies have always stood out to me out of all the other Marvel films, because they had a tendency to be more sci-fi than superhero fiction. Not that I don't like superhero fiction, but X-Men has always been more sophisticated to me, and seeing this movie, and realizing it was going to be the last true X-Men film was kind of sad.<br/><br/>There'll be others, but not with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Technically this isn't an X-Men movie...not in the strictest sense. It marks an end to the Wolverine trilogy, and it is easily the best of the three.<br/><br/>The franchise will never be the same. Even when more films are made, Wolverine won't be in it. I wasn't a fan of last years film so much either. I wasn't impressed with Apocalypse and it just really wasn't all that great of a movie. They did some cool stuff I suppose, but I feel like a lot of what X-Men films used to be about have been replaced with visuals and spectacular action sequences. Oh yeah, and Jennifer Lawrence of course. I really don't see where the film franchise is gonna go, especially since Logan can't even cameo anymore.<br/><br/>But enough about the seemingly negative future that hasn't happened yet. Even if this is the end of the X-Men franchise as we know it, it went out in a blaze of glory. No post-credit scene, it was really an end, and a fitting one at that. I couldn't ask for a better story, although I have to admit I may have been a little disappointed we still didn't get to see Omega Red. In any case, I was happy with the family aspect of the movie, and I thought that there were a number of important scenes in the film...the family with the horses, the X-Men comics, and of course the convenience store scene. X-23 in her cute little sunglasses and munching on Pringles. That was hilarious. I can't explain it, but it was just very much a work of art.<br/><br/>I don't know what the future has in store for this franchise, but here in the present, things are looking good. It was a great film. It was beautiful, bold and a little funny at times. Check it out."
"peefyn","8","2","6","7 March 2017"," Consequences
","It's about time for the X-men franchise. They were early pioneers in the modern day superhero movies, but they didn't evolve, and were outshined by the MCU-productions that elevated the genre to a new level. Light hearted superhero action films are now a dime a dozen, and no one does it better than Marvel studios.<br/><br/>Nolan brought Batman in the opposite direction, in stead of light hearted, he made films that took themselves seriously. Later DC movies continued this trend, with Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. The X-men franchise reacted to this (and the Marvel movies) by going in a completely different direction: Deadpool, a movie that doesn't take anything seriously. Its success could easily a unraveled the entire franchise into ""edgy"" Deadpool-like movies, but instead they opted to make a movie that not only takes superheroes seriously, but takes itself seriously. With Logan, there's an X-men movie that does not shy away from the bleak, and exploring the actual consequences of the themes they've already been rambling about for several movies.<br/><br/>Logan is a dark and bleak movie. There are fun scenes and a healthy dose of black comedy, but it's mostly a movie that beats up both the characters you've gotten to know, and the ones you've just been introduced to. And it shows how everything in the fictionally world they're in have consequences. It's not just another movie that you watch, and at the end nothing much has changed. It's a result of a divided world, the extreme suppression of mutants, and so on. Obviously what happens in the film will also have consequences for the characters involved in it, and while this is hinted at, I think they could have gone further in exploring how the extreme violence would/could affect the young characters in the film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is good, the visuals are sometimes really good, and the acting is fantastic. Both Stewart and Jackman blows it out of the park."

","There is very little you can nitpick about this film. I loved every minute of it. The film is over 2 hours long, and it never feels like it. From start to finish, the movie is paced so well. I saw the 2013 Wolverine, while is wasn't a bad film, it's story wasn't all that interesting to me. This time however, James Mangold returns and he's so much better and I believe a lot of credit for the improvement should go to the scrip.<br/><br/>While many might categorize this movie as a comic book film, which it certainly is. I believe it's a father-daughter love story and we see their relationship progress over the course of the movie. The character moments between Logan, Charles and X-23 are so beautifully put together, I never felt like I was watching a movie. And that to me, is a sign of a great cinema. The child actor they chose to play X-23 commands the character with complete justice. Kudos to the casting agents for recognizing her talent.<br/><br/>The climax is extremely satisfying, and the stakes have never been higher for Logan. To say that I was at the edge of my seat might be an understatement. I felt like crying at the very end. You follow these characters in their journey and when we approach the very end, it's a deeply personal and emotional moment for Logan and for the those who have been watching Hugh Jackman on screen for 17 years playing the role. <br/><br/>Finally, I want to say that Logan is a bittersweet film. Bitter because it sucks to see Jackman for the last time because he owns the character in every way possible. Sweet because it's a fresh change from the similar kind of comic book movies being produced each year to appeal to the masses. It's not a bad thing to appeal to the masses, but that's not what I enjoy anymore. Thank you Fox for making such an awesome movie!"

","""Logan"" is a touching character study exploring and extending on loss, regret and grief while coming from an already established universe. Yet the most unique and special thing this film does is detracting from the usual conventions of the genre that some would say this franchise started back 17 years ago. Logan was not afraid to break conventions just like what 'Deadpool' did however in a more satirical way, this film presents the bleak, the desolate, the ravage, all with fully formed characters that are fed up with the world in a Western esque adventure.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"" serves as a callous and hard-hearted protagonist that has basically reached his breaking point. The opening sequence alone shows the brooding nature of the character that Jackman has portrayed for almost 2 decades now. The brutality of the film is something to revel, even though it has pretty much been expected given the R-rating, the film hits the bar high up and doesn't hold back at showing us each brutal moment leaving no time at all for the audience who have grown fond of the usual PG-13 action to adjust and it is quite glorious. The beauty of the film lies in its portrayal of each character in this new post-apocalyptic world. The new dark and wretched environment in of itself is a smack to each character in the narrative and also a smack to the audience. It's in 'Logan' wherein we once again get a film, just like 'The Dark Knight' that values characters, values layering and adding more depth to them and values the consequences that each individual has had to go through and does not hold back at what it may mean for the story or even the franchise in its entirety no matter how bold, appalling or shocking it may be. Both Stewart and Jackman give their best performance and show how much they are percipient about their characters. Even after 17 years, this is probably the best and truest of all perspectives we've gotten of Logan and Charles. Sure we got both their origins from their respective movies, but this a movie where we see them having to face with demons that haunt them and them struggling to face life and the perils it has brought upon them. This is a film where we finally see them both in their breaking points and have them reach an in-depth progression of their characters. Logan is definitely not the same in the end compared to how he was in the beginning, Jackman's performance is packed with strong emotional subtleties and nuances for every shot he's in, the same goes for Stewart as his character suffers from Alzheimer's and the fact that he cannot recall or properly remember the destruction he accidentally caused. These are two very tortured people and we learn a lot more about them here than we did in their origins, this is who they are when they're faced with nothing left, this is who they are when they're faced with small glimmers of hope, and this is who they are when they're helpless. Stewart and Jackman both gave a fitting send off to their characters and dare I say it, at least one of them deserves an Oscar. Dafne Keen is wonderful and a joy to watch as X-23. Similarities to Eleven from 'Stranger Things' aside, it's lovely to see a little girl wrecking and slicing people through very unpleasant means. Hopefully she does not get replaced by an older actress if they ever plan on casting for the inevitable X-23 movie soon since she seems well adjusted to the role. Boyd Holbrook plays Pierce and is menacing and sinister while standing toe-to-toe with Wolverine. What we get from him in the film is what we get and his menacing persona and robotic arm might be enough for some and lacking for others.<br/><br/>The story is intimately simple and easy to follow, it's personal, small scale yet devastating, heartfelt yet ravaging. With narrative call backs to the old classic westerns and some similarities here and there to Mad Max: Fury Road, the film feels special in every step of the way. Shots that linger on characters in silent moments, being patient with how the character unveil its new self, being meticulous on having soft pans and quiet shots to stop and show the bleakness or even the hopefulness of Logan given all the odds stacking against him. The cinematography compliments the narrative as each scene looks excessively like a western and evokes a mood that leaves you thirsty and helpless as the brutality unfolds. The irony is, this film probably presents the most life threatening and intense challenge for the X-Men that makes you feel and eventually care for them, and it does not involve any world ending device or overpowered character like in the previous films of the franchise. Instead, the film opts to be thoughtful and understands what it needs to be to make a proper character driven movie. It's as thrilling and exciting just like any other blockbuster should be, but it's also dark, deep, raw, devastating, surreal, exhaustive, insightful and sincere like any other great movie should be.<br/><br/>Verdict : 5/5"
"valdavisjr","10","2","6","6 March 2017"," I'm at a loss for words....
","I went to see this movie on opening night. Logan was in my top 3 most anticipated films of this year and I've always loved Wolverine, and think he is a very complex character. That being said, when I heard about the possibility for an R rated take on the character from the comics, I got excited. So I was really looking forward to this movie. And I got to say, walking out of that theater I was completely blown away. This movie is amazing. There are no words to describe how much I love this film. It's been two days sine I saw it and I still cannot stop thinking about it. This is one of those films that you may think about a lot after you see it because it just leaves this intense impact on you. I'm gonna go as far as to say this is my favorite comic-book movie of all time because it's way better than The Dark Knight and every other superhero film that has been put up there. It is just that good. <br/><br/>My favorite thing about this movie is the fact that it doesn't even feel like a comic book movie or superhero film, it feels more like an indie film with comic book characters in it with very little reliance on CGI. Yes there is CGI in this movie but it is kept at a very low minimum as this movie relies more on realistic stunts and practical effects than CGI. Another thing I want to touch on in this film is its R rating. Holy crap, fox really didn't hold anything back on this one, this movie was brutally violent with so much blood and limbs and I loved it. Wolverine goes absolutely crazy as he tears into these guys and kills all these men like he does not care, along with X-23 who may I say is just awesome, and one of the best parts of this film. Not to mention this movie has two of the most violent action scenes I have ever seen in a superhero film one of which takes place on a farm. You will know what I am talking about when you see it because that is some dark, and brutal stuff. Another thing I gotta praise this movie for is the amount of drama and heart surrounding the story and the characters. I mean I have never seen a superhero film with so much heart as this movie had. There is some action in this film but the point is that it's not the basis of the movie. This is a very dark, bleak, character driven film where the focus is more on the drama of the situation with a lot of heart surrounding it. This is not your typical superhero film and if you were expecting some Avengers type CGI fest like some of Marvel's films you're gonna be disappointed as this movie is more of a drama with a great message about family and what it means to be human. But this film has some of the best action sequences I have ever seen in a movie and these action scenes combined with the drama of the film make this one hell of a movie. And the last thing I want to mention is that the way this film ended was one of the most satisfying, and fantastic finales to any film I've seen and I have never felt so satisfied after watching a movie in my life. <br/><br/>So overall this is just a downright awesome film that is very different from other superhero films in the past. Great action, great characters that are well realized, great drama and story, and a great final film for the character of Wolverine as well as an excellent final performance from Hugh Jackman in the role. This movie did everything I wanted it to do and it was everything I wanted it to be. I have no flaws with this movie at all. This really is ""The Dark Knight of the X-men films."" I love this movie, I adore this movie, the more I think about this movie the more I continue to love it, and it has officially gone down as my favorite comic book film of all time. It's a film that is powerful, and inspiring and it leaves a LONG lasting impression.<br/><br/>10/10"
"christonr-64261","7","2","6","6 March 2017"," Little Miss Wolverine meets Withnail & I
","The eighth (and final) appearance of Hugh Jackman's infamous Wolverine sees a huge shift in tone from its predecessors in reimagining Mark Millar's graphic novel 'Old Man Logan'. 17 years on from his first outing in X-Men (2000), here the shackles are very much off; with an incredibly sweary, violent and surprisingly political faux-Western chronicling the (so-called) lives of an increasingly aging/dying James 'Logan/Wolverine' Howlett and senile, aggressive and embittered Professor Charles Xavier. The relationship between the two men is near-heartbreaking and it is hard to fully fathom the complete journey which has led both veterans to the state of sad despair in which we find them.<br/><br/>However, once the main plot of the film really kicks into gear – a cross-country road trip/pursuit – there are moments of real melancholic clarity, joy and reflection; none more so than Charles' advice ""This is what life looks like You should take a moment."" All of the main protagonists go through visible character journey arcs in emotionally, physically and spiritually; but the real heart of the film is in the core relationships formed between Logan, Charles and ""X-23"" Laura, wherein the dynamics are constantly shifting according to each character's own baggage which they are bringing to the fold. This is immensely impressive, especially considering the limited amount of dialogue used to express feelings, thoughts and emotions. There is absolutely no fat on the plot and much is left unsaid; but very much to a successful and intended effect. Despite its positives, there are still times when the 2hr 17min run-time is felt and moments wherein the pacing does feel a little off due to unnecessary splicing of seemingly insignificant scenes or encounters; likewise there are other moments which end abruptly and without enough breathing room to really allow character interactions to fully form and resonate. On the whole though, the Deadpool-esque extremity of bloody gore, graphic violence and incessant cursing probably leads this to be the best incarnation of the X-Men franchise to date."
"filmsbyq","9","2","6","6 March 2017"," Logan - Go And See It Now!
","As a big X-men fan - collected the comics throughout the golden Chris Claremont era - and a would-be screenwriter and filmmaker, I have watched all the Fox iterations of X-men films and their connected films. Even though Bryan Singer strayed somewhat - okay, massively - from the source material, as films his first two were good. He even returned to save the franchise after the God awful Last Stand. <br/><br/>So when he made Days Of Future Past, making Wolverine the central character it was, though not right, a good film, but not right. He then followed up with Apocalypse and made Raven a hero. A hero! It is an enjoyable film and I did enjoy it, but it is plain wrong. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has become world famous playing the most popular character of Wolverine. The fact that he, at six-two, is a full eight inches taller than the character Wolverine he was portraying, mattered little after his scene-stealing performance in the first X-men film. Jackman was Wolverine. Jackman, more than any of the other actors, had embraced the spirit of his character.<br/><br/>So popular was his portrayal, it was inevitable that he would get a solo spin-off project. He did. Twice. <br/><br/>The first, an origin story, was poor but, for myself, enjoyable enough. The second was just awful, so bad. When it was announced that Hugh Jackman was doing only one more Wolverine film, it was strange, though not unexpected. All the other X-men, previously played by other actors have been replaced, so it seemed inevitable that he would be replaced by a younger actor, even though the character in the comic is never young. <br/><br/>Extraordinarily, The Wolverine was directed by James Mangold, a filmmaker with an impressive track record in film, having directed Copland, Walk The Line and Girl, Interrupted among others. <br/><br/>The fact that he returned to make Logan is mind blowing. Truth is, had I realised it was the same director of the risible The Wolverine, I would have been reluctant to watch Logan. Thank the lord I did not! Logan is a fantastic film. In look, feel and execution, it just gets everything right. The rating of R for a Wolverine film is perfect. The claws are in full effect in this film and how! This film is every X-men/Wolverine fans wet dream of a film. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved this film and will probably go and see it again. If this is Jackman's final bow as the Wolverine, not only do I pity the actor who has to follow in his footsteps, but what a way to bow out. Go see Logan."
"Fedoics","8","2","6","6 March 2017"," One of the best, well written, emotional, and action filled super hero films ever.
","Logan is truly amazing.<br/><br/>I've been excited for Logan for a very long time, the idea of an older, more stern, grittier wolverine is an amazing idea that you can go a long way with. Logan took that idea and made a fantastic film.<br/><br/>Here's the good, and there's quite a few.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is fantastic. Hugh Jackman does a fantastic job as always playing Logan. He really went deep into his character, bringing out one of the best performances of his career. Patrick Stewart was also amazing as always playing professor X. He didn't act his age throughout the entire film, really doing a good job making the audience think he's in his 90s. Newcomer Dafne Keen is the breakout star of this movie, pulling off an amazing character. Child actors aren't always good but Keen is magnificent as her character, really pushing the film to be amazing. Overall, everyone in the movie did a fantastic job acting.<br/><br/>The cinematography and lighting in this movie was beautiful. The lighting set a tone for each scene whether it be the dim lit area where professor X spends most of his time or a neon light illuminated action scene. The cinematography gives the movie life with each shot. The way it's filmed is expertly done and looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>The story's plot is well written, interesting, and isn't something we normally see in a superhero film. The movie didn't shy away from taking risks, it didn't hold back with violence, and it wasn't scared to make the audience cry. The movie follows an older Wolverine who is taking care of an even older Professor X. Beaten and driven down from his past and his healing factor slowly fading, he must help himself and the ones he cares for. The movie has a great chemistry between Logan and Laura. The movies especially shined when the two were on screen together.<br/><br/>Here's the bad.<br/><br/>Here's my only gripe with the movie, it can be slow at parts. The pacing is a bit of an issue towards the middle but not for long. Other than this, I didn't have any other problems with Logan.<br/><br/>Overall, Logan is a fantastic film, pushing a touching story, great acting, beautiful cinematography, and unique lighting. While it may suffer from pacing issues towards the middle it never took away from the overall narrative of the movie. Logan is something special, something we haven't quite seen from a superhero film. I'm excited to see what the X-men franchise has for us in the future."
"robtucker-18482","10","2","6","6 March 2017"," Perfectly executed to a newcomer of the X-Men series
","Going into this film on Friday 3rd of March at the cinema with 6 friends, I had very little idea of the events to have happened in previous X-Men and Wolverine films especially considering how much my friends knew about these two things so wasn't sure what to expect. I knew it was R rated and saw the trailer for the first time one day I watched Logan. The start was straight into the action with a brief understanding of Logan being older than what fans are used to. Things continued but the movie really shines when X-23/Laura comes along and changes it up for the better. She is (at first) incredibly innocent, things change and she becomes a wolverine (clone-daughter) like child who still has those moments of innocence that is completely essential to her young character. The death of Professor Xavier is incredibly surprising but dreamlike as if it isn't happening. The progression of the film at one point felt slow as it was happening but once it came to a physically, mentally and emotionally draining end, I just wanted to cry (which I would have done if I was on my own) and the pacing felt absolutely fine as opposed to my original thoughts whilst watching it. The star of the film is definitely Dafne Keen as X-23/Laura who completely owned it. Although she spoke for only the last half of the film, mostly in Spanish but still plenty of English to go around, her acting skills are phenomenal and took the words from the title of an X-23 comic called ""All new Wolverine"", applied it to her own X-23 and cemented it to the film series of X-Men which is amazing. Her overall performance is beautiful especially considering how she has had one previous accreditation (in a TV series called The Refugees, alongside her real life father Will Keen) but also considering how perfect Dafne Keen is to play X-23. Although X-23 may be a psychotic angry but usually innocent character, Dafne Keen is the complete opposite in real life which is full proof of her acting ability. Completely separate from her acting ability is how Dafne Keen is an English and Spanish speaking child who is a Gymnast which is what the casting team was looking for. The element of her being both right for the role as X- 23 because of her acting and because of her real life attributes, she was and always will be perfect and the only person who could and should play as X-23. Through watching Logan, I have realised how obsessed with this film I really am. Dafne Keen as X-23 held me close to this film as I possibly could be and because of that, I am super grateful of her performance and now a massive fan of her current and future work. I can't wait for everything she will do later down the line which I will definitely watch no matter what it's about. If Dafne Keen didn't play X-23, I wouldn't have liked the film so she is essential to it for me. I'm 100% going to re-watch Logan (which I never do with films) and this time cry at the ending. Also please, I need more Dafne Keen as X-23 so give her to me in any way shape for form, just don't ever kill her character, please."
"NoelKardaris","10","2","6","6 March 2017"," What a way to say goodbye!
","This is by far the best X-men movie to date. Wolverine Fans have long wanted to see an R-Rated Film like that. I think ""Logan"" is a terrific way to say goodbye to the character and fans get to see everything that they expect from this movie. The theme is dark, the Story is solid and the performance from all actors is great, especially the landmark performances from Jackman and Stewart. Dafne Keen has a fetching weirdness about her and is able to switch in an instant from a normal little girl to a young Wolverine. This is one of those movies that you do not know the whole plot just by watching the trailer and people should know going in that this isn't like any of the other X-Men movies we've seen so far. This film aims to take the Marvel superhero films even further into adult feeling just like the Dark Knight trilogy. I think it's a shame that we did not get a Wolverine film like this sooner but needless to say, better late than never. Highly recommended to fans of this genre!"
"abdullah-saeed99","9","2","6","5 March 2017"," Simply outstanding... A must watch... Spoilers ahead!
","Hugh Jackman's last time as wolverine is no short of an excellent movie . <br/><br/>I have seen a lot of good movies, and a lot of good superhero movies. However, I can say with confidence that this is by far the best superhero movie I have seen to date. Logan is a right and just ending to the character of Wolverine.<br/><br/>The movie revolves an around old, and frustrated Logan (who is a limousine driver). He, along with Charles Xavier (superbly played by Patrick Stewart) are waiting to finish off their lives in peace. <br/><br/>Both of them, especially Logan lack a sense of purpose in their lives. Logan has always been a reserved individual and a 'loner'. This, however, changes when X-23 arrives in his life and she becomes a forced purpose of Logan's life. He never asked for this, but accepts. The sense of purpose is what drives Logan for one last time especially since he has nothing on stake, and with a smile, Logan accepts his fate. He ends with a beautiful note, ""So this is what it feels like?"" - perhaps alluding to the fact that he is found love and family with X-23 and his dies happily among his ""family"" (X-23). His end (i.e. death) occurs in a romantic and beautiful manner - how we wish for ourselves.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the was the dichotomy of Charles Xavier. He is both crazy and sane. When Charles's mind is not under control, he is a dangerous weapon, but when his mind is under control, he serves as the sane person and a moral ground for Logan. If it was not for Charles, Logan might have abandoned X-23 right away.<br/><br/>A very good story conveys a good deal of meaningful emotions. Logan manages to instill such an emotion into the audience that by the end of the movie, tears are being shed by the audience. If emotions of such a magnitude are instilled in the audience, I can say that the movie is good. Soundtrack only adds to the emotion. This movie has outstanding soundtracks which meaningfully add to the emotions.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting from all the actors was great. The story was very good, realistic, emotional, rightfully bleak and most importantly it is coherent. I have only two minor complaints, first is that I think they went a bit over the top with the use of foul language especially with Charles but other than that I have only positive things to say. Second, they did not explain X-23 as well as I would have liked. There are hints which the audience can piece together but not as explicit as I would like. However, these are only minor complaints.<br/><br/>Very few actors leave manage to leave a character behind with such a nice note and kudos to Hugh Jackman for the legendary performances over a span of 17 years which for some fans is irreplaceable. Fox should leave alone the character for a good 7-8 years in respect of Hugh Jackman and the amazing legacy he is leaving with this character.<br/><br/>Thank you Hugh Jackman and James Mangold was such an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Edit: I have seen a backlash from DC fans bashing on this movie and comparing it to BvS. People have to understand that this is a different movie. BvS is sic movies packed into one movie and it tries to be so much at once. This movie is an ending to the character we say way back in 2000."

With blood violence and excessive amounts of swearing. Everything a true logan fan needs The cinematography for this film is some of the most beautiful and creative from any of the xmen franchise with some pieces that show the elegance of the camera. Scenes of fast paced action are caught with an keen eye along with the art of slow motion in other scenes.<br/><br/>The story although not capturing everything from the logan graphic novel does its very best to recreate vital scenes from said graphic novel. The writers have taken great care to bring characters beloved by all and re-create their personalities on the big screen with amazing accuracy. Although this movies story stands very well on its own feet even without taking every element from the graphic novel.<br/><br/>The thing makes this movie, are the performances from all of the actors. The most noticeable performance in my personal opinion was from rising star actress Dafne Keen Patrick Stewart and Hugh jackman with some amazing heart felt emotional performances which left myself tearing up on several occasions. I would never recommend any actors from a single film for an Oscar more highly than Hugh jackman and Dafne Keen.<br/><br/>Last year I wrote a slight review for deadpool rating it my 2nd best hero franchise film of all time at a 9/10 and thought it would be hard to top.<br/><br/>Read these words and know that (I Damian hockey) rate Logan as my 2nd highest rated super hero film of all time.

","After 17 years of playing one of the most popular characters in the X- Men franchise, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine/ Logan) naturally has a lot riding on his hunky shoulders in Logan — the third and last installment in the solo Wolverine series. Don't expect to see the X-Men in all their glory because the characters have aged and been through the fires. Xavier's declining mental and physical health (he's in his 90s now) and Logan's aging body almost make us feel sorry for the two characters. While Logan earns a living by driving a limousine, getting drunk and getting into fights, Xavier's disintegrating mind compels him to stay sedated in order to keep his colossal psychic powers under control. The film has a lot of gory scenes — there's plenty of bloodshed thanks to Logan's notorious adamant claws — so be prepared. But what shines through the action are the number of emotional moments between the lead characters, making it the most moving film of the franchise so far."

","""Logan"" is a film that has had a lot of hype surrounding it ever since it was announced that Hugh Jackman would be retiring from the role of the Wolverine and that this film would receive an R-rating. . Director James Mangold has delivered a film that at its core is a drama that explores the very real emotions of what it means to be human from the perspective of a character with superhuman abilities. He relies on character development and traditional story elements rather than CGI and explosions. This is by far the most subtle comic book movie of recent memory. <br/><br/>Mangold shows the physical and mental anguish that Logan has been living his entire life and how it has finally left him a broken and battered man. Jackman gives his best performance as the character that made him famous. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is well worth watching, even if you are not a fan of the superhero genre. It is an extremely violent film, but is a necessary component to truly understand the journey this film takes you on.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"nickey-matillano","9","2","6","5 March 2017"," Once you watch this, you'll begin to think how the previous Wolverine movies would have faired if it was the done the same way.
","Logan to me was great in its own way. Forget about the previous Wolverine, forget about the X-men entirely, this movie ties itself together alone pretty nice.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, again plays the role he was born for, Wolverine, has drastically escalated his acting career not only as an actor but a person as well, he's soooo good that we cannot picture another actor befitting the title Wolverine. And for good reason, Logan was the movie that subjected Hugh Jackman's role as this character with Justice against the blunder and controversy that both his previous Wolverine titles did not go according to what fans might have wanted or needed to see.<br/><br/>I dare say this might be the most intriguing and thrilling Wolverine movie out of all the X-men and the R18+ red band played a huge role in that regard. The movie set its own tone, premise and characters that we have might not expected, seeing as the previous Wolverine titles gave us the assumption that this third Movie would be a fest of fighting that does not reach it's truest nature.<br/><br/>I personally implore everyone, to see this movie, if not for the action then for the characters and vice versa. For me, this movie's flaws were that of several green screen obviousness, not gonna point out when and where but in the cinemas, it seemed too obvious to keep it out of mind.<br/><br/>But don't let cgi sway you off this film, it has a lot of context in itself, not just a undignifying brutality, there's lots of subtext and motifs that was prospered accordingly, it deserves the recognition to be noticed, for Hugh Jackman to finally rest in peace, knowing that this movie made all his fans, as well as the fans of Wolverine forgive him and the franchise for its previous and questionable movies."
"Equalizer16","9","2","6","5 March 2017"," One of the most sophisticate ""super hero"" films of all time
","After 7 films, Hugh Jackman still proves, we can never get enough of his wild uncanny wolverine.<br/><br/>Continuing in the newly adjusted X Men timeline, Logan is set in the year 2029, where mutants have become and endangered race, and Xaviar's school for the gifted has disappeared. Wolverine, or Logan (Hugh Jackman) now makes a living as a limo driver, as he tends to the needs of the fading Charles Xaviar (Patrick Stewart), who is suffering from his own telepathic psychic trauma, causing the entire earth to shake. But soon Logan comes across a mysterious girl who is more familiar to him than he knows as he embarks on a journey to protect her and take her to a safe Eden for her kind.<br/><br/>After last year's below average, but satisfying X Men Apocalypse, James Mangold concludes the Wolverine story with a cold hearted bloody violent neo- western, standing out from the crowed against all super hero films.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, this isn't really a super hero film at all, and is actually more of mature action drama. With its 15 certificate, Logan takes the advantage that Deadpool brought in which it can finally exploit and deliver the R rated bloody violence fans have deserved from Wolverine for ages. When the violence comes, it comes hard core, with 20th Century Fox making as much use of the certificate as they can. This however gives Logan its fuel for it to be what it is, which is a sophistical written piece of drama, standing alone but as a part of the X Men franchise.<br/><br/>This comes at rare moments when the film stops being itself and just takes time to be human, and capture a warm essence through the characters and story. But which is then taken back to its routes with its mainstream action. Which isn't a bad thing, it rather balances the drama, and action very well.<br/><br/>Entering a whole new side of the character of Logan that we have got to know so well. Jackman gives his shinning performance as Wolverine by far, collaborating all the effort and history that the character has delt with in all the films to create a clear and understandable portrayal. We see a crystal clear life led by Logan as he struggles to find peace in a life with out peace, and then sparing another of the same by attempting to give them a life without the misery he has lived.<br/><br/>Stewart also particularly shines, in giving us a new and completely different angel of Professor X, being one of the factors that the film reminds us that we are not living in a comic book, but the real world. Stepen Merchant plays Caliban who sportingly shines, and you barely recognise the popular comedic actor, even if he didn't have the pale skin. One of the most important cast member is Dafne Keen who with so little movement in her facial expressions does so much in her eyes that we really see her shy childness but also aggressive mutant abilities emit.<br/><br/>The film does unfortunately at times struggle to find things to do, trying to keep with in its 2hr 20min length, it reaches certain points where feels slightly with no direction, but does not reach any sense of boredom at all, and eventually finds real strong purpose.<br/><br/>What you eventually find is a film which is very much substance and style, in a good balance, with a surprising emotional atmosphere throughout recognising its audience journey with the character of Logan, and then resulting in a melancholy tale that will bring tears to the fans.<br/><br/>Logan is a powerful action drama, with well balanced story and action, with the best performance of Wolverine by Jackman, which is something new and outstanding from all super hero films. 9.0"

"vengeance20","10","2","6","4 March 2017"," Raw, Bloody & Pure Epic!
","Never been a fan of the Marvel Films in all honesty. I think it simply comes from me not being a fan to the 12+ theme, violence & humour. Not to mention the dragged out scenes, the dumb premise, the overuse of CGI, the classic saving lives theme being dropped, over complicated dialogue story-line... I could go on. I do however like 15+ rated Marvels Films, they simply are better, raw & not afraid to let loose unlike the others which are simply too restrained!<br/><br/>So, after getting Kick Ass's 1+2, Deadpool & Suicide Squad, we get Logan! Now from hearing about it, I had a feeling it was going to be a 12+, but from seeing the age rating, 15+ I had a feeling this was going to be good, & I was not wrong!<br/><br/>The film is about Logan (Wolverine) finding out he has a daughter, who apparently is just like him. Has the claw ability. So with some villains after him, his daughter & Xavier you have Logan!<br/><br/>The gore & blood in this film were beyond epic! It was exactly how I would do it! Only mines would be an 18+! But hey the violence & kill scenes were epic as f**k! They were simply epic!<br/><br/>The ending was sad but raw & solid! I thought this was an awesome film! Overall 10/10!!!!"
"aharmas","10","2","6","4 March 2017"," Jackman's Powerful Turn
","""Logan"" is that very rare movie which is a taut and solid drama, with a superb turn by the marvelous Jackman, giving it his all, showing a range not seen since Heath's Joker interpretation. It's almost like being the other side of the coin, a good man, tortured by guilt, tired of his dark odyssey, a champion who is not allowed to quit, even though his pain has levels which are not unbearable both physically and mentally. ""Logan"" wishes this all ends soon, and the audience will not be disappointed, but they will be both sad and happy that the film presents a very realistic and appropriate ending.<br/><br/>On the other hand, ""Logan"" is still a super hero movies, but with a huge heart and much intelligence and respect for the source. Having the powers not become the center of the film, but the family drama makes the film more powerful. There are strong bonds here, with Xavier doing his best to control Logan's tortured nature and his shock at the discovery of the new relationships he is now facing. Jackman's eyes are extraordinary, providing us access into his private hell. He's in agony for most of the story, and he uses his body expertly to convey just how difficult it is to even move around. If you consider, that the adversaries are now some of the strongest he has ever encounter, the outcome doesn't look very good.<br/><br/>If Jackman wasn't so good this time, a lot of the credit would to the newcomers, especially the girl who plays another version of a very familiar mutant, as moody and overwhelmed with much emotional turmoil. What is very impressive in that performance is the conviction demonstrated by young girls over the last year. Just like the performers in ""Strange Things"", the young ones here are complex and far reaching. There's hardly a happy moment here, with bodies scattered all over the country as Logan tries to reach safe heaven.<br/><br/>""Logan"" is a over two hours, but one knows its conclusion is not the end of the story. A big chapter ends, and we want to know what is next because as the baton is passed, we now the quality will continue, and under the careful production, direction, writing, and editing of team headed by Mangold, we should more than pleased with the results and wish there is more coming, as dark and as painful, but with a little hope.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"drawlife","9","2","6","4 March 2017"," Third time is the charm.
","By far this is the best Wolverine stand alone film. I guess third time really is the charm as X- Men Origins: Wolverine is an abysmal mess, and The Wolverine is just mediocre at best. What always held Wolverine back was the PG-13 rating. Now with this R rating, everything makes a ginormous difference. <br/><br/>The smart and bold script written by James Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green affords Hugh Jackman the opportunity to totally reinvent his portrayal of Logan/Wolverine, and the result is one of the best performances of Jackman's career, and ranks up there with one of the most impressive superhero movies of this decade.<br/><br/>It's very layered, and although at times there are a couple moments where it can drag, a lot of it is devoted to characterization of our leads. Patrick Stewart turns in one of the most thoughtful performances as Professor Xavier. Every scene with his banter and relationship with Logan is golden. Stephen Merchant also has a nice supporting role as Caliban. Boyd Holbrook has a very good asshole role as the ruthless Donald Pierce. A little underdeveloped, but he comes off as someone you love to hate and he does a good job selling that. Dafne Keen is Laura/X-23, and she is a superstar in the film. Granted she doesn't have much dialog, but she rules every action scene she's in and in the moments that she does talk, she doesn't come off as if she's reading the dialog in the script, but actually evoking the emotion that it needs. <br/><br/>James Mangold brings the tone, the pacing and the feel of a Western, particularly the movie Shane. Mangold is no stranger to westerns as he directed the great 3:10 to Yuma remake. Even in the set pieces, most of the film does not take place in a large cityscape, but rather in a desert like scenery, the road, the woods, a lonely convenient store, etc., making the film feel more isolated. This is an extremely violent film I might add, in which guts and blood are spilled and splatted everywhere. This time there's a visceral punch every time Logan brings out his claws to slice and dice. <br/><br/>Logan is a deep and somber character study of Logan himself. He and Xavier are old, withered and been though a lot. Even when Logan reluctantly honors Xavier's wishes to protecting Laura, it's clear after years of being bruised and battered, all he really wants to do is to drink and forget, to the point where he is numb to everything and anything resembling human feelings is irrelevant to him. The R rating is organic and doesn't feel out of place. Violence happens for a reason as it serves the story very well and Logan does not hold back in this one.<br/><br/>After seventeen years, and nine appearances as Wolverine(including this one), Hugh Jackman goes out with a bang. His dedication and commitment to playing this character for so long is a remarkable feat, so thank you Hugh Jackman for bringing out the best in you, even if some of the other movies weren't exactly great. <br/><br/>However, after seeing this film, I'm not ready for him to leave just yet. This and Deadpool are so far the best entries Fox has provided since X2: X-Men United. If only Fox can just come to Jackman's house with a dump truck full of cash. I hope Ryan Reynolds does everything he can to have him return for a Wolverine/Deadpool crossover, or perhaps Kevin Feige works his magic? Unlikely, but one can hope. <br/><br/>This is the Wolverine film I wanted to see. Better late than never. Hugh Jackman gives it his all, and I think it's very Oscar worthy. Yup I said it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"asha-albert","10","2","6","4 March 2017"," A fitting finale to Logan; simply the best X-Men movie ever
","Logan must be the one of the best superhero movies I have seen, probably next only to The Dark Knight Rises. The last movie about the Logan character, this is a superb end-story, worthy of the character.<br/><br/>Logan, as played by Hugh Jackman, is now aging, with a body that has taken too much punishment and seen too many better days. Trying to escape his demons, he has now taken refuge in the bottle and seems to be punishing himself for his supposed misdeeds. He is no longer invincible, has a permanent limp and a hacking cough, and takes much longer to heal. His adamantine claws are intact though, and make periodic appearances in some of the most brutal and violent action sequences ever seen in the X-Men series. But more about that later. <br/><br/>In a reversal of fortune, Logan has now taken on the guardianship of Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart), whose brain is deteriorating, causing him to lose control of his telepathic abilities, leading to catastrophe. A brain that was once classified as weapon of war, is now at the mercy of medication. Logan makes regular trips to the border to administer the medication - the professor is kept inside a huge empty metal tank, in the care of an albino mutant tracker named Caliban. The metal tank is needed to blunt the professor's mental outreach. In the course of one of these trips, Logan ends up taking on the responsibility of a young mutant with powers suspiciously similar to his own. This mutant is being tracked by the bad guys, and all hell breaks loose when they finally encounter her. <br/><br/>The action sequences in the movies are raw and realistic, highly violent and gory (decapitations and severed limbs are in abundance); the car-jacking scene, with its sudden burst of violence is especially riveting, as is the first incredibly brutal encounter between the young mutant and her pursuers. The scenes are shot so seamlessly that it's difficult to tell where the stunt ends, and CGI begins. Also, there's none of the extreme-close-up-jerky-hand-held- camera-shots, rather there's a return to classic, straight-shooting action, perfectly integrated with the rest of movie. None of the violence is just for the heck of it, rather it is essential to move the story forward. <br/><br/>Jackman perfectly encapsulates the slowing abilities and physical deterioration of his character, but what he does best is portray his character's emotional state - Logan is angry and desperate, wanting forgiveness and redemption, while also wanting to forget. He is giving way to mortality despite being for all purposes, immortal, and in a way, welcomes his impending mortality. <br/><br/>Stewart's portrayal of the old and ailing Professor Xavier is brilliant and touching - a prodigious brain, rapidly degenerating, locked in a failing body, controlled by medication, needing help for even the most mundane of activities - Stewart plays this to perfection - he may not have McAvoy's baby blues, but in talent he is unsurpassed. <br/><br/>This superb end-story for Logan has a solid emotional core that doesn't feel forced or manipulative, unusual for a superhero movie, and is probably the finest comic-book adaption you are going to see for while."
"bankofmarquis","8","2","6","4 March 2017"," Stong finish to Jackman and Stewart's X:Men Journey
","For me, pound for pound, the best Super Hero franchise going is the X:Men series (sorry Marvel Cinematic Universe).  Why is that?  Mainly,  it is because of the casting and the realistic interplay between these characters/actors.  No two actors serviced this series as faithfully and as effectively as Hugh Jackmans as Wolverine (Logan) and Patrick Stewart as Professor ""X"" (Charles Xavier).  So it was with mixed emotions that I entered the theater to see the self-proclaimed swansong of this series for the both of them.<br/><br/>And...I was rewarded with a very strong, very adult and very graphically violent - and fitting - ending to their journeys as these characters.<br/><br/>LOGAN tells the story of a time in the future when the mutant ""fad"" has faded and all (or most) mutants are gone (or hidden).  The former Wolverine is now a drunken limo driver in El Paso (is there any other kind), making ends meet so he can care for an aging Charles Xavier.  The early part of the film delves into the fascinating story of two people who were once indestructible and are now decaying - Logan's infallible body is now fallible and Charles' brilliant mind is ravaged by Alzheimer's.  Into this world drops a new mutant who needs protecting and saving from some bad guys.  Somebody needs to come along to to protect this girl.  ""Somebody already has"" says Charles to Logan.<br/><br/>The acting of Stewart and Jackman in the first part of the film (and really during the entire film) is exemplary, as good of acting as you are going to get in a Super Hero movie.  Not as showy as Heath Ledger's Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT, but strong, subtle and poignant, clearly showing the love and compassion these two have for each other.  Stewart, of course, has shown before that he has this type of performance level in him,  but it is the work of Jackman that surprises here.  He is up to the task and easily holds his own with Stewart.  He understands this character and being able to add another dimension to his portrayal must have been what attracted him to this role.  Adding to the interest in the first part of the film is the underrated Stephen Merchant as Caliban -  a 3rd mutant who works alongside Jackman and Stewart and enhances the proceedings.<br/><br/>The film, then, takes a turn to Action Hero Land when in drops young Dafne Keen as a mutant that is being chased and needs Logan's protection.  While there were action scenes before this point in the movie, the film now becomes one long action chase scene - and it is done very, very well - graphically and unapologetic in it's violence.  This will help soothe the ""fanboys"" of this film - they have been clamoring for an adult, hard R-Rated, violent Wolverine for some time - and get it they do -  but I was more impressed with the dramatic portion of the first 1/2 of the film than the action of the 2nd half.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Director and Writer James Mangold has crafted a very fine film.  He certainly knows how to keep the action moving - and I'm sure some of the ""fanboys"" will be bored with the more slow first part of this film - but that is the part of the film that appealed more to me and I wanted more of that, and less of the gory action, but that is not what this film needs to be in order to become the Box Office champion that it most certainly will be.<br/><br/>There are a few downsides to this film - while Boyd Holbrook makes a good bad guy, his boss - played by Richard E. Grant - was paperthin and unweighty in comparison to the leads, and an interlude to a family at a farm house really just served as cannon fodder, which was a waste of good talent like Eriq La Salle and Elise Neal.  I also was left a bit unsatisfied by the ending, I wanted just a bit more, one more scene, but I can understand why Mangold decided to end the film where he did - lest he falls prey to the ""multiple, false ending"" trap that the last LORD OF THE RING movie fell victim to.<br/><br/>Mangold, clearly, enjoys these characters and their interactions, but he didn't overplay his hand and these two fine actors - and their characters - can walk off the X:Men stage with their heads held high.  They are leaving on a high note and are adhering to the age-old showbiz adage -<br/><br/>""Always leave them wanting more...""<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
"sara2520","10","2","6","4 March 2017"," Awesome Movie
","When I left out of this movie, I hated the ending. Then when I was driving home, I was still thinking about the movie and it hit me that the entire movie was excellent including the end. If you take Jackson's Wolverine from the beginning in 2000's X-Men to all his movie until 2017's Logan, it's the warrior's journey from dawn to twilight and the ending was a perfect fit to this great warrior and a perfect sendoff to the phenomenal Hugh Jackson who did an excellent job in portraying Logan with so many dimensions. I can tell he had a blast playing Logan over the years, but like Logan coming to terms with his mortality and Jackson dealing his numerous cancer scares over the years, it was time put the claws back in once and for all. I loved this movie. It had a very strong cast. There were no weak links. The little girl who portrayed Laurie was amazing. Not only did she kick-butt as a little Wolverine herself in some brutal action scenes, but she was able to emote so many emotions without speaking and you cared and sympathized with her character. My favorite scene was when she was eating cereal so calmly watching the bad guys on camera arriving to kidnap her. This movie was also a wonderful sendoff to Sir Patrick Stewart. I watched on the Graham Norton as he announced seating next to Hugh Jackson that this would be his last X-Men movie. He said it was perfect sendoff to his character and he was absolutely correct. I loved this version of Stewart and his father-son relationship with Logan who are like a father-son who obviously loved one another but constantly bicker with one another. Professor X, as I will always call him whether he runs the X-Men school or not, was awesome and his instability with his powers led to some of the best scenes in the movie. I even liked the Albino who took control of his destiny. The movie was excellent. Great script, great villains, great cast, great action scene, great storytelling, and scenes that will rip out your heart and shock you. You care about ever character in the movie even the minor characters. But I really enjoyed this movie and even as another pass, I still am thinking about how great this movie is. It is a perfect sendoff to Logan and Xavier. And yes, it is bittersweet but it was the perfect ending to great characters."
"stevenrotherforth","10","2","6","4 March 2017"," Goes against the grain and it pays off big time!
","Logan<br/><br/>From Logan's first cinematic appearance back in 2000's X men it was obvious to anyone unfamiliar with him that he was something special. A character with depth and intrigue. Part of us the audience could relate to the inner rage that we in the real world cannot and should not let out. Marred by PG ratings in order to cater for a child friendly audience the first two solo outings failed to hit the mark. But Wolverine isn't for kids. He's not Superman. No flashy red and blue tights. He has razor sharp blades that pierce through his flesh and out of his hands. He kills people up close and personal. When that rage finally ignites the violence is catastrophic. With Logan the filmmakers have strived to get it right. One final stab (pardon the pun) at putting the real Wolverine up there on the silver screen. Hugh Jackman and James Mangold were adamant that this be so or they would walk away from the project. No compromises, no dilution. Thank god they didn't walk as this is probably one of if not the best X men movie ever made.<br/><br/>Set in 2029. Logan scrapes together a living as a limo driver in order to care for a very ill Charles Xavier. The Professor is suffering from dementia. The worlds most powerful mind is decaying and by doing so it causes him to have seizures that can kill all those around him. All other mutants are now gone. Not a single birth in over twenty years, or so they believe. The professors brain is now classed as a weapon of mass destruction. An incident that occurred in Westchester is partially explained to be the cause of the X men's demise. Something that Xavier no longer recalls as Logan tries to hide him from the painful truth. Another burden for our clawed hero to bare. Due to Charle's continual brain malfunctions Logan hides him away and struggles to care for him. Logan has health issues of his own. His regenerative capabilities are failing and the Adamantium that covers his skeleton is slowly poisoning him. Logan is at his end. He contemplates suicide with a single Adamantium bullet that he carries around. Only when a young girl by the name of Laura shows up on his doorstep desperately in need of the Wolverines help does he find new added purpose. Reluctantly so, but nevertheless he has no choice but to help. Logan is more of a western/ road trip movie rather than that of the Superhero genre. A bold choice that pays off. There are no over the top explosions here. The action is grounded yet extremely violent. If like me you've been waiting to see Wolverines berserker rage realised to its full potential then this is the movie for you. Heads roll, blood spurts and limbs are severed. But never does the violence seem forced. It is earned, called for and extremely well staged. Each slice and dice has an impact on the audience. We can almost feel the sharpness of those Adamantium blades. Violence and action aside it is the dramatic scenes of this film that really steal the show. The interaction between Jackman and Stewart is a thing of beauty. Oscar worthy perhaps? The father and son relationship is conveyed to tear jerking effect. Stewarts performance as an elderly cantankerous, confused shell of his former self is upsetting yet mesmerizing to behold. Jackmans portrayal of a broken more human Wolverine convinces you to love this character even more. The final moments of the film pull at the heartstrings like a herd of bolting horses because of Logan's new found humanity. Then there's Laura/X23 played superbly by the young Dafne Keen. A performance that makes you sit up in your seat. She's sweet, vulnerable, innocent and feral all at the same time. Able to convey a range of emotions just through facial expression. Her mannerisms and body language become chilling at the first sign of her metallic claws. Laura's first scene of extreme violence is probably the most memorable from the entire film. Even Wolverine himself cannot believe his eyes. ""Logan she's like you, very much like you!"" My only gripe is the introduction of X24. A Wolverine clone. It's Jackman but made to look younger and with less hair. For me this reminded me of the over the top Samurai villain from the previous film. I believe that X24 slightly detracts this film away from its grounded tone. Could there have been a better way of creating a Wolverine clone? Perhaps a slightly failed experiment. Something that didn't just look like Hugh Jackman in different clothes. However the more I dwell on this the more I lean towards the positive. I suppose the audience got a chance to see a version of Wolverine at his most brutal. Logan is a film that will benefit from revisits. Each time I watch this movie the more I think I will love it. I awarded Logan ten stars. I pondered at first. Does it really deserve such an high accolade? Yes I think it does. Not for the awesome action but for the smallest of perfections. The dialogue between two well seasoned actors. The range of emotions conveyed by Dafne Keen or even the brief but brilliant performance from Stephen Merchant as Caliban. A wonderful film. An awesome achievement that goes against the grain. Future movies of this genre need to take note. Big explosions just won't cut it anymore. If this is to be Hugh Jackmans last appearance as the Wolverine I think he definitely goes out on a high."
"Davidon80","8","2","6","4 March 2017"," Old man Logan
","In a future time line, mooted as 2029, Wolverine of X-Men fame is working as an Ubersque limo driver on the U.S-Mexico border. Charles Xavier is suffering from a degenerative brain disorder, and is under the care of the mutant Caliban, the X-Men are defunct and mutants are now a rarity. Suddenly a young girl known only as Laura enters Wolverine's life, and a road movie ensues where Wolverine must reach Eden, somewhere in North Dakota.<br/><br/>It is with a little sadness that I approached Logan, The X-Men movies have been a curio for me ever since I saw the first instalment back somewhere in the 2000s. The subtext with The X-Men about mutants living on the fringes, which has it's roots in the social activism of the 60's, with characters such as Magneto realising his superhuman strength at the hands of The Third Reich, always hinted at something far greater then the sum of their parts in comic book and movie form. That being said, even in it's movie form it has aimed high, hiring talent of the likes of: Ian Mckellen, Anna Paquin, Kelsey Grammar, Patrick Stewart, Oscar Isaac, Jennifer Lawrence, James Mcavoy, Michael Fassbender and going for broke with an unknown in Hugh Jackman. The X-Men has always attempted to be distinct, somehow merging a sense of theatre with its superhero dynamics. While this has not always been successful, sometimes the attempt is worthy enough of an appreciative pat on the back.<br/><br/>In Logan we have something of a crescendo for everything that was great about The X- Men universe: we have the theatre, we have the tragedy and we have the pathos all amp-ed up in a strange Hollywood blockbuster with a weirdly indie spirit. Logan has been spoken about by the actor Hugh Jackman as being the culmination of his career as Wolverine, ""this"" he exclaims in many interviews, ""is the movie about Wolverine that I wanted to make"", and it is not difficult to see why he feels that way. Playing an immortal super hero, part man, part metal, part feral beast, it goes without saying that his character has always stood out in the movies, comics and cartoon series as the most engrossing, dynamic and captivating of the X-Men team. A character worthy of his own story line, but always beholden to a greater story arc involving Professor Xavier and Magneto and sometimes Storm, Mystique or any number of the bit players. The previous Wolverine movie, set partly in Japan gave us a taster of a fully formed Wolverine movie, giving us glimpses of a man living on the fringes. Ultimately he is then given a new lease of life through his adventures in Japan, thus kick starting a more hopeful Days of Future Past narrative. Logan dispenses with this narrative, whilst it has been mentioned by the director that Logan (the movie) exists in that time frame (so we can assume this is the culmination of Days of Future Past), we can also approach Logan as a stand alone movie, existing on it's own terms and ready to make it's own sacrifices, and boy do they make some sacrifices.<br/><br/>This is what truly sets Logan apart from many other movies of it's ilk. Drawing inspiration from movies such as Unforgiven and Shane we see here a level of violence unheard of in a superhero movie. Super hero movies have a tendency to play it safe to the PG-13 crowd, with every act of violence skilfully manipulated for a younger audience. In Logan we see something different, we see Wolverine going full-tilt bastard on a bunch of Gov OPs slashing and maiming his way by any means necessary, along with child mutants ready and willing to fight their cause. Logan is so committed to showing the violence, and placing the violence within it's context that every bullet, and blade has a visual and emotional heft to it.<br/><br/>In Avengers: Civil War we have a story line built around the concept of collateral damage, and the consequences of super heroic endeavours. Logan, without needing to come across as moralistic answers this question with a full on caps lock, DEATH is the ultimate endgame to these actions. If the net result of the actions of a super hero is collateral damage, then ultimately the net result of 'collateral damage' is destruction of the psyche; just like soldiers returning from war who suffer from shell shock and paralysis or criminals who eventually confess their crimes. Logan tells us that super heroes eventually waste away on the inside, and never has this been more perfectly conveyed then to see both Wolverine and Charles Xavier wasting away, not by the hands of their arch enemy Magneto, but at the simple hands of old age and world weary fatigue.<br/><br/>In Logan there is a wilful sense of an end to this series, not so much an end to The X-Men, but if anyone has been paying attention to The X-Men over the last few entries it has become plainly apparent that the X-Men seem to be getting younger (real young), whilst the audience who saw The X-Men the first time round are undoubtedly getting older . Logan addresses this, acknowledging that ultimately, even our most immortal and impenetrable hero will remain all too human, and this is not a fact to be reconciled with, but merely a fact: our heroes die, our leaders are fallible and ultimately our children inherit the earth.<br/><br/>The X-Men has always had this mantra somewhere at the heart of it's story telling, but never has it been more brutally realised then in Logan."
"bshristov","10","2","6","4 March 2017"," Yep, It,s That Good.
","The film begins in a isotopic vision of 2029, a time where Logan has long ago abandoned the name Wolverine and the X-Men are no more. With his 200th birthday drawing near, Logan's self-healing hide doesn't auto- repair quite as well as it once did, and his drinking is out of control. Mutants as a whole are all but extinct—as far as we know, there are three left: Logan, Caliban (a mutant with the power to find other mutants and an extreme sensitivity to sunlight), and the former professor Charles Xavier.<br/><br/>This isn't a two man film, however.<br/><br/>It is also about a young girl, an absolute showstopper of a child who has all of Logan's powers and more, and none of the restraint its taken him lifetimes to accumulate.<br/><br/>Logan is in many ways an emotional, heavy picture, but it's also an uplifting one that reminds us that it's okay to fight for something more, something better. It's an amazing swan song for the Wolverine character, and for Jackman, and perhaps the best X-Men movie yet."
"James_De_Bello","8","2","6","3 March 2017"," 8.5/10
","Sad, brutal, powerful and most importantly freshly original, ""Logan"" is a great piece of cinema with performers committed to this material in a way we haven't quite seen before in the genre which pays off by touching emotional heights for which the audience might be as unprepared as much as they are touched by it.<br/><br/>The balancing act that Mangold pulls off is a tricky one, but his mastery in molding the tones and hitting the emotional moments when they need to is remarkable, he takes full advantage on his medium and leaves us with frames and feelings stuck in our head for long after the film's departure. He has so much on his table to bring to life, there are multiple story lines and many moving pieces, but he makes all of it into a beautifully flowing piece where you never feel lost, everything here belongs to this film.<br/><br/>The success of this emotional piece is strictly connected to how good the performances in it are. First off is Boyd Holdbrook who is a revelation, he has a natural talent for holding the screen and being magnetic and make the most out of it giving us a villainous role that is the perfect match for this feature. On top of that comes Dafne Keen who does stuff which I have never seen in a movie theater before, she is crazy good and possibly one of the best child performances I have ever seen. What she conveys with her eyes only is incredible and when she starts getting into the action they do stuff that I have honestly never seen before with a child.<br/><br/>Of course this is the Jackman/Stewart show in the end and what a show, what a finale to give to these characters. There isn't merit to be awarded singularly here, as in all great movies, the quality of the emotions you are being carried through starts with a truly great script that offers the actors A+ level material to work with. They rise to the challenge, making the most out of every word, every stare and in comes Mangold and his delicate touch in capturing all of these moments. This film is really sad, it brings to life emotions and characters in a way that hits the audience deeply, the themes of bitterness, rejection, heartbreak, love, life, purpose, discrimination, hope, it brings tears to my eyes just recalling the outlook the films takes and it is a icon of how cinema can convey theme through story no matter its nature.<br/><br/>The struggles the characters go through in this film feel so raw and close to us. Professor Xavier is given what is possibly his best portrayal and arch yet, he his in a sad, sad place, his life feels so tragic to us, his dreams have vanished, the way Stewart portrays him takes us to a place of such humanity, looking at an old man, a great man who is at the end of line, disillusioned and lost, mad, but still hoping. It is a beautiful piece of character drama that is developed throughout the film with pitch perfect dramatization and, curiously enough, the perfect amount out comic relief. As much as this film is emotional and sad it has moments of comedy gold that fit in seamlessly as they have always been part of these characters. Stewart has moments of ""Cukoo's Nest"" madness that bring out really funny monologues, plus his timing on one liners is perfect and even the way he moves makes for great comedy. And of course we don't loose Wolverine's dry humor which has always been a great part of his character.<br/><br/>And we haven't touch upon the action yet. This movie is violent and brutal and awesome because of that. Every drop of blood, every hit, every scar is justified by story. there isn't a moment of wasted time in the action, it feels urgent and necessary, the set-pieces flow in naturally and frenetically, they enter the story at the right times, they build and end when they need to and when it is time to start a new one is always feels built up and climaxes to new heights which are topped with the final confrontation which is a blood bath of violence and savageness that has me white knuckled, you almost feel there, with the characters, in the middle of this insane struggle. You feel every it, the pain in every cut has a weight and Logan's incredible effort and stress to go on it conveyed brutally in a way that you almost feel it upon yourself.<br/><br/>I think that there are only a few criticism that I could move towards the film which are plot points that are repeated throughout which don't really belong in the film. They insist on an X-Men comic point which has nothing to do with the film and raises questions all around which don't really need to be there and could have easily been solved with another macguffin. These sort of nitpicks and continuity issues are the only ones that really have any place in being pointed out.<br/><br/>Everything else in ""Logan"" works, this is a devastating film, with many tears involved, it will stick with you and leave you with images and feelings stuck in you mind, that is the mark of great, great film, one that molds tones and stories into one beautiful piece of genre cinema that will certainly have a lasting effect through its legacy, every single risk taken in here paid off to perfection."

","""Logan"" is the answer to all of my Marvel movie prayers. Let me start by listing my problems with the other comic book films: firstly the lack of real stakes or sense of vulnerability for the characters. While the stakes are almost cartoonishly high in other Marvel movies, considering they are literally saving the world, what they fail to do is truly make us feel as if the main characters could be killed at all. Whenever anything bad happens to these characters, they seem to immediately bounce back, such as with Nick Fury, who was shot multiple times and came back later in the movie, and James Rhode, who fell from the sky, yet is now recovering. In ""Logan"", they aren't messing around. Not only are characters beat up, bruised, guilt-filled, and slowly deteriorating, but many important characters are killed, usually at the most unexpected moments. The gore is also realistic and often genuinely disturbing. Secondly, the visuals. I'm not saying that most Marvel movies have bad special effects, and I'm not even saying that the cinematography is bad, per se, it's just so... bland. The color palette is dull, and most everything (besides for some action scenes) is shot in the most boring and predictable way, with no real distinct visual style. In ""Logan"", the cinematography has a very dusty and rugged feel to it. Also, the scenes in which Professor X has his fits after not taking his medicine, in which he essentially freezes everyone, not allowing them to move, genuinely feel tense and uncomfortable due to their shaky and claustrophobic camera- work, and you can feel Logan's struggle to move. Finally, the music. Again, nothing really very wrong with the music in other Marvel films, just nothing that ever stands out as unique or interesting. Music isn't often used in this film, but when it is, it heightens the emotion of each scene, whether it be heartfelt and genuine or intense.<br/><br/>On top of this, it has the best action scenes in any Marvel movie, with fantastic choreography and cinematography that doesn't rely at all on shaky cam or over editing, but rather clear, energetic, and hard hitting camera-work. The depiction of the future in the film is also subtly delivered through visuals that are relevant to the themes of government and upper class exploitation of minorities and others who can easily be taken advantage of for the most benefit. For instance, self driving cargo trucks are shown at one part nearly hitting people that are trying to get their horses off of the road, and large crop-harvesting machines are shown in the background of a poor man's farm. And, of course, the characters. Logan is a lonely alcoholic who is hiding on the border with Caribana, a mutant whose skin burns in the sun and who once helped to round up the original mutants, and with Professor X, who now requires medication in order to not accidentally kill himself and those around him. These are the only two people he still cares about after the death of all of the other mutants. He is working as a limo driver and saving up to buy a boat so he can sail away into the ocean with these two people and stop having to worry about being hunted by the government. The opening scene tells us that this is a man who has killed many and doesn't want to kill anymore, but is too often forced into situations where he has to. He has profound guilt for his murder, regardless of whether the people he killed were ""bad"" or ""good"". Logan is almost without hope, unlike Charles Xavier, who seems to believe there are still other mutants. To Logan's surprise, there is a young mutant girl named Laura who has just escaped a government facility where they have been attempting to modify and condition her to be an unempathetic killing machine for her entire life. A nurse approaches Logan with help, and while he is very reluctant because of the danger that will come with protecting this girl, he is eventually forced into it, and his empathy and conscience take over. <br/><br/>""Logan"" is a dark, dark movie. The light at the end of the tunnel seems to shrink more and more throughout the movie, but what is important is that it always exists, despite the terrible ordeals these characters go through. After all is said and done, there is still a small ray of light peering into the blackness of their reality, and that is what these characters seem to constantly be chasing."

","I was so surprised that movies could be this good. They put all the action sequences and everything properly in two hours. The story was great and the character were fantastic. It is hard to believe that there are a few people out there that dislike this movie. Just like Deadpool, this movie filled me with excitement as I watched it."
"Dragonsouls","8","2","6","3 March 2017"," Logan is the most important superhero film of all time
","Minor spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Logan may very well be the most important Superhero film of all time because it touches on social issues that we are facing today in the real world. One of the things I thought that added to its real world gravitas was the ""Donald Trump Wall,"" The film's near future setting isn't quite post-apocalyptic, but it teeters on the edge of it. The film made me wonder if such a border patrol wall would one day be used to not only to block illegal immigrants from entering the country, but perhaps, even the disabled, or others, because in the case of this film, it was also used to keep mutants out.<br/><br/>The year is 2029. Mutants are all but extinct, and a mutant hasn't been born in 15 years. Frank Logan (Wolverine) and another vampire-like mutant named Caliban care for an ailing Professor Xavier, who is on the brink of developing dementia. Patrick Stewart played his best portrayal of Professor X to date. He was brilliant in this film, teetering on the brink of madness, and also plagued by seizures that happen whenever he uses his telepathic ability. Because of this, Professor X is heavily medicated so that he no longer can use his special ability, and medicated without Xavier's behest. ""You're putting me to sleep!"" Xavier tells Logan whenever he stuffs pills into his mouth. This made me wonder if many of today's gifted people are misdiagnosed as crazy and put on medication just because they are unique, different, depressed and alienated.<br/><br/>The plot is rather simple. Wolverine is tasked with escorting a young girl across the country so that she can reach a haven for mutant kind, where she will be safe from a coven of trans-humanists. Wolverine refuses at first, but when he realizes that this young girl is his clone, and just like him, he dedicates his life to keep her safe from Transigent, a scientific corporation looking to genetically modify humans into weapons, just like Wolverine, except, unlike naturally born mutants, Transigent wants to engineer them without a conscience, and without a soul.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was nothing short of perfection. Oscar worthy in every sense. The best performance of a pulp fiction character on the big screen;--ever, period. If another actor other than Heath Ledger is ever going to win an Oscar for a portrayal of a comic book character, it will be him! My one gripe about this film was the brutal violence because it bordered on being gratuitous, and there was one small plot hole in this movie that sort of irked me. I was hoping for a happier ending too, because this movie depressed the hell out of me. Logan is a tragedy. And surprisingly, it borrowed a lot from the classic Univeral film, The Wolfman. The final scene in this movie was one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen. It touched me on a personal level and I can't remember the last time I got teary during a comic book movie.<br/><br/>9/10"
"kronossaviotitan","10","2","6","3 March 2017"," This is a must watch film. It has a very well written script coupled with impeccable acting which results in the best X-Men movie which I have seen.
","This film is not like the typical superhero film. This film focuses more on the character of the hero rather than their exploits. It is a darker, grittier type of film than one would have come to expect from marvel. This film displays an emotional maturity rarely seen in films of this genre. It is a very moving film which beautifully weaves the various aspects required of a film of this genre such as violence,superpowers,etc along with a gripping story having emotional overtones. Personally speaking, this movie almost had me in tears due to its unprecedented story and the fact that this is the last X-Men movie in which Hugh Jackman is going to act. I would rate this film as one of the finest moments in Hugh Jackman's illustrious acting career and I would go so far to say that it is the best X-Men movie to be ever created."

","I just came out of the cinema and I have to say: I love this film. Sure, there are flaws to it's caliber which it wields, however the weight also affects the storytelling and characters of this film and my god are they characters you love. Just the fact that it is R rated should tell you enough. Go see this film, Mangold was given enough power to take us on a proper emotional ride, he went to about 5 G with it. As a more of an outsider, I have to say that I haven't seen a better X-Men film, so far. But I guess it's because this one actually focuses on everything that X-Men stand for yet adds needed realism to prove, that all you see is more than just a film. It's, so far, a masterpiece."
"morellotunes","10","2","6","3 March 2017"," Excellent even if you don't like superhero flicks
","I don't write many reviews and, as a matter of fact, I don't even read many since I like to just decide for myself. Rarely, though, does a film come along that I feel compelled to write about. In this case, after having seen ""LOGAN,"" I just could not resist.<br/><br/>The film is a gritty noir-western take on the Wolverine character which many have wished for for quite some time. It is done with poise and grace and, while quite violent, does not ever feel gratuitously done. The film is visually stunning. Shot well and in a bleak manner, not unlike a 1970's film. It is cut well despite being lengthy. It never feels ""long,"" however. Additionally, as it is Hugh Jackman's last hoorah as Wolvie, it is especially satisfying to see such a success. It is impossible to imagine the character not being Hugh Jackman. He quite simply IS Logan.<br/><br/>Anything else I'd say would be a spoiler, so, I will stop here. Before I do, however, I want to reiterate that regardless of one's like or dislike for superhero films, this movie impresses as a ""film"" in all aspects of the medium."
"MeesTW","8","2","6","3 March 2017"," The Best Superhero Movies Aren't About Superheroes
","One could ask himself what Logan is really about. Is it a good vs. evil story? Is it a story about a superhero being overwhelmed by his fears? <br/><br/>To me, Logan is about an aging man who finds a purpose in his empty life. That's right, a man, not a superhero. Logan is humanized in this film, the audience gets to learn about about the human side of James ""Logan"" Howlett. Without giving too much away, Logan's character grows a lot in this film, and it all feels very natural. So that's where the writers did a great job.<br/><br/>This film is more of a character study, than a comic book film. In a comic book film, there is tons of CGI, a bad guy who wants to destroy the planet and almost succeeds and a two dimensional character who is supposed to be the love interest gets kidnapped or dies. Logan stands out by being a movie which takes place on a smaller scale, so that characters can be developed and that the audience can show empathy when something good or bad happens to these characters. <br/><br/>The story of this film does not feel unique. The escort type of story has been overdone since Children of Men perfected it. I would've loved to see something a bit different, but I can't deny that this type of story has helped Logan grow as a character. <br/><br/>The pacing in this film is so-so. The second act contained a lot of exposition, which ultimately slows down the journey we're on and makes you feel bored. <br/><br/>Since Avengers Age of Ultron I stopped caring about superhero movies. Thinking they're all the same, and the sad truth is, is that they are all very similar. Thanks to the great trailer of Logan, I was interested because it reminded me of The Dark Knight and Captain America., which are movies starring a superhero dealing with humane issues, instead of superhero movies. <br/><br/>I hope other writers take a look at this film and learn from it. The people don't want another CGI-fest, we want movies about actual people who deal with relatable issues featuring some good (practical) action scenes. <br/><br/>It lived up to expectations. 8/10."
"milan-d-rakic","10","2","6","3 March 2017"," Flat out: A Masterpiece
","Saw the movie yesterday and I just had to write a review, my first ever on IMDb.<br/><br/>There are movies and then there are movies. I have given other action/sci-fi movies 10 stars before, but in hindsight, I shouldn't have. I'm still blow away after watching Logan yesterday, and after thinking about it I'd dare to say that it is the best superhero movie ever (at least as of Feb 2017). I've seen all of them, and the Iron Man's, Avengers and other cannot be compared to this one.<br/><br/>Logan is dark, brutal and sad, but above all, it made me think about how time flies by. The first X-Men came out 2000 and I still remember watching and liking after first first viewing. Fast forward, 2017, and all this has come to an end, Charles has aged, Logan has aged, me with them, and as with all things in life: we go towards our end. However, Logan won't go away easily, he will fight till the bitter end, chopping of limbs and piercing skulls. In all this brutality we find a wounded soul that is just a shadow of it's previous glory, wanting to leave it all behind, and pass away silently.<br/><br/>As with every movie, there are (perhaps) weak points, but I am not focusing on that, this story is about Logan, about Charles, and about the genetically engineered mini-mutants (we might see them in a future movie with Jackman as X24). This movie is not a plain superhero movie, it is a true Movie, one that should be watched and enjoyed.<br/><br/>For the really picky readers: You might ask how Logan can get a 10, up there with the likes of Shawshank and The Godfather. Again, there are movies and there are movies.<br/><br/>Watch and enjoy."
"lukamaras","9","2","6","3 March 2017"," Excellent, intense drama with brilliant acting
","Logan is an excellent movie by itself, first and foremost. The atmosphere and the acting are so brilliant that superpowers are like a back story, almost like a layer just added on top of a great plot.<br/><br/>This is a sad, heavy and intense, gripping drama, centered on two old mutants, which don't even seem that. It is about human emotions and desires of two old men against a backdrop of a very believable dystopian future.<br/><br/>I saw it with a friend who didn't know anything about X-Men and she was amazed at how good the acting, the heavy atmosphere and the overall drama was. She didn't need to know anything about the franchise to enjoy the movie - that's how good it is.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it. On a side note, this is NOT for kids. It isn't your typical comic book adventure, far from that."
"shivamt25","8","2","6","3 March 2017"," Logan - review of an awesome emotional drama
","Buzz was all around about this one. Many have been waiting for long to watch it. The trailers were remarkable. I was eager too, but I was skeptical about it at first because I have seen the first two wolverines. Now, as I am here writing this review, I just cannot stop thinking how oddly satisfying that movie was. I was glad to see a marvel movie that is SO NOT marvel. It had elements which we do not expect a superhero movie to explore. That is why I can say with no doubt it was a breathtaking emotional drama.<br/><br/>It's 2029. Wolverine is old and a junkie. He drives a taxi for a living, just keeping his head down hiding from his past. He helps around to take care of Charles, Professor X who is not capable of what he was once. Mutants are gone. What is left is a life which is hard for everyone, with only one purpose â€“ survive, somehow. It was really gloomy seeing two of our beloved characters in circumstances like this. Then, they found a purpose. A girl, mutant, just like wolverine and then begins the ultimate chasing game.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were so powerful, you just can't help but feel bad for the characters, especially Logan. Quoting Pierce, played by Boyd Holbrook, ""Logan, just seeing you like this broke my damn heart!"". Also, the movie is brutal to the core. Everyone in the theater was gasping during the action sequences. This is not it. The movie plays with humor effortlessly, placing it at precise points in the perfect amount. The character development is so strong, that you will overlook that they have superpowers. I remember there was this one conversation on-screen and it was such an emotional one that I was thinking about it long after it was done.<br/><br/>The actors did a wonderful job. For Hugh Jackman, I have no words. For me, it was his best performance so far. Patrick Stewart's old sick Charles will unquestionably be remembered for long. Daphne as the young girl was superb. I don't know how they managed to show the kind of fight she did but it was something incredible to watch. A special mention should be given to Boyd Holbrook, who played mean villain Pierce. His humorous demeanor and southern accent added to the charisma of his role.<br/><br/>So, go watch Logan as soon as you can to your nearest theaters. Some would say that it is the best superhero movie they have seen in a very long time. I would say that for me the best would be Civil War. This is because I won't put Logan and other superhero movies in the same category. Logan is something different altogether. All the more reason to watch it right?"
"streamofstars","10","2","6","3 March 2017"," Intense and heartfelt, the best X-Men movie, A+++
","I'm not even sure where to start or what to say with this review, so I'll try and keep it short and sweet. I really want to scream GO SEE LOGAN NOW!!! Excitement aside, I'll admit that I'm not a massive X-Men fan, but I do love the Logan/Wolverine character and have seen all the other movies, and this was everything I hoped it would be and more. It's by far the best X-Men movie ever. I gasped, laughed and cried at various times and was completely blown away by it all.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot too much or give anything major away. I will say that this is not the usual shiny PG type superhero movie. Things are dark and grim. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is at the end of his rope and it shows. You feel his pain and despair. The movie feels and looks different, but definitely a good different. The cinematography and locations give a real and apocalyptic atmosphere. The action scenes are intense, violent and bloody, and the heartfelt, emotional scenes are raw and touching.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, in his final performance as Wolverine, delivers without question his best performance as the badass, but scarred hero. He gives everything his got and more. I really can't say enough good things about him. Patrick Stewart, back as Charles Xavier, is wonderful as always, while newcomer Dafne Keen as the young mutant Laura is absolutely magnificent. Boyd Holbrook, as the main villain Donald Pierce, is simply awesome, and Stephen Merchant as the mutant Caliban is excellent. The only negative about the acting unfortunately is Richard E. Grant, who I feel is underused and forgettable.<br/><br/>There were only one or two minor things towards the end that I thought could've been a little different, but the intensity and honesty that comes through the screen is worth a 10/10.<br/><br/>The other people who were in the screening with me must've been just as captured by the movie as I was, since no one left the cinema the entire time. That's saying something! And when certain scenes happened, you'll know which scenes, everyone was silent. Logan is not to be missed on the big screen!"
"Lleuq75","8","2","6","2 March 2017"," ""Logan"" Review: Hugh Jackman, forever.
","It will be extremely hard for to continue the ""X-Men"" franchise after ""Logan"", should they choose to do so. This film is so immersed into itself that the potential consequences from the events that take place here put a huge question mark on not only if the films will continue, but also if they should continue. ""Logan"", apart from that, will make you leave the theater with your heart in your mouth, potentially bringing a tear out of your eye. Director James Mangold has put together a film for Hugh Jackman that marks and defines ""The Wolverine"" forever. <br/><br/>Set in the year of 2029, ""Logan"" presents Logan (Hugh Jackman) under circumstances that are very allusive and connected to the character's past. Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier is so vulnerable and realistic that it makes for more than usual humanely devastating moments during the film. Xavier copious seizures and Alzheimer's symptoms require Logan's care, with the help of Caliban (Stephen Merchant) who unlike the other two does not contribute to the film's strong sentimentality. X-23, played by Dafne Keen, serves as the link between Xavier and Logan's relationship. <br/><br/>It is Stewart's performance, along with Jackman's, the driving force of ""Logan"". To think back on all that Logan and Xavier have gone through in the past, particularly the many instances when Logan did things he never wanted to do and took solace in Xavier's words, is heart breaking. Here we have a Professor X who is dealing with a terrible mistake from the past that is linked to the disappearance of most, presumably, mutants, while being taken care of by Logan, who is not only dealing with his physical disease â€“ adamantium poisoning â€“ but also with the fact that he cannot truly find a purpose to continue to live under these circumstances. <br/><br/>That is the film's greatest achievement. The depiction of these characters' lives in such a completely different lens from what it what also seen in ""X-Men"" and ""Wolverine"" movies do indeed, though not entirely, justify the ""Dark Knight"" comparison. What make it close to Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece are the subtle moments; the moments when the eyes, a walk, or the tone of voice allows the audience into the character's soul. In a farmhouse scene halfway through the movie, Xavier delivers a speech in bed when he speaks of how long he had not felt as happy he was in that moment. It is simply mesmerizing. From Stewart's performance, to the sublime use of sunlight and melancholic aura of the frame. <br/><br/>Where it falls short of being Nolan-worthy, however, is in balancing the overall tone of the film. This lack of subtlety is mainly due to choices related to Keen's performance and the use of explicit language. The language is not the problem. The problem is when the audience laughs at a curse word, when it was clearly not the intention behind the camera. This, of course, has to do with Mangold's poor choices. It is perhaps due to business reasons, to keep in a humorous aspect to the film that Fox feels necessary business-wise. Or, perhaps â€“ and I would like to believe this to be the case â€“ it is purely Mangold's own personal choice. That would mean that yes, he was trying to do the film's realistic and poignant tone justice and simply made the wrong choice. That only proves just how hard it is to make a superhero movie in this fashion, and how Christopher Nolan is, indisputably, a genius.<br/><br/>""Logan"" is the coming of age ""X-Men"" movie. It is the culmination of the story of the character that was defined as the face of the franchise. It hits you like a train; it catches you off-guard, and out of the blue you are experiencing a movie dealing with disease, with death, with finding a purpose to keep on going. In a western. In a ""Wolverine"" movie. This one is special.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"regula1","9","2","6","2 March 2017"," A last hurrah for a battered hero worthy of praise
","This is the second R-rated comic book movie to come out in recent years, the first of which was Deadpool. As Deadpool said in that film ""This guy's got the right idea. He wore the brown pants"" right before killing him.<br/><br/>There are many faceless henchman who should have worn their brown pants in Logan.<br/><br/>Logan is the ninth time Hugh Jackman has appeared in the role of Logan/Wolverine, and it shows in his performance. The film is set in the late 2040s, mutant-kind is all but extinct, and Logan is not the hero he once was. He is shown to be a tired warrior whose spirit is wounded just as much as his weakening body. He tends to a fading Charles Xavier, who in his 90s is losing control of his powerful and dangerous mind.<br/><br/>Then along comes Laura, a young girl with familiar gifts, and Logan must saddle up for one last ride. <br/><br/>There was much buzz around this film as it was reportedly Hugh Jackman's final film as Wolverine. In interviews, Jackman has said he poured his heart into this performance, and it shows.<br/><br/>Boy, does he knock it out of the park.<br/><br/>The theme of Logan's character throughout the X-Men films has been that he is a man struggling with both his identity and his guilt. We got a taste of his road down the hole of depression and remorse in 2013's The Wolverine, but here we see Logan hit absolute rock bottom. Nearly everyone he ever cared about is gone, his last remaining friend is slipping away, and to top it all off, his own powers are fading. We can only imagine the feelings that the character would be feeling, but Jackman's performance brings us as close as we can come.<br/><br/>Aside from Jackman, the other absolutely stellar performance was Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23. Her character starts out fairly simple, but becomes the basis for a deep bond to form between her and Logan. Her performance gave the film some of its biggest laughs, its most intense action scenes, and one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the film.<br/><br/>What faults there are in this film are surprisingly small. The main villains of the film are very one-dimensional; at times, the film almost goes deep into their motivations, but abruptly interrupts itself in lieu of more awesome fight scenes. There are certain characters that the film wants you as the audience to care about, but in reality you just don't, and the film moves on to bigger and better things. All things being considered, these are things the audience can accept as they take in the film's many other positives.<br/><br/>Logan may well be Hugh Jackman's last time baring the claws, and if it were I would say that this film is a very fitting way for Wolverine to say good-bye."
"vasco_cid","6","4","17","3 March 2017"," No comprende
","Wolverine has had quite a bumpy and uneven ride since Jackman took on the role back in 2000. He's been in the main trilogy, he's made appearances in the prequel-trilogy and has had also three spin-offs of his own. As charismatic as the character and the actor playing him are, all of his stand alone outings ended up lacking just that: charisma.<br/><br/>While Origins is often pinned down as a disaster, The Wolverine follow up ended up being a truly catastrophic mess; and despite Mangold's efforts to make amends in this final outing, ""Logan"" is not as strong as it should have been and also isn't the proper conclusion the character needed. The whole selling point was to adapt the Old Man Logan comic as the send-off to the iconic mutant with an R-Rating, an approach the character was craving for since 2000. The gripping action is there, the acting is unexpectedly superior for comic-book films' standards and there's enough character development to elevate the film. Nevertheless, Mangold somehow manages to have the film feel uncomfortably familiar, predictable and deficient denoting a weak directing pulse and sense of conclusion urgency. <br/><br/>As an avid X-Men fan and Jackman's interpretation of Wolverine, I ended up finding all three of the solo outings lacking in a way the ensemble ones (even the weaker ones) never did; he has inhabited Wolverine from day one and it is quite astonishing how he's made 9 appearances in the franchise and none of those felt flat, phoned-in or tired. It was a fully physical and emotional commitment to the mythos that honestly doesn't leave much space left for anyone else to take on or reinterpret(although sadly, we know it's bound to happen)."

"mrinalmmehta","9","1","2","29 August 2019"," My Review!
","Over the past few days, I've been seeing and commenting on Blogs about who could replace Hugh Jackman as ""The Wolverine"". With a pinch of Salt, I've been saying, ""Tom Hardy"". He has the physique, the acting abilities etc and then, I saw ""Logan"". Deep, emotional flick this. It is in no way a classic Wolverine movie. It's surpassed that. Hugh Jackman, the man, ""The Wolverine"". IRREPLACEABLE!!! Next is, the character ""Laura"". That kid, the depth in her eyes, spoke a lot. In many ways, she was over shadowing Hugh Jackman. Seriously, FOR REAL. At that moment, I was like, Tom hardy, respectfully can take a backseat and let ""Laura"" take over as ""The Wolverine"".<br/><br/>There are no end credit scenes in this movie. Many say, after the trailers and the movie begins, there is a pre-credit scene. I was right there sitting even before the trailers began and came across no credit scenes. I saw it online while typing this. Maybe it differs from Country to Country.<br/><br/>Peace Out!"

","LOGAN
RATING: 4.5/5<br/><br/>Not gonna lie, i shed a tear at the end. 17 years of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, comes to a close in all its bloody glory. Same goes for Patrick Stewart as the iconic Professor Charles Xavier. There's times in this movie where it looked like a horror movie to me with all the slashing and blood being spilt, which is exactly what a Wolverine movie should always look like. Plus, after all these years I finally felt the rage come through the screen, and i really appreciated that. I noticed i was clenching my fists during all the fights, the blood really adds a whole new dynamic. Kinda sucks that it took the last movie to finally get it right. This really felt nothing like a superhero movie and it's all the better for it. Gonna have to pour one out for Logan.<br/><br/>Damn, i need a hard drink after that. :'("

","Absolutely incredible. Such a grounded superhero movie that didn't need to rely on alot of special effects. The performances I think of Jackman and Stewart are two of the best in the comic book genre of films. In today's age that is saying something."
"ndson89","8","1","2","18 May 2019"," Proper send off
","When you think of wolverine it's all about the rough attitude and one liner puncher response that has become our favorite from the character. Nice build up of the story where all started with Logan and Prof X were barely making it just to make ends meet. This is a great conclusion to the X-Men saga and of course the Wolverine, Logan. They won't probably be another Wolverine like Hugh Jackman. And the girl portray really decent Jr Wolverine. Probably if any next Wolverine movie the girl will be decent."

","The wolverine - my most loved character of the X-man series. Besides being my most loved character it also is played by my most favorite actor - Hugh Jackman. He is very good actor and suites his role very well. Also, this is one of the few films that made me cry. In the end I cried a lot and and all the cinema was crying. This film has very emotions and I am 100% sure that everyone who likes x-man will be very pleased after watching this film.
EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED!!!"
"skippytjd","10","1","2","10 February 2019"," Phenomenal film that showcases the potential of the comicbook-based films
","This was not just the best comicbook movie, but one of the best overall films this year. James Mangold put together the most satisfying film of his career. From cinematography to writing to pacing, this movie pulls together all of the writer/director's strengths into a compelling character study.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gave his truest, most complicated Wolverine performance. He said he was walking away from the character before audiences grew tired of him, and he left everyone wanting so much more. Daphne Keen made an unforgettable debut as X-23, violent and endearing and utterly captivating. One can only hope that Disney-controlled Fox will still allow Mangold to film his planned follow-up with the character. Patrick Stewart surpassed Jackman in finding even more depth in a character he has played over numerous films. If this was anything other than a superhero film, he would be amassing Best Supporting Actor award nominations from every major body for his heartbreaking portrayal of a once-great man in decline.<br/><br/>In genetics, diversity is essential for a species' long-term survival. In art, it is much the same. With the deluge of comicbook-inspired film and television projects, it is essential that the scope of superheroic fare be broadened, and for artists to be unafraid to experiment with the form. A film like this, that is essentially a Western with a few fast-paced superhuman action sequences, shows what comicbook films can be, and how they can break out of the cookie cutter mold to extend the genre's cinematic life."
"jossjaybee","8","1","2","8 February 2019"," Excellent send off for Jackman's Wolverine
","Its funny how expectations can severely damage your viewing experience of a film. I went into this film with massive expectations and left the cinema feeling a little dissapointed. It took a little time and a rewatch to realise what a fantastic movie this actually was. And in retrospect, i realise that it was more a feeling of melancholy than dissapointment that i was feeling when i left the cinema that evening. This movie pulls on your heart strings man. Its bleak, hopeless and downright sad. Very few movies leave me feeling like this, but Logan was definitely one of them.<br/><br/>The character development is excellent and you really feel for these characters in their struggle. Logan takes no prisoners and would not have worked if it didnt get the full hard R treatment. Although this film isnt perfect and does have a few annoying elements, (disregarding the events of Days of Future Past, and totally messing up the X-Men universe continuity again!) its good points far outweigh the bad. It works best as a standalone movie, and you shouldnt think about it in direct relation to the rest of the X cinematic universe.<br/><br/>Its a pretty basic story, but the great cinematography, music, acting, characters and overall tone of the film makes it great. You know a film of this kind works when even after several rewatches, you still get a lump in your throat and tear in your eye. While i feel its quite overrated by some, this definitely stands as one of the greatest comic book films ever made and a perfect send off for Hugh Jackmans Wolverine. Highly recommended! 8/10"
"blazesuncaster","10","1","2","3 February 2019"," Logan movie review
","I CAN NOT EXPLAIN ENOUGH ON HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS!!!!!!! oh my gosh where do I even begin. I guess I'll start with the story. Logan is a broken down man just trying to reach the service of staying alive and taking care of an aging Charles Xavier. Logan then fines himself in a predicament when he comes along this other mutant with the same powers as him. Her name is Laura. And his job is to get her to her destination while also protecting here from the Revers. OH MY GOD, this is a good freaking movie. Now back to the review. This story was so well planned out and so well executed that it is hard for me to find the words on how good this film was. The lighting, the cinematography, the score, and of course the directing, holy crap was the directing good. James Mangold (the director) has come back from making his previous Wolverine film ""The Wolverine."" And I don't care what people say about the Wolverine, it was fantastic in my opinion. Not as good as this masterpiece of course, but still flipping amazing. But back to what I was saying, James Mangold is a master at its least when it comes to directing this film. The passing of this film is so good it flows like a stream of water. Now let's get to the acting. Hugh Jackman gives without a doubt his best performance in his film career. And I'm talking ""The Prestige"" level of performance. I love Hugh jackman and think he was freaking amazing in this movie. And Dafnee Keen also gives her best performance even though she has only been in a show and an upcoming movie ""untitled."" But still gives a mind blowing performance. Patrick Stewart holy s@@@ man. He knocked it out of the park with this performance. By far his best performance as well. As this being Hugh's and Patrick's swan song. I think that they went out with a bang and gave us. Especially me a time to remember. This is by far my favorite marvel, and probably my favorite movie of all time. I'm serious!!!!. This movie gets a 100%"

","""Logan"" is the best X-Men film to date. It brings more depth to the characters and has authentic consequences.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The grittier tone in ""Logan"" makes for a much more interesting story than the other X-Men films. It was not afraid to take itself seriously and that paid off wonderfully. There are a couple of weak moments in the storytelling but overall it is a gripping film. James Mangold bounces back well from the previous film ""Wolverine"" by showing that he knows how to direct action and make the audience care about the characters by giving the film some gravity. *Cinematography/Editing: The cinematography is beautiful throughout the film, but it doesn't seem to have an objective. There is not much visual storytelling happening. The camera mostly follows the action without any clear purpose for why it is being shot the way it is. John Mathieson has a good command of the frame and lighting, just lacks clear vision on this particular project. The editing is unnoticeable in this film, which is a fantastic thing. The only problem is that there are some pacing issues with some scenes. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is a bit dull at times, but for the most part it carries the action forward and is necessary to driving the narrative forward. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart steal the show as they give one last emotional performance as Logan and Professor X. Boyd Holbrook is a bit over-the-top with his representation of the villain. Dafne Keen does an adequate job as Laura. She is fairly limited as an actress as of now, but she is young. *Music/Sound: The soundtrack is strong in some points and weak in others. It really affects the tone of the film. Some moments feel epic and real, while others feel like filler and the music sounds like filler music. The sound design is a bit much in this film. The knife sounds are heavy-handed. It makes things feel a bit too ridiculous at times, but the rest of the sounds in the film feel authentic. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costume and sets are wonderful in this film, but some of the props feel a little dull. The special effects are mostly impressive, but sometimes get to be a bit ridiculous as well. But, seeing as it is a comic film, it is allowed to have a bit of ridiculousness.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Logan"" closes out Jackman and Stewart's career as X-Men with beauty and grit. It is a solid film worth seeing."

"EderR28","10","1","2","21 August 2018"," One of Cinema's Greatest Films, Regardless of Genre
","Simply put the best and most human superhero film to date. The trailer itself was beautiful and heightened my expectations for the film. As soon as the film begins you knew you were experiencing something different and refreshing. It breaks the flashy and clichÃ© mold often exhibited by Marvel's most noteworthy blockbusters. Instead of the flashiness 'Logan' is more of a neo-western than it is a superhero movie and that creative decision pays off immensely. Incredibly violent, but the violence is earned, unlike other comic book movies, 'Logan' shows you the consequences of violence in the most visceral way. Beautifully filmed, directed, scored, and acted. The movie itself and its leading trio of Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and the incredibly talented newcomer Dafne Keen were all worthy of serious Oscar consideration. This movie will always hold a special place in my heart, not only was it the perfect swan song to Hugh Jackman's tremendous run as Wolverine, but of the countless movies I have had the pleasure of viewing this was the only one that successfully and shamelessly moved me to tears. It was a pleasant surprise to experience a movie starring a superhero that felt genuinely intimate with believable stakes. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to take the time to watch 'Logan' in both it's theatrical and black and white 'Noir' cut as well."

"arjunflamingfeather","10","1","2","27 July 2018"," Confession to illegal stream of 'Logan' watched it
","The movie obscure in the visual connections was a movie with no subtitles. The movie titled 'Logan' did not have 'cam' written on it but 'ts' which luckily we did not find out. The Logan actor is 'Hugh Jackman' who has played in the 'X-men' series and 'Les Miserables'. 
The actor who was nominated for awards like 'Bafta' and 'Golden Globes' due to his on screen personalities has brought us memorable movies like The Prestige and 'The Greatest Showman' In the world. The later of 'Hugh's' movie titled 'The Greatest Showman' we saw in cinema hall. 
'Logan' is then the movie that 'Hugh Jackman' did not end in our memory."
"annieburke-72582","10","1","2","20 July 2018"," Well-crafted, emotional, gory, yet so beautiful
","Being completely honest here, this is the only movie within the X-Men film series (besides the two Deadpool films) I have seen. Yet, watching it only knowing Wolverine/Logan and Charles Xavier in a weaker, older, more vulnerable state didn't end up being a problem for me. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, although their send-offs for their beloved characters were incredibly sad; they put all of their heart into giving dedicated X-Men fans and casual movie goers alike, gripping final performances. Dafne Keen's portrayal of Laura deserves special recognition as for most of the film she is silent, with the occasional grunts and yells that come from fighting. Although, seeing a child be so violent on screen may be disheartening to some, Dafne Keen showed she was a force to be reckoned with as she proves she can keep up, if not out pace the much older Logan in all of their fights. Keen showed strength, resilience, heartbreak, and even a little humor as Laura. If the X-Men films continue with a spinoff of her and the newer mutants, it's safe to say that Jackman and Stewart have left the films in very good hands."
"GOWBTW","10","1","2","26 May 2018"," Feral to the finish!
","One of the finest of X-Men is Wolverine(Hugh Jackman). In the future, he no longer goes by that name. He is known as James Howlett, or ""Logan"". His powers are Adamantiun claws and skeleton and a mutant healing factor which is now reduced due to time. He's not the warrior at his prime. He's now a limousine driver. Helping his former teacher Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart), who now has to take medicine because of psychic seizures he suffers. 
But in the midway of the situation, there's another mutant with the same ability as Logan. It's Laura, aka X-23. The only difference is that she has 2 claws on each hand and one claw on each foot. But don't count Logan out, he can still fight. 
When he worked as a limousine driver, he did his job well. He handled himself well when one of the passengers flashed him. Logan wasn't such an absentee father, at least it wasn't Daken.
Violence and action was non-stop in this film. And that X-24 was more menacing. Logan is a warrior to the end. 
Nothing else can match the tenacity Logan can bring.
5 stars."

","Logan is one of the best films to come out in recent times- surely the finest superhero movie in the past few years. Logan has an emotional depth seldom found in recent films, let alone mass marketed multi-million-dollar superhero movies. The underlying themes of aging, mortality and death are omnipresent- even when the film goes into high gear. And on that note yes- there are some amazing action sequences that will keep the casual fan entertained. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart return and effortlessly slide into the roles they've played for 17 years, perhaps for one last time. Logan is fantastic- Do not miss."

"PStyles","9","1","2","5 April 2018"," The X-Men Movie We Have All Been Waiting For
","I absolutely applaud the creators of this film; finally, we are provided a mature, interesting take on Wolverine which has been long overdue. This film touches on themes of family, unity, and most of all, minority treatment wrapped in a relatable, superhero driven package. <br/><br/>I've been especially critical of superhero movies in recent years. Often, in my opinion, these films feel watered down as they are pumped out faster than we can watch them. I've always had a soft spot for X-Men, though, and this is by far the best of the bunch. Wolverine is one of my favorite superheros of all time, and we are finally rewarded with a mature, explicit movie that shows wolverine exactly as he was always meant to be shown. <br/><br/>This film is not meant to be a sequel machine; in fact, it is quite the opposite. ""Logan"" is meant to be a farewell to the character as we know it, and I must say that it was done in exceeding fashion. I did not expect this movie to be as incredible as it is, simply put. The characters are complex and mature and the plot is believable and exciting. Those of us that have been waiting for an adult superhero movie with a halfway decent script are finally rewarded with ""Logan"". <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, as usual, does a fantastic job in his role. In fact, the entire cast does a great job. This film, though, more than any of the others, has a genuine, relatable feel to it. While there are obviously mutants involved, I think this is one of the most relatable superhero movies to date. With themes that touch heavily on the treatment of minorities and discrimination, ""Logan"" tells a story more impactful than any superhero film made before it. <br/><br/>If you are an X-Men fan, then you will absolutely love this one. If you aren't, there are plenty of other reasons to see it. With excellent acting and a memorable script, ""Logan"" will most certainly resonate with viewers long after the credits have rolled. The themes I mentioned previously aid fantastically to the already great plot and give us something else to think about apart from action and conflict. To top it all off, there is blood, gore, and swearing to boot. This is a Wolverine film done right, and I think it is a fantastic farewell to one of the best characters in Marvel's illustrious history."

<ul><li>the girl with Wolverine's dna (the ""Wolverine's daughter"") it's a very cheesy idea (with an annoying act)</li><li>and that Wolverine clone - who ruins, in my opinion, an otherwise reasonable plot, by creating a reasonably ""cheap"" solution to end Hugh Jackman's role as the character.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall it's a likeable movie, with some drama and lots of violence, but along with that, I feel that Jackman deserved a better farewell...."

","Is what most of the negative reviews are obviously missing. The plot holes you are so readily describing, what exactly are they? You are the conspiracy ""they did it"" people. This movie is a dichotomy of James dealing with his imminent mortality, the fact that everyone who gives a shit about him dies, and now he has a grounding effect of discovering a mutant obviously cloned from his DNA. Logan is fraught with indecision as leadership and responsibility was never his forte and he retreats like most humans-numbing with alcohol. It's the humanity he embraces in self-sacrifices for Laura. Make no mistake, this is a dark and introspective movie. If you were expecting otherwise, a) you obviously do not know shit about old-man Logan and b) you're an idiot."

","Obviously the best XMen movie. Still bad. The giant leap forward is dumping the Stan Lee kind of intellect and the Halloween costumes. And some things can't be dumped.

A mutant has to have some powers, it's as much as Kirby's mind can go. But we don't know it. Than there are the bad guys. There has to be some bad guys, or else how else you get the fighting Messiahs? And the audience will see a slow scene with the bad guys coming in. Than there is a distraction. And a minor fight. Than the audience sees the mutant who does not hear anything. And the mutant is calm although there are screens showing what's going on outside. And the mutant does all these expressive faces waiting. And than the bad guys are in. And nothing. Switch to a big picture of the exterior of the building. And the music is off.

"paulclaassen","4","2","7","3 July 2018"," Oh no, they've turned an exciting franchise into a dreary drama.
","Unfortunately I did not enjoy this at all, mostly because I did not like this vision of the X-Men. The film plays more like a drama than a fantasy superhero film and the (very little) effects are mediocre compared to the previous films. Wolverine is a passive, pathetic character that actually deserves to die. The film is also unbearably noisy at times with way too much yelling and screaming. I'll conveniently forget I've seen this. Wolverine was brilliant in the three X-Men films, and X-Men Origins, which explained how he became Wolverine. The Wolverine followed his adventures after 'X-Men: The Last Stand', and then already did I get a feeling there were nothing more to tell about this character. 'Logan' therefore was an unnecessary installment. We learn that he has a daughter - a cloned daughter! Seriously, I hope they don't clone Wolverine for another sequel...<br/><br/>Dafne Keen was fantastic as his daughter and I predict a great future for her."

And judging by all the fans of the previous movies who dislike this one, I would say that clarifies my decision to skip all the BS and just watch the good one. This is the only good X-Men movie as far as I can tell. It had a good story with good acting and good action. If you want to watch a great movie, watch Logan.

","Firstly, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything since this movie has been out for quite some time. Aside from the obvious, I will try and not delve too far into the movie that I may ruin it for those who have not seen it.<br/><br/>""Logan"" picks up somewhere in the future with Logan caring for a very sick Professor X. However, Logan has also started to notice something about himself. He is not as unstoppable as he once was, he tires rather quickly now, and his wounds are not healing the way they used to. He is also very sick, but doesn't know why--just yet.<br/><br/>In trying to move Professor X to a safer location from all the goons who are after him, he is approached by a woman who tells him she and her daughter need to be taken to a place in North Dakota called ""Eden."" This is some sort of safe-haven from all peoples trying to kill them. The daughter's name is Laura. During one of many fight scenes, Logan witnesses the sheer brutality of Laura who kills at will and seems to enjoy it. After a perilous journey for all concerned, Logan will eventually realize something he never knew.<br/><br/>I realized I was really going to enjoy this movie because the first word that came out of Logan's mouth was the f-bomb! And believe me, that is just one of MANY f-bombs. The violence factor has been way upped in this one, too. Flying limbs, holes blown through heads, decapitations, and death by wood debris are just a few of the new touches. No more of that PG-13 stuff to appease parents!<br/><br/>The performances are also top-of-the-line here--especially by Hugh Jackman, Dafne Keen (as Laura), and Patrick Stewart as Professor X. This is simply the best movie in a series that has been around quite a long time. I loved it and it left me with a big lump in my throat when it ended. Rated R for graphic violence, adult language, and very brief nudity."

"bannedguybe","10","2","7","22 May 2017"," I cried like a little girl
","The wolverine is without a doubt the most characteristic X-Men we ever met back in 2000 (i was 8 back then, discovered the series as i grew older). I've always been a huge fan of the Wolverine (and Hugh) you guys remember him entering the school of Xavier? The feels are so real.. Skip forwards 17 years and and 10 movies later. Where we meet Logan and Xavier in the middle of the dessert, Xavier grew old and sick, same for Logan really... scars all over his body, too much drinking, looking gray and very unhealthy, working as a taxi driver.. U feel that things are about to go south for the both of them and it doesn't take long.. I wont write the entire story but its so well done!!! Credits for the director, but the most credits too Hugh and Patrick! <br/><br/>Here are a few points on stuff i loved and stuff i did not like about this movie!<br/><br/>Things i like 1 - Story telling (slow pace, nothing to fast) 2 - Low on special effects (we have seen a lot in the franchise) 3 - The death of Logan and Xavier (yes! Thats a good thing! I know its a bit weird but it was just time....U gotta face it, Xavier and also Hugh didn't had long anymore) 4 - The little girl plays a very good 'Mini' wolverine 5 - The bad guy with the cyborg hand 6 - When all the kids combine powers too kill the guy with the cyborg hand 7 - When the little wolverine turns the cross to a X on the grave of Logan, its really saying goodbye to the franchise, or at least to the Wolverine Story. 8 - There is no real 'greater good' point about this movie compared to the main movies, in all the X- men movies they fight a bad guy and sure that's cool, but a bit overdone after 7 movies, This is not so much about bad guys, its more about telling a great story and i like that a lot! <br/><br/>Thing i did not like 1 - When we meet the little girl, she never talks, but like never! When she starts talking she speaks Mexican, OK very well... But at the end of the movie she speaks fluent English, But why not talk from the start (and English) it would have made everything so much easier, but on the other hand, nothing about this movie is 'easy', its a very heavy and emotional movie. 2 - The X-24 Wolverine clone.... That just did NOT work for me, i was like 'are you kidding me' Luckily he dies fast and we also don't really see him that much, but common man, So the best say to kill the wolverine is by himself? Is that it? How totally unnecessary! Tho i cannot find a better way to end his life really...<br/><br/>What i want next : I would love to see a movie withing a few years where we meet the little wolverine again, would love a story about her and the kids, we all know where they came from but not where they might end up, but please don't f**k that up directors! And I'm hoping for a next movie for the main movies, but don't f-**ck it up like Apocalypse! Young actors like Mcavoy and Fassbender do a great job as young Xavier and Magneto.<br/><br/>Anyway, i hope this review made u watch the movie and maybe buy it!<br/><br/>Cheerio!"
"muhamadwaiz","10","2","7","22 May 2017"," Best X-Men movie for the best X-Men.
","This is without a doubt THE best movie across the entire Marvel and the X-Men universe. It is deep, emotional and way mature. The end of Wolverine franchise has delivered its most marvelous film yet. It showed the struggle of a weary Logan who finally wants an end to himself after years of immortality but wants a peaceful end. Logan takes care of professor X and is trying to stay away from trouble. However, he realizes soon that he has more than himself and the professor to protect as they encounter a new Mutant, X-23. The relationship between Logan and X-23 is depicted very well.<br/><br/>There were some things that this movie gave vague explanations for. For example, Logan's healing factor is failing but how? The answer I found after watching twice was 'the Admantium poisoning'. The movie does mention it but not explicitly. While Hugh is struggling with his failed healing, Charles is suffering from Seizures thanks to dementia. The epic struggle of the two old friends combined with an emotional storyline makes this movie all the most appealing (I just can't stress enough about the feels you get while watching). With little CGI and excellent Cinematography, this movie makes you feel the pain of Logan. In short, if you're a Wolverine fan, this is the movie you have been waiting for.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's Logan has set the standards for any future Logan too high. I'm pretty sure there won't be a better Wolverine than Hugh Jackman if 20th Century Fox or MCU decide to make another Wolverine without Hugh."

"veensepeper","10","2","7","30 April 2017"," Take notes, Marvel. This is ground breaking.
","'Logan' is an X-cellent movie. Period. It takes the comic book movie genre to a whole new level. A tred on new grounds that is long overdue. It's not just another action adventure. It's a western noir. And I'm loving heaven and earth out of it.<br/><br/>The story takes some clues from the 'Old Man Logan' mini series. But readers of the X-Men comics would also recognize some 'Messiah Complex' or 'Second Coming' influences in there. The end of mutant kind, with just the tiniest hint of hope - in the hands of a child. And it takes the full resources of all who is left (which aren't many) to protect it.<br/><br/>Marvel should takes notes from this. There have been movies in which the characters were at the end of their ropes. Both 'Iron Man 3' and 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' were supposed to take their main characters to super dire straits, but totally lacked the gravitas and general feel of it. Please, Marvel. Have the guts to take your characters to the edge of damnation. And let us, as viewers, experience deep emotions while partaking in your stories. Fox, of all companies, just proved it can be done.<br/><br/>'Logan' however, is not flawless. It has its nonsense. Actually, it has the same nonsense in it as both the earlier installments of the 'Wolverine' solo movies. There are some 'now you see them, now they're dead'-characters, and there is this this overpowered unstoppable baddie near the end of the movie that is slightly ridiculous... but this is really toned down and made to feel not unfit. Also, there isn't an over-abundance of non-existence future tech. So all in all, despite it being a movie about mutants, and taking place in the future, the entire movie feels very grounded in reality.<br/><br/>After the dour tone, and the realistic groundedness, a third quality that needs to be presented in this review is the cinematography. The lighting, the focus, the pacing... it's all spot on! Scenes are given the time to breathe, and the sets and locations are glorious to look at. Not in the sense that they look glamorous - because they don't. But they really helped to set the tone and tell the story. It's perfect.<br/><br/>Then, there are some nice nods to the comics. One of the minor characters, presented in the third act, is Rictor. In the comics, he is part of X-Factor. One of the supporting characters is Caliban. I like the fact that they changed him from a man-child into a highly intelligent person - but they kept his sense of loyalty intact. The bad guys also derive from the comics, as do of course Logan himself, professor Xavier and X23. But, despite these nods, the movie still feels fresh and original. Just like the ridiculousness, they really kept the comic book winks restraint. And it feels all the better for it.<br/><br/>All in all. You don't have to be into comic books, or superhero movies, to enjoy 'Logan'. It works as a movie outside of its genre. But if you ARE into comic books, and if you ARE into superhero movies, this is the breath of fresh air that the genre desperately needed. I hope there is more like this to come."

Im a big xman fan but the rest was uneasy violence almost a ""snuff"" film a child stabbing men men stabbing men which a knife is always way more gory i just felt it was just too violent. Xmen films are more kids adventure but the mix of a golden film (with just a bit of early life happiness story before the decline is all it needed just a light splatter of young love and happiness) against the violence just didn't mix for me but i had to give it 5 stars just for Patrick steward even though in my silly little worthless opinion it needed less xmen more early life. <br/><br/>I respect everyones opinion i just felt Patrick steward in this type of real acting role was an easy Oscar."
"barbagvido","10","2","7","27 April 2017"," The Wolverine we all waited for
","Logan is the 10th movie in the Fox Marvel Universe and the third and final movie in The Wolverine trilogy and also, sadly, the last time we see Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. But everything must come to an end. It's directed by James Mangold, the director of The Wolverine (2013) and is loosely based on a comic book story-line Old Man Logan.<br/><br/>It's really sad to see Hugh Jackman leave this franchise. He didn't even look much like Wolverine from the comics, but he introduced Wolverine to the new wave of fans and his portrayal brought something new and something great to the role. And here, he offers the absolute best of this role. His young co-star Dafne Keen shows one of the best child acting I've seen lately. If you're a fan of Stranger Things, she will remind you a lot of Eleven. And Patrick Stewart also does the best for last. It's Xavier we've never seen before, but he's lovable.<br/><br/>The movie is very gory and I love it. I'm glad to see that the R-rating trend is going strong. While MCU is generally better than this franchise, Fox takes risks and that's why I have respect for them. That makes this franchise more interesting. Also, the whole movie feels a lot like a western and I thought that kind of atmosphere fit very nicely with the story. I just have a few minor flaws. They didn't stop me from loving the movie, but I have to point them out. Someone will be bothered by them more than I was. An uninteresting villain and a bit of anti- climatic ending. But the fact that it was anti-climatic doesn't mean the emotional bar wasn't raised high. You will be getting a lot of feels here. I just expected more sense of closure, that it would go down a bit more epic. But this felt kinda realistic and like a lot bigger gut punch. You will see for yourself.<br/><br/>For everyone who wanted a good, bloody and intense approach to Wolverine, here you go. But it can as well be enjoyed on its own."
"thomasshahbaz","10","2","7","24 April 2017"," The term 'tour-de-force' gets bandied about, but...
","...voila un tour-de-force! (sorry)<br/><br/>I entered this film expecting an above-average, silly action flick. It is, however, a masterpiece about brutality and redemption. <br/><br/>The film vibrates with power (literally, in once scene). The sheer scale of the emotion and breath-taking action (again, literally, I stopped breathing more times than I can remember) are exceptionally rare in any film, let alone an X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>Many genres are stitched seamlessly into a subtle, poignant fabric, devoid of anything to criticise, in my opinion. This is greatly enhanced by a sumptuous score which is perfectly matched to the tone and pace of the story.<br/><br/>It's rare I see something which I could immediately watch again, in fact maybe this was a first. It's also rare that I immediately rush to IMDb to see what else the writer/director has made... I urge everyone in the strongest terms to immediately see this film!<br/><br/>P.S. Stephen Merchant... who'd have thought he'd be so good!"
"pc95","7","2","7","18 April 2017"," Subject of Aging
","This seems to be the trend in movies these days where actors who are calling it quits or who are hanging up a role are getting their encores. Take director James Mangold's ""Logan"" which he also wrote. This movie is certainly a vehicle for Hugh Jackman, who has been in no less than half- a-dozen superhero movies at least. It was likely written specifically for him. Mangold smartly has made his super-heroes mortal and given his story more gravitas. The story feels like a variation of what we've seen before, but the subject of aging and death is right out in the open. It's a fresh and mostly honest look for a Super-hero movie, although the violence is explicitly graphic and maybe could've used a bit of a tone- down. Jackman, Stewart, and young Keen are a capable bunch to watch. The results are good. Recommended 7/10"
"jackchadwick","9","2","7","17 April 2017"," Logan by James Mangold
","Once again Hugh Jackman reprises his role as our favourite mutant Wolverine in James Mangold's second attempt of a Wolverine movie. The movie is a fantastic, beautiful movie and a lovely send off to Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine. Throughout the whole movie I felt very moved by what Wolverine and Professor X (Sir Patrick Stewart) are going through as washed up nobody's that went from hero to zero and are not appreciated. Until this new mutant that could potentially be the last mutant comes along and gives The Wolverine something to live for again. Logan is a very emotional, heartbreaking, moving movie that tugs at our heart strings from start to finish. It's beautifully shot and there isn't a moment in the movie were you aren't almost crying in the emotional scenes that make your heart ache or the action sequences that make you want to jump out your seat and join in on the action. The performances are fantastic, the story is beautiful, the movies a masterpiece and in my opinion the best superhero movie that actually makes the audience feel real emotions. There will be a lot of potential Oscar nominations for this movie and I believe it could even collect one. A great way to start off 2017 in the movies and hopefully movies in 2017 will be just as good or even better than this. Fantastic and could be just as successful as a solo movie that isn't apart of the x-men franchise. 9/10."
"diac228","10","2","7","17 April 2017"," An extremely impressive wrap-up to the Wolverine trilogy, Logan is leagues above the other X-Men films
","Logan might become the first film to truly force the Academy to rethink its opinion on comic book films since 2008, when The Dark Knight forced the committee to expand its Best Picture yearly lineup. Yes, it is that good. And yes, it's the best superhero film in nearly two decades. Yes, I am pitting this above The Dark Knight. Stop shaking your head.<br/><br/>What is a masterful blend of action, drama, and comic book flair, Logan is perfectly executed from beginning to end even though it will tear your heart apart as if Wolverine himself is coming at you in the midst of his infamous berserker rage. Even if you secretly and calmly knew the results of this film, considering that Jackman won't be reprising his role and considering the obviously bleak tone, you still won't be ready for the heartbreak. This dramatic style of comic book cinema is what DC has never fully been able to pull off (especially recently, I'm looking at you Batman vs. Superman) and Disney's Marvel has always refused to aim towards (Because Disney enjoys Marvel following the Pixar formula). It is a fitting end and an excellent finale to a rather clunky spin-off trilogy that is embedded amongst a plethora of other films.<br/><br/>I don't use the term Oscar-worthy very often, especially in the comic book realm. However from the cinematography to the acting many elements of Logan deserves extra praise and an abundance of attention. We can start with James Mangold, whose writing and directing skills here have hit peak momentum. With an interestingly diverse career that spans from Kate and Leopold to Walk the Line to Knight and Day (huh?), Mangold and friends concoct a deep script that remains very much grounded even if the concept involves X-Men and superheroes. In here we see a much older and dying Wolverine and Professor X trying to help a young mutant reach the northern border for safety before the evil company that created her catch up and grab her. The emotions of a difficult life are explored far more than the whimsical events that usually follow comic books that we've read over the years. From the music to the cinematography, every element of Logan points to presenting a story that forces you to reflect on a life you've lived.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart have always been the best parts of the entire Fox X-Men franchise (which has more mediocre films than good, I must add), and seeing them working together here in such a dramatic picture continues to showcase their range and phenomenal talent. As Logan and Charles as opposed to Wolverine and Professor X, we see them stripped down of their power and youth and witness a severely condensed version of what they used to be. It hurts to watch, but we maintain engaged and begging for them to just survive the day. They both deserve some Oscar buzz, I am deathly serious. And serious extra points to Stephen Merchant and newbie Dafne Keen for their remarkable performances. The cast was overwhelmingly stellar and made the film tougher to witness as the stakes are raised and you know death is imminent.<br/><br/>I avoided this movie longer than I should have not because I was afraid of DC-like disappointment, but more because I knew it was the end of an era of films I grew up with, and I knew deep down that it was going to be a difficult watch. Much like us (most of us) as we grow older, the X-Men films have indeed matured, especially in the Wolverine timeline. Logan is nonetheless entertaining indeed, with the dizzying violent action and impressive visuals that compliments a story that feels like a grim western. The production value was top-notch, considering the smaller budget (for a film of its caliber and genre anyway) and considering the fact that the comic book visuals were mostly taking a backseat while allowing the story to organically grow and advance.<br/><br/>It doesn't feel like a comic book movie because it hits so close to home. Logan is a punch to the gut, but a mesmerizing film that is hands-down among the all-time best of the genre. Whether you enjoy comic book movies or not, this is required viewing.<br/><br/>Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/"

This final chapter ( apparently) too is quite enjoyable, at least for a sizable portion of the run time.<br/><br/>The movie, however falters in the last few minutes , where it becomes kiddish , literally. The final few sequences are not well shot and are boring. There is a lot of violence and gore and yet the typical energy associated with the eponymous character is missing.<br/><br/>There is a scene where mutant kids gang up on the bad guy and use their respective powers to kill him. It is totally childish and reminds one of Captain Planet ( only that Captain Planet was indeed targeted at Kids ..).<br/><br/>The violence in the movie is rather too graphic at times. Specially given the fact that a kid, one of the lead characters, perpetrates most of it along with Mr. Logan. <br/><br/>The movie adeptly portrays Logan's march into old age and vulnerability and departs ( Thank God for it) from Logan's drawn out truth and reconciliation musings regarding his past.

I even saw a few interviews with Sir Stewart. I was wrong. I really never have been more wrong.<br/><br/>The movie (if you haven't seen it yet) was hard, yet engaging but also emotional from the start. We all know Wolverine, we know his pressure points (emotional and psychological). We all know he can heal (ergo WE also can). However, the scars inside NEVER heal. And this was shown PERFECTLY! After being confronted with your past (in this case Logan), I think we all know what those scars mean. It doesn't mean that we made the wrong decisions but we sure as hell CAN be confronted by them.<br/><br/>Even if most of those scars were not self inflicted, you still make the best of it.<br/><br/>DC or Marvel... I really think this movie is one that will last."
"jem-82919","7","2","7","1 April 2017"," Original. This film will not disappoint.
","I am not an X man but I have seen a few, enough to understand the back story and that's all you will need. Logan is a movie-story so expertly told I was slowly but surely carried away with a fully loaded cinematic treat for the heart and mind.<br/><br/>Like all good stories Logan needs some context, so take your patience with you to the cinema it's well over 2 hours and not all action. There are twists of the unexpected and the tragic. But mostly you'll root for the good man that is Logan and all that he can do.<br/><br/>A child Wolverine, who'd of thought, not me! Violence abounds against an unending army of armed agents with bad intent. Professor X puts in a crucial and unselfish supporting performance. He is central to my favourite scene. The hotel seizure, it's what happens when an old man of awesome power loses control of his own sensibility. He holds the entire hotel in a telepathic grip of fear when the bad guys corner them in a hotel room. Fantastic and original. I loved it.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed that the albino Stephen Merchant character blew himself up for what I can only assume was frustration that his character was not able to have more impact on the movie....boom! Up to that point he was promising and quirky but literally a vehicle for the first half of the film.<br/><br/>There is no question that Hugh Jackman carried this film, he did it well and with willing and able support from the cast and crew I suspect. I highly recommend it today, but wonder if it will stand the test of time and present as well in 10 or 20 years. Perhaps not a classic, but certainly a cracker.<br/><br/>The Good, the story, the performance, the originality The Bad, slightly over the top violence? The Ugly, that beard that beard"
"riveto","5","2","7","23 March 2017"," Far away to be the 10 of 10 movie everybody is talking about
","I tried to avoid trailers, reviews and almost every media that could spoiled me about this movie, just reading some friends talking about how good was this movie, so i went to theater expecting an overwhelming flick... then i got stomped in the ground, don't take me wrong Logan is not a bad movie, but truly is not the excellent movie everybody says, so here are my facts.<br/><br/>I know everybody got different tastes and obviously i respect that, but there are some parameters that turns a movie into a great movie, one of them is the context, if we take out Logan and the x men universe out of the movie and change it for an average guy that was part in a failed military experiment that managed to escape for a very long time until he meet another failed experiment that result in a child, be sure it could be a lame movie, because it got a lot of facts that do not make sense, and second there are many other movies that has done better even recent movies like blood father with Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>And the main problem of this movie relays in inconsistencies, let me explain some of them, lets talk about Laura (a.k.a. x-23) like the weapon X is a child with adamantium skeleton filled with anger and no sympathy for human race, in the beginning of the movie, she could manage a large group of reavers by herself showing no mercy with a berserk state then we got gas station scene when a employee try to ask her to pay and she almost kill him, then we got the family and we see her smiling and willing to share those feelings, after that we find that she can talk, she can drive, knows how to use a map, and even know what is money for, why not just pay the sunglasses in the gas station? why she need Logan to get to Eden? and then she find his mutant kid friends that must face the same amount of reavers but this time is better to run.<br/><br/>And OK maybe many people can think why judge a movie from this lack of sense with the girl? well the problem is that the movie repeat this patron in almost every character, Logan for example in this movie is old, he is sad, wrecked, tired of life, but the movie can't explain why? and every time the movie try to make it, use Charles Xavier as the one with the turbulent past and no Logan, so come on, this movie drinks from the old man Logan comic series book, in this series, Logan is tired from life because he killed almost all x men in a trap set by mysterio so his conscience corrode him, but here he almost got no reason to be sad, he is one of the last mutant, but why he is sad? why he want to be dead that even got this adamantium bullet to blow his head off, if he could be killed by a old and rotten wood?.<br/><br/>But... people like it... and is true, Logan is a different movie from everything we seen before in the marvel universe, is sad, dirty, drinks from the old crepuscular western movies, got a lot of gore and violence in some cases unnecessary if you ask me, but it got it, that try a lot to appeal to every sad feeling you got in your heart, and you probably like it even cry with it, but if you know about movies, if you have seen a lot of movies like blood father, the road, the dark knight, watch some series like stranger things or even played some video games like the last of us, you could find what's missing in this movie, it lacks of creativity, it lacks of that parts where the spectator could fulfill the argument, and make sense even could be in the shoes of the characters, there a lot of things that makes no sense in this movie, full of clichés, not smart behaviors from almost every character even villains, family ties that appear from nothing and some other super heroes and comic adaptations movies that are far over from this movie, you could find what Logan really is, an average movie with a lot of body but no heart on it."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","2","7","20 March 2017"," Wolverine's Finest Hour is Also Jackman's Last
","A very hard R for Hugh Jackman's last call as Wolverine, easily the most unapologetically dark, violent take we've ever seen from a Marvel property. It's a jolt at first, but also necessary to effectively and immediately shift the tone from the campier tendencies of the greater X-Men franchise to the sad, defeated near-future of this timeline. There's a bucketful of carnage, but also a wealth of character moments, particularly between Xavier, Logan and Laura, the young mutant also known as X-23. This area has always been trouble for Fox's X-films, with so many faces cramming the screen that it can often be tough to remember names, let alone a convincing motivation. This time, that scope is kept intentionally narrow, and it bears ripe fruit. Particularly during the gut-wrenching final scenes, which not only deliver a strong sense of closure to all three arcs, but also reveal the troubling reality that tomorrow's heroes may have already been corrupted by the path they've unwillingly marched. Outstanding work from the leading actors, particularly Jackman and Stewart, who have a long and successful chemistry together, and a surprisingly bright supporting effort from Stephen Merchant, of all people. It's a bold finale that should finally give mature fans of the genre something wet and meaty to sink their teeth into. Refreshing proof that not every superhero story needs to be bleached for a younger audience."
"patrickkemner","10","2","7","19 March 2017"," So much better than the last crappy X-Men
","Greetings<br/><br/>Finally, an excellent X-Men movie. After the mediocre scenarios of First Class (Some actors were great though) and the awful Apocalypse movie (everything is bad in this movie), we have at last an excellent X-Men movie worthy of the original cast of the X-Men (Even though Anna Paquin's Rogue personality/story was in fact Jubilee's and it should have been her. Rogue is a tough, rowdy woman, not a horror film screamer with a girlish attitude... but the actress did what she was told to do... although the real Rogue story played by a tough rowdy actress would have been better.).<br/><br/>It was nice to see Mr. Stewart and Jackman work together once more, they have a great on-screen chemistry. Wish the original X-Men cast did more movies together, I miss those actors as the X-Men. Pity the director and writers screwed up everything with an amateurish X-Men 3...<br/><br/>Well, it is not an ameritrash movie with no scenario and where everybody claps hands at the end of the story, which is good (so cliché and I am tired of watching the same movie each time with different actors and theme).<br/><br/>Everyone in this movie gives an exemplary performance as an actor, even young Miss Dafne Keen is great. hehe! :D<br/><br/>Logan is a touching movie about the only surviving X-Men, Wolverine, and his life a long time after the other X-Men disappeared or died. Professor X is old (80ish in the story) and Logan, well, something is wrong with him and we see it right at the beginning of the movie. Like I said, the movie is not flashy and superficial like the last few Marvel movies, it's not based on a bang-bang! pow-pow! or a cliché, and very boring, save the world scenario like Suicide Squad or X-Men Apocalypse. There IS a scenario, character psychology involved (probably why Mr. Jackman and Stewart agreed to make another super hero movie with the Wolverine and Prof. X), emotions, an intrigue (you are asking yourself questions for the first part of the movie... especially if you don't know much about X-Men's comic book universe), and of course, captivating credible characters.<br/><br/>You really feel the pain of the characters and for that I lift my hat to the actors as well as those who made it possible for them to be so real (good editing, scripts, directing, etc.).<br/><br/>If you are like me and loved X-Men 1 and 2, well Logan is even better albeit being a sad dark tale. But it seems that the Future Past never came at least. No Sentinel-ruled U.S.A... for now.<br/><br/>I will certainly buy the Logan DVD and put it beside The Wolverine movie (the first one, not the crappy 2nd with the botched scenario) and X-Men 1 and 2 in my collection. The actors and those who worked on the movie merit at least that... hope they get recognized by winning a prize in some big award show, because Mr. Jackman and Stewart did an amazing job with their characters.<br/><br/>Thumbs up both of you!"
"Cinema_Love","10","2","7","18 March 2017"," Impressing movie !!
","Let me start this review by saying the numerous good reviews by either the critics and the real critics in my mind, you, the people sold me.... well last year at the same time, we had Batman vs Superman that in my opinion was so destroyed by critics that us, the normal people, did not want to see it... in fact I saw it and loved it a lot.<br/><br/>So far with the underrated one BvS, let's talk about the best thing Marvel ever done with their current TV series shows on Netflix ''Jessica Jones'', ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and currently since yesterday ''Iron Fist''.<br/><br/>''Logan'' stars Hugh Jackman in the returning role but in a much different era, 2029. Sir Patrick Stewart also join the cast as Professor X, the great Stephen Merchant as a older Caliban, we seen him under another actor in ''X-Men Apocalypse'' last year. Boyd Holbrook as the furious Pierce. and an actor I'm happy to see, Richard E. Grant as Dr. Rice. But the one that really shines is Daphne Keen Fernández who portrays Laura, the daughter of Logan/Wolverine.<br/><br/>I won't talk much about the storyline as you will see, it's not entirely new, but for a film like this, it's brilliant. James Mangold make a film part Western part Superhero and the recipe work pretty well... ''The Wolverine'' was kinda disappointing for most, in fact, i did not hate it as it was part of another universe of the Claw man. Here, it is the same case, it's another universe, you can say ''Hors-Serie'' but the film really shines because we know Logan since almost 2 decades of film with Hugh Jackman and it take a really personal and emotional ride.<br/><br/>See it without even reading what worked or what could have worked. It's just pure cinema and I enjoy it a lot."
"syedmahiaan","10","2","7","17 March 2017"," One of the Best Movies I've ever seen.
","Logan is an excellent combination of sadness, action, and gore. It exceeds in making a good Wolverine film (One that we have only dreamed of happening), and flat-out brilliant characterization of Old Man Logan, and of course, X-23. <br/><br/>Gore matches up beautifully with Wolverine, and i was surprised this was the first Wolverine movie with an R rating. Other than Wolverine himself, (Which i repeat, is a brilliant performance by Hugh Jackman), Charles Xavier (Professor X), played by Patrick Stewart is also amusing, seeing Professor X struggling to control himself is heartbreaking, as he goes day by day, going through telepathic seizures which paralyses everyone close by him. X-23 fit in perfectly into the story, having an attitude just like Logan, she is surely a fan- favorite part of the movie.<br/><br/>Logan is old, he is weak, and he will go through hell to get the next generation of mutants to safety, and (SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>Succeeds, but, unfortunately dying in the process. The scene in which he is covered in blood, with a branch sticking out of his stomach, and holding his own daughter's hand, is absolutely a scene that stands out the most, because for Logan, Getting Hurt is an option, Getting killed is an option, But, Quitting is not.<br/><br/>Logan is a heartbreaking, eye watering, and overall, a masterpiece."
"aki-149209","10","2","7","14 March 2017"," Fitting end to tribute to Wolverine.
","Since Logan, (IMO) X-Men universe have only 3 good movies so far. Those are X-Men, Wolverine - Origin & X-Men - First Class. Logan simply outcast those movies. Its just perfect in all sense, whether you want humour, gore, action, drama or emotion. You name it and Logan has it. Its just perfect in each way. Hugh Jackman is always been & will always be the Wolverine for his fans. He did a marvelous job, the best of his career I think. Apart from him Dafne Keen is spectacular as Laura. <br/><br/>Logan is the true tribute any production house can ever give to any of his character."
"powermandan","5","2","7","13 March 2017"," Really Not Very Good.
","I've never been a big fan of the X-Men series. The Wolverine spin-offs haven't impressed me either. So far, this instalment has maintained a very high rating on this site. It is different enough from the others to be considered different, but different does not always been better.<br/><br/>The first noticeable thing that is different with this is its R-rating. There's nothing wrong with a movie being rated R, especially an action movie. But this movie seemed like it tried to capitalize on the successes of Daredevil and Deadpool by making it similar in tone and grittiness. But honestly, the action here wasn't as amazing as you'd think. It is good, but not great. There is lots of blood and guts, but that literally does nothing--it neither diminishes nor elevates the quality of the action. Maybe if this was directed by the same ones that did Deadpool and some Daredevil episodes, the action would probably have been great. I guarantee it.<br/><br/>So Logan apparently takes a more realistic and humane approach than the others. Okay I totally disagree with that. Anyway, Logan's powers are dwindling and he makes a living as a chauffeur. His latest client makes him stumble into a wild scheme that involves doctors trying to replicate mutant DNA since the mutant population is shrinking. He also must care for Professor Xavier.<br/><br/>So what other problems do I have with this? Right off the bat, it is way too long! It goes on and on trying to forcefeed the bogus relationship between Logan, Xavier, and the girl. And the storyline is too dull to fill up that much time. And it is told so much dryer than I could have imagined. And finally, Hugh Jackman. I've never understood the big fascination with Hugh Jackman as an actor. He is far too forceful in his delivery. I didn't buy it. None of the others were good either.<br/><br/>So good action, and not much else.<br/><br/>2/4"

Logan was packed with everything a great movie should contain and i would recommend this to anyone it is great! So many surprises, so much action, great/impressive drama the film is perfect in my opinion and it is worth seeing!"
"pablocegar","10","2","7","13 March 2017"," The best tribute to Hugh Jackman
","This movie was amazing to watch. I loved the fact that it drove away from the classic villain that wants to destroy the world or the galaxy, but instead doing a film where Wolverine is being chased while taking care of Proffesor X and Laura. <br/><br/>The film was so powerful with lots of great character emotions all over it, which gave the film a more serious sense than the rest of the Marvel movies, and yet it had some humour in it, and amazing fight things in which Laura was awesome.<br/><br/>I'm happy that this movie is having such great success, and I hope that they don't mess it up doing a Wolverine reboot in the next few years, but instead they continue with Laura's story-line because she was amazing and Dafne Keen did an amazing job."

","This movie was everything I wanted it to be and more.

The acting was on point and you fan feel the emotions the actors are portraying. It touches on quite a few taboo and shocking things. <br/><br/>True fans know where this story leads, and I have only ONCE been to a movie where the audience was SILENT afterwards and that was American Sniper. And no, I'm not likening Logan (a fictional character) to Chris Kyle (A TRUE hero), it just goes to show how truly attached moviegoers have become to Wolverine. <br/><br/>All around awesome movie, phenomenal acting, every minute of the movie was done well.

"Jayashantha","9","2","7","12 March 2017"," Only seconds to Dark Knight
","I don't normally miss a premiere of a movie this kind but had to wait till today. So here I am coming out of Logan and WOW! I was not ready for something like that! LOGAN is a comic book live action masterpiece. I'll make this SPOILER FREE since it's still too early to go in too deep. Talking about LOGAN, this is something way different than what you'd expect from a normal Marvel movie. Not another Disney-Marvel family fun filled adventure but a more mature take on a story line that is so complicated and brutal, this is proof that the franchise has really grown up since 2002. I'm so glad Fox pulled something like this off. Director James Mangold and Screenwriters Micheal Green and David James Kelly did a tremendous job staying faithful to the source material and sending off the two iconic actors who gave life to Logan and Professor Xavier for almost 17 years. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart brought their A game for this movie and the performance is just speechless. Have to say, it took them 17 years to bring out the true self of the character Logan/Wolverine and the fact that it came out with a hard R makes it even more perfect. Logan is a movie that is so brutal, action packed and will always keep you at the edge of your seats but will also emotionally destroy you along the way. 2017 started off with a movie that is so amazing watching it once will not be enough. I don't know how Academy selections normally work but this movie deserves a go at Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for the heart breaking performance by the legendary Patric Stewart and the well put together story that managed to stay within the borders of the original source material but was able to make audience forget it was another comic book adaptation. This is a MUST watch movie for the year 2017."

"jboothmillard","7","2","7","8 March 2017"," Logan
","It was massive news when it was announced that the leading actor was stepping down from the role of Wolverine, after seventeen years, this was his final outing, it was just a question of what would happen to the character, directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma, The Wolverine). Basically it is the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction, James ""Logan"" Howlett, formerly Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), is ageing and weakened, the adamantium fused to his body is poisoning him, meaning his healing capabilities are dwindling, he has turned to alcohol, and he works as a chauffeur. Logan is living in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, along with albino mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), there they are caring for Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, causing devastating effects to his telepathic abilities. Logan is approached by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse for biotechnology corporation Transigen, she wants him to escort her and an eleven-year-old girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), to a place called ""Eden"", in North Dakota. Logan is also approached by Transigen's cybernetically-enhanced chief of security, Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), he turns down his offer of a job to find Gabriela and Laura for him. Logan reluctantly accepts the job for Gabriela, but he discovers she has been murdered, Pierce and his cybernetically- enhanced enforcers, the Reavers, try to kill Logan and Laura, they and Charles narrowly escape the killers, but Caliban is captured and tortured into using his capabilities to track them. Logan and Charles watch a video on Gabriela's phone, they learn that Transigen was breeding mutant children with DNA samples from several mutants for the ""X-23"" project, but as they grew up they became difficult to control, upon completion the children were deemed unnecessary and were to be killed, Gabriela helped several children escape and smuggled Laura across the border, furthermore, Laura is Logan's daughter, bred from his DNA. Laura has brought a X-Men comic, Logan finds this while they stay in Oklahoma City, in it Eden is referenced, he comes to believe Eden does not exist, the Reavers locate them, but Charles has another seizure and freezes everyone in the hotel with a psychic blast, this allows Logan to kill the enemy, but hundreds have been left injured and dozens dead, Logan injects Charles with a suppressant before they leave. A local family, the Munsons, give the trio shelter, after they help round up their horses on the highway, during the evening Charles expresses his guilt about the past, where he has a seizure that injured and kills an unknown number of people, including some X-Men. Charles thinks he is talking to Logan, it is in fact a feral Wolverine clone, X-24, that has no healing abilities and a weaker adamantium skeleton, the clone stabs Charles and slaughters the Munson family wife Kathryn (Scream 2's Elise Neal) and son Nate (Quincy Fouse), then captures Laura, Logan returns after the devastation, the injured Charles dies shortly after. Caliban sacrifices himself, destroying the van he is in with two grenades, allowing Logan and Laura to escape, Logan and X-24 clash, until the clone is impaled and shot in the head by Munson father Will (One Hour Photo's Eriq La Salle), before he dies, allowing Logan and Laura to escape. After burying Charles, Logan is rescued from a clinic by Laura, after a doctor attempts to convince him he can help his condition, Laura convinces him to let her drive them Eden, meanwhile X-24 is given a serum to regenerate by his creator Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), the head of Transigen. Logan and Laura find Eden, a safe haven for the escaped Transigen test subjects, run by mutant Rictor (Jason Genao), the children are planning to journey across the forest to the Canadian border, where there people who can help them, Logan wants to leave Laura with them, he worries his presence will endanger them. However the Reavers ambush the children in the forest, Logan uses a serum Rictor gave him to restore his healing factor, he slaughters many Reavers before the serum effects wear off. Rice confronts Logan, he reveals the destruction of mutantkind was is due to a virus created by Transigen, made to control the mutant population and weaponise them, he also mentions that Logan killed his father, Logan shoots Rice dead, and Pierce release X-24 on him. The children wipe out the remaining Reavers and kill Pierce, Logan and Laura fight X-24, Rictor uses his seismic powers in attempt to aid Logan, but caught off-guard he is impaled on a tree stump, Laura is able to kill X-24 with an adamantium bullet to the head. Fatally wounded, Logan acknowledges Laura as his daughter, he tells her not to be the weapon she was made to be, before he dies in her arms, the children mourn his death, and bury him in the woods, Laura tearfully adjusts the cross on his grave, to create an ""X"", she and the children continue their journey to cross the border and find a new beginning. Jackman has played Wolverine since the first X-Men in 2000, in a total of nine movies, including cameos and three solo movies, so speculation was obviously rife as to whether he was being killed off or replaced, the now dishevelled and more vulnerable Jackman really creates pathos, Stewart as the weakened Professor X also does fantastic in what is his final X-Men movie as well. This is a most interesting entry in the series, for its raw quality, stripping away massive set piece sequences and going down a slow-burner road movie style, and it is much more adult, more swearing and much more gory violence, you question why it is not an 18 certificate at times, it has a good script and gets you excited when it needs to, it is definitely a suitable end for the clawed superhero we loved, a great superhero action thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Very good!"
"sc_mackinnon","6","2","7","7 March 2017"," I wanted to like this - I really did! But...
","I had heard the reviews of this one: excellent, poignant, best Wolverine movie, etc. What I watched did not live up to the hype.<br/><br/>The magic of the X Men wasn't there. Neither was the humour. Instead, I watched a sad and plodding movie with 1 dimensional characters. It all seemed so flat.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart was just annoying. He rambled on too much. There was very little background info on the mutant caretaker character. Jackman was pretty good. The guy can deliver every single time, no matter what the movie. But I must admit, what really didn't sit well with me was I was all the cussing and the graphic violence. I was surprised by it. The X Men movies never resorted to that. It just seemed like it was too much. <br/><br/>Very disappointed in it. I wish that I would have trusted my 'inner critic' and waited for it to come on HBO. I wasted over $30 at the theatre."
"cruise01","9","2","7","6 March 2017"," Best Wolverine film yet!!!
","I was very much amazed with Logan, and for it to be the third Wolverine film. It felt completely different as a film with the character like the style, direction, and tone. Different in a good way, were James Mangold's direction was worth mentioning and how this character was so grim looking. The film given an R rated direction, makes it even gritty when it comes to its brutal bloody violence and a more profane Wolverine. Logan is an impressive film that could stand on its own if it wanted too. The script was perfect as it focuses on the characterization with a grim old alcoholic Wolverine and gritty intense fight sequences that can leave the audience cringing with the characters claws slicing through the bad guys. <br/><br/>The plot takes place in 2026, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a chauffeur for hire, driving his clients in a dystopian future. Trying to make enough money for him and Charles (Patrick Stewart) to live on their own and away from everyone. Until a lady asks Logan for help, knowing who he really is. And needs his help to drive Laura (Dafne Keen) from the borders of Mexico to North Dakota for safe haven. With a militarized unit known as the Reavers led by Donald (Boyd Holbrook) after them. Laura has a similar gift like Wolverine with the claws and a healing factor. <br/><br/>The plot was well done, taking the story further out with the timeline, making Logan feeling isolated and alone. With the adamantium poisoning him as he ages, and it is finally catching up to him. The film has some gritty intense action sequences making Wolverine fights with the bad guys bloody. The film's midway reveal with the villain was also cool and puts an insane match to Wolverine without giving away spoilers. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart delivered their best as their characters are older and a grimmer look. Dafne Keen did great as Laura, a quiet young girl that delivers expressions that you can actually feel for when she is afraid or angry. <br/><br/>Logan does so well in concluding Wolverine's character arc, and even though it is sad to see this being the final movie to the character. It did it so well, that Logan ends in an emotional satisfying way. I still have trouble seeing how this movie is so different from the others. The others focused too much on having a lot of mutant characters and action and cgi. This film worked on delivering just on that one character, less cgi action. Grittier undertone action. Sometimes taking it way to seriously for a comic book character. Which makes this character different from the previous movies and the X-Men movies. <br/><br/>Overall, Logan is a really good superhero film, making it the best in the series. With its dark gritty direction, a strong script that delivered on the old man Logan concept, powerful performances, intense action, and an emotional satisfying conclusion. I give Logan 4.5 out of 5."

Laura could've so easily ended up becoming an annoying character but was thrilled to see her strive as this character enforcing a mysterious personality as well as at times kicking ass, she thrived as this character better than anyone could and was an overall excellent performance by the young actress. <br/><br/>This film conveys a contrasting outset as to what is stereo typically seen within superhero movies, we still have a thrilling film with some amazing action scenes but with a completely different vibe, this is a whole hearted drama about family, not your usual superhero stereotype. being so down to earth was absolutely brilliant focusing on character development and story telling over massively over extended action scenes, something needed in the past 2 wolverine films. whilst having the first and third act as the most thrilling, intense and emotional acts the second act is still so greatly needed in order to build our characters personality and bonds between one another as well as really ensuring the audience cares about what happens to them. Being the send off to Hugh Jackmans reign as the wolverine this film gave me exactly what i needed, some kick ass brutal action scenes with no holding back which really did take my breath away portraying pure compassion and emotion, Logan is in a completely different category along with the dark knight rises and proves superhero films are worthy of Oscar nominations!The connection between our 3 main protagonists was exceptionally conveyed from the acting to the story telling Logan can not be faulted and gave me exactly what i needed, highlighting why i love film, it truly made me feel pure emotion as if these characters were real, theirs an indescribable feeling that when Logan is kicking ass saving the day that doesn't come around often at all but occasionally brilliant films such as this one comes along and reimburse that overwhelming feeling of pure amazement and happiness that i long for in films.<br/><br/>This film does portray pure emotion and each actor/actress gave it there absolute all however my one and only ask from this film would've been that they included a little bit more into the emotional scenes a couple more extra lines of dialogue that really would've tugged on my heart strings that tiny bit more but also understand they don't want to over do it. <br/><br/>If it hasn't been seen clear through my soppy love for this film Logan truly is outstanding, with in my top 2 superhero films and anyone who hasn't seen this film needs to. perfect is next to impossible in the film genre but i believe Mangold got as close as you can get.<br/><br/>I gave Logan a 10/10"

","Wolverine is everything a movie should be.You feel like you are on an journey where you feel each of the main character's emotion and pain. You laugh with them, smile with them, mourn with them and feel rage with them all within the span of two and a half hours.The characters were organic and feels natural.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing from the main characters. Hugh Jackman brilliantly portrays a washed up has been Wolverine who lives in the shadow of his glorious past. A man who is broken and has lost everything and doesn't care anymore. His character feels like a character from a Shakespearean tragedy. Sir Patrick Stewart plays the old Charles Xavier, a sick old wise man who's just whiling away the final days of his once incredible life. And the star of the movie is undeniably Laura, portrayed superbly by Dafne Keen. She steals your heart from the first time she appears on screen and doesn't give it back to you until the end credits roll. She was the heart and soul of the movie. The bond between these three characters feels so organic and you are in the ride with them. Nothing on the movie feels forced.<br/><br/>The action sequences are placed at the right time and right place. It was not overdone and it was not underdone, it just feels natural. The three main characters were the main part of the movie, the action and other superhero elements are there just to enhance the characters and they don't take the center stage at any point. And that's what I like a superhero movie to be. A superhero movie about characters not just superpowers. The superpowers should be a part of the character and not the other way around.<br/><br/>The movie is gripping, makes your heart feel heavy and feel light and puts you through all sorts of emotions within its run-time. It's not just an action/superhero movie, it's a heart throbbing drama with action and superhero elements in it. It also has a lot of nostalgic feeling to it.<br/><br/>I don't care about the critics, negative or positive. I never base my opinion on them. This review is completely based on my own opinion and I don't care if you like it or not. This is my first review and I'm only writing it because I totally loved the movie, I soaked in every single second of it. And I just wanted to praise the movie somewhere. The movie felt like a love letter to me.<br/><br/>This is the best superhero movie, till date and I hope people take this as an example, and make movies based on characters and not just the superhero elements. (I'm not saying they should never make the other way, because if done right, they can be brilliant (like Guardians of the Galaxy was super cool but pretty much most of the other movies of this genre are kinda generic at this point in time. It's overdone. Besides all their flaws, movies like Man of Steel, BVS and the old X Men Movies had the humane elements to their main characters. And irrespective of their imperfection,I always enjoyed them more than movies with just superpowers elements.) But to me, Logan is just a flawless perfection and has everything I need in a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Bonus review (for gamers), if any of you played The Last Of Us, this is the closest movie adaptation we're gonna get. And you will definitely see the similarities. Besides their obvious similarities, they're still very different in their own ways. I don't think Last Of Us should be made into a movie because it's hard to fit in the story and develop the characters within the given short hours. But Logan had an advantage with that since Wolverine and Charles Xavier were already established characters and it was easy to fit the story within the short span. So movie goers, if you liked the movie, you should definitely consider playing The Last of Us. And gamers, if you liked the game, you should definitely consider watching the movie in the cinemas. You'll definitely feel good.<br/><br/>10/10 **********"
"bigredkblazer","10","2","7","5 March 2017"," Everything You've Been Waiting For & So Much More
","I rate Logan a 10 because there isn't an 11. I'll admit I initially approached it with some trepidation given the previous two films in the franchise. Wolverine is one of my two favorite comic characters (the first comic I bought for myself was Wolverine #42). I've read every Wolverine story ever written, so for me the first two films in the series were a pretty tremendous letdown. Their only saving grace is that Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine and brings his A game in each film, which are also buoyed to an extent by some other great actors like Liev Schreiber. The story lines have been cut and paste jobs that just didn't work and we've been denied Wolverine's true nature because of a millstone like PG-13 rating. Everything wrong in those films is instantly rectified in Logan. Its clear that a lot of source material was incorporated into this film, and while not a strict retelling of any one story line; it treats the material with the respect it deserves. We finally get to see Wolverine go berserk; his feral rage unleashed until everything around him is dead. But, with an R-rating I certainly expected that. What I didn't expect was a great plot with great characters, and I'm not the first to suggest that a couple Oscar nominations wouldn't be out of line. A lot of people might dismiss that, but I assure you that only means they didn't see the film. Logan works so well because it is a great film set in a superhero universe, instead of a superhero film. There's a depth to the characters that's been missing in almost every film of this genre except for possibly in Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. The story isn't afraid to follow things to their darkest possible conclusion, often leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering if they are really going where you think they are, and then they do. There are times that will have you holding back tears. The action is great without feeling gratuitous, rather its a product of the world in which these characters exist, and so rather than violence for violence's sake the audience is thrust into something akin to the Omaha Beach landing in Saving Private Ryan instead of the island compound destruction from Commando.<br/><br/>Most people by now realize that they are introducing X-23 in this film. This was another decision that both excited and frightened me. X-23 is an awesome character, but I had a host of practical considerations for trying to bring such a young version of this character to life on screen. I was floored by Dafne Keen's portrayal of X-23 from both a dramatic standpoint as well as her capability in the action. Obviously there were stunt doubles and CGI used, but its done so seamlessly that you truly believe in how dangerous and capable this preteen killing machine is. Thus far I can't remember such a performance by so young an actor as evidenced by my lack of ability to come up with a comparison.<br/><br/>Logan isn't about franchise building. I'll save you the seat time if you want to leave at the end: there is no sneak preview for the next film in the franchise. That very fact is Logan in microcosm. This isn't another tale in a series, in fact you could watch it without having ever watched any of the previous films and not feel like you missed anything. Logan is a great film in every sense, and is putting the entire industry on notice that the bar has been substantially raised because its going to be THE standard to which these films will be compared for decades. This is the first film in a very, very long time that I will definitely see in the theater more than once. If like me you only get out to a handful of films a year make this one of them. You will not be disappointed."

There are few that are really meant for the adult market - Dark Knight trilogy, Dead pool and Guardians of Galaxy could be placed in this category. <br/><br/>Logan invents a new template for serious cinema with superheroes for adults...

"jcaesar-01251","8","2","7","2 March 2017"," Logan: Third times a charm.
","Here's my spoiler-free review of the film Logan, which I was lucky enough to go to the NZ premiere to watch.<br/><br/>Firstly, I think we need to thank Deadpool. Because if Deadpool didn't succeed in the way that it did, 20th Century Fox wouldn't have taken the risk of creating a Logan/Wolverine film the way it should be. James Mangold (director) and Hugh Jackman pulled no stops as we progressed through decapitated heads, punctured limbs, sliced off body parts, and buckets full of fake blood that gives Wolverine an animalistic savagery his comic counter-part has, but just couldn't capture in the previous PG X-Men films. <br/><br/>We're in the dirty, dystopian, Western-like world of 2029. A world where mutants are all but gone, Logan is not the fierce warrior we've come to know, but an alcoholic driver-for-hire, whose adamantium is slowly killing him from the inside, caring for 90- year-old Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who suffers from a brain disease that causes people within a mile or so to paralyse every time he suffers a seizure. Their quiet life is quickly turned upside down with the introduction of Laura (Dafne Keen), who takes our characters on a journey running from evil scientist Dr. Rice (Richard E. Grant), cyborg-arm guy (Boyd Holbrook) and his Reavers. Special mention for Stephen Merchant as Kaliban who adds to the story, and not just comedically. <br/><br/>This is a contained X-Men film, building on the previous 7 films mythology, but more concerned with the story at hand. There's no world to save, no city to clean-up, not even a damsel in distress to turn into a love interest, this is a family tale, told in the most adamantium way possible. It's a film about a passive, sorrowful, broken hero at the end of a long adventure trying to find peace. And the film is smart in creating unpredictability, we're unsure of what this road will cost Logan.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of this film, is its focus on the man, not the superhero. It's in the title of the film, named after James Howlett's human alter-ego: Logan, rather than Wolverine, his superhero alias. The previous X-Men films have been about showboating their superhero powers, it's what audiences expect going into a X-Men film, and I would argue most if not all superhero films. Here, we dive in Logan's reluctance to be a hero, a complexity he's been struggling with for a couple movies, and Mangold explores these personal themes, such as Logan's reluctance but also his feelings of guilt and isolation. <br/><br/>The character relationships here are unparalleled in superhero flicks. All the relationships add depth, emotion and a heartbeat to the film. The mentor-student/father-son dynamic between Jackman and Patrick Stewart is heart-warming. Seeing a broken, beaten and old(er) Xavier being cared for by an aging and ailing Logan is nothing short of heart-breaking. In previous films Logan uses the term 'professor' to show Xavier's standing over Logan. Here, Logan doesn't mention it once. They are now close, and we explore their bond and the mutual feelings of guilt which is incredibly engaging. Also, Logan's relationship with Kaliban is a great. The relationships aren't just about emotional depth, but they help bring out our hero's humanity. Also, these characters don't just make a team, but a family. Unlike previous X- Men films, where they tried to make us think it was family, this film takes the time to tell a story of a family.<br/><br/>The standout is Dafne Keen, playing Logan's daughter Laura. Keen holds her own with the 2 veterans, skilfully adding to the trio's family dynamic. Keen presents a young Wolverine-like Laura whose walk between innocence and intensity is spectacular.<br/><br/>If this is Jackman's swansong, he's exiting stage left at the top of his game, to the thunderous applause of an audience demanding an encore. This is indeed an end-of-an-era, Jackman has donned the adamantium claws a whopping 9 times in 17 years, and never has he been more nuanced in his delivery than here. His performance can be both exhilarating and tear-inducing in equal measure. Jackman's legacy can be seen through the fact that his Logan/Wolverine has survived a Brett Ratner sequel, one bad Ryan Reynolds Deadpool, a couple bad movies to still be as loved and cherished by not only the comic book geeks (you), but also the general movie-going audience (you).<br/><br/>Logan is a sincerely moving and gritty human story, which enthusiastically abandons superhero formulaic troupes, traditions and templates, translating the antithesis of what we have come to expect superhero films to be. It has set the standard for genre defining films, but to lock it into a genre will only do it a disservice, it's not just the best Wolverine film, or one of the best superhero films, it can confidently stand alone as a cinematic experience worthy of multiple viewings, which I intend to do."
"mynban","9","2","7","2 March 2017"," Different, realistic, character driven approach to X-Men
","While it is a Marvel movie and a X-Men movie; Logan is very different than the other movies of X-Men and Marvel. It is more like a character based drama that happens to center around characters of Logan and Xavier.<br/><br/>If you are planning to go to that movie with the intention of seeing the next Marvel movie with its light heart-ed humor, or next X-Men movie where they don their sleek outfits and mutant-power their way through a world threatening evil; please note that this is not one of those.<br/><br/>Movie feels very different in the sense that it takes itself very seriously. No humor that is placed there that is aimed at the invisible audience superhero knows to be there, no action scenes where all the troubles of a beating and conflict is magically wiped away at the next scene. Also no billion dollar cutting edge tech stealth planes and state of the art tech mansions where characters are only concerned about world politics and threats since they somehow all live off some kind of trust fund.<br/><br/>Reality of life is in the center of the movie. The struggle of those characters with decaying health, with money struggle, with grief of the past events in a world that does not have a place for them anymore and their conflicting way of looking at what 'future' means. Those are things what this movie is mostly about, and the interactions between Xavior, Laura and Logan.<br/><br/>If you always liked Xavior and Wolverine; and wanted to see more of them in a more character focused story; then you will love Logan. <br/><br/>But if you are looking for a movie where heroes don their sleek uniform and beat the next bad guy in some flashy action where fight's only purpose is to entertain audience; you might find this movie to be off- putting and depressing."
"coreyjdenford","8","2","7","1 March 2017"," He's a bloody animal
","This review of Logan is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>IF ONE COULD simply describe how old Wolverine the same way X-Men Origins: Wolverine showed it we would be here all day, describing different timelines from when he was born to when he had the adamantium enhancement. So we're just going to say that he is old, like really f*cking old, sure superpowers are one thing, but nobody ever said that he was impenetrable to tiredness, or said that he was invincible. Yes he can heal but now it takes a lot longer to heal his aged skin. <br/><br/>In Logan Hugh Jackman's last time as the clawed mutant, he's tired, set six years after the sentinels killed thousands of mutants in X-Men: Days of Future Past we track Logan as a limo driver retired from the killing, having to look after another old codger, namely Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier who now at 90 years-old is very frail, restricted to a wheelchair he barely remembers who he is, he has constant seizures that are more powerful than ever that can be stopped by medicine. He is spending retirement with his trusted friend, Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who's a mutant tracker he can sense a mutant from miles away, however he's always worried when Xavier has one of his seizures. It's here when Logan meets Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen), a mutant with extraordinary powers but also like Wolverine has a dark past this quickly comes to show, and essentially she uses her dark past to control her power. Logan soon sees that she is more powerful than he anticipated, using her two hand-claws to brutally attack oncoming killers. He has to travel cross-country to a paradise for mutants who the mute Laura, learned from a comic book Logan, is convinced that she made it up but he goes anyway lugging along tiredly through the roads. <br/><br/>Director James Mangold's material showing the brutality of her past is powerful it shows that Wolverine isn't the only one with torture in his life. In addition he lives up to his promise by keeping the CGI to a minimum there's a slight ounce of CG here-and-there but compared to Marvel movies there's barely any. Mangold's technique here is not only in intricate detail of the character studies of Wolverine and Laura, but he's good with blood too the violence doesn't let up; sure there was violence in the previous X installments but nothing like this. There's splats of blood-and-guts everywhere it's sometimes unnerving, he Fs, he decapitates, he impales, and slashes - seemingly never-ending brutality here, Wolvie has been this bad-ass before in the other installments showing bloodless killings, but here we see the Wolverine we've been waiting for.<br/><br/>However the film isn't perfect, there is a flaw in the second act the film slows it's momentum in a moment when Wolverine learns more about Laura, her abilities, her family, and her life learning what kind of person she is. Explaining a little slowly but all essential material to the third act as it picks up its pace again. It's here when the material gets a lot stronger, Logan now a lot more tired has to pull through one last fight against Holbrook's soft-speaking, yet brutal killing machine, it's here when Mangold inputs sentimentality as Wolvie is beginning to get weaker when his medicine wears off, he shows strength though but it's not enough going into the final few moments. Laura/X-23 fights alongside him with a team of child mutants, she shows strength too she has seen a lot in her young life and killing is the only thing she knows. <br/><br/>There is a moment in the finale when you may let out a few tears when Logan, is on the edge he puts in the effort to stay up but it doesn't work. Mangold keeps this on a high, keeping up with the material from the previous two hours. Sure Logan isn't perfect but it is the best Wolverine has ever whet mistakes Mangold made with 2013s The Wolverine he cleared them up here. After nearly seventeen years and 9 X-Men movies (not including Deadpool) either playing as the main character or a cameo Jackman's Wolverine has been through a sh*tload of stories in the X-Men universe and this is no exception to his brutality. It's fair to say Jackman's final time as the Wolverine ends on an emotional high.<br/><br/>VERDICT: A bloody brilliant Wolverine movie, it's brutal, action-packed and endlessly exciting, this is the best Wolverine has been in years."

"praveenraghav1989","10","2","8","5 July 2017"," Terrific and Fitting Finale for Wolverine !!!
","If one would take X-Men be it the cartoon or the movies, Wolverine always had and will have a special place and mention in many of the story lines. This character is like the face of the X-Men Franchise as the Adamantium Clawed Mutant with a Dark Past and Aggressive Nature of handling things when they go out of hand. This may be one reason why this character had always been given importance in the X- Men Franchise which also lead to making a solo movie X-Men Origins : Wolverine (2009) which may not have linked with the X-Men storyline, but was a movie which many of the wolverine fans enjoyed to see their heroic mutant kick ass out of his enemies with some stellar action sequences.<br/><br/>Coming to Logan (2017) directed by James Mangold, this is not the usual X-Men movie which would have multiple mutants clashing and bashing out each other with their superpowers, here instead we are given a different treatment for some of the successfully established characters from the X-Men Franchise ; Professor X played by Patrick Stewart and Logan\Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman. Unlike the other X-Men movies, there are no surprise cameos and CGI fueled catastrophic action scenes, but what we endear to witness is brutal action, blood splattering deaths and emotional bonding between the main characters.<br/><br/>The story is set in the future (2029) , where most of the mutants have been killed and their race is nearing extinction, surprisingly we get to know that one of the X-Men is responsible for the same which is not be revealed here.Also we see Logan aka James Howlett aged, he isn't the hyperactive person as how he was. He is slowly dying inside himself, side by side he is taking care of Charles, his healing powers are going down and the character is doing a Limo Driver Job just to keep earning for themselves and also have each day pushing. Things get topsy turvy when a lady named Gabriella approaches Logan to take custody of a child named Laura (Dafne Keen) , who she proclaims to be a mutant and like him (Wolverine) , for which Logan refuses initially and due to change of events the child accompanies Logan to his place. Also we have some people working for Transigen who are hunting for the Laura and are ready at apply any means to capture that girl. A minor interlink is there between the post credits of X-Men : Apocalypse which connects to main plot of this movie.<br/><br/>From here the movie enters into zone of Action, Drama and Emotion with Wolverine getting into his best act when the Claws come out of those knuckles which start the slithering process and also he gets a surprise sidekick for the slicing and chopping act. The most different factor about Logan is how the emotional bonding is depicted between the main characters (Logan , Charles, Laura) which was not much shown light in the previous Wolverine movies.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart is in his best form as Professor X\Charles Xavier where he wins in portraying all emotions in the right manner throughout the movie and his comical interactions and dialogues exchanges with Logan and Dafne are captured very well. This is very different showcase of Charles done by Patrick when compared to the previous X-Men movies. There is wonderful scene in the movie where the character exclaims after waking up from a sleep and admits that this has been the best sleep which he had in years so far. This shows us the audience that what both Charles and Logan are in search of, Peace.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman who has given blood and bone for this role, makes this outing more effective with his poignant and aggressive performance. For the man who thought immortality was his curse finally gets rid of the same in a touching and emotional finale. His best aggressive performance comes out when the Claws pop out and Wolverine unleashes his raging action on the baddies. My honest opinion would be that this role cannot be done more effectively other than him since, this character is one of the primary ones in the X-Men universe and carrying the same for more than 15 years is not an easy task since portraying the character on screen efficiently and perfectly is what makes the audiences connect with the character and also makes us embrace or dwell for the same, on this factor Hugh Jackman scores and hits bulls eye. Watch out for a surprise from Hugh itself in the movie which is sure to leave the audiences stunned and awed.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen is excellent as Laura, a kid whose life is at stake while she holds a major responsibility with her for saving lives of others. Be it the Action Sequences or the Interactions with Logan and Charles, she charms us all in both. Her conversations and dialogue exchanges with Logan add up to the minor comic moments in the movie.<br/><br/>The Climax ends up with high and heavy note where Logan realizes that his time has come and also ends up saying that ""so that's what i feels like"", since the character's journey has been all been filled with rage, sorrow, suffering, loss and much more. James Mangold deserves a much bigger credit for delivering an Action & Emotional farewell for the Adamantium Clawed Logan , but the world would always prefer , embrace and celebrate him as ""WOLVERINE"". One of the best X-Men characters that would always remain Immortal through ages.<br/><br/>For me this one was perfect though it had some minor shortcomings , but Logan (2017) will always be a great addition to the X-Men Franchise and also a fitting finale for Wolverine."

","A perfect farewell to the only mutant who had solo films in 'X-Men' franchise. I never understood 'X-Men', I thought it was the worst superhero film series I've ever seen. But 'Wolverine' was the only reason I watched them all and particular, Hugh Jackman. There won't be Logan now onwards, though a set of new generation welcomed in this film, while saying goodbye to the old guys. So now what happens in the future of this franchise is a very suspense. Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.<br/><br/>After many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.<br/><br/>It's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Logan is the film based of Wolverine a member of the X men, a mutant league that helps save the world from other evil mutants. Thanks to Professor Xavier they are educated and learn to control their powers or mutations for the good of human kind. In this battle between humans and mutants, Wolverine is the rebel that becomes one of the main characters of the comic book. Wolverine has become a hit, that the film industry has made a series of movies to explain his life through the years. His mutation and character becomes the center piece of the main issue: why him? And how can I get rid of it? This are the main questions we ask ourselves at a point in our lives. Logan's thirst to know himself has taken him to live far more than any other mutant, his ability to regenerate and his adamantium implants has become his fortune and curse. <br/><br/>This film takes place in the near future where there are no more mutants, humans have destroyed them. There are a few left and Logan is keeping alive Professor Xavier. This fight against humankind has come to an end where mutants are gone and there is no one else to protect earth. As the epic battle comes to an end, Logan finds out that mankind is making mutants by taking their genes to build weapons for the government. When a younger mutant comes to the scene, Logan finds out that this girl is his ""daughter"" and was raised in a Mexican hospital to be a weapon instead of a kid. <br/><br/>The main problem is when science interferes with mankind and expect it to behave as a robot with a series of configurations to act according. But human beings have a conscience that tells them who they are and percive a sense of what is good and bad. We can teach them to fight and act in a way but we will never stop thinking about our actions and who we are. Our place in the world is one of the main questions about our identity, and the present actions we do become a part of who we are. We can't be another person and change who we are, we can only be better or worse. https://pensarparaserfeliz.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/logan- and- consciousness/"

","I've been a fan of Wolverine since he appeared in the early 80's in the X-Men comics, he's always been my favorite anti-hero, a super-hero who wasn't afraid to kill when the need arose.<br/><br/>And I've HATED every live-action movie he's been in since Bryan Singer's X-Men in 2000 (First Class was OK). I like Hugh Jackman - I truly do, and he did the best he could, but Hollywood took what made Wolverine great and ruined it. His fights in the X-Men movies were always lame - he mostly got his ass kicked by women every time.<br/><br/>Then Hollywood managed to screw up Wolverine: Origins by pitting him against the lamest version of Deadpool I've ever seen. Then they put him up against a robotic Silver Samurai in ""The Wolverine."" LAME. LAME. LAME!! Again - none of this was Hugh Jackman's fault - just crappy writing and Hollywood bull$#it.<br/><br/>Now there is ""Logan."" This is the movie true Wolverine fans have been waiting for. It's the closest thing to the comic book to date. A dark, troubled hero struggling with his inner demons, and doing the right, noble, heroic thing.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, all I can say is: watch this movie! It's FINALLY Wolverine done RIGHT. From a comic-geek fan of Wolverine for over 30 years, I can proudly say that this is one of the best comic book movie adaptations out there. It's on a par with Batman: the Dark Knight, Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool."
"markswanepoel","7","2","8","7 May 2017"," Blood. Beer. Beard. Awesome?
","Blood. Beer. Beard. Awesome?<br/><br/>After last year's R-rated Deadpool film it was inevitable that the studio would do the same for Wolverine. The R-rated blood and gore action sequences are a big part of this film, and although they visually look good, in some instances I had to call overkill. Almost the entirety of the supporting cast was killed off and most of the time, it was unnecessary violence that was never really substantiated (i.e. the scene where the Munson family are killed off by X-24 – Why? Was the murder vital in the plot?).<br/><br/>On the positive side, Logan feels real and that ultimately makes the ending the more meaningful. It also has an element of fatherhood that binds the relationship between the characters. There are a few emotional moments, that truly make the film heartfelt and quite sad. <br/><br/>Logan stands out in the X-Men franchise. The other X-Men films all followed a distinct formula and they never really made any big adaptions to it. If you still need further reasoning as to why you should watch this film, then just listen to the soundtrack, Kaleo's ""Way Down We Go"" and both Johnny Cash's ""Man Comes Around"" and ""Hurt"" are all great songs that themselves are reason enough. To end all things off, Logan is unique, quite entertaining and worth the $8 ticket price. In my opinion, it's a Jeremy Jahns - ""worth buying on Blu-Ray""."

We get to meet the characters o Charles, Caliban. Patrick Stewart knocks out of of the park as professor x in this movie.

That little girl as x-23 is a very good actor. Every single actor including the human characters are acted well. <br/><br/>This movie does a damn good job to establish the story of x-23 and his relationship to Logan and Charles. The base of this movie is Logan finding himself and the cause for him to stay alive or sacrifice himself for decent reasons. Every single dialogues are well done. The conflict that Logan goes through with himself that what should he do in this whole movie is impressively done. <br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic hardcore with bloods everywhere. X- 23's action sequences are insanely awesome. When Logan goes full throttle in the end you feel it with him, its that's well done. <br/><br/>Only thing i will complain about in this awesome movie is when Logan yells or shouts at the very end, to indicate to us or to everyone that he is coming to save those children's i thought that was cheesy shouting or yelling or whatever it is.<br/><br/>Other than this movie is such a masterpiece of the genre..... 9.1/10...."

First let me point out the good things of the movie. The acting is spot on. Xavier en Logan are true tortured souls and you really feel for them. The action and violence has been done well, but between those scenes is too much drama. Then there is the f*cked up timeline. Some things from the old timeline have happened, but no explanation as to how. Then it take place in 2029 which is only 6!!! years after the end of Days of futures past, where everything is just fine. There are young mutants there which shouldn't have been according to this movie. Then there is the question of all the mutants around the world. Where have they gone? What happened to them? The bad guy is an evil corporation and they have simple henchmen and when the X24 comes into play i just wanted to leave. Maybe it's a metaphor for our battles against ourselves, but it seems like a cop out.<br/><br/>All in all, there is too much drama, too much unanswered questions and too little action.<br/><br/>p.s. The girl who plays Laura also did a terrific job"
"andyjcox","5","2","8","7 March 2017"," Depressing dark and generally miserable movie
","Let me start by saying I am a huge Wolverine and Marvel universe fan.<br/><br/>After all the hype I was excited to watch this film but personally I just didn't like it, which disappointed me. I go to the cinema to be entertained not to be depressed. I found the whole film portrayed a miserable old Wolverine in a dark place, surely when you are over 200 years old you would have figured out how to enjoy life instead of wasting it moping around.<br/><br/>It was violent and I have no issue with that and some of the scenes were superb, The acting was also very good from all involved, but I found the film took itself far to seriously and was too preachy.<br/><br/>If I go to the cinema to see a super-hero or anti-hero movie I don't need it to be believable and realistic and I do not need the point of the movie rammed down my throat, its supposed to be far fetched and unbelievable to stretch your imagination and let you work out your own point of the movie.<br/><br/>I just feel this film is a demonstration of a character misunderstood by the contract owner and how they would feel if they were in Wolverines shoes.<br/><br/>To sum up.. Too preachy, too miserable & too dumbed-down to be a properly enjoyable anti-hero movie."
"jctundis","5","2","8","6 March 2017"," Low expectations met... barely.
","I honestly don't understand the hype on this film. Saw it last night, and while there are some great action scenes with a brilliant amount of gore (finally), the film is poorly paced, largely boring, and full of the kind of lame, trite action movie tropes you'd expect from James Mangold in the second half oh his career.<br/><br/>There is almost no correlation to Old Man Logan, instead becoming a hodgepodge of three other stories that I won't mention the titles of due to possible spoilers.<br/><br/>As the title of the review states, I went in with low expectations. The movie barely delivered on them. In fact, the more I think of all the lame story ideas and self referential garbage forced into the script, the less I like the film."
"seige-hound","10","2","8","1 March 2017"," A Beautiful End to Wolverine's Saga
","Bryan Singer's X-men hit cinemas back in 2000, when the superhero genre was still recovering from a certain case of ""Batman and Robin"". It was hard to take comics seriously, but Singer brought the X-men, a team of superheroes that faced problems not many other heroes face (that being discrimination) to the big screen in a grand sort of way. An allegory for the struggle many minorities, especially the LGBT+ people, face in the real world, audiences empathised both with Charles Xavier's pursuit of protection of the Mutants, and the education of the masses that these Mutants aren't as bad and scary as they may seem at first, and Magneto's pursuit of vengeance against the people who abused him almost his entire life.<br/><br/>And in the centre of this broader narrative is Wolverine, a man that, while youthful in appearance, is hundreds of years older than any of the other main characters in the story, but cannot remember his past beyond a name. An unstoppable killing machine fuelled by rage, pain and distrust, he is brought into the fold as a broken man, with the promise that Xavier would help him rediscover who he really is.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is arguably one of the best cast and most famous characters brought from comic book to screen. Even in the films that were brought down by mediocrity in other areas, Jackman played Wolverine with power and precision. But no matter how good he was in his past movies, nothing matches up to his performance in Logan.<br/><br/>Logan is the last Wolverine film. Hugh Jackman said so himself that it would be his final portrayal as the Wolverine, and while it's entirely possible in the cynical Hollywood market that produced three different portrayals of Spider-Man within 10 years, I highly doubt Jackman would go back on his claim.<br/><br/>The plot of Logan seems to be separate from the broader X-men franchise, sort of like how Deadpool wasn't really a part of the established continuity. Unlike Deadpool, which was a goofy, vulgar and crass film (still good though), Logan is gritty, sincere and tragic. Both films have the same amount of violence and gore, but while you laugh as Deadpool cuts a man in half, you don't laugh here. You feel every single cut and bullet in this film. Both physical and emotional.<br/><br/>The heart of the film is the relationship between Logan, Xavier, and a new character named Laura, who is revealed to be Logan's biological daughter, and exhibiting similar powers. Laura, having just escaped from a government facility, is being chased by Pierce, a mercenary with a robot hand. What follows is an action packed road trip across the continental United States from New Mexico to North Dakota. I won't spoil the details, for this movie is worth watching all the way.<br/><br/>Logan is what I was hoping for in every way when I heard of an R- Rated Wolverine film. It is not simply an excuse to add some CGI blood and limbs coming off Wolverine's victims (although there is plenty of that if that's all you're looking for) but it also works as a fantastic culmination of Wolverine's character arc throughout all of his portrayals. Logan is a beautiful film in all the best ways. Emotional, visceral, and entirely separate from any extended universe of films. There is nothing hinging on this film, canonically speaking. You should enter this film not expecting something that will play into later films, but as an entirely separate film that allowed everyone involved to explore a story and characters in an isolation chamber of sorts. It is one of the best superhero movies of all time, and definitely the most mature and grounded one since The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jheathburton","9","2","8","1 March 2017"," Not to be missed
","This film is how wolverine should have always been depicted on the big screen. It is violent and full of explicit language, and more true to the comics. I'd say the story is slightly based on the old man Logan series, give it a read if you haven't. But with professor x and x23 you see wolverine (Logan) in a different light you see his caring side along with the rage we expect. This Logan is very different, he's a raging alcoholic and only cares for Charles. It seems after disliking him in old age they have an understanding and truly care for each other. This film is not to be missed!"
"azmothchoudhury","9","2","8","1 March 2017"," Marvel's Closest Movie to the Dark knight.
","Before Logan was released, there was not a single movie in my opinion from both Marvel and Dc, that could match the Dark Knight in quality. Sure there were commendable films that were close such as The Winter Soldier but they were still a far cry from the level that was presented by TDK. In my opinion, FOX have finally done it and have produced the closest movie in terms of genre-breaking and story-telling. They have surpassed the loopholes and issues surrounding their previous movies and so have transcended to a different domain of story-telling and entertainment. Logan attempts to break genres just like TDK did, by not following the rules of traditional superhero movies. Instead of big budgets, explosions and intergalactic journeys, we get a character-driven drama which attempts to show how the wolverine film was meant to be made, both in action and plot. We see that Logan is both vulnerable and broken; hes not the same as he was once before.<br/><br/>Despite all the good scenes we have of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, the person who stole the spotlight, was none other than X- 23 actress, Dafne Keen. Her action scenes will blow you away, you have not seen a young girl as brutal and bad-ass as her! It is quite a slow and long piece, but in my opinion it worked as a final film for Hugh Jackman and it makes perfect sense. Though not perfect and still not as good as TDK, because while the acting of Boyd Holbrook as the villain was great he just wasn't a memorable threat towards the end. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie because like i said, it truly is something else and very unique for a superhero film. If you were waiting for a movie to be at least an inch away from the greatness of TDK, then this is it!"
"joshbarton15","10","2","8","1 March 2017"," Brutal and personal.
","Seventeen years and eight films after he first donned the iconic mutton chops and sharpened those adamantium claws, Hugh Jackman is back one last time in his most iconic role of Wolverine in Logan. With the ominous tagline 'His time has come' looming over the film, my hopes were that they'd be able to do both the character and Jackman justice after the two solo outings we've had so far have left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The year is 2029 and there hasn't been a mutant born for twenty-five years. Attempting to hide from his life and legacy, Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives on the Mexican border providing care for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart).<br/><br/>With his powers dwindling, Logan is approached to help with Laura (Dafne Keen), a young mutant being pursued by dark forces. bringing everything he tried to put in the past right back to the fore.<br/><br/>First thing that struck me about Logan was just how different a take on the character this was going to be. Sure, he's always had anger issues but we have never seen him in this state before, constant pain and deteriorating powers making him a shadow of his former self. Right from the off we are thrown into a scenario that perfectly sets the tone for the film about to unfold, it's subtly comical yet brutally violent, making me so glad we finally have an R rated Wolverine film.<br/><br/>The violence isn't unnecessary either, supporting a more realistic portrayal of Logan taking down his enemies. It also helps the action sequences flow better, rather than having to cut away every time someone gets stabbed in the head the camera can linger a little longer on the mess Logan and X-23 leave in their wake, one long take in particular towards the end gloriously showing Wolverine at his devastating best. It's at this moment that I have to thank the success of Deadpool, which led to the studio giving James Mangold the chance to do an untamed version of this character, Mangold in full control of the reins mirroring Logan fulfilling his brutal potential.<br/><br/>The difference in quality between The Wolverine, which Mangold also directed, and Logan is quite staggering really and you can certainly tell Mangold was in full control of the story this time round. The former descended into a typically over-the-top CGI-fest of a finale whereas Logan takes its time to build a study of this beaten down hero before climaxing with a heartfelt and personal finale that makes it much more of an involving film for the audience. The theme of parenthood has been explored a little with this character before, his relationship with Rogue in the first two X-Men films however, none of them have been quite like this, Mangold's homage to the old school Westerns playing out fascinatingly well as Logan plays out. The real dirt and grit of a Western etched with Logan's past is felt through John Mathieson's quite wonderful cinematography while the adventure of it all is encapsulated in Marco Beltrami's score.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Logan features the best turn from Hugh Jackman in the role to date, and you can tell with his performance and promotion of the film that this is something he's always wanted to do with the character. Jackman's dedication to the role is admirable and I don't think he's ever done a bad job in any of the films, it's just that when a performance like this comes along in a film of this quality, it's hard not to put it above the rest. Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X, himself not in the best of places, and it's a very good and touching performance from a man who's also done a lot in making the X-Men films what they are. I found I had to get used to the pair of them swearing so much but when I did, the two are really quite funny, particularly together.<br/><br/>The breakout performance from Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 is one of the most impressive ones we will see all year, offering an innocent yet vicious portrayal of such a powerful little girl. She speaks very few words, using her facial expressions more to convey her emotions and she rather impressively gives Jackman a run for his money when it comes to the action sequences. The rest of the supporting cast, most notably Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce and Stephen Merchant as Caliban, make the most of their screen time, even if Holbrook does fall foul to the comic-book movie villain curse. This is Jackman's film though so focusing more on his last outing was always going to happen.<br/><br/>Logan certainly does justice to both the character and Hugh Jackman himself with a film that steps away from the superhero norm and offers a personal and emotionally fuelled outing that certainly brings the violence and delivers one of the best comic-book films I've seen."

The characters are depressing, but somehow you can't even empathize with them - it is nearly impossible to be emotionally connected to any of the protagonists. I am in total awe how this movie got so many nice reviews, honestly I would've been falling asleep if not the massive amount of violence (unneccesary, btw) that kept me awake. Ain't nothing remarkable about it.

"MikeF-6","Null","2","9","4 September 2017"," Bad Movie In Almost Every Regard
","Four pluses: 1) I always enjoy Patrick Stewart in just about anything; 2) Ditto Richard E. Grant; 3) The young actress who plays the new mutant (Dafne Keen) does very well in a role in which she is entirely (until almost the end) mute; 4) Johnny Cash's ""When The Man Comes Around"" plays over the end credits. Other than that, this is a Bad Movie in almost every regard. There is nothing in it that we haven't seen a hundred times before. In the title role, Hugh Jackman channels Humphrey Bogart as the cynical loner who doesn't want to get involved, who ""sticks his neck out for nobody,"" until he goes all-in for the good side (Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, Key Largo, The Harder They Fall). The action/fights are very repetitious: heads roll, arms roll, blades penetrate bodies. Worst of all: it is a Road Trip movie where mis-matched characters have to bond during a long automobile journey.<br/><br/>A few years ago, I decided I needed to see more multiplex fare so squirmed my way through ""Captain America"" and ""Thor"" before I said ""No more comic book super heroes."" But I watched ""Logan"" because a production team spent six weeks in the New Mexico desert about 4 miles from my house filming the scenes that feature the old factory with the downed water tower that appear in the film's first half hour. On a morning run, I even saw the battered limousine (if you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about) being transported on a flat bed truck on its way to the filming location. When the set was first constructed, it was covered in the paper and TV news flew over in a helicopter, but that ended coverage so, apparently, there were no Hugh Jackman or Patrick Stewart sightings in Albuquerque. So it is possible – nay, even probable - that everything they did for that month and a half was all for green screen projection and no movie stars ever saw the place in person."

","Logan is directed by James Mangold, the same director behind ""The Wolverine 2013"" and ""Walk the Line,"" so that means you know it will be both good and bad. Except, it wasn't it was an amazing film, and i was pretty surprised considering The Wolverine felt good at the begging and a bit bizarre from the rest, but this one i different. The movie is rated R with some hardcore gore and action that really made Logan the monster he is, and this movie is R rated so be prepared.<br/><br/>Logan A.K.A Wolverine is once again played by Hugh Jackman and just like Hugh, Logan is reaching old age where he is forced to handle it's usual effects on him, Especially as a Superhero. So the plot contains Logan being forced to escort a girl across the country lands where they are also being followed by the enemies both after him and the girl. So we are introduced the story with both drama and surprisingly well made action that isn't too shaky and spastic like other films trying to be cool.<br/><br/>The film has some amazing acting from both Dafne Kenn and from Jackman with scenes that make you feel more into what the characters are with emotion and comedy they bring that i truly enjoyed. With the ending involving a both great and heartwarming ending that made me enjoy this film. The one thing i will complain about is the toning in the scenes that occur in some acts that felt questionable where in one scene thy fight a whole group of villains and in the next it is over and everything is calm and it felt a bit weird. The movie felt like both a action western adventure with some great action that is filled with gore and moments where i say ""That Guy is Dead."" I loved this movie and it was honestly one of the best films to watch in 2017 and it felt like a great experience in the theater. So i recommended Logan for the Action, Drama, Humor, and over the top violence that made it seem more bad-ass. A+"
"alindsay-al","9","2","9","1 March 2017"," A fantastic dark real take on wolverine
","For years we have seen Hugh Jackman play the character of Wolverine, and I have now seen possibly his final performance as the character in Logan and I loved it. The premise sees an older more damaged Logan taking care of an ill Charles Xavier, when they encounter a new young mutant who they must protect from dark forces. Hugh Jackman reprises his iconic role as Logan and I think this may be his best ever, he is clearly a more aged, impatient version of the character and you totally buy his more pessimistic viewpoint on life at the beginning of the film. I love his character growth throughout the film and you buy the emotion he conveys from this truly emotional gut wrenching performance that is award worthy. Patrick Stewart plays Xavier again in this film and he is brilliant in this much different damaged performance. We are used to seeing Stewart as the confident wise teacher but in this film he is ill, damaged and broken and it is such an interesting take on the character that Stewart nails out of the park. Dafne keen plays Laura the young girl in this film and she is great in this film especially considering it is her first ever role. Her, Jackman and Stewarts chemistry is fantastic in this film and I really did buy their little dysfunctional family that slowly grows. Plus she is absolutely great in the action scenes along with Jackman. Boyd Holbrook plays the villain in this film and he was pretty good in this film, he was menacing when he wanted to be and cocky when he wanted to be. I also thought Stephen merchant did a pretty good job as Caliban even though he isn't in this film that much. The story of this film is a very simple escort mission to get laura to safety and it really works, the emotion between the characters carries this story and really makes you care about them and the situation that they are put into. The script has some great dramatic dialogue that does sell the dire straights that these characters are in as they try to survive in the world. There is very little humour in the film but what is there did make me chuckle a bit and in a real way. The style of the film is very dark and despondent which really works for the situation that the characters are in and the awesome gritty bloody violence that has been needed in a wolverine film forever. However, my one negative for this film is that it is a little too long and I feel like there are some real pacing issues that make this film feel even longer then it actually is. Overall though I loved this film and I urge anybody who is a fan of wolverine or just good movies that you have to see this film."

","I have seen every single Superhero Movie from old school to new school. I watch them all, the day it releases and I can honestly say I didn't really like the previous Wolverine films. I have issues with some parts of the other Xmen Films. However, this standalone film is just amazing.... the story-line is epic everything about it was excellent. Great performances by HJ & PS. I recommend this film and I'd also like to see the rating stay high for an age. So vote/rate!! the movie after viewing for yourself.<br/><br/>10/10 for me"
"daniewhite-1","5","1","3","29 March 2020"," Morbid
","A definitive send off for Wolverine, and a well made piece of work, with good acting and a very heavy going quota of emotional baggage. Almost enough baggage to sink a ship that has a pretty slight and simple story, few important characters and a heavy handed approach to the characters emotional conditions.<br/><br/>Also the film has a decidedly underwhelming villain and a less than imposing goon plus a gimmicky mirror baddie Wolverine.<br/><br/>Direction and choreography are adequate for the task at hand and there is a well designed audio effects. The musical score follows the emotional morbidity of the films tone and never fails to reinforce the many opportunities for heart string plucking.<br/><br/>The main gain for 'Logan' is from it's actors who mainly give excellent performances, particularly Patrick Stewart and young Dafne Keen; Hugh Jackman meanwhile has no problem portraying his character in absolute any condition required.<br/><br/>'Logan's reverence for old westerns, and particular references to 'Shane' have the unfortunate effect of giving characters most of their most poignant and illuminated dialogues, which humanise them the most, as quotes from that other film. This degree of transference is a trying side effect of being so heavily indebted to another film whilst your own has issues of minimally written story, situations and characters.<br/><br/>I rate an even-stevens 5/10 for a strong valedictory send off for the Wolverine character and some very good acting performances. In the technical credits the film is sufficiently proficient to get through various fracas. An overloading of the films protagonists with grief and calamity beyond that which some actors have the time to humanise adequately with their portrayals and a sadly unsubstantial breed of villainy means that I can't rate higher."

","Here's my super late review of Logan .So Logan was directed by the guy who directed the not so good wolverine movie where he fights asian dudes. And this time he sure made a comeback with Logan. So needless to say , Hugh Jackman was great as wolverine and the little girl who played x23 was great too , the bad guy was good but would've sucked if it weren't for the R rating. Patrick Stewart was 'okay' as for most of the movie , he's just an old dude in a wheelchair annoying Logan. There are many references to the previous x men movies but without giving reason on what happened to the rest of the x men .The story is not your typical superhero movie , its a road trip drama with lots of gorey action and that's the best part , because you see wolverine for the animal he is. So ,in the end , Logan is not just a good superhero movie but a great movie with loads of action , good one liners , great characters and one big farewell for Hugh Jackman."
"KeremUlucay","8","1","3","12 July 2019"," AN EPIC FINAL FOR LEGENDARY CHARACTER
","Logan is an amazing journey and final film, I think it is a great final for both Wolverine and X-Men franchises. Unlike any other superhero movie, it has an attractive way at storytelling and cinematography. And it is one of the most realistic films in this genre. Its atmosphere and tone are just great for character. James Mangold has improved himself since The Wolverine(2013). He really understands the character and tells us how tired Logan is, how he cares about Charles and his indifference for other people. You can feel what Logan and Xavier have been through during years, movie successfully describes those and mutants situations in this universe, that's why storytelling is so well. Also it is enjoyable to see them in this situation, I mean when they at the end of the line. It has an epic and emotional final. Actually, I think it would be more effective on me if I wouldn't wait so long to watch it and learn he dies in that movie. Even though, I surprised so much when X-23 and X-24 showed up. On the other hand, movie have lovely details like X-Men's comics and action figures. Seeing Logan's reaction to those and seeing how people love Wolverine is nice. Finally, I want to thank Hugh Jackman for showing us his best on that iconic character for 17 years. He will never be forgotten as Wolverine."

"SugarandIce","10","1","3","21 May 2019"," The Last Dance
","Why is it that so many of the best superhero films are the ones where the superhero elements feel secondary? Where the characters feel human first and super second? Where the story is down to earth and barely a comic-book film at all? Winter Soldier, Dark Knight, and now Logan... In truth, Logan may be better than both of those. It may be the best superhero film ever made. Then again, it's hard to say. Is it it even fair to call it a superhero film? It's more like a gritty western. This film is the perfect conclusion to the X-men films, and to Wolverine's tale. If X-men 3 ruined X-Men in the worst way, than Logan killed off the franchise (for me) in the best way possible. It broke my heart again and again. The characters I loved are at their absolute lowest and worst. The action has never been more spectacular and violent. Wolverine is at his absolute finest in brutality and in Hugh Jackman's performance. The inclusion of a new young girl mutant also brings in a great new character. This film left me in tears with all that occurred from beginning to end. It's so hard to sit through this film but I can't dislike it. Of all the X-men films, this one truly has the most heart."

Logan is a super complex character that I had the pleasure of growing up with. Hugh Jackman ends his Wolverine career on such a high note! The action is superb with addition of the R rated violence. Normally I would be against any PG-13 super hero movie that wasn't already an R taking such a rating. Logan proved me wrong. Wolverine is a character that had no problem taking it to the next level. It blew my mind. We are now in the golden age of superhero movies. It's movies like this that prove that with fresh ideas and great characters that this genre of film isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Acting standouts are Hugh Jackman (of course), Patrick Stewart (also in his final X-men appearance), and Dafne Keen. It's a shame that this wasn't nominated for more awards. It would have won Best Picture, Best Actor, & Best Supporting Actor in my opinion. I hope more superhero movies take note and take more risks like this one. I highly recommend."

","Hugh Jackman's farewell performance could've only gone out on a high note, and the short answer is YES. James Mangold finally gets to shine as the writer/director of this Oscar nominated film. Taking inspiration from the Old-Man Logan storyline, but crafting an original story. The script is beautiful and the rating serves the story well, it's not in favor of violence like Deadpool, but instead services the story and the characters that inhabit it. Jackman delivers what is probably his best performance as the character, he finally gets to go all in and in turn delivers something emotional, action-packed, and poignant, but you can't give him all of the credit. Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen make this film just as much as our lead. Stewart delivers a heartbreaking and beautifully underrated performance as the ailing Prof. X that will make you cry, laugh, and feel all kinds of emotion, and Keen is no exception. Another underrated performance Keen gives a feisty and emotion rich character, that more than holds her own with the veteran actors she is placed against. There is absolutely nothing wrong I can say about this film. Head my advice, give it a watch and I guarantee you'll love it even if you aren't a fan of the previous films (but it definitely helps)"
"rhyshurst","8","1","3","28 June 2018"," Great superhero film and great western
","Logan is a fantastic super hero movie and absolutely one of my favourites in the genre , as well as a great western.
It has a bleak and depressing atmosphere that sets it apart, and makes it a refreshing change of pace from the average marvel/x-men fare.Logan's world feels truly realised, and a terrifying possibility in the x-men franchise.The cinematography allows you to breathe in both the arid desert landscape and the brutal carnage of the fights (which are choreographed and executed excellently).
Every actor in the film turns in a fantastic performance.Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart give emotional final performances that very nearly brought a tear to my eye,whilst Stephen Merchant and Boyd Holbrook do surprisingly well in a film such as this. Dafne Keene is a brilliant physical actor and does well for the first 2/3 of the film, but I found her line delivery to be slightly monotone in the last act.It could have been the point, but I personally would have much preferred her to have stayed silent.I believe she could have pulled such a performance off, and am dissapointed that the film didn't go the extra mile, and felt the need to have her speak
If I have one complaint, it's the lack of connection to the other x-men films.It's certainly not a universal complaint, and it hardly ruins the film, but I think a stronger connection could have given the desolate and dying world of the x-men an even bigger impact.The proposed 'Sabretooth as an ally' scene or even a shot of the x-mens deaths/corpses would have had a huge impact, and an even bigger emotional gut-punch.
Overall, this film is an absolutely worthy watch and well worth you time.I also highly recommend the 'Logan Noir' version in blacks and white, but either version will do.Just have a box of tissues on hand!"

But it has style and a great road movie vibe to it. Dafne Keen is pretty damn good. She doesn't has to hide behind Jackman and Stewart. There are plenty of fantastic action sequences and also quiet moments in which the characters can shine. Here the movie doesn't even feels like a big blockbuster mutant/superhero action flick. The film actually mentions an event which could be told in a prequel and shows something that could become a sequel to Logan and still it's much more of a stand-alone film than most other comic book films / adaptations of these days."
"anselmdaniel","8","1","3","10 June 2018"," A somber end to Wolverine
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Logan is the final Wolverine movie starring Hugh Jackman as the titular character. The movie is set in a futuristic world where mutants are hunted and becoming extinct. A young girl with the same powers of Wolverine is discovered and Logan finds himself helping his fellow mutants.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie, Logan is already a departure from previous X-Men movies. The movie earns its R-rating by showing lots of gratuitous gore as people are cut into pieces by Wolverine. The scene also shows how drastically different the tone is. Wolverine is not a hero and works a menial job as a limousine driver. Professor X is revealed to have suffered a mental disorder that cuased the deaths of many mutants. Logan is not a hero in these scenes. His goal of earning money to move the professor away is neither heoric or villainous. The plot then moves to its main arc of Laura and follows Logan and Professor X on a road trip as they escape mercenaries searching for Laura. This plot is basic, but the execution is unique. The story is incredibly grungy and filled with twists that the audience may not expect. This is a gory and brutal story of characters being hunted. This movie transcends the typical superhero movies that are so common nowadays with a massive tonal change. This movie is nothing like the Marvel Cinematic Universe's movies with their light and humorous tone. It is for this reason that the movie deserves praise for trying something different for superheroes.<br/><br/>I am hard pressed to find anything wrong about the movie. The directing, editing, and acting are all good in this movie. Patrick Steward does a good job as a mentally damaged Charles Xavier. This movie does not appear to fit into any of the confusing X-Men story-lines, but this is acceptable with how the movie is stand-alone. Previous X-Men movies are not required viewing to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Logan is highly recommended. The movie is a shining example of what a comic book movie can aspire to be.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"CIDMoosa","8","1","3","7 June 2018"," the trodden warewolf !
","The one and only appeal to Marvel Studios after watching this would be to retire the Wolverine charisma since no one could render it with this much exactness as Hugh Jackman. If you are going into ""Logan"" expecting every prospect to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disenchanted. This is categorically not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main emphasis of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. ""Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its stint to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it possibly has the most characterizations in an X-Men film to date.<br/><br/>We've never comprehended Wolverine this susceptible. He's old, he's wrecked down, and he's trodden. He can't heal like he used to. The only alteration between Logan and Nolan's Dark Knight is you can't get the epic touch with Logan.<br/><br/>Set in a grim near-future where very few mutants persist active, we meet an unthinkable incarnation of our favourite enclawed superhero: one who's decidedly past his prime. This is not the near-eternal Wolverine we reminisce, but Logan , a broken, far older man who feels the heft of every wound inflicted upon him. His once- formidable physique - tattooed with scars that aren't restorative as fast or as well as they used to - seems to be failing. It's only his fortitude to keep the ailing, ageing Professor Charles Xavier safe and buzzing, but fate has other plans for him.<br/><br/>Just when you thought Nolan has given you a trilogy of realistic superhero stuff, James Mangold directs his way into glory with this epic piece of pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>Highly recommended watch !"

This film is perfect. Logan is a raw, painful masterpiece of a film, and it is the swan song Wolverine deserves. This is a character who has always pushed the PG13 envelope with violence and language, and we finally got the R-Rated filmhe deserves.
Hugh Jackman gives an oscar worthy performance here, playing the character with an intensity i have never before seen. Yet he still adds nuance, with a subtle underlying suicidal pain to our canadian hero. His death is not a massive CGI-Blown festival, but it is a sombre and quiet piece of masterful filmmaking. He holds his heart in his hand, the daughter he never knew he had. 
""This is what it feels like.""
Patrick Stewart is given an oscar worthy role as well, and the world's greatest mind having dementia and implied to have killed the X-Men is one of the saddest and most tragic ideas ever put to film.

","*spoilers ahead*
9.8/10 
Directed by James Mangold and starring Hugh Jackman, Logan is easily the best film to come out of the X-Men universe. It is violent, it is emotional, and it has a damn good story.<br/><br/>The movie is about an aged Logan/Wolverine (Jackman) who has to take care of a failing Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart), when a mysterious new mutant (Dafne Keen) shows up and all hell breaks loose. From there, Logan has to avoid an organization named Transigen, led by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant) and Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), while protecting Professor X and getting the new mutant across the country to the Canadian Border.<br/><br/>From the start, the movie shows that it will not hold it's R-rating back, with the first word said in the movie being an F-bomb, followed immediately by a very R-rated action scene, with a guy's arm getting dismembered and several more ending up with claws in their heads. However, the language is always where it feels like it should be, such as whenever the characters have stress or pain, and the violence does not feel overexcessive, with only five major action scenes throughout the entire film. <br/><br/>Through the insane violence though, Logan has a very deep and emotional story, especially with the fans who watched the first X-Men film back in 2000. They get to see these characters get pushed to their limits for the first time, with Logan progressively losing his healing factor throughout the movie and Xavier in very bad health. At the end of it, both characters have very touching sendoffs, closing their 17 year reign as the iconic characters.<br/><br/>The characters were also very interesting and well-played. Hugh Jackman obviously kicks ass playing his most iconic role, sadly for the last time, as a beaten Wolverine with a vulnerability we've never seen before. Patrick Stewart also brings a different side to Charles, where his age is finally catching up to him. The final noteworthy actor is Dafne Keen, who plays Laura in her breakout role, making her one of the most badass characters in the franchise. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was really well done, deserving its R-rating and praise for being one of the best superhero films of all time"
"Prashast_Singh","10","1","3","27 May 2018"," Everything not every superhero film is.
","LOGAN is an intense superhero film. It's an action film with intense drama and violent action sequences, due to which it rightly deserves the R-rating. But honestly, this film is an epic in many ways. It's not merely a superhero film; it's a deeper commentary on life, human weaknesses, relations and a lot more that better needs to be seen than read. I've been constantly watching superhero films since past few weeks and this one turned out to be a very dramatic yet highly entertaining action film.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is the real man to watch out for here. I've honestly not seen much of previous movies, and THE WOLVERINE is the only one I saw (and totally enjoyed) a few days ago. I really liked him and became an instant fan. He has that energy, he oozes rage and I really love his angry expressions. This film allows him to both fight and emote: and he doesn't disappoint. Another round of applause should go to Dafne Keen, who plays her part with utmost sincerity. Patrick Stewart is highly impressive as well. The rest of the cast fits in their respective parts and leaves a strong impact.<br/><br/>The action of the film is a major highlight. Yes, this time, there is a lot of blood and gore to expose the hidden rage of Wolverine, but it never feels unnecessary and totally fits in well with the narrative. There are some good visual effects too, and the locations add to an adventurous feel. The cinematography is top notch. The screenplay is excellently written and the editing does complete justice to the its essence. <br/><br/>The film is also dramatic but far from being totally dark or melodramatic. There are a few light moments too. The thrills in the plot are effective and work well. The film proves that emotional doesn't necessarily mean melodramatic or very dark, something which a lot of other genre movies are, let superhero movies alone. There's not any usage of a very intense music as well, and this gave a different feel. <br/><br/>LOGAN is on the whole a pure gem. It's great that the ones for whom it was sculpted have realized its essence and have given it the love it deserved. The emotionally unforgettable and mindblowing ending made me want to salute the maker James Mangold, due to whose skilled direction and writing the film felt very new, refreshing and original apart from entertaining and memorable. I think I should get myself a Wolverine action figure soon some day."
"kinggolub","10","1","3","1 May 2018"," The Best films about superheroes.
","Logan - one of the best films about superheroes.
The reviewer carefully avoids spoilers.<br/><br/>To begin with, I was never a fan of the X-Men universe. Of all the films of this epic, I only watched the first two parts, so I did not have a spiritual affection for Hugh Jackman and his character. And I treat superhero films quite calmly, without fanfare and overestimated expectations. And despite all this, Logan made an indelible impression on me.<br/><br/>And first of all because Logan is an intelligent and adult movie. Rating R is played out here to its fullest, placing emphasis on the realism of what is happening, moral dilemmas and the complexity of human relationships. Superheroes in fact the same people as all of us, they have the same feelings and emotions and they are just like us mortal. Of course, all these topics were mentioned in superhero films before, but not one of them was dedicated to this, not one of them tried to show how expensive superheroes have to pay for their abilities and how many people's joys they lose.<br/><br/>The gloomy and depressing atmosphere of the film, helps to get close to the characters and imbued with their emotions and emotions. The measured tempo of the narrative does not let you get bored, and the action scenes start so suddenly that they give some reserve of vivacity. Uhh, and what these action scenes are cool, thank you rating R, thanks. The musical accompaniment is also on the level and works perfectly for the atmosphere. Although I heard a lot of claims that the music is not remembered and does not cause a desire to download it in itunes right away. Is this the meaning of music in the movies? The musical accompaniment should not come to the fore, its task is to gently and imperceptibly accompany the events taking place in the film, adding colors to them and whipping up emotions. The picture and camera work also do not cause any complaints. The image is moderately gloomy, the footage is excellent, and the minimal amount of computer graphics helps to even more believe in the realism of what is happening.<br/><br/>And separately I want to consider the plot, the villains and the actors' game. The plot here is not intricate, although unexpected turns are present, and in general it is quite simple to understand. But I can not call it a minus. The main place in this film is given to the characters and their relationships, and the plot only gives the direction of this story. As the villains themselves, whose motivations are not convincing, and the past is unknown. But it seems to me that this was done intentionally, so that the villains did not overtake the spectator's attention to themselves, because the film is not about them, not about the opposition of heroes and villains.<br/><br/>And of course, I can not help praising the cast. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Daphne Keane were great. I would like to talk more about their acting, but I doubt I can do it without spoilers. The important thing is that I believed them. He believed that it was hard for them, believed that they were tired and wanted to find reconciliation with their own souls. And all of the above, allowed the film to heat my emotions to the limit and make me literally sob in the final. At what it is surprising, that at the second viewing of a film of the house, to contain emotions was even more difficult, for I already knew the plot of the film.<br/><br/>It's time to sum up. Logan is a terrific film that I really consider to be one of the best superhero films of all time. And I can safely recommend it to anyone who does not think that superhero films should necessarily be performed in the genre of entertainment movies. My score is 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>P.S. It is unfortunate that the score at the film screening at 7.5 points does not correspond to the level of the film. Unfortunately, despite the trailers of the film, which very clearly showed us the nature of the film, and the name of the movie Logan, not Wolverine, not the X-Men, namely Logan, people could not figure out what movie they were on. Many expected to see a typical movie about superheroes, with an abundance of action, humor, bright and colorful picture, and received a chamber drama, in which the action fell into the background. And it surprises me how the discrepancy with false expectations can spoil people's impression of the film. On this I have everything. Thank you for reading this review and watch a good movie"
"diaju_vampprincess","6","1","3","25 April 2018"," Cheesy lame storyline
","*****WARNING: THE CAPTION CONTAINS SPOILER!!!***** <br/><br/>Well, where do i begin? 
Both Logan and Charles irritates me. They keep trying to hide the element of surprise about Laura. So everytime Logan asks who Laura is, Charles just keep telling the same line ""don't leave Laura"" ""don't leave Laura"" ""don't leave Laura"". Wtf. Why doesn't he just explain him about Laura? he could have just yelled she is his daughter, i believe Logan will surely save her unconditionally.
BUT, instead of telling what Logan needs to know, Charles like have no other line (even Groot has a better line than Charles). And it makes me couldn't enjoy the movie. I can only see the flaw. <br/><br/>First, the story is said they are in 2029, but i just realize the smartphone in 2029 is just EXACTLY the same like we use in 2016. Lol. Why don't they just use Nokia 5110 instead? I mean, with all the tech the X-Men got, and even the tech they use to clone the mutant, yet, they can't invent the technology for more advance smartphone? Gimme a break.<br/><br/>And second. Well.. you know you're gonna die tomorrow, so you're making a video, recording yourself telling story about ""a very special girl named Laura"". And since you are a very considerate person, after you record yourself, you edit the video with some footage in the hospital which showing the experiment in making mutant children. You maybe ""just a nurse"", but you have an expert-video-editor talent.
I keep trying to find the ""made with viva video"" watermark in it, it's just too bad i couldn't find it.<br/><br/>The stupid part is, the storyline is obviously [PREDICTABLE, yet they think Laura's identity won't be revealed until Charles say who she is and the audience will be shocked. Do they really think the audience is like 3 years old????
OH Pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase, with a single glance from the trailer, all will know who the hell Laura is. Don't need to surprise anyone, she's not mysterious at all.<br/><br/>Oh, but i do like (AND VERY MUCH AGREE!!!) when they say Charles is the most destructive mass killer weapon.<br/><br/>Score: meh.<br/><br/>Yes, i'm writing this review in rant."

"invisibleunicornninja","9","1","3","15 March 2018"," A fantastic conclusion to Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine.
","This movie is depressing. This is not the same Wolverine that first appeared in ""X-men."" That's not a bad thing - that's just a warning for anyone who thinks that this movie is going to be lighthearted. <br/><br/>Characters - The acting is amazing. All the characters are believable and well-portrayed. These complex characters are brought to life by brilliant actors. Even the child actors are decent.<br/><br/>Violence - I think that pretty much every fan of the title character has been waiting for a movie where Wolverine kills people and we get to see it. This movie's well-shot action scenes are filled with blood and death.<br/><br/>Plot - Though there are a few very minor plot holes in this movie, they don't take away from the overall enjoyment there is to be had. For the most part, this depressing story is solid and most importantly - entertaining. <br/><br/>Sights and Sounds - This movie is extremely well shot. All the effects are great. I can't remember having any problems with the audio, but there wasn't really anything special about the soundtrack. There are a lot of great shots in this movie and a lot of stuff is shot outdoors. <br/><br/>The Ending - If you don't already know what happens in the finale of this movie - don't worry because I'm not going to tell you. However, it left me waiting around for an end-credits scene where it turns out the finale didn't happen. There isn't one. <br/><br/>The R Rating - This movie has Deadpool to thank for being able to explore the themes it did. Because Deadpool was so successful, Marvel figured out that R-Rated superhero movies can work and so we got this masterpiece. After you watch this movie, watch Deadpool if you haven't already.<br/><br/>The Genre - This isn't much of a superhero movie. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but its something to think about before you sit down to watch this movie. Again - this movie isn't very lighthearted."

"GARYMARKBE","10","1","3","3 February 2018"," FLAW IN LOGIC IN THE OTHERWISE SUPERB FILM LOGAN
","FLAW IN LOGIC OF THE FINE FILM LOGAN I just saw the film LOGAN about Wolverine of the X-Men in the future which I thought was pretty good but absolutely great at the beginning. It deserves super extra points for doing an original take different from other superhero films with added human drama and steering clear of mere superhero cliches. The beginning which subtly oriented the viewer to how different the setting and characters now were--this beginning was superb! Now I wish to enter a SPOILER warning for those who have not seen the film.t I think there is kind of a flaw in the logic of the films essential plot element. Evil scientists, if I can oversimplify, have created these guys who are sort of clones of Wolverine and just as deadly. Early in the film it is established that wolverine has created a bullet made of adamantiium (sp?)-- the fictional metal that is the strongest of all-- when he contemplated suicide. Wolverine is almost unkillable and only admantium can kill him or those clones like him. The flaw is that Wolverine and his clones have deadly claws made of adamantium and could have killed each in this way, Also a very trivial thing: Wolverines gray hair and beard seemed to vary drastically from scene to scene. I incorrectly thought at first this might indicate different ages in flashback sequence I was not f ollowing, but this was clearly not the case,"
"eric262003","9","1","3","30 January 2018"," A Nice Send-Off To Hugh Jackman's Role That Solidified His Career
","Emanating in the year 2029, the mutant race is on the brink of non-existence. An aging, disheveled shell of his former self, Logan (Hugh Jackman) the once mighty brave leader of the X-Men s now living a secluded lifestyle working as a chauffeur in a dystopian junkyard desert in Mexico with his ailing mentor Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his loyal, pale complexioned tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant). Trouble starts brewing as Logan against his better judgement must protect mutant girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) from an assembly of bounty hunter in pursuit to wipe them out led by Donald Pierce. (Boyd Holbrook).<br/><br/> Since 2000, Hugh Jackman has played the iconic Logan/Wolverine ad it's this role alone that definitively put a stamp on his career. After 17 years, this ride mut come to an end and in ""Logan"", Jackman will unleash the dreaded claws for one more hurrah. The big difference between this movie and the previous solo films about Wolverine is that the action is more tense, the drama is more uplifting and the action scene are violent, but very well choreographed. The best thing about this movie is that director James Mangold give superhero action fans what they want add to that what they deserve, an R-rated film that shows no remorse or any watering down in its action scenes. Through all that dicing and slicing with his claws Jackman looks like he's never lost his step.<br/><br/> Aside from the gory scenes, Mangold and his screenwriting cohorts Scott Frank and Michael Green have successfully managed to fully bring Mark Millar and Scott McNiven's ""Old Man Logan"" comic series juxtaposed with an homage to the classic Westerns like 1953's ""Shane"" and 1992's ""Unforgiven"". The character of Logan himself has an identical psyche to Alan Ladd's Shane and Clint Eastwood's William Munny as a vigilante who's willing to leave the past behind him and unwinds until something horrifying happens that resurrects his old habits. In spite of the gloom settings and cynical tones, there is an equally balanced humour to lift one's spirits so that you won't leave the theatre depressed.<br/><br/> Performance wise, Jackman delivers a strong performance as Logan being that it is his swan song as the film that made him who he is gives everything he can to close out this chapter in his movie career. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as Professor Charles Xavier and though it can be sad seeing this once powerful mentor in the aging condition he's in, Stewart still pulls it off convincingly. Wonderful performances come from the strong support from Stephen Merchant and Boyd Holbrook as Caliban and Donald Pierce respectively. The real scene stealing comes from Dafne Keen as mutant Laura who was near flawless.<br/><br/> If I could find a solitary flaw in this story it have to be the editing. The main scene which could've been better was when the mutants are hiding in a remote area.<br/><br/> When everything sums up we should not say this is the end, we should just say, see you later. Even though Jackman may not play Wolverine, there might be another performer who might play Wolverine. Though this may be the end of an era for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, at least he went down in a big way thanks to his endearing performance and Mangold's sharp direction. This will truly be a send-off everyone will remember."
"alexandregatineau","9","1","3","30 January 2018"," What a suprise
","Before going to this movie, I didn't watch trailers, didn't read anything, just went out of curiosity. <br/><br/>I'm very tired with super heroes movie recently, the original movies to introduce the avengers were fun and the first ""the avengers movie"" was pretty cool. Since then, it's all been generic movies (Thor 2, Iron man 2 and 3, Winter soldier, Age of Ultron, ewwww). <br/><br/>But somehow, they finally hired good people, gave them money, gave them Logan and ""do something good, do something people want to see"". <br/><br/>If you're scared of watching this because of the two previous Wolverine movies, don't. Logan is worth it. It has depth, it's grim, dark, sad, gore but not just for the sake of being like that. They worked on it. Like ""Hey, if I was Wolverine, I would stab people in the face with my claws"" and they did it and you see it. But they didn't cross that line ""haha yeah and when he pulls out his claw, you can see the brain leaking from the guy's head and with make a focus on it for 2 seconds hahaha"" nah nah nah. It's gore for the sake of ""reality"", not for the sake of gore.<br/><br/>Visually, it's pretty. Not much to say, vivid colors and tons of light, which contrasts with the darkness of the movie. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is on one of his best performances. Could be his best one (I haven't seen all his movies, working on it). He's tired, ill, rude, fed up and has seen a lot in his life. Hugh Jackman portrayed him perfectly. Whoever has to be the next Wolverine, be prepared for the hate because you have big shoes to fill after this movie.<br/><br/>Interesting choice is they don't explain anything to you. The X-men are gone, Xavier is going insane (due to his age?) and people are chasing someone. You kinda understand that Xavier seems to have killed the X-men by accident during an event, only Logan survived because of, well, being almost immortal. But you're dropped in this timeline with no explain and you just have to enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>Not gonna lie, I cried in the end, which is pretty rare for me. Okay, maybe I cried when Optimus Prime died in Transformers 2 too, but that time I cried for good reasons. <br/><br/>Don't watch it with someone who isn't interested or keeps talking, you're gonna spoil a good experiment."
"jerralagbayani","9","1","3","28 January 2018"," If You Want To Be The Best You Got To Drive the Best
","Logan is by far one of the most mature super hero movies I've seen in Marvel. From it's mentality to physicality this shows Logan's transformation as an olden Wolverine who's on the verge on dying. 
Basically if you haven't seen this awesome and innovative film for the end of Logan's run Logan takes a last stand with the help of Professor X to take X-23 to Eden before the government kills her and her friends for one giant fight that really puts X-Men on high ground for the next film.
The reason I rate this so high is because it is Logan's story. Old and washed up he is he puts up some effort to take her unlike what he'd do to maybe 
Caliban. There is some light humor and a lot of F-Bombs(and very brief nudity). Ain't no grave can hold their body down..."
"Mohican15","9","1","3","27 January 2018"," Brutal, tragic, but a fitting end...
","In the words of Shane, a movie that is both watched and quoted in this film: ""there's no living with... with a killing. There's no going back from one. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand sticks. There's no going back"". This sums up the feel and plot of LOGAN well, a film about someone who's done terrible things to survive and is now just trying to get by in peace... <br/><br/>It's been 17 years of Hugh Jackman as one of the MCU's greatest characters and now his run has finally come to an end. Let's face it, apart from Jackman's Wolverine himself, it hasn't been a great ride. The past few X-Men films have been decidedly mediocre and the first WOLVERINE movie (Origins) was downright terrible, but I can assure you that LOGAN is a whole new ballgame for the Superhero movie. James Mangold has delivered the best X-Men film to date and this really feels momentous for the franchise. Although I admired and respected a lot of this film, there was also material that I frankly hated in it. Let's look at all the good in Logan! <br/><br/> Obviously a large portion of praise has to go to Director James Mangold for pulling it all together, and pull it all together he certainly has. Both his writing and directing are quite frankly masterful. Mangold's story encompasses all that you expect out of a Wolverine movie (it is after all based on the Old Man Logan comic book) but what Mangold does is he strips his characters and the story right down and makes it raw and realistic. The plot is simple and straightforward but has enough twists and turns to keep you hooked. The characters are all very strong and brilliantly multi-layered and the story itself is brooding and very Western-like. Mangold also directs brilliantly, choreographing brilliant and brutal action scenes but also getting 110% out of most of his cast and that's the real highlight of LOGAN: the cast!<br/><br/>We must of course begin with Mr. Jackman. I am not a person who thinks Superhero movies deserve a place at the Oscars but with Jackman there has to be an exception and if he doesn't get at least a nomination for actor I will be very disappointed. Jackman delivers a herculean performance as Logan. He's a cynical, depressed, world-weary, alcoholic who is nowhere near the young punk we used to watch. His healing factor is failing him. He squeezes bullets out his chest and is forced to pull his claws straight out of his knuckles. Bloody coughing fits and claw puss is another affliction Logan suffers with. He actually wishes for death and Hugh Jackman plays all of that to the uttermost of his acting ability. Every cough, wheeze and splutter is authentic and real. We're made to feel his pain, anger, sadness and loss. It's an incredibly raw performance. He really captures the character of a regretful man who's had a violent life and now just wants to die in peace. He only lives with Professor X, Caliban and eventually his daughter Laura ""X-23"". But perhaps most importantly, through his performance, we are truly made to care about this old man, Logan.<br/><br/>However, Logan is not the only good performance in this film. There are two other standouts: Laura (Dafne Keen) and Professor X (Sir Patrick Stewart). Dafne Keen delivers a phenomenal performance as Laura and at so young an age. She gives a incredibly strong performance and plays a real fighter. She's every bit as tough as her Dad but also has a very humane side that you can really root for. Not wanting to sound pompous but mark my words: ""that girl will go far"" and I really look forward to seeing more of Ms. Keen and her growing career. Then there's Sir Patrick Stewart as the ailing Professor X. Here is another really vivid performance. The Professor is dementia-addled and forgetful. He acts as Logan's conscience but is often prone to devastating mental seizure's. He's definitely flawed but acts as Logan's father and becomes the sort of grandpa character that you really care about and just want to hug. <br/><br/>Decent performances from most of the supporting cast including Stephen Merchant, Boyd Holbrook, Elizabeth Rodriguez and Jason Genao. Stephen Merchant gives a good, serious performance as the sarcastic mutant Caliban. Boyd Holbrook is convincing as the psychopathic thug Donald Pierce but is certainly no Hans Landa. Elizabeth Rodriguez gives a very emotional performance as the damsel in distress. Jason Genao is another great performance as the new mutant leader and gives a very strong performance. The only error in casting is Richard E. Grant as Dr. Zander Rice. Grant is not someone I would even think of casting for Rice and basically reads the script but this is a small blight on a terrific cast.<br/><br/>Something that obviously stood out in this film is the action, really courtesy of the R-rating. The rating really gave Mangold the free reigns to give us action appropriate for such characters. We really see what Logan and Laura's claws are capable of. I first watched this film with my very good friend and fellow IMDB user Tarx309 and we were really both taken aback by the action. It's gritty, bloody and brutal but most of all realistic and so makes it more believable. Each fight scene is brilliant and brutal. Logan's berserker run against the Reavers in the forest at the end is simply glorious to see, with Logan unleashing all his rage and fury! <br/><br/>Finally, did I enjoy LOGAN? I enjoyed LOGAN as much as it was impossible to enjoy it. There were funny moments but they were few and far between. There were tender moments but they were crushed by the brutality, but I must say I was really touched to see the old western SHANE since it's a movie I often watch with my Dad. However, the second act was what really ruined the film for me. A gorgeous Christian family is brutally murdered. You see I can take violence but what I can't stand is mindless slaughter. It ruined LEON for me and it ruined part of this too. It was like something out of your worst nightmare and really dragged the film down for me. Once it gets back on the brutal adventure path I enjoy it but it was still a horrible path for the film to take. We finally arrive at the climatic and bloody end of the movie and without giving anything away, it will break your heart!...<br/><br/>LOGAN is certainly not for the squeamish but it is a masterpiece of the MCU and a fitting end to 17 good years of the Jackman in his famous role. It's a sad, dark, brutal chapter but certainly the best end to the character. Farewell, Bub!"

"charlieboy_com","8","1","3","10 January 2018"," Wolverine enters gritty neo-western mode
","For some reason, this was a bit hard to write, so I apologise in advance for the torrent of ideas about to come over. I've never been a fan of the Wolverine character simply because I find other X-Men to be far more interesting and because I quickly get tired of his feral tantrums. While I've always understood the central role he played during the first three entries of the franchise, I did find the idea of the Wolverine stand-alone films to be nothing but mere cash-grabbers. This became true when ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009) premiered in such a messy way, yet the character and Jackman's potential were too strong to be thrown away like that, hence his return for 2014's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" and his stand-alone follow-up ""The Wolverine"" (2013), which obviously intended to continue Logan's patched-up saga. However, that instalment proved to be better than expected, mainly due to Mangold's vision focused on testing Wolverine both physically and mentally, a trait that is far more developed and interesting in this new and last entry.<br/><br/>With ""Logan"", Mangold deviates from the previous films (and most superhero films, for that matter) to deliver a Western-influenced gritty road-trip tale that does wonders for Wolverine's persona and takes the characters into new directions, pretty much like Nolan's Batman trilogy did for the Dark Knight. While the action sequences are well shot, violent and fantastic enough to keep your eyes open, finally fitting in what a Wolverine film should be like, it is the dramatic moments where the film works best, especially during its first half. Despite being more of the same, Jackman has never been stronger: thanks to the amount of years he's been tied to the mutant, he's managed to build his own Wolverine and transform him into something flexible, vulnerable and raw that feels more human than most of the heroes we've seen on screen. Nevertheless, it's inevitable to have all eyes on Stewart's Xavier, who effortlessly steals every scene he appears in; and on newcomer Dafne Keen, whose intense, vicious and explosive performance is more than enough to turn the scales in her favour whenever she shares time with Jackman. And it is precisely the relationship between Logan and Laura/X-23 where the film walks a fine line: it works for the purposes of the film, yet it does feel like something is missing and it falls somewhat short towards the end, thus diminishing the emotional gut-punch that is supposed to happen. It's a borderline subtlety, as the lack of time to develop their bond also contributes to Logan's tragedy in finding something he might start to care about just to lose it immediately (which works both ways too).<br/><br/>In terms of the villains, these may be pretty standard, but they're alright by any means if you consider where the film is heading: the heart of Logan lies in the battles he has with himself, as he comes to terms with his human condition and the fact that not everything is always about him, as Magneto would say. Yet Mangold has managed to make it all about him, as Logan definitely sets a new path for the superhero genre that Marvel, Fox and other studios will have to consider from now on, a path where it is much more about light, darkness and what's in between, than about punching some bad guys dressed in capes, boots and gowns; more about saving themselves than saving the world."
"gavinp9","8","1","3","2 January 2018"," Fantastic finale
","'Logan' is the final (we'll see) Wolverine film, in addition to the six X-Men films, so it's safe to say it's Jackman's last outing - it's been a good 17 years! 'Logan' is again directed by Mangold, who did the previous film ('The Wolverine') and is set in 2029 - when Logan/James Howlett is ~200 and Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) is ~90. They do a great job of making them both look and seem way older than their appearances in the last few films! It's great to see Logan as an every-man drifter, working as a limo driver between El Paso and Mexico, where he's looking after Prof X with his dementia. Clearly, some tragedy has befallen them and it's alluded to a few times.<br/><br/>The ""near-future"" looks very realistic - almost the same as now, but with driverless trucks and giant robotic harvesting machines. No futuristic ray guns or anything! It's also cool to see Wolverine kill about five people and swear about 10 times in the first 3min - well-earned MA rating! Also, very true to the comics, where some of the story is from Millar's 'Old Man Logan' (highly recommended). Once X-23/Laura (Keen) comes into it, the film becomes a Western, with Logan trying to protect Prof X & Laura from Donald Pierce (Holbrook - fun bad guy) as they go on a cross-country chase.<br/><br/>There's some plausible plot, only tentatively linking in with previous films, but particularly X-23 and X-24 (i.e. Wolverine as ""Weapon X"" was X-1, but this time the experiments were in Mexico, not Canada...) showing Logan both his past and potential future. Getting to see his healing-factor wane and have to face his mortality, as well as reluctantly be the good guy, is all true to character and pulled off expertly by Jackman. It's long (2.25 hours), with lots of nice, character-building moments - particularly with the family at the farm house. Keen is good as Laura and Merchant has a nice role as Caliban. It's also touching and poignant in plenty of scenes (good score), but there's heaps of action and violence too - especially the final 25min, with it all well executed."
"robertryszewski","Null","1","3","31 December 2017"," Genre-bending masterpiece of a performance
","Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's performances in Logan have made this ""superhero"" movie a very poignant and touching film, that nearly completely escapes being labeled under the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Watching these characters (Wolverine and Professor X) that we've followed through so many movies grow old, sick, and weak, and lose their superhuman invulnerability, in a way, makes them so much more relatable. While there's plenty of gory, violent action, the focus of the film lies a lot more on the humanity, emotions, and motivations of our favorite on-screen stars. We see them suffer, and we see them struggle: with regret, hatred, anger, and eventually even love.<br/><br/>Logan shows us how, at the end of the day, even superheros are merely mortal. They, like us, have to deal with the same mundanities and drudgeries of day-to-day life, and navigating how to find happiness and do right by others. And they, like us, eventually have to die. While technically part of the X-Men franchise, Logan can easily be consumed as a stand-alone film, one whose storytelling and execution are masterfully and thoughtfully executed."
"robobobotic","8","1","3","29 December 2017"," I love this movie, but I have a few problems
","I love this movie a lot. It definitely the most well made superhero movie, that puts a lot of realism in to the Marvel universe. It also seems as though this not a continuation of any previous movie, moreso it seems like its ''what actually happened'' behind the comics - showing the harsh reality in detail that the mutants are facing and not just being super heroes who save the day all the time. I like to think this and it also makes sense why Logan was so mad at the comic books that actually misrepresented what actually happened in the past with X-men.<br/><br/>
There are things here and there and stop this movie from being perfect. Like Logan and Charles's inconsiderate actions of going to those people's house, even though they knew they were being chased (which also SPOILERS - lead to Charles's death).
I also think the X-24 weapon, was kind of pushing it too far. Not only because X-24 is not really a real comic book character, but because he's whole existence seems like nonsense to me. Why would they genetically create Laura (that is very unstable), when they have a whole perfect copy of Wolverine that they can control? Not only that, but It seemed as though they were trying too hard to find a way to kill it ''somehow'', like how Will Munson all of a sudden drove the car in to X-24 out of no where to stop him, so the main characters can run away.
So I dont really know how to feel about it, but you did feel the sense of dread for the main character when you have such a powerful creature following them. So I guess that was a plus.<br/><br/>
But overall with some minor mistakes here and there, this movie was really good and I really want more R rated realistic and pessimistic super hero movies like this."

"cliftonofun","8","1","3","27 December 2017"," A superhero free from franchise
","Well, it only took Hugh Jackman 9 times playing Wolverine to make a truly great comic book film that can stand on its own. Of course, it required stripping away all the trappings: the continuity, the characters. This was not a franchise, but a story. And it worked because of that fact. A few complex characters on a conflict-filled adventure. Just the basics. I could have lived without some over-the-top moments at the end, but otherwise this movie was just plain brilliant from the beginning. Here's hoping they wait a while before the inevitable reboot."
"The Grand Master","8","1","3","10 December 2017"," We bid farwell to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine
","I'm still coming to terms with the fact that the curtains have drawn on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. We loved him as he sliced his way onto the big screen with X-Men (2000). We all loved him in many of the X-Men movies throughout the past 17 years, no matter how good or bad the movie was. Truth be told, I lost interest in the X-Men series following the disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). I hadn't seen any of the movies since until I decided to give Logan a chance while on a long distance flight back home.<br/><br/>Logan departs from the usual entertaining fanfare and draws us into a bleak, depressing and violent 2029 in where Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a far cry from his days as the agile warrior Wolverine. His abilities to rapidly heal has weakened, he is broken and vulnerable, he has aged, he is now an alcoholic, and he spends his days as a limo driver to make a living. Along with albino mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), Logan is also caring for the critically ill Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is relying on medication to keep his destructive seizures under control. Logan finds himself being a reluctant protector to Laura (Dafne Keen), a child that has been created as a mutant superweapon by biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen. Laura is pursued by head of security Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) who wants to retrieve the child at all costs. Logan finds himself being drawn back to his old life that he left behind as he finds himself fighting for his life albeit with his diminished superpowers.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has had a magnificent run as his most memorable character Wolverine. Logan was the perfect movie for his character to end on a high note.<br/><br/>Unlike all of the movies in the X-Men series, Logan is DEFINITELY not for younger audiences. It's brutally violent, it's intense, it's very emotional, and there is frequent use of the f-word. You also feel that the characters, particularly Logan/Wolverine and Charles Xavier/Professor X, are no longer the heroes they were and are more vulnerable and weakened in a bleak and dystopian world.<br/><br/>James Mangold did a terrific job as a director. This is one of his most memorable movies that he has done.<br/><br/>Logan was an excellent movie, and also renewed my faith in the X-Men series. I'm sad to bid farewell to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. But should there be another movie in the X-Men series which brings back Wolverine, I'm sure the next actor will do well donning the superclaws.<br/><br/>8/10."

","First of all, i would like to point out that i am not an extreme comics and superhero fan of any sort. But i do appreciate those type of movies.<br/><br/>As such i will say that this movie is not an usual superhero flick.<br/><br/>It has few violence/action scenes, although effective, and builds up on tense and dramatic storyline/characters.<br/><br/>It is mostly a good drama, starred once again by the perfect-for- the-role Hugh Jackman, who manages to create a dark and suspenseful feeling and interest for the story.<br/><br/>It is somehow a conclusion to the characters'story, but the plot sometimes feels too rushed and unconvincing.<br/><br/>It is not a masterpiece, nor it does have an unflawed plot, but it is well paced and pleasantly shines thanks to a dark, very human, grumpy and old Wolverine/Hugh Jackman."

"kaspergordon","10","6","47","6 March 2017"," Disney take notes.
","This is one of the best (if not the best) comic-book movies I have ever seen. It was so nice to go see a movie with one of the comic-book characters you grew up with, and not being treated as part of a demographic plan to sell tickets, toys and merchandise. <br/><br/>This felt like an actual movie - with heart, soul and and a story to tell. And not like a machine-made formulaic and predictable 2-hour toy commercial, full of political correct cast characters, pointless forced jokes and waves of product placement. Like all of your other Iron Man and friends movies. <br/><br/>The movie had action scenes when it needed to, to further the plot. And not to make you feel like your being treated as an ADHD-case by throwing something loud and shiny at you every 20 minutes.<br/><br/>And the action in Logan is great. It's like you're there, and feeling every punch, slash, stab and shot, along with the characters. It is very grounded, gritty, intense and easy to follow. And never scaled too big or over the top. This isn't collapsing skyscrapers with tons of flying robots, monsters, laser cannons, explosions, and people surviving the most ridiculous situations. While some blue beam shoots up in the sky, so our so called heroes can save the planet the 100th time. <br/><br/>This is just characters you care for (even the villains), fighting for themselves, each other and their humanity. Often in a very brutal way, but the brutality just makes the action more involving. The action isn't explicit in a gory way - like it's just trying to shock you or to be edgy, but it just pulls you more in. Actually I think a lot of PG-13 movies, could make their action scenes work this great too, without toning up the blood and violence, if they just toned down all the CGI and made the action more accessible and believable. It really isn't about the R-rating, as much as it is about involving you as a moviegoer. Instead of distancing you with CGI and unbelievable over the top shiny scenarios. <br/><br/>Personally I'm under the impression that people have had enough of the Disney Marvel movies, and all their imitators. Enough of expanded movie universes (that actually feels more like a commercials for another movie within the movie, more than it feels like it's expanding anything). And enough of movies about super heroes that all feel and look the same with their political correctness, CGI, demographic planning, predictable jokes and formulaic plots.<br/><br/>Most people just want a good movie with atmosphere, drama, and scenes where you actually can tell what's going on.<br/><br/>Hopefully this movie will help start up a new trend, and become a genre- defining piece, so Fox once again can be the innovators of something new, like when they first started the genre with the first X-men movie."

","I fast forwarded through 3/4 of this movie, which I hardly ever do. The start had some promise, but it soon became one uninspired gore-fest in which all you do as a viewer is wonder who dies next. I understand the idea of a raw movie, but in the X-men context this was just an empty shell without any values or any factor that really swept you along. And what a waste of talent for one of my favorites, Patrick Stewart. And the ending just leaves you thinking 'What... that was it?...' I actually had to laugh a little. Glad I skipped though it, otherwise the waste of time would've been bigger."

","Though I totally love Hugh Jackman and X-men, for me the movie was a big disappointment. The beginning was good but starting with the second part it was a complete downfall.<br/><br/>-The movie's deaths were not well balanced. I really have troubles with compassion towards a bunch of kids that had 5 mins of the screen time and big characters like Logan, Xavier and Caliban. Why to kill all three? -Why they let doctor Zander alive after the massacre at the farm? Could run him over easily. -They created a clone of Logan. lol -What's up with the kids who were grown to be ""universal soldiers""? Why they didn't fight back? Oh well, let's assume they saw that they are outnumbered and decided that they'd better run and they didn't want to put their killing abilities into action. But then they happily jumped on Donald Pierce and pretty much killed him. What happened after that? WHY they left Logan and Laura to fight alone? Come on, there's only ONE villain left, the kids were taught how to fight and then they just hid in the bushes? What a joke.<br/><br/>This all just ruined the good impression left from the first part of the movie. The whole movie final is a total joke and it seems that the creators just played on the well worked franchise and didn't really care about the logic in the movie being sure that people would go to the cinema anyway. Well, they were right."

"pennaracer","10","1","4","18 June 2019"," A Farewell to Hugh Jackman
","Before we talk about Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, let's revisit the X-Men series
While movies like Spider Man, Captain America, and Iron Man were very popular among fans, the X-Men were quite underrated
I remember when X-Men first came out in 2000 and it was something out of this world especially being the first comic-based movie then a sequel came called X2 and that was even better than the first
After that was X-Men: Last Stand which was good but could have been better
X-Men Origins: Wolverine was very mediocre but watchable
Then came X-Men: First Class which was the prequel of the events of the first three movies and it was pretty good a different style
The Wolverine is a movie focused on the character, Logan, which follows the events of the first three movies and that was the Wolverine movie we all wanted but it didn't stop there
X-Men Days of the Future Past again centered on Wolverine as he must travel back in time to save the X-Men that was an amazing concept that was perfectly executed
Then Deadpool came as the first R-rated movie for Marvel and the highest grossing R-rated film Ryan Reynolds is the highlight of this movie and he is pretty funny
And there was X-Men: Apocalypse which was an okay movie<br/><br/>Now we have Logan which is not only the best movie of the X-Men series but one of the best superhero movies ever made
Sadly this is where we say good bye to Hugh Jackman. There were many amazing characters in X-Men like Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) which I enjoyed a lot but Wolverine is my favorite. Some of you guys may not realize this but he has been the main character for this series till now
Yes Logan is R-rated but that's thanks to Ryan Reynold's Deadpool which gives the Wolverine we always wanted
It is a lot of gory violence but this is very realistic depicting a world of mutants
Patrick Stewart reprises his role as Professor X and so does Stephen Merchant as Caliban unfortunately they are leaving as well
Boyd Hallbrook did justice to his character, Donald Pierce, as a ruthless mutant hunter along with Richard E. Grant as Dr. Rice
The supporting cast did an awesome job especially the mutant kids
Marco Beltrami's music really puts you to the edge of your seat as the suspense builds up
James Mangold really did a superb job in making an amazing superhero film like Wolverine<br/><br/>Now let's talk about Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. He is the best man for the job and now he has aged as Wolverine is now more than a couple centuries old
He is getting weaker but he has to save his kind from a powerful enemy
Hugh Jackman is going to be retiring from X-Men as now he is having health issues due to his age which is very sad
Hugh Jackman will always be my favorite Wolverine and one of my favorite superheros
He is indeed the man for the job and the best Wolverine
Now we have to say good bye to Logan as now after this movie there is going to be a major change in the X-Men Universe
Yes Deadpool 2 is coming soon but think about the X-Men without Logan
No one could have done Logan like how Hugh Jackman did and now it is sad to see him go
I will warn you that you might become emotional throughout this movie<br/><br/>I am going to miss Hugh Jackman and of course Logan is going to be a future classic
A future cult classic
Now we have to say good bye to Logan and I wish the best to Hugh Jackman"
"dberryii","10","1","4","7 May 2019"," On par with The Dark Knight
","This is the best possible way that Hugh Jackman could have retired his portrayal of Wolverine. The performances from Hugh, Patrick Stewart, and Dafne Keen are incredible. The end of this film is heart wrenching enough to bring even the manliest of men to tears, and it's not just thrown on top of the plot, it is truly earned. Logan is everything you never knew you wanted out of a comic book movie and sits at the top with The Dark Knight."
"rmichaelfox","9","1","4","18 March 2019"," Best X-Men movie to date
","Overall the ""X"" franchise has not been as good as, say, the MCU or the Dark Knight trilogy IMHO. Logan, however, is up there with the best comic book movies of any franchise. Tons of heart. Solid pacing and directing. Solid performances by the main characters. Variety of settings. A strange combination of beauty and brutality. It's one of the only comic book movies where the end came and I was like, I don't want this to end! Thankfully a perfectly chosen Johnny Cash song helped me transition from the film back to the real world."

","I like the x-men series. This is one of the coolest movies ever. This is one of the beautiful films of the x-men series. But inconsistent. Because the story is going on in 2029. But the technology is backwards. In the stories of two thousand years, world technology was more advanced."
"Syphied","10","1","4","12 January 2018"," Above all Marvel films...
","After Deadpool, Marvel/Fox has realised that R-rated films aren't such a bad idea after all. ""Logan"" was originally planned to be shown as a PG-13; the decision to R rate the whole film certainly disappointed young fans of the X-men Universe. <br/><br/>But my, what a decision! ""Logan"" is not your conventional superhero story where the protagonist is tasked with realising the good that they can do. No. Logan is one of those rare films where we really experience the conflicts within characters and the gruesome fate of some of the most iconic and loved comic book heroes. Hugh Jackman's and Patrick Stewart's final role as the infamous Wolverine and Professor X is, in a nutshell, a heartbreak for many. We see the pain and torment that has worked its way past even Wolverine's indestructible adamant skeleton and remarkable healing factor. The equally worn and beaten Professor Xavier is no longer recognised as the righteous and stable mentor that we are all so familiar with. With a cast performing like nothing seen before, there are a plethora of surprises waiting at every corner. <br/><br/>What makes this ""Logan"" stand out is not its R rating or story but its realism and lethargy. Just when Jackman's character is ready to concede to the cruel dystopian world, he meets a child who reignites the emotional conflict within Wolverine. There is no such thing as a perfect film and although Logan lacks in some areas, the film was always meant to show Wolverine and Xavier live in a world where they are the last of their kind. So in many ways, it is very close to perfection. 
 
To summarise, ""Logan"" surpasses every expectation of a Wolverine film and entertains us not only with fast paced action scenes and angry characters but also a fantastic end to the legacy of X-Men."
"robertasmith","7","1","4","12 July 2017"," Too many unanswered questions
","A good film with a lot of positives. Jackman is on fine form and Patrick Stewart brings all his acting talent to the party. Dafne Keen is extraordinary in her role as Logan's 'daughter' and I'm sure we will see much more of her in the years to come.<br/><br/>On the negative side I thought there were parts of the film that were mumbled, Stephen Merchant was simply wrong in his role and as much as I love Richard e Grant, he was out of place and not at all convincing. I was left with questions over the virus that was destroying mutants and the serum that temporarily restoring powers. In fact, I'm not even sure I've got that right.<br/><br/>Spoiler - I don't believe for one moment that Logan won't rise from his grave and I believe Jackman has said that wolverine will return but without him. So, the Marvel universe continues but I am left with the feeling it is getting a bit tired."

She speaks Spanish in the movie an a little English. She does a great job and it seems she will be the next wolverine.<br/><br/>The movie does its job entertaining, to me, I don't like to watch too many dark movies (Hollywood needs to get back to the 80s era where there were hundreds of comedy, adventure and family films to choose from) and it also needs to get creative and stop remaking great classics."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","4","11 March 2017"," Very ambitious
","I think there are quite a lot of things that Logan is attempting to do that I don't think any other Marvel comics film has done. In terms of ambition, it definitely eclipses those others. I don't think everything in the screenplay always entirely worked. There are some rough edges that needed some refining for the finished product. And I also don't think the film is quite the masterpiece that it is being hailed as. However, it's an incredibly well-made, enjoyable, and really meaningful picture that allows us to experience these characters that we've know before in very different ways. The film should be congratulated for definitely trying something different and for mostly being successful."
"Special-K88","Null","1","4","8 March 2017"," a very unique take on an iconic character
","One of the X-Men's most venerable members returns for this compelling tale set in a bleak future where the mutant population has been ravaged to the brink of extinction. Acting as a caretaker to the ailing Charles Xavier, the weary Logan is suddenly drawn into a dangerous quest when he encounters a remarkable young mutant with a unique gift, and runs afoul of the sinister forces in dogged pursuit. This isn't the usual flashy, lightweight, or humorous mutant concoction; it's a gritty and raw saga with thought-provoking themes, in-your-face action, and dark subject matter. In what is reported to be his final time taking the reins, Jackman—playing an aged and much more vulnerable character—is sensational, creating one of his most memorable and distinctive interpretations to date. An impressive showing, one that isn't really made for fans of its predecessors. ***"
"Laakbaar","7","1","4","7 March 2017"," Charles and Logan go on a roadtrip
","This is another movie in Marvel's X-Men franchise. We're a few decades in the future of the other movies. Logan (Wolverine) and Charles (Professor X) are old, isolated and not doing well. The entire mutant thing has been successfully stopped, and the mutants are being hunted (by men called ""Reavers"" for some reason). There is also a mad scientist experimenting with mutants. Logan and Charles get together and try to save Laura, a mutant with the same powers as Logan. She's got Logan's DNA so they think of her as his daughter. Logan is not really into it. She keeps talking about a mutant hideout near the Canadian border. Logan thinks it's hogwash, but he takes her there, chased the whole time by the hunters and mad scientist. Will Logan lead them to safety in Canada (his homeland, as we all remember).<br/><br/>I heard this was a really good film, but to me it was just OK. I'm not sure what the hype was about. I guess this superhero film is different from the rest because it reflects on the idea of the decline and death of superheros. I'm not sure it's something I need to explore, since I'm not really into this genre in the first place. There's nothing about this movie that stood out for me. <br/><br/>I'm not really into the characters. Hugh Jackman played his role with the usual gusto, but I didn't see anything in the character to draw me to it. I don't understand why the Wolverine character has had so many movies. Boyd Holbrook was interesting. <br/><br/>It's not a bad film, although I thought it was too violent, and it bothered me how the innocent people they came across were all wiped out.<br/><br/>So, this movie's current score on IMDb is 8.7? And it's the 37th top rated movie? Wait...37th of all time? OK, this is an OK film, but it's not that good. This just indicates how many young men are into these superhero movies and will go online to support them. It's a shame because it skews the entire IMDb movie rating system."

"Argemaluco","9","1","4","4 March 2017"," Logan
","Logan has already become one of my favorite superhero films... even though it doesn't really look like a superhero movie. It would be more appropriate to describe Logan as a western, or a drama, or a tense thriller which would still work without the fantastic elements, because there's no need for mutant powers to comprehend the desperation of a man tormented by his past and with an uncertain future lacking of any hope... until hope finds him. But, hope of what? Of redemption? Of survival? Or of briefly returning to the brutality and violence from which he attempted to escape? The simple fact that Logan inspires those questionings reveals its narrative deepness and emotional complexity, both of them rarely seen in the occasionally frivolous world of superheroes. Hugh Jackman confirms once more that he was born to play Logan/James Howlett/Wolverine. The benefit of the years (I'm equally talking about the age of the franchise and Jackman's) have allowed him to create a credible and natural evolution of the character throughout 9 films (well, he barely played cameos in X-Men: First Class and X- Men: Apocalypse, but I'm still counting them), and that's a probably unique case in universal cinema (not only in comic adaptations). But Jackman is only one of the brilliant elements of Logan; we also have the excellent screenplay, solidly structured with ""classic"" elements (the retired hero must return to action; the hero considers his powers a curse, etc.) which feel fresh due to some unexpected inversion of roles and the intentional distancing from the comic archetypes which are becoming routine in this kind of movies; don't misunderstand me: I keep enjoying the films from Marvel Studios, but it's already time to change the recipe a bit... something achieved by Logan with an excellent result. I also liked the fact that the antagonists aren't megalomaniac super-villains with vague plans of planetary conquest (or something like that), but individuals who are ""normal"" to a certain point representing extreme manifestations of the vices of humanity: intolerance, obsession with control, selfishness. Another thing I liked was the austere vision of the year 2029; instead of exaggerating the futurism and the science fiction, director James Mangold presents us a world which is the same to the one of 2017, but with small visual details supporting the story. In conclusion, Logan isn't a perfect movie, but I enjoyed it very much, and it definitely deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation."
"jdesando","Null","1","4","4 March 2017"," The greatest adventure of all.
","""Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long."" Logan (Hugh Jackman)<br/><br/>God is allowing us to enjoy the last in the X-Men /Wolverine cycle with Hugh Jackman having endured 17 years of pumping up to give adolescent males a reason to get up for the demands of an unforgiving world. However, this film, Logan, is not all blood and guts—it presents an aging hero coming to terms with the natural degeneration of his greatness and his legacy.<br/><br/>It's really all about how these mutants, who clearly represent the fringes of society with odd residents marginalized by the homogeneity of the world. Inevitability hangs over this substantial hero saga, especially an iteration that suggests what even super heroes long for— immortality through lineage or enduring philosophy. <br/><br/>As the founder of the mutant school, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), tells it to Wolverine: ""This is what life looks like: people love each other. You should take a moment . . . ."" The film is suffused with a sense of the importance of family, not just Logan and his daughter, Laura (Dafne Keen), but also the new generation of mutants who must band together to survive.<br/><br/>The heroism turns on love rather than technology. The love is familial, in this case Logan discovering his daughter then sacrificing his safety to escort her to Eden, a place with other child mutants, who must hide from the dark forces bent on using them as soldiers. Although such bonding is the stuff of cliché, this film makes the growing love and sacrifice believable.<br/><br/>In the end, the search has been to discover what it's like to live and love normally. Albeit briefly. Amidst the sturm and drang of violent, bloody super hero films, and this one has as much violence as any other, the discovery of homely love is the greatest adventure of all."

","James Mangold's Logan, the third installment to the Wolverine franchise goes out with a bang for Hugh Jackman's last outing as the titled character. I thought this movie was great, very well written, and loving the cinematography, the feel of it. Lets talk about characters, Hugh Jackman as an older Logan to me was done greatly, so was Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, their dynamic was fun to watch, like father and son. Also, absolutely love Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney/X-23, she didn't speak for most of the movie, but did a darn great job every time on screen. Also enjoyed the dynamic between her character and Logan, would have liked a little more to the father/daughter relationship, but it was good nonetheless. There were somethings I wish could've been different, but a very solid film. Some other actors I thought that deserve praise Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce and Stephen Merchant as Caliban, both did great jobs. Overall, great R rated superhero film, western vibe, drama driven, brutal action. Also to me, the best of the Wolverine movies."
"stevendbeard","8","1","4","3 March 2017"," Good/Bad
","I saw ""Logan"", starring Hugh Jackman-Eddie the Eagle, Swordfish; Patrick Stewart-Blunt Talk_tv, Robin Hood:Men in Tights; Boyd Holbrook-Morgan, Gone Girl and Dafne Keen-This is her first movie but she was in a Spanish/BBC TV series called The Refugees.<br/><br/>This is one of those good things/bad things. It's good because it's a really good movie-they got it right by going with an 'R' rating-and it's bad because this is Hugh's & Patrick's last times to play these characters-at least, that's what both actors have said in interviews. The movie takes place in the not too distant future where Hugh is older, has more aches & pains, even walks with a limp and his healing factor takes longer to work. Most mutants are either dead or have gone into hiding. Hugh himself is hiding out near El Paso, down close to the Mexican border. He and another mutant, Caliban, are taking care of Patrick, who is fighting dementia by taking pills-if he doesn't take them, he will lash out uncontrollably with paralyzing waves of mental energy that hits anyone in close proximity. Hugh has just about given up on everything. He just wants to buy a boat and live on the ocean. About then is when Dafne shows up, looking for help. A group of cyborg enhanced mercenaries called The Reavers are after her. Boyd is their leader, and all Dafne wants to do is get to North Dakota, a safe haven for mutants. If you are familiar with the comics, you probably know the connection between Hugh & Dafne, aka X-23. The fights are fantastic but be cautious of taking little kids. Heads & other body parts are dismembered by both Hugh and Dafne with ease and there is lots of language flying around-It is hilarious to here Patrick use the F-bomb. Oh yeah, make sure you are not late to the theater. There is not a scene at the end of the movie but there is one at the very beginning. It involves another super hero, basically plugging his own up-coming movie- no date is mentioned, it just says coming soon. It's rated ""R"" for strong brutal violence, language and some brief nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes. I loved this one-I wish there would be more 'R' rated super hero movies- and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"dommeriano","10","1","4","3 March 2017"," Logan is perfect as an action/drama
","(Won't give any spoilers) After seeing this movie, I would definitely say this is the best of the x-men series. This movie is an experience. Not one moment throughout the entire movie I was bored, something is always keeping it going and your heart beats faster as the movie progresses; it's truly a great drama(I even held in my pee for half the movie and it was worth every second). The cast gave one of the best performances I've ever seen in a Drama/Action. The Hugh Jackman, as always, perfect as Logan/James, at times you forget that he is even acting; it is the best performance he's ever gave of this character. Patrick Stewart as Charles, playing Professor X who lost his mind was so well executed and heart aching to watch; when I got home I had to watch some recent interviews with Patrick Stewart because he played the part so well. And oh my god, Dafne Keen who plays Laura (the little girl) was amazing. I won't say much else about the movie because it would be best to go into this movie not knowing anything. People who have never seen an x-men movie in their life can see this movie. As long as you understand the sort of characters in this movie and maybe a little bit of background about mutants. My girlfriend saw this movie with me without seeing the rest of the x-men movies, and she loved it."
"FairlyAnonymous","9","1","4","3 March 2017"," Wow, what a surprise
","Having heard very little about this movie (and not having seen any of the trailers) I decided to go watch it... and wow...<br/><br/>Why this movie works is because it finally dives into the mentality of the characters. Wolverine is obviously the most beloved character, but we get to see him in an older state where he isn't what he used to be. He feels vulnerable, lost, and weak. This is in complete contrast with the other X-men films.<br/><br/>Instead of everything feeling cartoony and over-the-top, we get a real gritty and serious movie that has a lot of weight to it. Characters would die unexpectedly. The violence is to the extreme. Everything in it is utterly hopeless. To add to that, it has a lot of twists and turns in it which consistently kept me at the edge of my seat. I never felt safe in this world, and I loved how the movie was consistently manipulating my emotions with constant tension.<br/><br/>Logan is an excellent X-men film, but better yet it is also a great film on its own. <br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of the x-men movies (generally feeling mildly let-down by the end of it) but I was surprised with how clever this movie was and how bold it could be. This movie felt personal, and I felt more emotion in this movie than all of the X- men films combined.<br/><br/>If you aren't squeamish, go and watch this movie."

","X-men origins: Wolverine is set in the past, The Wolverine is set in the present, while Logan is set in the future, where mutants have been wiped out and have become comic book legends (literally, the X-men are a comic book within the movie). The best there is is now a limo driver just trying to lay low, until he meets a young mutant who needs his help getting to a safe heaven.<br/><br/>The filmmakers go for a hard R with this movie with Wolverine and even Professor Xavier laying down some F bombs that will shock you and have you amused after being use to the PG-13 version for the past 17 years.<br/><br/>But the most important part is that the R rating allows Logan to go into full berserk rage that we Thought we saw in X2, but once you see Logan you'll realize you did not. It was violent and brutal, perfect Wolverine, and the best fight and action sequences I have seen from the X-Man in the movies.<br/><br/>I also like that this movie got to showcase Patrick Stewart's version of Charles Xavier far more than any of the other movies. He was always more of a side show in the other films especially in comparison to his turn in Logan.<br/><br/>For those of you who are fans of the comic, like The wolverine (and most of the X- men movies really) the focus on Wolverine means that a lot of other mutants from the comic don't get a chance to get adapted to the movies (Does not help that the plot is about the fact that mutants were wiped out). Wolverine battles the Reavers (who are Cyborgs not mutants) in this movie mostly. However, we do get to see the first appearance of X23 in this film which was perfect and bad ass .Once again, the R Rating assured the best adaption of the character made it to the film.<br/><br/>It's an amazing movie and a great Wolverine story. When Jackman was chosen to be the Wolverine I thought he was so wrong for the part, now seventeen years later I'm sad that he's retiring from the role.<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com/"
"MItTiger","10","1","4","3 March 2017"," A Fitting End For Hugh Jackman
","Absolutely stunning film & the greatest solo movie Marvel has delivered to date. The movie makes full use of it's R rating with tons or gore and language (Don't watch this if you're afraid of blood, there's more enough to fill a couple of swimming pools). Great performances by everyone and truly a film that stands out from the rest of the superhero movies we have today. It is Hugh Jackman's final portrayal of him as the Wolverine and it was a great finish back to his humble beginnings back in 2000 with the first X-Men film that we knew and love. Needless to say it will be hard to never again see Jackman as the Wolverine again, but with this film he has made his mark among the greatest superhero movies of all time."
"socrates99","9","1","4","3 March 2017"," Masterful and emotionally impressive tour de force
","What a beautifully crafted movie! There's no ignoring this James Mangold, the director and the man with the story idea. I appreciate the way each scene made meticulous sense. It makes watching so much more engaging and rewarding when you can follow each event and never doubt, given the premise, that it could have happened that way.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are both in fine form. Each in his own way make the story work at a refined level for which they deserve A list pay. Supporting their work are several others, including a newcomer in the role of Wolverine's 'daughter', all of whom manage to not only break the spell, but actually add to the story's impact.<br/><br/>By far the most critical casting was of Laura, Wolverine's genetically enhanced offspring, of sorts. They had to find someone who could pull off the physically demanding role, and if I were Mangold, it would have been job one. It's miraculous that they found Dafne Keen who has no trouble getting what the movie is about. She does a wonderful job and I'd love to see her again."
"Impsman","10","1","4","3 March 2017"," Just fantastic
","There are groups of cinema goers who will steer clear of any film involving 'super heroes'. I understand that as they are not always for all. Logan is clearly a Marvel film and involves characters created within the X Men universe.<br/><br/>It is though a very different kettle of fish. This is a film which can be enjoyed on all levels by everyone who invest in good storytelling , character development and acting performances. This film can easily stand alone from any previous film involving these characters, and is in my opinion the best film within the X Men universe.<br/><br/>This is supposedly Hugh Jackman's final time wearing the adamantium claws and it is a very fitting end to those 17 years. Both he and Patrick Stewart excel in their roles and have never been better on screen. In many ways I hope that neither are inclined to play these parts again as it will be very difficult to match these performances in the future.<br/><br/>So if you are one of those cinema goers who rule out films of this kind, I would encourage you to give this a go. You will not be disappointed"
"Anurag-Shetty","10","1","4","3 March 2017"," An action packed & emotional send-off for everyone's favorite mutant.
","Logan is the next film in the X-Men franchise & the last movie in the Wolverine trilogy after X-Men Origins: Wolverine(2009) & The Wolverine(2013). In the not so distant future, Logan(Hugh Jackman) is taking care of Charles(Patrick Stewart), who is unwell. They live in a hideout on the Mexican border. However, Logan & Charles can no longer hide when a young girl named Laura(Dafne Keen), enters their lives. Now, it is up to Logan to protect Laura from the malevolent group, that wants to capture her. <br/><br/>Logan is a mind blowing film. It is the best movie in the Wolverine trilogy & might also be, the best film in the entire X-Men franchise. Director James Mangold has given fans the perfect Wolverine film, with just the right amount of action, emotional moments & unpredictability. The visual effects look very realistic. I'm glad that this movie was given an R-rating. Now, we get to witness the full extent of Wolverine's rage, his penchant for brutal violence & his usage of swear words, with nothing held back. The action set pieces are fantastic & the highlight of the film, is the climactic set piece. The performances are another strong point of the movie. Hugh Jackman is awe-inspiring as Logan. Jackman portrays the various shades of his complex character, both subtle & not so subtle, expertly. I will really miss Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine. Patrick Stewart is spectacular as Charles. Stewart gives us a very different portrayal of his character, this time around. Dafne Keen is amazing as Laura. Keen's performance is on par with both Jackman & Stewart which is commendable, considering she had the most difficult role. Boyd Holbrook is great as Pierce. Stephen Merchant is awesome as Caliban. Elizabeth Rodriguez is superb as Gabriela. Richard E. Grant is brilliant as Dr. Rice. Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal & Quincy Fouse are good as Will Munson, Kathryn Munson & Nate Munson, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Logan is a must watch for all fans of the X-Men franchise. Go watch this unique superhero film, that is unlike all the other movies in its genre. We'll miss you, Hugh!"
"DrGlober","10","1","4","3 March 2017"," This movie is the best super hero movie ever made it.
","Although the pacing does sag ever so slightly in places, Logan is by far the best X-Men film ever made and easily one of the best comic-book films ever made. Violent, emotional and expertly crafted with award- level performances - the best was definitely saved for last. If you are an X Men fan, more importantly a Wolverine maniac, this will definitely delight you, even more make it memorable to see the best of the series go off on a winning note."

"Tehmeh","6","1","4","3 March 2017"," Almost great, but falters in the end.
","I like James Mangold as a director. He's made some very fine movies. I even liked 2/3 of the last Wolverine movie he directed. I liked this one too, but I'm sad to say that just like ""The Wolverine"", this movie lost me in the end. I was a little disappointed when it was over, which is a shame, because otherwise ""Logan"" is just great. Mangold made a movie for adults, so I will judge it as such.<br/><br/>""Logan"" feels driven. The script seems solid, direction as well, and the actors are doing a great job. Cinematography is excellent. This feels and looks like a real movie, not a calculated studio product. Humor isn't forced, themes are handled with taste, the serious vibe of this movie feels natural. Marco Beltrami's music is beautiful and atmospheric. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen are all excellent. I can't say enough about these three, they were so good. Hugh gave it his all, Sir Patrick Stewart brought tons of heart into the movie and Dafne Keen, despite being a child actor, was excellent in what she did. Acting-wise, admirable.<br/><br/>""Logan"" is almost like a road movie. It's very confined, nothing is too much of a spectacle. Even when some really brutal violence kicks in every now and then, it seems to fit. Everything supports the narrative and the tone. It trusts the audience to understand the language of grown-up movies, and there's even real heart to it. It's like the Wolverine movie that I always wanted. For the first 90+ minutes, that is.<br/><br/>And then...then something happens. I don't know what. Did the writers just not know how to end the movie, or did they not have time? Did Mangold drop the ball? Because the narrative starts to stutter. Out of nowhere, we get some amateur-level storytelling, bad plot devices and clunky transitions. Themes that were handled so well until now, are now almost hammered to your head. This movie stopped being smart and surprising, and started to be a little more clichéd, obvious and pandering.<br/><br/>At the same time we're introduced to a bunch of new characters that I could not care less about. It wasn't an intimate movie anymore. The tone and pacing seemed to suffer, and the last battle became a schlock-fest, along with a few campy shots of Hugh Jackman running like an ape and roaring like it's a B-movie. What was first a great and impressive Wolverine movie, was now a mediocre X-men movie, unsure of itself and desperate to impress. The whole situation is suddenly cartoony, almost turning our main characters into cartoons as well. What happened? It went so well for so long, it was perfect. I was so invested, but suddenly I couldn't feel anything anymore - even when the seemingly emotional (and admittedly good) ending hit the screen. That's when I should have cared the most. That's the worst of this movie's sins: Many things that made this movie great were pushed to the side in the end. It didn't stick to its guns all the way, which is a bit of a shame. It didn't trust itself (or the audience) enough. <br/><br/>Did the last 30 minutes ruin this movie? No. The last part of the film isn't inexcusable crap in itself. It makes sense story-wise, and most of my problems with it come from strictly comparing it to the amazing first 90 minutes. It's just so disheartening for me to not be able to love ""Logan"" until the very end. I wanted to have that great ending, I wanted to be invested all the way. I didn't and I couldn't, but I'm hoping that after seeing this movie again I can be more at peace with it.<br/><br/>That said, this is still a quality movie. ""Logan"" is a charmingly simple film. It's focused on characters instead of complicated stories. It's beautifully made, violent, often heartfelt, even naturally funny at times. It's a genuinely good Wolverine movie with elements that we haven't seen before. It's not interested in setting up other movies, and as much as I disliked the change of tone and quality in the end, this one actually has an ending - which is a plus. It is a movie of its own, not a cynical advertisement for other movies.<br/><br/>To summarize: ""Logan"" is a great, well-crafted movie full of character, structure and intimacy until it decides to be something else just when it's supposed to count. What it does right, it does absolutely right and what it does wrong, feels worse than it is because of the things that it got right. It's well worth seeing and arguably a lot better than the last Wolverine movie, but it could have been a great movie through and through. In the end, it's ""just"" a good movie, which is nothing to scoff at. It's not ""the best superhero movie out there"", which is what some critics are saying. Not even the best X-men movie - that title still belongs to the amazingly solid X2. ""Logan"" came very close, but Mangold and his writers (who all did a really good job otherwise) just couldn't pull off that last mile. Worthy effort in any case, easily succeeding in many things that are quite hard to accomplish. For those of you looking to be more invested in characters and confined little stories rather than ensemble pieces with world-ending threats, ""Logan"" will be a very special treat. I will add this one to my blu-ray collection.<br/><br/>Thank you, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, it was nice having you in these movies. You both went out on a high note. I have a feeling that I'll be seeing plenty of Dafne Keen after this, so no need for goodbyes on her part yet."
"paulinoemerson","10","1","4","3 March 2017"," As usual, best ever storyline among the MCU movies
","For me, Wolverine and Xmen movies have the best story versus the Avengers hero movies and other MCU movies, with some exceptions (i.e. Ant Man). Maybe I can be a bit bias because my favorite hero of all time is Wolverine. But as you can see, Wolverine movies are inferior in terms of sci-fi action as compared to Avengers movies, because Wolverine movies take pride from its storyline. Yes, I agree that the whole Wolverine timeline can be really confusing but that is because they try to fit in storyline from the Xmen movies. <br/><br/>On this movie, you can see less action as compared to other Wolverine movies but you are in for a ride on the action scenes, the drama and some humor."
"awaisee50","8","1","4","3 March 2017"," The Logan Movie Wolverine Deserves
","Wolverine has always been a fan favourite. You don't get three solo movies if you're not. But despite his hallowed status—and despite Hugh Jackman's dedication to the character—Wolvy always felt like the sole grown-up stuck on Xavier's Island of Misfit Heroes. He's a lone wolf, not a wide-eyed mutant struggling with outsider status. As Old Man Logan in Logan, he finally gets to be the salty dog everyone always suspected he was.<br/><br/>Of course, just because Logan shows Wolverine in all his grizzled glory doesn't mean he stays free of other mutants' drama. This time, it's daddy issues. By 2029, Logan has sequestered himself away in Mexico, driving a limo to make money while taking care of an ailing, seizure-prone Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). He'd happily stay off the grid forever (he's saving up for a boat), but soon a young girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) shows up wielding some very familiar- looking adamantium claws. She, along with scores of other children, were created by a nefarious research firm to be child soldiers. They escaped, and are heading to Canada to seek—but Laura got separated from her brood and is being tracked by the doctor who made her. She needs Logan's help.<br/><br/>This being a Wolverine movie, our hero initially wants no part of it. He's out of the X-game, and sees no obligation to assist. Then he sees that Laura's medical files have his name, ""James Howlett,"" emblazoned on them. Predictably, his cold, dead heart grows 10 times. Logan, Professor X, and their new charge road trip north (in this version of 2029, President Trump apparently never followed through with that whole wall thing), leaving a trail of carnage behind them."

","Seventeen years ago we saw Logan for the first time, and this week we went to the movies to see him for the last time! Yes my friends, the saga of the most intense mutant has come to an end! Hugh Jackman says goodbye in the best way possible, in an amazing movie! So human and so cruel! Nothing more fair with a super hero so violent, savage and indestructible! BUT THE TIME HAS COME! The movie makes you feel pity, sadness and cherish all at the same time. Every scene was hand painted by the director James Mangold. If you don't like blood or violence, I recommend you to leave your kids at home. The movie is R rated! Wolverine shows no mercy at all in his last days. The lesson that stays is: you'll always need someone, and never try alone. Logan always was a lonely wolf, and learned the worst way that it took him nowhere! An extra for the Professor Charles Xavier, always great in his appearances, assumes a good role during the plot. It was a sad movie, we will miss it a lot! Worth every second and yes, you'll love every violent stroke of the most violent mutant of the big screen!"
"sportsnut-66935","9","1","4","3 March 2017"," The Unleashed Wolverine I've Been Waiting For
","This movie is great! Logan is an ultra-violent story about age, purpose and hope. This movie excels with it's ability to produce R level bloody, brutal violence. Seeing Wolverine unleash on Reavers is the Wolverine moment I've been waiting for my whole life. Many comparisons have been made to Nolan's The Dark Knight, which shouldn't because that movie is as close to a perfect movie as you can get, and this movie is not perfect. In terms of story, Logan centers on an aging Logan, who is a limo driver, and takes care of an exceptionally vulnerable Charles Xavier, and does so with the help of Caliban. Logan is approached by a woman and a girl, and the girl is being hunted by a group called the Reavers and their leader Pierce (Boyd Holbrook). The story is really a cat and mouse game as Logan is not longer the spry, destructive fighter he once was. However, that's where Laura (Dafne Keen) comes in. She is everything Wolverine is and more. The story lacks a little in substance as some filler scenes are blatantly obvious, but there is humor to lighten up the dark tone. Now we come to the acting. By far the best overall performance by Hugh Jackman. Sir Patrick Stewart delivers a side to Charles Xavier we've never seen. Holbrook is good, but his character is extremely uninteresting and underdeveloped which is my biggest complaint about the movie. I don't know whether to hate him, or just not care about him. Keen is a welcome addition to the cast, and exemplifies the show don't tell aspect of acting. She will probably be a star in the near future. Back to Jackman though. His final outing is his best as the story adds a layer of vulnerability and just overall fatigue to a character that has been through hell his whole life. In past movies, I've felt the character of Wolverine wasn't very complex, but that all changed with this movie. The acting saves the weak story. The action is the greatest I've ever seen in a superhero movie. This movie isn't about heroes in spandex fighting aliens or robots, but is a gritty realistic take, with very little CGI. It's about a person who wants to die, but suffers through life anyway and will protect those he cares about with everything he has. It's brutal and bloody, and intense and the duo of Wolverine and Laura is an unbeatable fighting pair. Overall, I had to wait a while to give this movie a rating because of my exceedingly high expectations going in. It lived up to most of them, but failed on a few others. Overall, I was very pleased and this movie is the best, however it is not comparable to the rest of the X-Men movies due to it's major differences. X-Men Days of Future Past is still the best of the series. 9/10"
"oazam","9","1","4","3 March 2017"," A perfect way to end the journey of Wolverine.
","The trailer was fantastic which made me decide to do advanced bookings for this film on the first day. Everything you need to know about Wolverine's last stand is all in this film. <br/><br/>So the story focuses on Logan ailing the care of Professor X near the border of Mexico. Things go peaceful but then unexpected mutants suddenly appear and try to intervene in Logan's life. So with the help of an 11 year old with the same instincts of Logan, they try to save the world. <br/><br/>Consider this as a plot with no spoilers because if you're expecting a full plot, Wikipedia has everything you need to know because revealing the story will make me an asshole to Hollywood. <br/><br/>The acting was scintillating and phenomenal. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman owns every scene in the movie and he got into his character really well. He was so balanced and nuanced and his claw-fighting did so much justice to the movie. <br/><br/>Patrick Stewart was great as always and you know how good he is when he plays Professor X or normally known as Charles Xavier. <br/><br/>Dafne Keen was also good in his role and she managed to give a good role as a mutant.<br/><br/>The VFX, set design, and action were all brilliant. These 3 elements will be remembered for Hugh Jackman's action choreography. Can anyone give some training to Josh Trank because I was so stressed by Fantastic Four reboot.<br/><br/>The background score was also amazing and you can see how much work has been done.<br/><br/>Overall, this is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen and after this and I am so gonna miss Hugh Jackman. Which is why this is an IMAX worth watching movie. Perfect weekend to waste 15 dollars. For Bollywood viewers, stay away from Commando 2."

","This movie has created a lot of hype due to the fact that it is last movie of Hugh Jackmen as wolverine and he will no longer portray that role in the future, so being a concluding chapter to his 17 year long service at this role everyone is eager to watch this movie.Me being a beloved fan of the x-men franchise was excited to see this movie and how Jackmen's last go as wolverine would look like.<br/><br/>The initial reviews when the movie released were very positive and some even compared it to great films such as Dark knight, but i have to say that this movie can't be compared to any other movie,it is directed and presented in an innovative and unique way.Logan has elements of western,family drama,action...put together in it to make it refreshing to the viewers.Performances of all the actors were very good,Jackman and Stewart were impressive.When it comes to special effects this movie didn't had much so those who expecting it would be disappointed, most of the actions were very violent but eye catching and thrilling.The most entertaining one for me was when Charles was forced to use his power in one scene to save himself and a character, it was a heart pounding scene.<br/><br/>In conclusion do not expect to see another Dark knight instead hope to watch a variety movie with some good action and sentiments, you will be gratified."

","If you are die hard Logan fan then, this movie is made for you. This the the third standalone movie on wolverine. The movie dates forward in the year 2029 where Logan earns his living by fair means. The movie has a study pace filled with brutality and abusive language, it can be taken as one of the most brutal movie so far in the X-Men series. Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart) suffers from a traumatic Neuron disease at the supporting front. And adds stars to his performance every time he appears on screen(Not to forget he lost 21 pounds for his role) Various other characters can also be spotted along with the lead star and Laura(Dafne Keen) grabs all the attention towards her, she is accomplished by her nurse who is on her way to Eden(the safe house of mutants). She make a deal with Logan(Hugh Jackman) to take her and Laura with him to Eden which situated in North Dakota. So Logan, Charles and Laura sets on their way to Eden with a lot of complications on their way, Will they make it there? For that go and watch Logan."

"thegreathealer","9","1","4","3 March 2017"," Logan's last stand is first X-Men masterpiece
","X-Men fans - not to mention Hugh Jackman himself - finally get the Wolverine film they deserve in this brutal, bloody and brilliant last hurrah for the adamantine-clawed anti-hero. It's 2029, and a physically and spiritually burnt-out Logan is chauffeuring anything from funerals to hen nights, raising enough cash to get the drugs required by former mentor and head of the X-Men school, Charles Xavier, whose dementia now threatens to turn his Cerebro-enhanced noggin into a weapon of mass destruction. With mutants all but extinct - one survivor being Stephen Merchant's albino sun-shirker, who tends to the Professor while Logan earns his doe - the desperate pleading of a Mexican nurse convinces the last remaining X-Man to abandon his descent into booze and self- pity. His quarry is a young girl, short on speech but high (make that VERY high) on the kind of special skill set that Logan should recognise...especially when it's revealed that she is the result of a secret-ops attempt to turn mutants into soldiers at the behest of the kind of crazy, ruthless Doctor (Richard E Grant, in typical oily Brit persona) that these films demand. Spurred as much by the suggestion the girl may in fact be his daughter, Logan flees with the Professor and his new- found charge in harness, while a mobilised army of ruthless mercenaries chase them from Mexico to Las Vegas and beyond, all the time just one step behind this ersatz family of mutant misfits. Tagged as being the last appearance (of nine) by Jackman in his signature role, Logan delights in its influences from westerns to road movies, lending the film an anthemic and elegiac tone. While shorn of the PG-13 audience, finally the full brutality of a knife-wielding hero finds its visceral voice in a series of bone-crunching, head-splitting set pieces that more than warrant the film's 15 certificate. But amidst the carnage and the bouncing severed heads, Logan finds the level of character-led and emotive storytelling that the 'parent' X-films rarely delivered. You genuinely care about our protagonists, and when Logan's last stand finally comes (with far more satisfaction than the subtitled X-Men outing of 2006) it's both satisfying and strangely subdued, eschewing much of the CG-led grandstanding of previous entries for a more cathartic and affecting conclusion. This is grown-up, adult comic-book fare in every sense, and as a result provides both X-philes and followers of the nine (and counting) film series with its first, genuine masterpiece."

","Wow. This movie was amazing. I was expecting an adult MCU type film, but was pleasantly surprised to see a very good storyline. The film was thoughtful, and took you through a variety of emotions. For all MCU and DCU filmmakers, Logan is a study in how to make a great film."
"jacobsperling","10","1","5","3 April 2019"," Great plot, spectacular emotion, and brilliant acting.
","Previously, there were 3 films in the ""superhero"" genre that had been truly legendary: Christopher Nolan's genre-changing Dark Knight trilogy. That was it. Now, a case can be made for a fourth.
Logan is a brilliant film, brutally violent, but incredibly emotional, with an amazing plot and phenomenal acting-Hugh Jackman and Dafne Keen, in particular, are absolutely stellar, with great supporting performances by Boyd Holbrook, Richard E. Grant, and Patrick Stewart.
Now note: This is not a kids movie in any way. As mentioned, the movie is incredibly violent, also with frequent language. Also, there is a 2-second shot of a woman's front, which leads to this complaint: Why do movies have to stick in incredibly irrelevant inappropriate scenes which add nothing to the movie, but will turn some viewers away? There is a scene where a drunken woman briefly pulls down her gown, revealing her front, to shock the driver-the scene is so irrelevant to the movie, it's incredible-so why put it in? Is there no concept of basic morality anymore? Violence and language could be called mature, sex and nudity is just inappropriate.
However, this remains a phenomenal film. Jackman is terrific in one of his best performances to date, Keen is absolutely phenomenal (where was this girl?), Holbrook is brilliantly villanous, and Grant and Stewart play their roles well-particularly Grant; Stephen Merchant and Elizabeth Rodriguez have good supporting roles as well. The camera work (John Mathieson) and direction (James Mangold) are excellent, and the film's' emotional depth has not been seen in the superhero genre since the Dark Knight trilogy (which still contains the 3 best superhero films ever made, but Logan is terrific). All in all, a great movie, one of the finest films of 2017, and a terrific cinematic achievement."
"tabuno","7","1","5","11 January 2019"," An Ugly Violence, Emotionaless Superhero Movie
","7 March 2017. Unlike Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector, Hugh Jackman as Logan isn't very likable in this movie. He's stubborn to the point of being almost dumb about his decisions, allowing bad things to happen to him Even a wolf would probably be even more intelligent, resilient, and resourceful than this version of Wolverine. The relationships between characters are stilted and not very meaningful. The plot lurches from one engagement to the next more like a video game than a thoughtful and emotive storyline. Even the predictable ending seems strained by the inability of the team of characters to really offer up a sensible and more likely scenario for a climatic ending. Too many people are slaughtered in this movie that needlessly went to their deaths because of superhero ignorance or drunkenness. By the end of the movie the redeeming value that somehow was patched together at the end, isn't that convincing or memorable."

If you have engaging life, you accumulate tremendous amount of experience.

"cammymadden","7","1","5","14 April 2017"," Good film (as far as X-Men films go)
","The X-Men films are always difficult to review because the universe, the characters and usually the special effects in the films are all incredible and for the most part it is the storyline that fails to pack a punch. The Wolverine films have been part of this same flaw and while Origins was somewhat interesting, it was also incredibly underwhelming. Don't even get me started on how boring the second Wolverine film was...so here we are after a whole series of average films with what people view as the best so far. <br/><br/>I have to say I probably agree with them. Within the whole series, Days of Future Past is probably my favourite film but this would be a close second. For those of you who have stuck with the films over the years, you know going into this film that they're not at their best: the trailer alone shows both Charles and Logan having aged and it's always quite an emotional time when characters such as these begin to show their mortality. <br/><br/>I do however, have to disagree with many of the reviews on this site: first of all, as far as films go this is not ""the best film ever"" nor is it the best Marvel-based film either (obviously I mean from Marvel comments as we all know that the Marvel universe is somewhat divided due to legal issues). For me, almost all the MCU films trump the X-Men films by a long shot and this film is no exception. <br/><br/>I've still rated this film pretty highly (7) because it is definitely a good film. I just think all those aboard the hype train perhaps need to slow down a little, catch a breath, and come back to the reality where X-Men films are average or slightly above and will probably never succeed beyond that (with the exception of Deadpool)."

The first one is an impressive and fairly serious movie about family, aging and human nature. The other is your typical X-Men movie about mutants and the men who hate them. And, it earns its R-rating through copious amounts of violence and language.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (clearly wearing a hairpiece), Patrick Stewart (clearly not wearing a hairpiece) and 12-year old newcomer Dafne Keen are wonderful in the scenes they share. Unfortunately, the story bogs down and become formulaic the instant the bad guys show up. With a running time of 137 minutes, I found myself yawning more and more frequently as the movie continued.<br/><br/>While many movies use low-cost locations (Vancouver, Eastern Europe, etc.) to stand in for major urban areas, Logan is a bit unique in that it uses the New Orleans Harrah's as a stand-in for a casino somewhere in Oklahoma. (""Look, I know the film is set in LA, but for budgetary reasons, we insist you shoot in Paris and Rome."")<br/><br/>As X-Men movies go, it's one of the best, so see it now if you LOVE X-Men movies.

","After all this years an all of the X-men and wolverine movies we finally close the final chapter with the most human film of the entire franchise. Logan is not a movie about mutants, but more of a movie about people. The year is 2029 and almost all of the mutants are gone or in hiding, Logan has a regular job and takes care of the poor and old Charles Xavier( with help from a friend), they have almost of a father-son relationship in the movie, a ""son"" that's seeing his ""father"" sweep away from himself and reality due to his debilitated mental status. Some people might say that that this movie could have used some more of the characters that we were used to see but Jackman and Stewart steal the show together, and don't get me started with the little girl that gives a really good performance without saying almost anything. A final journey in which family, friendship and heroism are the main aspects of the last crusade of The Wolverine with a perfect yet sad ending which die-hard fans that have followed the franchise throughout the years will probably weep tears alongside the ending credits. A final word about Stephen Merchant an actor who is more used to comedy but still delivered a good performance. Over the years a lot of actors played superman, batman, spiderman, etc but only one defined the super hero role as Hugh Jackman has defined Wolverine or Logan if you wish, i do not envy the actor that eventually will try to follow the footsteps of the Australian actor."

Because of this, Logan's ability to heal is deteriorating. He is under the impression that because mutants have not been born for over 25 years, they are rapidly becoming extinct. No new mutants have surfaced since. Therefore, Logan feels that his duty right now is taking care of professor X(Patrick Stewart), who is also suffering from the serious disease neurodegeneration disease, which weakens his telepathic ability, and causes him to have seizures very frequently. They both find themselves having to fight against the dark elements that make it hard live with. I really liked the whole movie. There is nothing negative I can say about the film. I was impressed with the whole story line, character development, and especially; the acting period. The cast is filled with truly talented people, who have vivid imaginations.

"reallaplaine","8","1","5","25 March 2017"," Hugh Jackman's best performance yet
","Logan is the darkest of the X-Men/Wolverine series. Thankfully, it is more realistic than its predecessors. When Wolverine cuts loose there is blood and split heads and body parts flying all over the place - instead, as with earlier series, one barely saw a blood spatter. Logan is dark because Wolverine is battling himself in this rendering more so than ever. He doesn't want be what he has become and the battle that rages inside is killing him. Without spoiling the movie, a surprise player appears and she gives Logan a new injection of life and purpose. The fighting scenes are pretty thrilling, the twists are good, but for reasons which are inexplicable the creator decided to enter a short segment with a bunch of young kids living alone in the wilderness, happily surviving on hot dogs, smiling and all clean and normal, like, ""What!!?"" as if they had all the luxuries of life in the middle of nowhere!!! That one small segment was like injecting some scene from the Wizard of Oz into the middle of Platoon. Nonetheless, Logan delivers up. It is heartfelt and Jackman delivers his best performance ever. His acting is sincere, the pain he feels, you feel, and the conflict that roils through him to the last scene of the movie is indelible until the end. But please, no more Wizard of Oz - this is real life, lots of killing and blood... I mean, duh."

I always seem to be the man in the theater who has no idea what the in jokes are that the ""real fans"" are laughing at, or who the characters are, or what their back story is, or even anything about the ""universe"" the story is taking place in.<br/><br/>So I judge all the movies having known nothing going into them. What I liked about the X-Men series of films is that it didn't get too deeply into another universe and explained things (rather simply) so that someone like me could get up to speed. I've seen (I think) the entire film series to date and have enjoyed all but one of those films.<br/><br/>Logan is perhaps the best of them though. As a stand alone movie it's very good and I think anyone who has not seen the earlier films may be a little lost at first but it's easy to follow and to get into the characters and world. The action is great and I like that, unlike the other films, it goes a little darker. <br/><br/>The effects are masterful and as always I'm a big fan of Hugh Jackman. Patrick Stewart is also very good, as usual.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film for anyone.

"BillSims28","8","1","5","21 March 2017"," Satisfyingly Emotional Conclusion; Fresh Approach
","Logan, the swan song for Hugh Jackman's grizzled antihero, offers an utterly different variant on the over-saturated market of superhero films with an emotional and character-focused film that keeps mindless action to a minimum and offers some genuinely crafted character development. The film takes place after the apparent extinction of mutants in the future, with Logan and Charles Xavier hiding out from humanity and looking to retire on the USA-Mexico border, before being thrown a curve-ball in the shape of a girl who appears to offer hope for a future for mutant-kind.<br/><br/>Having played Wolverine in ten films now, the role fits Hugh Jackman like a glove. Things have changed now, with the Canadian veteran nearing the end and displaying clear weakness in both his fighting ability and healing powers. The same can be said for Patrick Stewart's Xavier, who, suffering from dementia, must receive around-the-clock care to prevent life-threatening seizures from taking hold. The emotional impact of Logan is where it excels, with the benefit of characters who have been developed over the course of several films allowing director James Mangold to explore the themes of death and the future without needing to set up the characters first. The film unfolds on the scale of a Shakespearean tragedy, and seeing Wolverine, once undisputed ruler of his kingdom, reduced to an old man struggling to keep himself going on, is an image clearly reminiscent of King Lear and Macbeth.<br/><br/>Logan also benefits from the relaxation of certification - rated 'R' in the US and '15' in the UK, this makes it a film which no longer needs to pander to the market, but instead is free to target itself at those who want to see something different. Mangold approaches this increased flexibility with glee, and the level of violence (not for the squeamish) and profanity (the first word spoken in the film is 'fuck') is noticeably different to the majority of similar superhero films. The more mature nature of the film allows for a more realistic feeling journey, where Wolverine's claws cause more violent and bloody damage than the toned-down violence of the previous PG-13 X-Men films.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as a film it is an effective and near-perfect way to phase out the X-Men and usher in a new era, without making it feel like a 'Where are they now?' round-up of all the X-Men of the last 17 years. It is a well-made film which loses its way in places and may not live up to its super-emotional billing but will certainly entertain fans of the franchise who will appreciate its handling of the characters, as well as hold up as an interesting and heart-rending fantasy drama. 78/100."

Starring: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen Director: James Mangold<br/><br/>In truth, there is only two reason I did not give this movie a perfect ten. The first has nothing to do with the movie itself, just some characters in it. They teased the Reavers at the end of the last X- Men movie but didn't go too far into it. I've always loved the idea of robotically enhanced people going up against the supers of the Marvelverse. Too bad they weren't able to add in the fact that Tony pretty much created their cybernetics.<br/><br/>The other thing that hurt the movie a bit was the fact they made the X-23 project a major project instead a single clone of Logan. They sort of did that with Origins, but it wasn't as bad here because of what happened at the end of the movie. And that is the reason I can forgive why they did it.<br/><br/>Everything else was just masterful. The acting. Making the locations look like they were traveling across the entire country. The blend of action and comedy and drama. The subtle Easter eggs in the movie. I caught a lot of them, but I don't thing I caught them. The way this movie set up the events for the future X-Men movies. Oh yeah, some may say that it didn't set anything up, but it is there. Just wait and see.<br/><br/>There are some people out there who are going to say there wasn't enough action in this movie compared the other X-Men movies. You know what I have to say about that? Go read the Old Man Logan comic and tell me if there was enough action or not. Granted, they couldn't follow the comic to a T, but they got it close enough. Maybe if Fox wasn't being such pricks when it comes to their biggest cash cow we would have been able to see the likes of Hulk, Red Skull, Dr. Doom, and Caliban (played brilliantly by Stephen Merchant) would have been replaced by Hawkeye. But we got what we got and I am not going to complain.<br/><br/>On the spectrum of the movies, I would put Logan as the second best out of the ten. Deadpool is included in that number.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Hugh Jackman has said the only way he would come back as Wolverine is if he is in an Avenger movie. I'm inclined to believe him on that account. He has run his course with the X-Men movies and this was his swan song. They can easily reintroduce Wolverine at a later time in the new version of the X-Men verse they are creating.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10"
"stilloopless1","Null","1","5","21 March 2017"," Going out on top
","If this is indeed Hugh Jackman's last foray into the X-Men world as the title character Wolverine (which I'm strongly hoping it isn't. There are still many questions/stories after seeing this film), what a way to go out!<br/><br/>As expected, Jackman and Stewart own the characters they've been given guardianship in a gritty, raw, tour de force. The chemistry between the two has always been superb, but the interplay here is next level. Relative new comer to acting Dafne Keen as Laura is a marvel (no pun intended) to behold and more than holds her own on screen with these two veteran actors. Stephen Merchant as Caliban brings his A- game. And Boyd Holbrook's Pierce wastes no time establishing himself as the bad guy you love to hate. An added treat is Eriq La Salle as the very humanizing Will Munson.<br/><br/>The film starts rather unexpectedly with an inappropriately lighthearted and deliciously twisted vignette from a ""guest"" character. Once the laughs are over, however, $#@! Gets dark and real, real fast. To say that Wolverine has seen better days is an understatement and it looks like his days of reluctant hero are behind him for good. Patrick Stewart's Professor X isn't faring much better either. Due to the actions of one former nurse, both men are tasked with one more stab at heroism. What follows is a two hour dark, violent, graphically violent, action packed, touching, humorous, raw, introspective, emotionally charged, dramatic ride of a life time. An entertaining and compelling family road trip from hell from start to finish.<br/><br/>Don't just take my word for it. Make your own road trip to the theater and see this 10 for yourself."

","When the trailer of Logan came out, it was very much clear that this movie will not only be creating records but also be a movie that will forever remain in everyone's heart.<br/><br/>We all love superhero movies, but something about Logan made us love it even more. Director James Mangold's unique approach made the movie a memorable experience. <br/><br/>Logan is a movie where you simply can't find anything wrong, whether it is the story, the performance or direction. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart were both amazing in this movie, as for Dafne Keen, she did such a terrific job that I was left with my mouth wide open! Same goes for the rest of the cast, all of them did a spectacular job!<br/><br/>As a comic book reader and a fan of Wolverine. This movie truly satisfied me.

","Logan was a brutal,somber and entertaining film which was different from another other X-Men movie and followed in the steps of The Dark Knight pretty well.<br/><br/>Lets talk about how the R-rating worked in this film,i would say for the character Wolverine it was awesome,the slashing(action),gore and language was better because of it but in the beginning it felt a bit forced as the first line of the movie is an ""F"" bomb,but after a few minutes everything felt natural.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple and very small which was good as the movie dives into deep character emotions & developments as Wolverine is old and bitter and i found it interesting how he was reluctant throughout the film and was only helping the girl in this movie to like get rid of her,but he isn't all bad as Logan cares for professor X & the their relationship is different from other films and for this dark and gritty movie it was well needed.<br/><br/>Although the tone of this movie was dark,gritty & somber there is some humor and fun to be had in this movie even if it's keep at a minimum,were humor was needed the movie did it nicely.The action was on point and i loved every bit of it,from chase scenes to the slashing the action was well done & glorious.Now the characters in this movie all had some purpose and meaning to their roles especially X-23(the little girl who is helped by Logan),she was awesome in her action sequences & her acting was good,Charles Xavier was also good in this movie as it shows him as an old,tired and beaten down Professor X who isn't as wise as he was and it was very interesting to see the growth or struggle of the character.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was amazing as always as Logan and his character is pitiful,bitter and you almost wonder if he is still a hero as he refuses to help people and doesn't are about anyone expect Charles and doesn't almost care about X-23 and the film portrays & explains why he is like that and it is very satisfying.<br/><br/>Another reason why this movie works and why it's so different in the superhero genre is that this film is sad and so emotional especially in the 1st and 3rd act of the movie,and since its a grounded movie the tone works nicely.What annoys me in this movie is the 2nd act whereby the film becomes a bit boring & since it was a more grounded movie it focus on some real world themes which sometimes worked and sometimes didn't & you start to notice that the movie is too long and some scenes that could have been cut out,but other than that the movie is fine.<br/><br/>Logan was a fascinating movie full of great action,emotion and depth,this was the Wolverine movie that makes a fitting end to Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as Logan."

"dan697","6","1","5","15 March 2017"," The best film in the X-Men franchise
","Whilst watching 'Logan' it doesn't take long to realise it this isn't an ordinary superhero film. Beyond the fight scenes, the blood, and the claws there's a solid bed of realistic and compelling human drama. In fact, in many ways the film can be considered a character or family drama given how much it focuses on the pain of its modest cast. Stripping the film to its bare bones, we have a washed-up and irrelevant anti-hero, that now drives a limo as a means of earning money, who looks after his senile 'father' with a degenerative brain condition. He is later forced to take care of a daughter that, until recently, he didn't know existed. This narrative set-up sounds like a painful but quirky indie film – along the lines of 'Little Miss Sunshine'. But these character dynamics aren't a secondary part of the movie, on the contrary, they're under the spotlight and they drive the film forward. It's probably for this reason that they went with the title 'Logan' rather than mimicking the older titles ('X-Men Origins: Wolverine' and 'The Wolverine') – because it's effectively a story about human drama. This is the primary reason why 'Logan' is so impressive.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the central character, Logan (a.k.a James Howlett, a.k.a Wolverine), is nothing short of fantastic. We're used to seeing Captain America and Batman with their chests puffed out and fists clenched but when we see Logan we see a graying and bespectacled man, who walks with a limp and wears glasses. The film brings us up to speed with the state he's in with an brilliantly executed opening scene where Logan is forced to use his claws to deal with some gangsters. Even though we get to see him in action, it's evident that he's not the animal he used to be; his claws don't full retract all the way and his regenerative powers are much slower than before. What we understand from this is that, after being portrayed as immortal in multiple films, Logan now seems vulnerable and frail. On top of this, he's also shown constantly swigging bottles of booze and even carries an adamantium bullet with him as he contemplates suicide. He's a has-been celebrity that's now totally irrelevant – a truly tragic portrait of a once great superhero.<br/><br/>This thorough revision of Logan as a character is certainly a fresh and welcome change to the usual superhero formula. Perhaps we've already reached the point where superhero films must do something drastically against the grain in order to stand out because, as fun and spectacular as they are, the MCU films can be ultimately considered quite invariable. Whereas, if we look at the box-office success and positive reception of 'Deadpool' and take into account its R-Rating and its uniquely different and fourth-wall-breaking protagonist it's clear that different is good. Although, 'Suicide Squad' can be said to have tried to the same thing and failed by having super-villains as protagonists so I guess the makeshift conclusion can be; make a different superhero movie to be innovative, but make sure it's still good.<br/><br/>Going into the film I was extremely nervous about the man in the director's chair, James Mangold, because of how much I hated 'The Wolverine' – it was *shit*. I was pleasantly surprised to see 'Logan' take a very different path to 'The Wolverine' although there were still some 'classic' X-Men movie moments – Logan fighting with a younger, stronger version of himself, for instance. Praise is also due to Hugh Jackman because his alleged final appearance as the Canadian super-hero may just be his best – mainly because he's not only required to growl and scream but also *act*. It is sad to see Jackman leave a role which he has truly made his own over 17 years but I'm certain this is not the last we'll see of Wolverine. There have been calls from fans for Tom Hardy to adopt the role but who knows what will happen. Perhaps the X-Men rights will be purchased by the MCU and a whole new generation of X-Men will be created<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was similarly solid; Patrick Stewart is, as always, class as the wilting Professor X and newcomer Dafne Keen is surprisingly great as the young Laura – a character with a strangely large amount of similarities to Eleven from 'Stranger Things'. Fans of 'Narcos' will be glad to hear that a beefed up Boyd Holbrook (a.k.a. Agent Murphy) is delightfully villainous as Pierce.<br/><br/>One thing that has puzzled me about the film is how it fits into the larger X-Men cinematic universe – totally separate to the Iron-Man and Captain America universe, of course. There are now multiple timelines at play here after the event of 'Days of Future Past' but, even then, didn't Professor X die in 'X-Men: The Last Stand'? I'm sure there's an easy answer to this seemingly gaping plot-hole but the films do risk becoming a bit muddled and confusing. Multiple timelines are ubiquitous in the comics but comic book readers are more dedicated than the average moviegoer.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is raw, it's different and refreshing and this is all affirmed by the ending – I was praying that it wouldn't end the same way as 'Batman vs. Superman'. I'm not a huge fan of the X-Men franchise but this is without a doubt my favourite. Maybe the best piece of praise I can give the film is that even if you completely removed the superhero aspect, you would still be left a great movie.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.9/10<br/><br/>I have a bunch of other film and music reviews up here that you can check out: https://somespiltmilk.wordpress.com/"

","spoilers ahead <br/><br/>Logan - wow - a fresh take on what i think they should have done with all of marvel all along. This was a gritty dark version of logan. He is older he isn't healing great anymore and he is looking after an old charles xavier who has seizures that can kill people. (its mentioned that he accidentally killed some of the xmen) <br/><br/>this is gory and action packed, in fact one of the best fights happens in the first 5 mins when for the first time in any marvel film related to xmen limbs went flying, people were stabbed in the head and generally messed up. <br/><br/>The films moves quickly into the charles and logan relationship with Logan struggling to look after charles as he is so powerful. None the less some women keeps asking Logan for help to get her and some young gir across the border to some safe haven for young mutants. (It seems that mutants have become mostly extinct in this story) Logan reluctantly gets roped into helping this young lady. <br/><br/>The government are chasing her down and are going to kill her but logan helps her escape on multiple occasions. Eventually it is revealed that the girl is a clone of logan and is techinaaclly his biological daughter. However a clone of logan has also been made and being that old man logan doesn't heal or fight like he used to the new wolverine throws him about with ease and eventually kills xavier.<br/><br/>After escaping and burring xavier the young mutant meets other young mutants who she intends to escape across the border with. Logan lets her go but sees that there bad guys are in pursuit and he ends up taking some rage potion and this is one of the best moments of the film seeoing him kill multiple people in the woods until eventually he has his show down with the cloned wolverine. This time logan looses he gets impaled by a tree and stabbed multiple times and its only when our young girl shoots the bad wolverine with a aliminuem bullet and kills him that logan gets a chance to say goodbye to his daughter before dying from his wounds. <br/><br/>All in all this way a great film it was emotional it was violent it was action packed and again ill say marvel should have done this years ago. It was nice to see Hugh Jackman go out on a bang as his previous wolverine films wasn't very good. Old man Logan an easy 9 out of 10 for me."
"dave118118","9","1","5","14 March 2017"," heartfelt sentimentality and severed head splatter
","Logan - 9/10 The third and final solo Wolverine film in the X-Men franchise. Unlike all of the other films in this franchise, this is inspired not so much by comic books or other Marvel films, but by the likes of Little Miss Sunshine and The Wrestler. Director James Mangold has opted for a much more sombre tone giving the film a weighty realism which lends itself very well to the on screen dramas that unfold.<br/><br/>Much like the finale of a beloved long running TV series, this is a meticulously planned out story that ensures Hugh Jackman gets to give Logan the swansong he deserves. The approval of an R rating by the studio meant that the filmmakers no longer had a vested interest that this film would play with children. Not only does this mean we're finally getting to see Wolverine in a gratuitous, ultra-violent, no holds barred manner, but also allows the films to tackle some tougher themes.<br/><br/>The Wrestler is frequently cited as a big inspiration for this film and whilst it's not quite as drenched in melancholy and poignancy, it certainly follows a lot of the same beats. Jackman and Rourke both portraying aging, lethargic men who lack a sense of purpose in life.<br/><br/>It's also great to finally see a comic book film which has ambiguity and unexplained plot points. At points it alludes to certain past events but doesn't feel the need to hold the audiences hand and show everything in a condescending way.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to seeing Merchant but was left a little disappointed. He essentially just plays himself where I'd hoped this might have been a bit of a breakthrough role for him.<br/><br/>In general, the performances across the board are incredible. Stewart and Jackman find new depths to their characters almost 10 films in which is testament to their dedication to the role. Dafne Keen is all bite and no bark as the muted infant mutant.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best X-Men films which has both heartfelt sentimentality and severed head splatter in equal measure. Hopefully a bit of financial success here will pave way to seeing more R rated blockbusters being made. This film has benefited from the rating so much it has to be seen as a bit of a game changer."

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","1","5","12 March 2017"," The film that singlehandedly redeems the X-Men film canon of its past mistakes.
","Logan doesn't need ridiculous or contrived 'end of the world' scenarios to make its story worth a damn; it's centered on James Logan and Charles Xavier and their everyday struggle in 2029 America. James Mangold's film plays like a western-influenced superhero film that also takes pages from 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road (with one of the earlier action scenes at least) and takes the X-Men franchise to the next (and penultimate) level.<br/><br/>Speaking of the director again, Mangold will definitely be a strongly sought-after talent thanks to this brutal and touching gem of a movie; not to mention that he made Wolverine spectacular again. Logan was great in X-Men: Day of Future Past, and he's still got the goods here; only this time around the story is EVEN BETTER! Logan has basically made it to the end of the road: he's a man who's experienced a life of torment and running away from his problems. Now he just wants to help Charles have a better life (with what time Professor X actually has left). However, all of those plans change when Logan discovers a new mutant child named Laura, whom he involuntarily has to protect. And the film then becomes a chase of cat and mouse: with Logan, Charles and Laura having to stay one step ahead of cybernetic-antagonist Donald Pierce.<br/><br/>Logan is a superhero-western film hybrid that also has a good dose of post-apocalyptic fiction influencing its bold and heartfelt story all the way. I can't recommend this film enough. For those of you who love comic films and cowboy movies, this absolutely is THE film for you to see.<br/><br/>Logan: a title that perfectly compliments one of the most self-contained, and director-driven comic book movies to date."

","Pros: -Clear vision for the film, with a defined aesthetic and characterisations. None of that mess that so marked Apocalypse and Origins: Wolverine as ""mediocre"" and ""a flaming train wreck"" respectively -More mutant-ness than I had anticipated. -Superb acting from Dafne; mostly expressing herself through subtle emotional facial expressions. Really wouldn't expect that much from a child actress but she's superb. -Genuine emotional weight.<br/><br/>Cons: -Reavers were on a scale from underwhelming to utterly useless. -Some action scenes were a bit too shaky-cam for my tastes.<br/><br/>Afterthought: Whoever tells you this has a lot in common with Old Man Logan has either never read it (maybe they looked at the pictures?) or not seen this film. Old Man Logan is a slightly camp romp across the US to kill some inbred Hulk children with a wisecracking Hawkeye driving Spiderman's old ""Spider-Car""; this is a weighty, serious, very adult, emotional story crafted around some well acted characters against a back drop of decay and despair. They aren't remotely similar in tone, and anyone that says otherwise is talking out their rears."
"triplex376","8","1","5","11 March 2017"," We always knew it should end this way.......
","Wolverine films have always troubled me in the past.<br/><br/>They have only got through carried by the characters popularity and the huge talent of Hugh Jackman. It's easy to forget that 17 years ago it was mooted that he had been miscast in X-men as Wolverine but he quickly won audience members around and all credit to him he has made the part his own despite the variable quality of the solo material and an unbalanced push the character got through the x-men franchise.<br/><br/>The Origin's outing had material to make a great movie but failed through stupid use of that material and nearly killed off Deadpool to boot. Now Deadpool has made a Billion Dollars! Studio Interference? The Wolverine was jaw dropping for the first 30 minutes really good for the rest of the film and then Origins style stupidity kicked in again and the resolution was idiotic - Studio interference not just suspected but a definite in this instance. Now we have Logan and has the Studio learned its lesson? Unbelievably yes and the result is a very good film that clearly all parties wanted to make.<br/><br/>Stylistically the movie gets a lot from westerns and the often referred to in the press junket 'Shane' moments. It is a road movie and the theme's of Family and Legacy permeate and how you cannot escape your past. Standout for me was Stephen Merchant as Caliban who added a contrast to the gruff Wolverine and who's presence fleshed out the situation they were in. Patrick Stewart played a senile and cantankerous Prof. X well but overplayed the R-Rating, you will see what I mean. Boyd Holbrook was good as he always is but was too 'Villain by numbers'. Richard E. Grant was excellent but had little to do unfortunately. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, as is the case over the last 17 years, has now made the part of Wolverine impossible to recast for at least a number of years and even then not without creative distinguishing changes. That is how outstanding he was in this film portraying a decline of an erstwhile almost invulnerable hero with style and, as the part required, an indignity. We shall not go gently.........<br/><br/>8/10 for me but they should have added the following: The Westchester Incident, Sabretooth (Liev Schrieber), Whatever happened to Magneto would have provided emotional material for Stewart. Richard E Grant playing a Composite of his own character plus the material used for Holbrook (And Holbrook not in it!).<br/><br/>If the character arc was taken to it's logical conclusion then we always did know it would end this way. Logan is a fitting conclusion to Hugh Jackman's involvement with the character.

"sorfildor","7","1","5","10 March 2017"," A satisfying character-driven drama
","I have a very passing interest in comic book and superhero movies but nevertheless found this to be an enjoyable film. Hugh Jackman plays the morose and dejected Logan alongside Patrick Stewart's portrayal of a moribund Xavier, deteriorating from Alzheimer's and suffering telekinetic seizures which have rather disastrous consequences for those around him. The character of Laura is introduced a short while into the film, played competently (in some places overdone) by Dafne Keen and what follows is a road trip-esque drama in which we see them bond through strife.<br/><br/>Some parallels can be drawn between Logan and the Dark Knight series in terms of the overall tone of the movie. However, Logan is filled with some 'comedic' parts typical of your Hollywood production which detached me slightly from the overall grittiness and darkness of atmosphere the movie holds – for the most part - rather gracefully. Specifically, there is a scene in which Xavier is admonished by Logan for not taking medications to suppress his seizures, and responds by sticking his tongue out like a child (with accompanying noise). You could argue Xavier's degenerative disease could go some ways to explain his rather bizarre reaction and general eccentric behaviour in the film, but I would have preferred a more dark and pitiable depiction, like a vulnerable man in terminal decline as the stress from being relentlessly pursued takes its toll. Instead, we see his spirits lifted as they befriend a family on their journey before he is abruptly killed by a wolverine clone. Despite this, Patrick Stewart's acting is sublime as you would expect from the veteran, showing the haggard professor desperately clinging on to the hope he finds in Laura, and the effect she has on Logan.<br/><br/>The sentimental moments are very poignant and help to humanise wolverine, contrasting the excellent fight scenes where we see him graphically – and in many cases, reluctantly - end several waves of mercenary types. Here he is untethered by a previously restrictive film board rating; we finally see blood in a Wolverine movie, along with decapitations and other brutal executions. None of it feels gratuitous or simply there for fan service, apart from the questionable and uncharacteristic overuse of the F-word by Xavier.<br/><br/>After over a century spent in conflict with others, Wolverine is tired and his body is unable to cope and regenerate from the trauma as well as it could do before. However, he isn't just physically damaged; the movie plays with more sombre themes such as when Caliban provokes Logan early in the film on his adamantium bullet.<br/><br/>I much prefer movies in which the story focuses on individual conflict rather than grand scale destruction. It was a joy to see Logan and a great send-off for the character of Wolverine, feeling like a satisfying end of an era for a series which has produced movies of variable quality."
"chilichilipepper","8","1","5","10 March 2017"," An Honest Review
","Just got back from watching Logan, and well was a little let down. let me go through some pro's and cons.<br/><br/>-Pros Realistically depicted Alzheimer's. I think this is the first film that actually researched Alzheimer's and instead of the old movie trope of ""Old person thinks it's 1970"", they really did nail down what living with an Alzheimer's patient is like. (4th generation alzheimer's patient here, I know that disease too well)<br/><br/>An amazing storyline that really investigates what it would probably be like to be a superhuman that is getting old and their powers are failing them. They treat the powers in the movie as just a part of the mutant's body rather than a mystical mutation. It is heartbreaking to watch our hero's mutant conditions be kind of like another feature of growing old (such as heart conditions or failing organs). It makes the movie extremely realistic even though we are talking fake mutants.<br/><br/>More on that, it is a movie about mutants that feels real, again as if their super powers aren't just a mutation, but a mutation that just like any body organ will begin to fail as one gets older<br/><br/>The acting was UNBELIEVABLE. If you didn't tear up at some of the scenes, you probably have no soul. Also the acting made these characters feel real. They could be your grandparents or old uncle or really I think everyone can relate to watching someone deteoriate as age takes away their lives.<br/><br/>The direction was also amazing along with the script. This is not a superhero movie at all, this is an examination of life, love, pain, triumph, and mortality.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>Really not that many. My main complaint was that the second act kind of was too long and slow paced. I mean I went out and had a cigarette, came back and asked my sister what I missed and she basically said ""Nothing"". The movie could have used much better editing because really, there was a good 20-30 minutes of scenes that did nothing but enhance the examination of life theme. However by the time we got to those scenes, it was pretty much fully established. Better editing (maybe to get it down to 2 hours instead of 2:20, would have tighened up the movie and made the script pop out more.<br/><br/>Some of the characters had barely any character development outside of Logan's, Xavier's, and mini Logan. Quite often, it seemed like they just introduced characters that appeared to be important only to just kill them 5 min later. Plus, a lot of the villains backstories / development were rushed and disconnected from the film. At times, it almost felt like there was more to these characters that ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>However, this is a movie that will be crippled by it's release time (right after the Oscars) because it IS AN Oscar caliber movie. But history proves that come next years Oscars, this will be a forgotten movie. And it shouldn't. It should be nominated for at least a best supporting actor with Stewart, and one for the actress that played Laura, along with make-up / cinematogroph / best original script (or adapted script really), and even maybe best actor for Jackman.<br/><br/>In short TLDR, this is a fantastic movie that really isn't a ""superhero"" movie. It completely stands out (similar to The Dark Knight as far as quality goes), but also stands out as a grim, poignant look at becoming older and standing by helpless as your body begins to fall apart.<br/><br/>8/10 although really I'd rate it closer to a 7.5/10 due to some of the pacing issues and lack of development of the minor characters."

Nothing is forced, and everything looks natural, which is a breath of fresh air and I was very happy with her. I believe this film will be very well received by the fans. Nevertheless, the end particularly moved me. It is perfect, sincere enough and without artifice. Between the western style, the road movie and the adaptation of the comic, the film never loses the thread of its history and has its own identity, which is very rare these days. Logan remains an excellent film and is like a little piece of art or jewel that we don't that see that much Thanks Hugh Jackman for 17 years of Wolverine."
"elale-573-971300","10","1","5","9 March 2017"," I really related to Logan being the family caregiver
","Unexpectedly human in its portrayal of disability and caregiving, this movie had everything I wanted as a Wolverine fan and even gave me a new way to relate to Logan, as a family caregiver dealing with his own physical problems related to aging. <br/><br/>Here comes the spoiler. Obviously the big thing that wasn't in the trailer is that this is Wolverine Vs. Dark Wolverine. It was an excellent addition to the story, because after all, who is the most perfect opponent for Wolverine but someone just like him, but younger, stronger, and crazier? <br/><br/>Of course, Lara is also just like him but younger and crazier, only she's a cute kid, so... yeah, I predict the next movie in the Wolverine franchise will be Teen Lady Wolverine. Speaking of teens, it's kinda too bad that the level of violence in this movie made it an R, because it seemed like the plot was designed to give kids someone to identify with in Lara, and that her story was about the fantasy of the perfect father. So many children don't know their dad, and they imagine if they found him he'd always have their back. But then many of them do find their father and discover he's emotionally unavailable. Those two characteristics are big parts of how Logan and Lara relate in this movie. <br/><br/>The action in this movie was great, and the plot had just enough twists, and dealt with some real life issues. Having a major character who speaks Spanish and whose goal is to cross an international border brought up real world political questions, but thankfully, the movie didn't try to answer them, but stuck to being an action movie. <br/><br/>Flawless. See it."
"Alondro","8","1","5","9 March 2017"," It's good... but a bit confusing...
","It's a very good stand-alone film, or if linked to the generally darker tone of the other Wolverine films. The only issue is that it doesn't mesh with the rest of the X-Men timelines, but it doesn't do enough to split itself off from them either.<br/><br/>If it had been the very first X-Men franchise-based film, I think it would've been far better to me, as I didn't have the memory of the two (or 3?) other time lines. And this doesn't quite fit into any of them. But with the two lead actors being who they are, it's rather hard to take them out of those roles in the other films.<br/><br/>I suppose it's best to go into this and firmly tell yourself, ""It's another alternate timeline, like the first ""Hulk"" movie and first 3 ""Spiderman"" films and has NOTHING to do with the rest of the franchise."" Then it might not lead to head-scratching of what exactly led to this place in the film's melancholic future."

","This is the best X-MEN movie so far. It is very real and serious and full of drama. I think is has the most drama in a superhero movie. At the core of the movie stands the father- daughter connection and their struggle to get along and to survive despite their enemies. Of course professor Xavier's involvement as a sort of ""acting grandfather"" is no small thing to mention. Overall it was an excellent family triangle created by the three main characters. Not to mention the action scenes and the great wit of the girl. A very emotional movie indeed. One of the best of Marvel's."

","Logan is the final installment of the X-Men solo movie staring Hugh Jackman as The Wolverine for the last time and after seeing this tonight i proudly to say this not only one of the best superheroes ever made but also a game changing move of Marvel studios since The Avengers.Back when i first hear about the movie it already make me curious when they just simply put the words LOGAN in the tiles and even more shocking with the feel,the look and the music when the trailer first came out.This is a very different movie from everything Marvel ever done before when they portray The Wolverine as a jacked up old man who you can really tell that has going through some tough stuff in his life and now he is very tired with it.No more X-Men,no more saving people and mutant from the force of evil now he just a broken man with no idea for the future despaired to live pass another day and without the help of Charles(Patrick Stewart) and Laura(Dafne Keen) he will eventually kill himself.The movie feel like two separated movie combine into one when it part superheroes movie when the plot involving Logan and Charles has to help Laura get to EDEN a place full of the last remaining mutant when a evil corporation chasing them lead by a guy named Pierce and part family drama movie when they show each character chemistry on screen and how they dealing with a lot of problem to the point that you can't recognize them with normal people.I also have to give credit for the fact that this is a hard R-rated movie so now we can finally see Logan slices people into pieces full on blood and gore that so satisfied to watch."

"pyrocitor","8","1","5","7 March 2017"," The Slashist
","Never underestimate a good Johnny Cash song. His course, plaintive ""Hurt"" as backing track singularly ratcheted the Wolverine 3 trailer from mild superhero curiosity to one of the year's most anticipated films - grim, bare-bones, and populated not with CGI-bloated posturing, but with genuine human hurt and heart. Then, the title drop: Logan. No numeric epithet, no pandering 'X-Men Origins.' Just Logan. It's impossibly representative; Logan is lean, mean, and, despite the lack of titular superheroic alias, the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for. <br/><br/>Of all the hats Wolverine has worn through the years, from samurai to spandex, a cowboy hat may be the most natural fit, and returning director James Mangold keenly embraces his film's intrinsic western influences, with more Unforgiven than Uncanny X-Men at play here. Only loosely drawing on Mark Millar's seminal Old Man Logan (no mafia of cannibalistic Hulk incest offspring here, for one), Mangold's 2029- set story is nowhere near as flamboyantly dystopian as Days of Future Past. Dusty, dark and whittled down, Mangold's screenplay obstinately avoids any expositional spoon- feeding, instead trusting the strength of his performers to get the sordid backstory across, with only the faintest teases of narrative breadcrumbs (hint: always listen to the radio). Here, Fox atones for their past X-sins (no more X-cuses?) by de-mythologizing the superhero more than Alan Moore's Watchmen. Instead, our titular ex-X-Man breaks ranks with his comic book past by, in a cunning fourth wall breach, brandishing X-Men comics and knocking aside Wolverine action figures in-text, and scorning them as bullsh*t. His film follows suit, flayed of all but the most rudimentary comic book winks (and even the most fanatical nerds aren't too likely to squeal at the Reavers or Caliban, as enjoyable as Stephen Merchant's crusty, brittle performance is). If you're harbouring hope for intertextual X-nods or cameos, save it for the exquisite Deadpool 2 teaser, bub. <br/><br/>Instead, Mangold crafts a grim, ramshackle road trip movie. He devotes far more time to basking in his characters' perennial aging agony and curmudgeonly family dynamics than the brewing military science conspiracy that prompts Logan's run. Pacing is fairly measured, including a dalliance at a family farm far more successful than Avengers: Age of Ultron's, which allows for plenty of breathing character beats, at the cost of urgency and momentum. It's spiced up considerably by Mangold's gleeful exploitation of his hard-won R-rating, and the comedic novelty of Logan and Professor Xavier spewing F-bombs (F-Men? Okay, I'll stop) has an unexpectedly enjoyable shelf life. Still, Mangold's film largely avoids flagging through its bursts of action combat. We've waited 17 years for an uncensored Wolverine fight scene, and he makes up for lost time here, each hack-and-slash fuelled by bedraggled fury and flamboyant gore, no face or limb safe from perforation. The saying may go 'It's all fun and game until somebody loses an eye,' but countless eyes are lost (or covered, for those who prefer their combat PG-13), and Logan has never felt so free. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, my 'no cannibalistic Hulk incest offspring' jab is not wholly a compliment. There's the persistent tickle of Mangold's film, in its quest for ruthless realism, playing a touch too safe. This isn't to say we need full-blown Mad Max histrionics, but endless sequences of Logan and Laura and stabbing their way through legions of metal- armed mercenaries in lieu of a juicy big bad (Boyd Holbrook and Richard E. Grant both sneer and steal scenery enjoyably, but are disappointingly bland and forgettable) do lose their lustre over time. A third act twist literalizing the 'Wolverine's worst enemy is himself' conceit isn't innovative or memorable enough to cover the slack (apparently undershirt shade provides the film's 'black/white hat' Western moral dichotomy here), and a pseudo-science climax attempting to graft larger scope to the narrative feels rushed and forced. The most cringeworthy, however, is Mangold reworking his film as a cloying love-letter to classic Western Shane, from a clumsily gratuitous mid-film nod, to a fawning climax saturated in schmaltzy cheese. It's an unorthodox, disappointingly disingenuous surge of sentiment in a film so otherwise unpretentiously bleak, and Logan's swan song deserves better.<br/><br/>Still, the importance of a superhero film this character-driven can't be overstated, and the work of the central trio are what really hit home. His 17th year snikting claws, Hugh Jackman has never been more committed to Wolverine's gruff charisma and burly humanity. He's so believable as a man defeated as much in soul as body, Jackman doesn't so much act as embody being dragged, cussing and screaming, over broken glass for two and a quarter hours, without the Oscar-begging bleating of a Leo in The Revenant. This is not a superhero, action star, or wounded western gunslinger. This is real hurt. That said, newcomer Dafne Keen's X- 23 is arguably even more extraordinary. She's so credibly feral she can be hysterical, heartbreaking, or truly chilling with only the slightest twitch of a lupine eyebrow. It's unclear whether she's being groomed as a new franchise headliner, but her exceptionally raw acting earmarks her as an emerging star to watch out for. Still, it's Patrick Stewart's Xavier who ultimately walks away from the show, radiating cavernously credible agony and disappointment at his diminishing mind and the suffering it has caused, all gilded with a gleefully profane sense of humour. <br/><br/>Logan has been heralded as 'the new Dark Knight' in terms of reaffirming the potential of the superhero film, though it's a bit too derivative and tonally confused for the title to hold. What's indisputable is its status as the most blisteringly emotional, mature, and savagely hard-edged genre offering in years. Remember Wolverine's congratulatory comic catchphrase that X-Men Origins embarrassingly beat out of him? It couldn't be truer here: Logan (and Jackman himself) is the best there is at what he does. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"
"AhernEamon","8","1","5","8 March 2017"," Not your typical superhero blockbuster
","I went to see this last night. I haven't seen every X-Men movie but I didn't feel I'd be missing out on too much judging by the premise and reviews I read. Logan (wolverine), Charles Xavier (professor X) and a mutant called Caliban - who I wasn't familiar with - are keeping a low profile on the Mexican border. All the other mutants are gone. Logan is struggling with ailments and doesn't heal as quickly as he used to and has taken it upon himself to care for Xavier as he struggles with a degenerative brain condition. They're trying to see out their days in anonymity when their peace is interrupted by a woman and a girl trying to make their way to Canada while being tracked by dark and sinister forces. It concentrated more on story-line for the plot immediately going forward rather than going into the back story in any great detail. I think this made it more watchable for anyone who hadn't been following all the previous films. Normally superhero movies are written and made with the widest audience in mind. So typically their suitability tends to be from an early teenage audience upwards. Sometimes pg for the widest audience possible. I assume one of thoughts going into the making of this film was that those who have been following the franchise since the very first X- Men movie are that much older now. So, rather than making a superhero movie, a movie was made that happens to have superheroes in it. As a result, if strong language was needed to emphasise emotion or intensity it was put in without effecting the demographic audience. The same with violence to portray conflict and rage. I read one review that said it played out more like a futuristic western than a superhero movie and I got that feel too in places. Indeed there were a few references to, and clips from an old western (the name escapes me) with Jack Palance. Do I think all these factors had any detrimental effect on the potential and actual audience? Well there were only three or four seats left when I was buying my ticket and there were reactions from the audience during the movie, so no. The action never seemed too contrived or artificial relative to the content of the movie and any cgi was minimal and blended in well with the scene. When things got slow it was still carried well by the experience of the main actors so I never lost interest or got impatient waiting for when they got back to the action sequences. Overall it was worth the admission price."

","Excellent film. It's an intimate character piece with tense action, dark sci-fi elements and a bleak Western feel. Performances are great with all the central characters feeling very fleshed out and real. It's not all bleak depression either with there being some genuinely funny moments that break up the overall darkness of the film. Coming to the end of his road, Logan is a man looking back on his life and is conflicted about his place in the world and who he is. Overall the film is successfully emotive, the character moments have truth and depth, the action is visceral and shocking and the story throughout is immersive and mesmerizing.

After watching this movie in theater twice i can say without a doubt that this is a must.<br/><br/>The most common complaints about this movie, is that it is untrue to the comics and the other movies in the franchise, but this is not to be considered a super hero movie, since it is so much more. In short it is the movie that Logan/Wolverine deserved. A personal story that is about Logan and his struggle to save the remains of hope there is for his kind.<br/><br/>Sir Patrick Stewart is also completely outdoing himself as Charles this time around.

It takes time to get used to an old Logan walking with a limp but Hugh Jackman just pulls off the character brilliantly. Storyline is good and leaves an opportunity for a sequel in the near future. X-23 is very much shown in alignment to the comic books and is very well enacted by the young Dafne Keen.

","6.5* out of 10<br/><br/>Didn't watch the trailer, didn't read the synopsis, I just walked in a blank canvas ready to absorb whatever was going to be playing on the screen. I enjoyed it, not as much as the other 9/10s and 10/10s the other reviewers are handing out but I enjoyed it. Here we have vulnerable Logan, walking-dead Logan, tsundere Logan, asshole Logan (the usual) and finally protective dad Logan. Just to preface, I am a reviewer that hates plot holes, it normally ruins the entire story for me, and Logan was a film that had some egregious plot errors. You basically had to suspend disbelief for the entire final arc. And not to mention the horde of mindless adversaries pouring out from god knows where only to disappear during times when backup was needed most, coupled with villains who've been plunked down with a paper-thin backstory, who you really can't be bothered to give more than two craps about. That being said, if it was any other movie, my rating would have automatically been a 5 and below, the saving grace here were the tender bits scattered turbulently throughout the film. Despite being unable to ignore the shoddy story-line, I found myself choking back a sob as Logan cradled Charles' head in his arms, and had tears streaming down my face as Logan dug a makeshift grave while trying his best not to fall apart at the seams, I was gripping the edge of the armrests as Laura and her ragtag team of misfit mutants were hunted down and cheered silently when Logan hulked out. Honestly, I went into the cinema looking for a bit of Saturday night movie action fun and came away with something more, it's definitely a different animal on its own in the X-men franchise. I just wished that the story-line could have been more clearly thought through, it would have made for a much more cohesive experience. For a final swan song, it could've been done better, but it definitely isn't a shabby film at all."

","*Short Summary at the End* I have been a fan of Marvel movies ever since they first started coming out when I was a kid. I loved the fantasy, action, and drama they brought a long with it. Super hero movies were all the same. They always have had a bright tone and made kids wish they could fly around with their fictional self. I loved that, emphasis on loved. People are getting tired of the same old, and wanted something new. Then came Deadpool, the very anticipated ""Don't Bring Your Kids to this Movie"", movie. I was awestruck when I realized that this was a superhero movie for people that were a little bit older, and could take darker, more inappropriate humor. It fit very well with the character that Deadpool was. Marvel reaped the benefits that came with it and continued on with the trend. <br/><br/>I am not the biggest X-Men fan, but have watched every movie relating to it, including the Wolverine saga. I was disappointed in the last Wolverine movie, the one set in Japan. It was, in my eyes, mediocre to say the least. <br/><br/>Then came the trailer for Logan. The perfect super hero movie, especially for Hugh and Patrick. From what I could tell it fit the Wolverine character like a glove. I was lucky enough, and saw it the instant it came out in my theater.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop ranting now and say this short summary of how I think the movie ""Logan"" is. It is amazing. With all the hype I had stored over the months, re-watching the trailers over and over, it blew it my expectations out of the water. All I have to say is to just watch it."

"Tss5078","7","1","5","7 March 2017"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","Many people have asked why the name Wolverine isn't in the title of the latest X-Men movie. The reason is that this film is not for children. Logan is violent, vulgar, and disturbing, this film will give your kids nightmares. Logan is supposedly the last time Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine, it might also very well end the current X-Men film franchise, that has produced nine feature films and brought in billions of dollars. That being said, I expected an epic conclusion, the likes of which Marvel had never done before, and what I got was somewhat of a disappointment. It takes place in the future and yes, Logan is older, but he's still the Wolverine, so I was expecting a fair bit of fighting and chases, but it seems that was pretty much all this film has to offer. A deteriorating Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) claims that even though a new mutant hasn't been born in decades, he is speaking to one that needs help, and as it turns out he was right. Logan and Prof. X go to rescue the child and bring her to safety, while the government tries to stop that from happening. I get that this is the future and there isn't time to fill us in on everything, but there are some major plot holes with the story that are never explained. This may be a Wolverine movie, but it is also the conclusion of the X-Men, so what happened to everyone and everything else? The stories narrow focus is on these three and getting to their destination, with chase after chase and fight after fight. The film certainly has it's moments and more than it's fair share of F bombs, but where was the whole conclusion element to it? The epic end to one of the biggest franchises in the history of film just isn't there. The big draw seems to be that they finally went for the R rating and showed Logan's true personality and yes, they made the film much more realistic than any other X-Men film, but I didn't have that satisfied feeling when it was all said and done. As for Hugh Jackman, this was easily his best performance as Wolverine. You see his real personality and all that comes with it, and if this wasn't the type of film that it was, released when it was, I truly believe people would be talking about an Academy Award, he was really that good. The harsh reality is that X-Men as we know it, with the cast that we know is probably over, but the way they ended it leaves us with too many unanswered questions and a feeling of unfulfilled promise."
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","5","7 March 2017"," Bleak, vicious and wonderful.
","In 2000 a fresh-faced Aussie actor with only a handful of local credits to his name scored the prized role of Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men. 17 years on, Hugh Jackman delivers his ninth and final performance as the metal-clawed mutant, and it's arguably his best. Set in the not-too-distant future where mutants are all but extinct, our eponymous antihero is eking out a living as a limo driver on the U.S-Mexico border, predominantly to fund his alcohol addiction but also to provide for the mentally declining Professor X (Patrick Stewart). Happy to drink his remaining years away, Logan's waste of a life is upended when he's forced upon to transport an enigmatic girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), across the country to safety. Shedding the usual superhero template, this entry into the X-Men universe plays out more like a slow-burn, gritty Western, or a violent, modern-noir road trip flick; you can take your pick. The emphasis on building character and atmosphere through weighty dialogue, metaphorical plot devices and an unrelentingly sombre tone won't be for everyone's tastes—especially those expecting the normal comic-book fare—but it's undeniably ballsy and mostly poignant. There are long stretches without action, however when the set pieces come along they're executed with a brutality that is both completely apt and utterly surprising. Wolvie slices and dices his way through hordes of henchmen, but this time they actually bleed. There's a reluctant grimness to the fighting this time around too; the carnage doled out by Logan is not presented as 'fun' or 'enjoyable' in the they-had-it-coming kind of way, but rather as a heavy burden that weighs him down. At the core of the proceedings is the two-hander between Jackman and newcomer Keen; the former all weary pessimism driven by regret, the latter naively filled with optimism and hope despite the odds against them. Anchored by two powerhouse central performances and a smart narrative that dispenses with superhero convention, Logan is the bleak, vicious and no-holds-barred farewell this iconic character deserved."
"jpabsp","9","1","5","6 March 2017"," Im crying because i am going to miss it
","Other than the fact that I'm crying cause it's the last time we see Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and because it is the last Xmen movie with the original characters(unless they do movies with same characters but in the past)this movie was great and the acting was very good and everything was perfect right down to the very emotional ending but the horrible thing about this movie is how they killed off Prof X. I mean the strongest mutant ever shouldn't have been portrayed as such: (weak and swearing and cant read minds) it would have been nicer if he weren't constantly swearing and acting un- professor-like and if he died in a better way and not so simply and without at least looking like he can control minds again(not animals). Sad about Prof X but loved the movie still and i need a long time to get over the fact that it is the last one."
"mwcrunner","7","1","5","6 March 2017"," Neat but very sad as well
","This was a very well done last performance of Hugh Jackman here. It's sad though that this is his last X-Men movie. Also this is based on the comic book cause in the comic book Wolverine dies and a new Wolverine comes along named Wolverine X-23. I also did see that Wolverine had an evil twin in this. Also It's neat that she has a daughter in this too. It's also very sad to see the rest of the X-Men all dead cause of William Stryker's son. It's also sad to see Professor X die too and Wolverine in the end. But this movie at the end lets us all see a new team of X-Men rising which hopefully we'll see in new X-Men movies in the future. Wolverine may be dead and gone, but his legacy will live on and Hugh Jackman will always be remembered for his role in these movies. Also lets hope that Tom Hardy makes a decent replacement for him in new X-Men films."
"TristenCorvinus","10","1","5","6 March 2017"," Amazing, emotional, end of an era.
","First off, for those who say this movie doesn't Portray wolverine the way he should be and the violence was unnecessary, look at wolverine's comic book portrayals, he is violent aggressive and embraces what he is made for, A weapon. Secondly for those who say it doesn't make sense why Logan is dying, it is because of adamantium poisoning it is causing his body to rot faster than he can heal from it add on to that the injuries he is sustaining through out the course of the movie it is finally to much for his body to handle, third, for those who say that there is little to no plot yes there is you just didn't pay attention because it was there, yes it can be a little difficult to follow but you can piece together the plot by the points the movie makes, fourth the complaint of that they didn't use their powers is absolutely absurd, wolverine views his claws as a curse because the are slowly killing him, professor X couldn't use his psychic abilities because the drug that wolverine injects him with is a suppressant to try to keep him from using his powers because his seizures are you know in his brain where his psychic abilities are controlled which are caused by a degenerative brain disease meaning when he has a seizure he can kill people, and Logan doesn't want Laura to rely solely on her claws like he did because he want's her to have a better life than he did, fifth the naming of the main bad guy Donald Pierce has NOTHING to do with politics, and it's not anti-human it's simply showing what lengths companies are willing to go to for money."

","This movie felt like more than just another marvel movie to me. This movie made me feel like I was saying goodbye to a dear friend, and that's the best part about it. Logan was a movie that made me feel emotions, something that I never feel in superhero movies. This film is masterfully shot, and the acting is superb. Watch this movie"
"tankace","10","1","5","6 March 2017"," Wolverine close with a blast
","Logan is, as we know for the time, the final film of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and after the awfulness of Origins and The Wolverine which was just a good action film with a weak ending ,I wouldn't imagine that the final chapter of our hero to be as good as it was rumored to, but in the end was even better.<br/><br/>For starter the film takes place in 2029 and Wolverine and Professor X are in their last ,they are tired and their abilities aren't working as they used to. It was extremely painful for a big fan of the X-men watch these to legends be like that. However we still see glimpses of their old selves and with Wolverine when it comes out it is epic to say the least. Also they found a young girl who has abilities and they help her escape from their pursuers.<br/><br/>What I loved with the film was the fight scenes and imagery who justify complete the R rating and gave us the Wolverine film we wanted to see in years. Another pros of the flick was the quiet moments between the action which flesh out our protagonist showing us that dispute the low point of the mutants in this film, what drives the plot is hope for the future for if they manage to save that girl then she at least will have a better life than the had.<br/><br/>As for the man himself Hugh Jackman was amazing ,this is by far his best interpretation of Wolverine and he portrait very well this weary and grumpy version of the most popular X-men. The little girl was the show steal-er ,as her action scenes for me were the best in the film. As for the villains Pierce and his superior are the second best villain I have seen in the X-men films since William Stryker and I like that they didn't do what they did out of hate but by their point of view they were fixing a mistake of them. Which is realistic for the best antagonist is the one who thinks that he doesn't do something evil for evil sake but either good or his job and here is the later.<br/><br/>Finally the emotions that this film brought out to me were sadness, fear and at times relief. The relief is mostly for the quality of the film for it is from my point of view, the best super-hero sequel since the Dark Knight. Definitely go watch in cinemas and be aware it isn't a kids film or a pop-corn action."
"ross-118","9","1","5","6 March 2017"," Finally, a GREAT Wolverine film
","I was a fan of 2013s The Wolverine, cookie cutter ending aside, it was a well done film that, for me, eclipsed many of the other X-Men films. Sitting down to watch this, I though about the first trailer, how little it showed and how gritty it looked and then how disappointed I was with the 2nd trailer which made it look more X- Men like. I wondered if the hype was all it was ever going to be and we'd get more of the same that we've been given since 2000s original X-Men. Thankfully I was wrong. The first scene literally set the tone and it carried on from there to create a truly great film, not superhero film, FILM! Jackman is on top form here, reaching Prisoners level of acting for me. Giving one last go at a character he's played for 17 years. He approaches Logan exactly how it should have been done, as a tired old gunslinger with no need for a gun. Praying/waiting on his end but so stubborn and p1ssed off to actually seek his demise. Stewart, also doing his best Professor Xavier work as they actually give him character in this film rather than being in a coma (X1), imprisoned (X2), exploded (X3) and basically cameos in the rest of the films. Logan and Xavier are truly believable as a father and son duo, both old and tired but find comfort in caring for each other. Their relationship is one of the best things about this film! Good supporting turns by everyone else including Laura, the little girl afflicted by the same powers as Logan. James Mangold cited his influences on this film as Shane, Little Miss Sunshine and The Wrestler and all 3 shine through here but I can tell you there is little to no humour in this, it's as gritty and fierce as it should be and was able to be within it's R/15 rating. Believe me, this is near the knuckle sometimes and bordering on full blown 18 rating. Do not take your kids to see it, this is an adults film. I really enjoyed this and I'm sure it'll go on to be the most critically acclaimed X-Men film due to a stellar script, excellent direction and top notch acting."
"palavitsinis","9","1","5","6 March 2017"," It's sad but that's life... Even for Logan!
","Went to see this movie with a knot in my gut. With a realization that this is the end of the line. Come on, this is not a spoiler, we all know it already! Logan is not dead either way, as new iterations of the X-Men could come at any time.. <br/><br/>Wolverine gave life to Hugh Jackman as he gave life to the role. No matter who comes along, Jackman will always be the first one that came so close. Just like the comics were sketched after him...! <br/><br/>The movie was awesome. It kind of grabbed you by the hand from minute one and never let go. It was dark and gloomy and it kept crushing your hopes over and over again, when you tried to think that a miraculous comeback could take place.<br/><br/>In movies like that, I feel that there is no room for actor critique, for long and exhausting analyses, etc. Logan was f*** awesome! It is an end of an era, till proved otherwise at least, and it's dark as dark night was in a sense. Just get out there and go watch it..."
"RIP_Mizz","8","1","5","6 March 2017"," The Wolverine we all wanted.
","I'm a huge X-men fan and even a bigger Wolverine fan and always been a fan of Hugh Jackman portrayal of the character but always felt something was missing. This movie found what was missing and that is a Wolverine who is violent and angry more than all of the other movies combined.<br/><br/>This movie is depressing and fun at the same time which is hard to do but this movie pulls off. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are great as always but man what a breakout performance by Dafne Keen. This is by far the best Wolverine movie and maybe the best X-men movie.<br/><br/>My negatives with the film are very few but were noticeable like the movie being too long, not explaining stuff clearly enough that needed to be explained in my opinion and one villain is a bit silly. But please go see this film. This film is what comic book movies need to be and need to be taken more seriously so hopefully some comic book characters get their more serious adaptations instead of too much comedy."
"rushmoras","8","1","5","6 March 2017"," Probably the most interesting X-Men movie since the first
","The movie Logan is set in the year 2029. There are no more mutants, only a handful are left in the world. The mutants have been ""destroyed"" thanks to GMO food that one science company, which is one of the bad guy branch from Alkali Lake, makes. We find Logan as somewhat of an old man: he can't heal properly and as it turns out later it's because of the Adamantium (either the bullet, which was embedded in his skull at the end of Origins, either the Adamantium itself) - it's slowly has been poisoning him for some time. So, he's working as a limo driver, trying to gather a few quick bucks to buy a boat, get Charles with him and get the hell out of dodge, before Charles' uncontrolled seizures kill everyone insight. However, some things don't go according to plan when Logan is approached by a woman and a child, who are being chased by paramilitary organizations wanting to get their assets back. At first, Logan is reluctant to help them, because as he states in the movie he's not Wolverine, that Wolverine is dead, but after a couple of assassination attempts on his person, Charles and the little girl, who turns out to be a mutant embedded with Adamantium and two Adamantium claws and very proficient in killing everyone, Logan decides to help them after all. If not for being decent, but just to get out of dodge safely.<br/><br/>While the movie is 2 hrs and 11 minutes long, it's not boring. The viewer is constantly captivated by the quick action scenes, explosions and sometimes stunning nature's visuals, which were shot in British Columbia during Fall season.<br/><br/>The acting was by far the best one in any X-Men movies up-to-date. From Dafne Keen's shock-mixed-with autism scenes too Patrick Stewart's dementia and Alzheimer's ridden motions, it's the best acting I have seen in any of the X-Men films.<br/><br/>Lastly, it's the bloodiest X-Men film of all. From dismemberments to decapitations, the rivers are flowing blood when Logan's and Laura's characters are in action scenes.<br/><br/>10/10"
"secretzfan","9","1","5","5 March 2017"," Fox transcends the comic book genre again
","I wanna give this movie as close to a 10 as you can get without actually hitting it. <br/><br/>After I came out of Logan I was truly emotionally broken after seeing it. It was so powerful from every bloody and gore filled scene. Logan tells a powerful story that takes place in the X Men world, but doesn't feel like any of the past X Men movies. The film instead is more like a dramatic piece. It has edges and flows and feels powerful. Every scene in it feels more impactful than the last. <br/><br/>Truly if superhero films keep getting this good it won't be long till the Academy Awards wakes up and has to nominate one of them for best picture. It just can't be denied forever. This is no longer just a typical comic book film with a comic book character as the lead. This is a drama that tries to pull at the heart strings on the viewer. It is nearly perfect. <br/><br/>The film has many layer to it. It speaks more on family and the bonds that a family can share when there together along with getting a sense of normalcy in there everyday lives that they live. It would bring you on the verge of tears out how powerful this film truly is. It works on so many levels and deserves a lot of praise."
"potbob","7","1","5","5 March 2017"," Great Movie, lots of plot holes, cannot compare to The Dark Knight.
","Lets start with the obvious. I think a lot of these reviews are overblown. Was this a great movie? Absolutely! Can this be compared to the Dark Knight? Absolutely not. That movie was a solid 10 out of 10. This movie had so many plot holes that were unanswered, I was shocked. I get that they wanted Jackman and Stewart to go out on a high note and their acting was Oscar worthy, but they really half assed the plot. The X Men timeline makes no sense. There weren't any explanations as to what happened to mutants. It was hastily thrown together like ID4 part 2 and that's what made this movie a 7 instead of a 10. Deadpool was still a better marvel movie."
"ayoreinf","9","1","5","5 March 2017"," A tour de force of acting with a great story to boot
","This one is a 9.5 or a 9.8 rather than 9, but let's not split any hairs on trivial details. It's one of the best sci-fi/action/comics, I've seen in a very long while. I've said more than once that the X Men have the best characters written down in comics history. They also have some of the best story lines, even though this one is not part of their long illustrious mythology, it's still rings true to their comic based characters, and since the comics itself had already presented us with so many alternate realities, none can complain if it doesn't follow a precise story from the comic books.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, presents what I consider to be his best movie performance, Patrick Stewart is coming close to his very best, (I simply didn't see enough of his movies to pass a definite judgment). Dafne Keen shows great promise, as the young wild, and sensitive X23. The rest of the cast are faultless to the very last minute role. And the story flows naturally from the very start, it's as if it simply writes itself, and as far as I'm concerned it's one of the best complements one can give a story or a script. A real masterpiece and a great signoff for a wonderful character. All fans of the X Men, and of Wolverin especially, this one is a real must see."
"CraigsCritique","8","1","5","5 March 2017"," Claws Out for One Last Logan Outing
","So I came out of seeing Logan this week with a great deal of frustration...not from the film itself but for what had preceded it in the X-Men films made prior to it, I thought what I had witnessed was very good indeed but really it bears no physical relation to what we've seen from previous X-Men films.<br/><br/>I only own one X-Men film (First Class) and I think that exemplifies my on off relationship with what Fox seem to have consistently got wrong with the films, no one can dispute the casting in either of the film timelines with Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence amongst others being seemingly perfect actors for their respected characters.<br/><br/>Yes we must praise the more emotionally driven storyline of Logan and the performances of not just Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart but of young Dafne Keen, but in equal measure you've still got to notice the flaws on show, I was not particularly impressed by the bad guys played by Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook and there was a particular moment involving a character which is a hugely emotional moment that is then interrupted with the intent to further heighten your emotion for the scene you've just witnessed yet I was hugely frustrated by it, now this may be a story thread from the comics (I don't know) but either way I actually thought it detracted from a possibly hugely emotional story development that did have me on the edge of my seat and close to tears.<br/><br/>It sounds like I'm hating on it doesn't it but I feel we mustn't suppress the flaws the film still has including the fact that it is too long, that I am adamant of, however the stuff that is good is close to exceptional with a generally great script that is not only emotional but funny as well with the obvious Professor X and Logan conversing the absolute highlight, the great performances from said actors with Stewart for me being award worthy.<br/><br/>There are comparisons to be had with this film in the likes of the obvious Children of Men and the less obvious Creed, yes that's right the Rocky reboot that came out last year, I can already hear the superhero fans howling out it anger but there's something to be said for a long standing franchise character having an emotional one last hurrah having experienced all that they have in their respected film worlds, the 15 rated film that it is here in the U.K is really the age range the X-Men films all should have been in to begin with considering all the stories of persecution and so on, so to see the violence as it should be is all the more hard hitting and affecting.<br/><br/>Yes it is a different type of comic book/superhero film that is an extremely welcome one, I just feel we shouldn't have had to go through so many mediocre X-Men film experiences to get to this one ten films in that has such meaning and emotion."

","A good movie.<br/><br/>Some productions are marked by their bold style, heavy thematic, and etc, and are remembered and exalted by these same characteristics, when reminded by movie buffs around the world, in casual discussions.<br/><br/>Logan will certainly be remembered like this. The film delivers a magnificent action, exploring for the first time the real potential of Wolverine in this regard, as well as bringing a new type of approach to hero films, with a weight, a reality, and a seriousness that make until the story turns off almost That completely of the own kind of superhero.<br/><br/>But even picking up on the action, the ""dirty"" story and the performance of the actors, with Hugh Jackman and especially Patrick Stewart impeccable and 100% committed to roles, Logan points out in other points that would be even easier to correct Than the others in which the film succeeded, which makes it not reach the potential that had, and even being a farewell worthy of Hugh Jackman of the paper, is that thought that could have been better.<br/><br/>In order to exemplify (without spoilers), two points that are very badly used within the narrative, and that end up taking a little concentration of the viewer at the time of the film, are, first of all, the misuse of the villains of the film, the Reavers, who At first they give the impression that they are going to be a great force in the course of history, but at some point they are taken from focus, and never really put to the test.<br/><br/>And finally, what has bothered me the most, and even caused a certain shame, is a ""narrative element"" used at some point in the film, where it is necessary to explain a certain thing, and this is done in the most superficial way, played And possible whimper that makes you even want to laugh. If you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about, and if you did not see it, when you see it, you'll remember what I said.<br/><br/>In summary: Logan is a good movie, delivers definitely incredible moments, talks about family, shows a Wolverine loaded with anguish and regrets, but sins in moments, being kind of a ""roller coaster"", going from ""heaven to hell"" in Few minutes, but fortunately, good times still stand out from the bad."

After two mixed solo attends, this movie is finally what fans and critics were waiting for.<br/><br/>Logan is a broken down man, with the great days past by. Now his healing powers fade and of all the friends of the past is only a senile Charles Xavier left, who needs medicine to keep is dangerous powers locked away. This is the starting point of a often brutal but sometimes also heartbreaking journey through a near future world with the mutant being only a story of the past.<br/><br/>The direction by James Mangold and the characters in this movie are gorgeous. There are many little details that you would not expect in a movie like this. Overall the feeling of an old western a la Eastwood is omnipresent. There are absolutely dirty and bloody fight scenes with rolling heads and claws through the face, but between these violent scenes there is much character development. Something you would also not expect in a comic book movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the final view onto Hugh Jackmans Wolverine and the way they ended everything.

","Seeing LOGAN in IMAX was an excellent movie to see. Despite being the last film for the two actors to play their own character, Hugh Jackman will always be the greatest actor who has ever played Logan aka the Wolverine and Patrick Stewart will always be the greatest actor who has ever played Charles Xavier aka Professor X. Honestly, I enjoyed seeing this movie, an adventure to help a young mutant be safe from harm. I kind of felt like LOGAN would be the final film of the X-MEN series, but it is not because there will be more X-MEN films. LOGAN was the last film of the Wolverine Trilogy which centers about Wolverine. Looks like for future X-MEN films, they will all be different now that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are now done with playing the roles of their own characters. I notice that Wolverine and Professor X are the only two members who appear together in all of the Wolverine Trilogy. I was upset about the evil corporation for using the young mutants as things which was just wrong. Those young mutants should treated like normal people. Glad that the villains are now gone. Humans and Mutants should be treated as one. Again, the movie was excellent. Thank You, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart for playing the greatest roles in the X-MEN series for 17 years."

","Logan is a dark and gritty take on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. It delves less into glamorizing heroes and super-powers, and instead grounds itself into the mortality of one's legacy. This is one of the first films that have added great depth and complexity to the character of Logan, leaving him in a moral mess. <br/><br/>Dafne King is surprisingly powerful and convincing in her initial unspoken role. However, the more she speaks English later in the film, the aura of mystery surrounding her dissipates and leaves a generic young actress, with the initial power of silence gone.<br/><br/>James Mangold did very well with Logan, and while the majority of the film has taken to a more Western tone, it ends on a note similar to other x-men films, and at the end of the day, has the all too familiar feel, providing a minimal lasting impact."

","As a preface, I must admit that I am not one typically moved by nostalgic sentiment. For the most part, it's usually poorly depicted or dramatically heightened to a nauseating degree. <br/><br/>""Logan"", however, completely shattered my preconceptions of what ""being moved"" meant. From the start of the movie, I was inexorably drawn in by the simultaneous strength and fragility that Hugh Jackman was able to embody in the character. One could literally feel the anguish and loathing that he battled with throughout the film and perhaps that is what ultimately drew me in. While the violence was explicit, it was not disgustingly overblown and aptly captured the primal aggression underlying the Wolverine's nature. Conversely, there was a rough, broken, tenderness that transpired between Logan, Charles, and Laura. It spoke volumes of the grief and trauma that each had experienced and also highlighted the oft dismissed and understated devotion and compassion innate within Logan. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Logan's final words of: ""So this is what if feels like,"" was one that shook me to the core. I was in tears- heartbroken at how such a mighty man had fallen, yet content, in a sense, that he was finally at peace. To all who appreciate such emotional gravitas within a film, I absolutely recommend you to watch it."

","For some us, the 21st Century began on that July weekend in 2000 when the first X-MEN movie was released; with a record box office take for its time, it proved that comic heroes other than DC's Superman and Batman could find an audience with movie goers and ushered in the era of the big comic book tent pole. It also introduced us to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, one of the most perfect pieces of casting of all time, with Patrick Stewart's Professor Charles Xavier a close second. Now, nearly seventeen years later, these first generation movie comic icons take their final bow in LOGAN, the last appearance for both Jackman and Stewart in the roles that fit them like a glove.<br/><br/>How does their swan song stack up:<br/><br/>The hero: we find Jackman's Logan not fairing so well in the future of 2029. This is a world where mutants have mostly disappeared, exactly how is not completely explained, but a disaster at Xavier's institute is alluded to more than once, a calamity for which the Professor may have been responsible. Logan, as Wolverine now calls himself, is not doing so good as he lives in Texas near the Mexican border, working as a limo driver, drinking too much and looking after a very aged and nearly senile Charles Xavier. He looks terrible as admantium poisoning is starting to take its toll and his regenerative power is starting to give out. He's also haunted by terrible memories and suffering the effects of grief and guilt. This Wolverine is a shell of the mutant hero we knew in the earlier films, all the better for when he is called upon to summon the old fire and rage to square off against the villains; Jackman can do the avenging hero just fine, but I think his best moments come when Logan hits the bottom in scenes of defeat and bitter regret. They set the table for when Wolverine rises up and does what does better than anyone else.<br/><br/>The plot: In a lot of ways, LOGAN is not a superhero movie, but a western with a little Mad Max thrown in; it even directly invokes the classic, SHANE. This is underscored by having the action set in the real American west as Logan reluctantly comes to the aid of a young girl named Laura whose powers closely resemble his own. The story turns on a journey to North Dakota, where Laura hopes to meet up with the other young escapees from a secret lab in Mexico where a nefarious corporation (a comic book and movie trope) is breeding test tube mutants. Logan and Charles Xavier hit the road with a bunch of corporate hired guns in hot pursuit. The small child in danger and needing the protection of a super human guardian is a template taken right from TERMINATOR 2, except here the small child is a killing machine all her own, and we are treated to some great action scenes and a high body count (good guys and bad guys alike) before a showdown in the far north. Despite a running time of over two hours, the movie keeps moving along and is not as convoluted as most other comic adaptations. You don't have to be overly familiar with the long and twisted history of the X-Men franchise to enjoy LOGAN, but it helps.<br/><br/>The actors: Jackman and Stewart truly do their characters justice, sending them out with real grace notes, but the revelation is young Dafne Keen as Laura, the deadly tween with admantium claws. The bad ass girl has become something of a pop culture cliché, but Keen's performance transcends it, she is simply marvelous and her scenes with Jackman and Stewart are well written and well played. The villains of the piece are Boyd Holbroke and Richard E. Grant, as the enhanced mercenary and requisite evil doctor; and both of them are really rotten without any redeeming quality, such a relief from other comic movies where the bad guy is a tragic mirror of the hero. Stephen Merchant is Caliban, a character familiar to any X-Men comic readers.<br/><br/>The special effects: There are no omnipotent personifications of evil threatening the earth here, so there thankfully are no scenes of skyscrapers crumbling and cites falling, but what we do have is lots of good R rated blood and gore as we get the berserk Wolverine using his powers the way we always wanted to see them used. Limbs are severed; skulls are punctured and decapitated with state of the art precision. At times it's as if Sam Peckinpah had returned from the afterlife and directed a super hero movie (Bloody Sam was actually offered SUPERMAN in 1977, but turned it down). <br/><br/>Director James Mangold makes good use of the restricted rating by allowing Logan to spit out a bunch of obscenities the PG-13 Wolverine wasn't allowed to use. This is not a movie for young kids.<br/><br/>And if a critic describes LOGAN as ""not like any other comic book movie,"" then they clearly hate comic book movies.<br/><br/>I couldn't think of a better finale for Wolverine than the one LOGAN gives him, that final image is one of the most memorable of any recent movie. But now that we're done with Wolverine and Charles Xavier, let's explore some of the other great characters in the X-Men universe; it's about time we get that Gambit film they've been promising and how about a stand alone Quicksilver movie, then there is Cannonball And Emma Frost."
"dpbertrand-126-427929","10","1","5","4 March 2017"," More than a Comic book film
","Before seeing this movie I saw a Quote from a critic along the lines of ""not just a great comic book movie, But a great movie in general"". I think that may be the best way of to sum up Logan.<br/><br/>To start this movie isn't for your typical comic fans, this is more for fans that enjoy movies as an art. The story is deep, dark, gritty and emotional with not a ton of humour. I for one have no issues with this as I see The Logan character as this is how one of his films should be made. I am not familiar with the source material, however I have always enjoyed the X-Men movies for what they are, big budget blockbusters. The biggest problem with the movies for me have always been how they have failed to feel any type of emotion for the characters, until this film.<br/><br/>This is a story of a hero who has lost his way and only cares for very few people, if not only one. A hero who is struggling with the past and is ready to live out his life in peace and alone. Obviously things happen to make him question things and also possibly guide him back on the right path. I have to say it's the first time in any comic book movie where I generally felt emotionally attached to multiple characters and would truly be sad if any of them were to be harmed or worse, die. After all these years with so many movies of this genre it's crazy to think it took this long, but it was worth the wait. <br/><br/>Hugh and Patrick really do their best work with the characters they have played for 17 years. They both have moments in the film that almost brought me to tears and also made me really think about life and how you can always improve regardless of your age. Dafne Keen is also very good. She is so convincing in a role that had to be hard for an 11 year old to play. Her first scene is absolutely impressive. The villain is fine but nothing to go bonkers about. He's charming and weirdly likable but never a true threat. To me the true villain is the demons from the past, and how to overcome them.<br/><br/>The action is raw and gritty just like the film. It's so brutal it could be hard for some to watch, however I wanted to just jump in to the screen and fight along with them (again, a first for an XMen film). If you are looking for huge set pieces and big special effects you will be disappointed. Think more Jason Bourne style of fighting with claws. <br/><br/>All in all this is a fantastic movie. I know it's early in the year, however this could end up being my favourite movie of the year. It's so raw and honest with great action sequences and a true character study of how great Men have to deal with their own demons. If you don't go in expecting an action movie and have an open mind I think anyone could truly enjoy this film."
"Silver_Zero93","10","1","5","4 March 2017"," The End of a Legendary Eigthlogy series
","This is the first time I write a review and my English is not that good, but I still decided to write this because it is the one movie that worth writing a review for. For a normal movie, I would only give 9/10, but this one is different, this movie marks the end of a 17 years series, a legend. I watch Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor X since I was young, they never fail me in their roles, even some of the movie plots suck. The plot of Logan is nothing special compare to other action movies, but we are talking about a superhero movie here. It doesn't feel like superhero movie at all, it tells the story of how a legend ends, and it is a perfect ending to a legend like Wolverine. I feel sad when I was watching the movie, but it is not because of the story, it is the nostalgia, seeing both of the actors become old, and how they trying to help the next generation. <br/><br/>Either you are a movie fan, X-Men fan, Wolverine fan, or not, go watch this movie, as a respect to the series and the actors, and it is worth your money. There are many superman and spiderman, but Hugh Jackman is the only Wolverine.<br/><br/>P/S: Watching Logan and his daughter going around in the movie reminds me of The Last of Us. I am a fan of TLoU and I hope there will be an adaption for the game soon, while Hugh Jackman still can act. Hugh Jackman is the perfect fit for Joel, Ellen Page or the little girl Dafne Keen in Logan might play a good role as Ellie."
"grillascosta","9","1","5","4 March 2017"," Perfect, bloody and emotional sendoff for Hugh Jackman
","Logan is a violent action-thriller loaded with strong emotion. <br/><br/>The movie starts off they way it should showing you what your really in for. The introduction is strong showing what happened to Wolverine and his current life while introducing the villain all at the same time. This movie perfectly balances it's strong brutal violence with strong emotional scenes throughout the whole 2 hour and 21 minute run-time. The way some of the action scenes were designed kept you stressed and on the edge of your seat leaving you breathless the whole way through. <br/><br/>Except you have to see this more than just an action movie full of nitty- gritty violence. The emotional and strong messages that were included in this movie were strong and effective with a great plot to add. The acting from every character is powerful and believable especially that of Dafne Keen who plays X-23. <br/><br/>Altogether this movie is a perfect, bloody and emotional sendoff for Hugh Jackman and the pay-cut he took to get the R rating was greatly appreciated. You will be missed after a great 17 years. Great work James Mangold."
"niravgohil","9","1","5","4 March 2017"," Old Man Logan
","Logan is what a superhero genre movie should be. Talking about story first then Old Man Logan is a best way to bid farewell to our most beloved X-Men character, The Wolverine. The way the story progresses from a man not willing to accept an unwanted burden on his shoulder to a man who sacrifices everything for that burden, is simply marvelous. Talking about acting, Dafne Keen is a real star here. I just loved Dafne in her new role and she does absolute justice to her role. The way she says, ""Daddy"" for the first time and that fatherly look on Hugh's face! I cannot say Hugh does justice to this role because he is playing this role since past 17 years and there is a reason why he is our favorite X-Men. I now cannot imagine any other actor playing this role after seeing Hugh as Logan in his final outing. Must watch for every X-Men lover."
"beandip57","10","1","5","4 March 2017"," Logan is a Beast
","So many years of the X-Men and Wolverine franchise and I was always left wanting more or disappointed, but not after Logan. After the Wolverine movie I said I would not go to a Fox wolverine movie because they destroyed my favorite character. After Deadpool, the fact that it was R and the trailers, my hopes were high. I was thrilled by opening scene, Wolverine like he should be, dark, angry, frustrated and most of all a reluctant hero. The story is filled with gritty scenes of action which not only bring a sense of realism of what would happen when a hero has 6 sharp knives as hands but also the sheer carnage of fights. It is not for the faint of heart as Logan does not hold back any punches, pun intended. Logan has a great and moving story also. Laura was amazing at her part (i wont spoil it) and steals the show in some parts. Patrick Stewart still does more than justice to professor X. A must see for all the comic book lovers, action junkies or wolverine fans, this is what i always wanted Logan.... the beast the best at what he does."
"chinmaykatre","9","1","5","4 March 2017"," Where brutality meets poignancy
","It was about four years ago when I was first introduced to the X-men universe. Since then irrespective of the quality of the script, I always have admired Hugh Jackman's brilliant portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. Thus about an year ago when he posted a picture of his 'Claws' on Facebook with the caption 'One Last Time', it was pretty clear that the X-men universe was never going to be the same. And what better way to conclude than Logan! <br/><br/>The R-rated violence in the movie is exactly how it was supposed to be; but the emotions embedded among all the killings and bloodshed is what makes it exceptional. You don't need to be a die- hard Wolverine fan to adore this movie. Brilliantly written, directed, shot and acted, Logan is worth every penny. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman were expected to be brilliant, but the 12 year-old Dafne Keen steals the show. With only a handful of dialogues, she still manages to make you adore her with pure and natural expressions. <br/><br/>Although the vulnerability of Logan and Professor X is not something that we are used to, the deep emotional connection they share is stronger than ever. There are some funny moments too;but they, in no way, compromise the dark tone of the movie. Any movie which can get you glued to the screen the entire time, is always a delight to watch; and Logan precisely does the same. <br/><br/>The final act of the movie is an absolute triumph; something which James Mangold couldn't pull of the last time. The ending leaves you numb, while making you appreciate a great piece of art you just witnessed. To sum it all up, Logan deserves all the hype it is getting; and it surely is the best movie in the entire X- men franchise. <br/><br/>Thank you Hugh Jackman..... You will be dearly missed."
"autisticreviewers","10","1","5","4 March 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","When you announce that you plan to retire from a well known role in a movie franchise, you better go out with a bang. That's exactly that Hugh Jackman does in this third and final outing as Wolverine that is finally true to the brutality of his world (compared to the first two attempts). It's brutal, emotional, darkly funny but gives a terrific send off to one of the greatest on screen heroes ever.<br/><br/>The film's storyline is based on the acclaimed 'Old Man Logan' graphic novel, staring off with an aged and weary Logan who takes care of an elderly Professor Xavier and earns a small living as a limo driver. Living in a world where there are less to none mutants existing on the earth, Logan is offered a job to help transport a young female who needs to be at a safe border away from an corporation that is seeking to hunting her down and cleanse a new world of their own. A reluctant Logan then seeks this and pushes him to a fight for her protection when she shows similar powers to him, despite his age and weaknesses.<br/><br/>What makes the film believable is it's raw character development and emotion, with having seen Logan show emotion prior to this film this one in particular shows his full range, being a bitter, fragile and weary human that is capable of caring less as his past actions and experiences have placed a bad thought on him. The performances overall are incredibly great, giving us heroes and villains that make the story movable and engaging.<br/><br/>The violence of this film is another showcase of Logan, we're finally given the brutality of Logan's capabilities with dismemberment, bloody kills and gore. For an MA rated film here in Australia, it's certainly violent despite that the highest rating is R in the country, this is indeed intended for an older audience despite the Marvel label.<br/><br/>Overall, to make an exit from an worldwide famous role, Logan is a shining example of how to do so. With a great script, outstanding performances and well done action set pieces, this is one hell of a goodbye to the greats.<br/><br/>5/5 - The Autistic Reviewers. Check us out on facebook!"

","Finally All we get the Wolverine we have been asking for, for the past years and it's his last time. Well i guess he couldn't have ended it in any better way as a last farewell to the fans and his signature role the wolverine .This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it's better than many of the previous X-Men installments . And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie.oh god.Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters.<br/><br/>It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really ""her"" movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. <br/><br/>There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless."

","I go to the cinema frequently and have been intoxicated by the trailer for this movie through the fabulous Johnny Cash song 'Hurt' ..... but as good as this trailer was, it v=certainly didn't convey the fabulous movie that sat behind it. It had been well publicised that this was the final swansong for two of its integral characters, but the sympathetic way that this was handled throughout was unexpected. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action and macabre killing, but there is a rather touching story-line underpinning I t all ... something that isn't usual in X-Men movies. I have say that Stephen Merchants portrayal of Caliban was a surprise, and it took a short while to get 'The Office' out of my head, but actually it worked. I would recommend any X-Men fan to go and see that, although that's probably a given anyway, but just expect something different ... and enjoy."

"Carycomic","9","1","5","3 March 2017"," The third and final chapter in one of Marvel Films' greatest cinematic trilogies.
","In X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, we learned that Logan was born in pre- Victorian England as James Howlett (half-brother of the youngster who would grow up to be Sabertooth). We learned how they became mercenaries in every major conflict in world history. And, we learned how he became a Cold War spy/commando whose skeleton became laced with adamantium in an attempt to create the ultimate living weapon.<br/><br/>In plain old WOLVERINE, we learned how he saved the life of one of his Imperial Japanese Army captors the day the U.S. dropped the A-bomb on Hiroshima. Leading to the debut of the Silver Samurai, over half a century later, as part of a convoluted attempt to make use of Logan's mutant healing factor-enhanced longevity. <br/><br/>Now, in this speculative sequel to X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, we learn the possible outcome of Logan's alteration of history. It is 2029 (twelve years from now). And, instead of a dystopian future ruled by the robotic Sentinels, we have a future in which mutants are virtually on the edge of extinction because of a mysterious drop in the collective birth of them. Well that, and a strongly hinted-at disaster involving the School for Gifted Youngsters and Professor Xavier's telepathic manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease, <br/><br/>Enter the high-tech mercenaries known as the Reavers and their leader, Donald Pierce. These guys are looking for a Mexican woman who ran off from a top-secret (and highly illegal) genetic research facility. One that's been using abducted Mexican women as surrogate mothers for what are basically test-tube mutant babies!<br/><br/>With the one called ""Laura"" (brilliantly played by newcomer Dafne Keen) being Logan's surrogate daughter.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is somewhat predictable. The mercenaries are working for one of those half-mad scientists who now find it more profitable to work for shady bio-tech corporations rather than trying to conquer the world. In this case, Transigen (a corporate front for Logan's old friends at Alkali Lake). Once again, they want to breed the ultimate living weapon. And it appears they have succeeded!<br/><br/>The form that success takes is the biggest surprise in the whole film. Unfortunately, it's almost cancelled out by what happens to the Munson farming family (played by Eriq LaSalle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse). I really wish they had been spared! I know they were introduced in order to serve as an example, to Logan, that one can have more than one kind of family in one's life. Nor does it necessarily have to be a biological one. <br/><br/>But, their getting massacred shortly afterward still struck me as counter-productive.<br/><br/>That's one of the reasons why I deduct one star from the perfect ten I would otherwise like to give it. The other reason, of course, is that this film marks the swan song for Hugh Jackman's almost twenty year-long portrayal of Marvel Comics most popular mutant. The anti-heroic one who was always the best at what he did! I understand he wants to avoid being irreparably stereotyped, like Adam West was after the BATMAN series went off the air. <br/><br/>Yet part of me still hopes that he might return to the role someday, once he's satisfied his search for versatility. A search that, I must confess, has ended quite happily for other movie stars who have undertaken it.*<br/><br/>*Remember Robert Deniro's precedent-setting portrayal of the comatose mental patient in AWAKENINGS?"

","I will start by saying that this is my new all time favorite superhero film ever created and this is the first time it has changed since the 2002 version of Spider-Man. I mean ""Logan"" had it all. The story takes place in the year 2029 with a bruised and battered Logan trying to make a living while helping out an aging and decrepit Xavier. The story then turns towards Logan being tasked to help X-23. I will stop there as to not spoil anything in the least. I will continue onto the acting with both Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Xavier giving the most awe-inspiring performances of their careers as these characters which have been 17 years in the making since their on-screen adaptations have emerged. The newest star Dafne Keen as Luara/X-23 did an outstanding job and Boyd Holbrook as Donal Pierce was a BADASS. The acting all around was a Masterpiece. The action is what most people are going to go and watch this movie for in my opinion and it doesn't disappoint. The action is gritty, gore-filled and gratuitous and I may add that it had a sort-of mesmerizing effect throughout the entire movie. The action was enthralling and the fact that most of it was done without the use of CG makes it even more fascinating. The cinematography is uncompromising and very surreal and each shot is done with such integrity for the craft that it can't help but be noticed thanks to James Mangold. I will close by saying this is a Must-Watch film. The film is filled with subtle nuances and nods to the old while bringing what is surely to be the new to the forefront. The film has a good amount of humor and also a heartfelt embrace that is soon never to be forgotten for as long as you live. P.S. IMAX is the Pinnacle POV to enjoy this film to the fullest in my opinion."
"Hyker","7","1","5","2 March 2017"," Best movie out of the X-Man franchise
","Logan had it's first show yesterday and I didn't wait long and bought the tickets as soon as I could. The movie is taking place in the year 2029. It starts off slowly by introducing the first 3 main characters: An old Wolverine, the even older Charles Xavier and Caliban. Caliban had his next appearance after X-Men: Apocalypse. In the first ~45 minutes you can already see that Charles is mentally ill as he gets a seizure since he can't control his brain anymore. Thus he has to take medicine and pills. Wolverine had a rough past as he received a lot of scars and you see him coughing through the entire movie. <br/><br/>All 3 of these characters are living in the wasteland to hide from society. Logan is doing a Taxi-service to earn some money so that he and Charles can move to a nicer place in the future. While Logan is driving around he meets a Spanish woman with a girl on the back of her car. That girl is X-23 (Laura Kinney). The antagonist is Donald Pierce, a member of a company that's developing child-mutants. (X-23 is one of those). Pierce is seeking for X-23 as the kids escaped from the company. Laura is hiding with Logan and Charles. The road trip-like movie is about Pierce chasing Logan, Charles and the girl. <br/><br/>The film has a good story telling, no boring parts, a nice setting with nice camera shots, good music, some really thrilling parts and there were moments I haven't anticipated at all. However it's typical for Marvel movies to have a boring antagonist. Pierce is very predictable, has no character development and is very clear from the beginning. He only wants to carry out his plans. All in all I enjoyed the movie and I'm glad I've watched it in the cinema. Recommending the movie to those who are a fan of the X-Men franchise and a movie with good story telling.<br/><br/>7/10"

I admit I didn't watch the previous two Wolverine movies, but I was completely drawn by the trailer for Logan and the different, darker tone. I watched it the first day it came out in Taiwan, and I came out feeling like all the emotions have been drained from me. <br/><br/>Logan is definitely not your typical superhero film. It's raw, and very character-driven. It was heartbreaking seeing how broken Logan and how fragile Xavier is. You could totally feel how distraught the characters are. And when Laura first enters the screen, she completely steals the show! Her presence is...wow, I was at loss for words. She was phenomenal. And she didn't even have any lines for most of the film! <br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, I can honestly say that this is the best superhero film, and one of Hugh Jackman's best performance to date. This is also the first time I cried watching a Marvel film. I know superhero films usually don't get considered by Oscars, but I think Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Dafn Keen all deserve recognition for their acting chops here. Well done, Wolverine, you will be missed. (Note to studio: PLEASE DON'T cast another actor for this role, like DC did with Batman! Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine, and will always be.)"

As no other in terms of style and genre, which despite coming from roots forged under the simple stylized ''superhero action'', ends up showing us an incredible side, a human and intense final for a character with a wonderful development. Logan is full of moments of action, incredible cinematography, beautiful soundtrack, incredible performances, an intense and realistic script, and above all, emotions. Quite a lot of emotions. This movie is a moving action movie, full of sentimental movements that serve both to show the weaknesses of the characters, as the fact that they are as human as the other humans in their cruel world. Logan is directed and created sublimently to deliver what is one of the best comic movies of recent times, setting high standards for future deliveries, if there are any in the future.<br/><br/>Logan is an amazing, entertaining, exciting and emotional movie. A glorious farewell for a glorious character. The end of a saga that has filled us with action ends up being a work of art that allows us to see human and inhuman mortality.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, it closes the story with a high score; excellent music, magnificent chemistry between the protagonists, a credible and human script, beautiful cinematography and a direction full of heart makes Logan a film of superior quality to any other of the same genre.

","In a nutshell, the acting is decent but the script and direction are awful. The quality of the ""drama"" is severely hampered by the absolute reliance on tired old cliches and a string of painfully predictable scenes. There isnt a single thing happening here that you don't see coming a mile away. But that's not the worst thing about this movie, because you wouldn't normally expect a superhero film to be some groundbreaking dramatic work.<br/><br/>I didn't like Logan because I found it very depressing and anticlimactic, and all of it done for no reason other than to be dark and gritty. If they were trying to go for a bittersweet sendoff, any sweetness is completely overshadowed by how depressing it all actually is.<br/><br/>After like 8 films with everything that happened, in the future all mutants have been outlawed and are almost extinct, everyone we know and care about seems to be dead, except Xavier and Logan who are both decrepit and dying and hiding in the desert, with insufficient explanation as to where and why it all went so horribly wrong. They both end up dying a violent death.<br/><br/>The mutant school, everything Xavier and the X-men did, all of their adventures, it was all ultimately for nothing. Nothing came of it. The world of the future is just awful and hopeless and the only mutants still alive in 2029 are the failed lab experiments made by Alkalai. Logan's character arc eventually brought him to a worse place than what he started off as - he's even more gloomy, more sad, more lonely, more sick and defeated than he ever was before, and he has sunken to the depths of despair so much that he's suicidal. He never got better, the world never got better, struggling was pointless, everything went downhill and then you die horribly and unceremoniously. What a great sendoff!<br/><br/>This film just presents an incredibly bleak fate for everyone, and there's ultimately no punchline for any of this. ""Dark & gritty"" does not automatically equal good.
Wolverine had a very painful, violent life. I feel that he deserves better in his old age than to drink himself to near death and then die on a hill murdered by his evil clone."
"amrikbiswas","8","1","6","6 September 2018"," The Wolverine I've been waiting for. 8.3/10
","Now Logan wasn't a cinema I was expecting to like at all. <br/><br/>I've loved the Wolverine character and Hugh Jackman's portrayal for a long time, but I absolutely HATED the X-Men movies. Ever since The Wolverine came out in 2013, I regained hope in the Wolverine that they could bring back a character and return him to his full glory. That was just hope though, I never thought that they actually would infact BRING him back to his glory. But a bittersweet glory. <br/><br/>When I heard about Logan coming out, I was ready to keep an open mind. And then I saw the trailer and I saw this, a Wolverine berserker rage. That's when I knew I just had to see the movie for the berserker rage itself. And it didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Logan follows an incredibly emotional journey with Logan as he deals with his body which has stopped healing properly due to something internally poisoning his body, the very Adamantium in his body. Logan is then bestowed with the care of a mutant girl who is said to be genetically related to him, in other words, his very own daughter. The movies follows the emotional troubles that Logan must face not being able to protect his loved ones anymore as he approaches death day by day. <br/><br/>I loved this plot, it was absolutely thrilling and emotional to watch Logan. The visual effects are really good and the classic Wolverine was revealed for perhaps the second time in theaters. The movie's psychology is incredibly well thought through and it's portrayal of responsibility is incredibly well done. Not to mention, Hugh Jackman's acting is superb and emotional and the portrayal of old Logan is spectacular. <br/><br/>This movie however like almost every other movie does lack in certain areas. In Logan particularly, I felt like a bit too much relied on the character's action and at times it felt like a silent film although I do admit that the silent attribute of the film really suited the tone, but there was a lack of dialogue. I also felt that the introduction to Laura and the other mutants is a bit poor. A big plothole I felt was that why did Logan even bother taking in Laura? Judging by who he is as a character, he wouldn't have probably have given a damn. What caused this change of mind? What caused this change of heart to feel some sort of responsibility? That I felt was a major plot hole to the movie.<br/><br/>However this movie is a truly spectacular farewell to Logan and I feel like it's worthy of a tribute to such a spectacular actor. <br/><br/>I can't deny that this is probably one of the best movies released in the past few years and is a must watch for any Wolverine fan. <br/><br/>One thing that really made this movie though was that it was MEMORABLE."
"anastasijanoth","10","1","6","22 August 2018"," Lifelike fantasy
","Best thing about fantasy (sci-fi, or other) it is that it comes from human mind. Purpose of it must be in the same place. Life doesn't offer us such fast, exciting, lively situations or characters. But it is a bit silly - if you are not a kid - why would you watch something so obviously exaggerated, unrealistic and therefore childish? Well, if you ask me, here is why.
Fantasy movies are similar to human dreams. Full of pictures that are not really corresponding to reality, however it makes you recollect, it makes you think, it makes you remember - some feeling, or unfinished business. Or it might lead you to the questions that you don't usually ask on daily basis, and the answers are not certain, so maybe better not to ask and not to know.
If you followed Logan's character, you'll see that in spite of all his superiority and awesomeness, his life is not either of those things. Moreover, it is dramatic and full of losses.
His powerful claws are both a gift and burden. We have something similar to it, consciousness about self and one's life, the one that goes beyond knowing when I need to pee so I don't do it in my pants. It's the one that makes you search for the meaning constantly. It is a bit of superpower that we all got, and very often we are not sure what to do with it. No return policy however.
Logan has a very long life, everything that matters to him passes by, but he stays. So the first feeling you could attach to his character is - other than ""wow, what a beast"" - is that he is alone. Our life, in the best case, goes in direction that at certain point we lose people who were our whole world once, when we were kids. They are no longer in the world that we are still in, and the thought of it is also lonely.
And so what now, with claws, with powers, with life. If you are not running for the cover of majority, that finds meaning in having more than everyone else, listen up. To be alive and happy to be alive, even for one moment, is reason enough to be here. If that moment is not now-wait. When it comes, everything else will be far back in the past, even if it was second ago. And it is real. 
Wolverine will be my inspiration for survival, for love for life in spite of all, for doing good even when nothing around us gives us reason to. It happened many times that I my ""powers"" made me suffer and that I healed even when I thought that it was not possible. That is why his story feels so close to a human's."
"rcling","3","1","6","1 August 2018"," Far too dark and not enough development
","I can't believe all of the high ratings being given to this. The violence was over the top, there was very little explanation or development of the X-23 character. If you've seen one decapitation, you've seen em all. Little Laura took on a whole platoon of goons early in the film and yet, at the end of the movie she did very little by comparison. 
Professor Xavier deserved a far better send off than the one he got in this film. There was virtually no development of any of the young characters we saw at Eden. Logan can take bullets, but he gets done in by a tree???? Really? And what was the point of an entire family of innocents being violently killed. They finally put some black characters in an X-Men movie only to be murdered for very little reason other than to get an emotional response? Didn't work for me."

"siderite","8","1","6","18 May 2017"," A better mutant movie, but still not great
","Compared with the ridiculous leotard dressed PG-13 heroes of the X- Men movies so far, Logan is a masterpiece. Yet that's really not hot praise. The film is a little better, but still the same old tropes used again and again: the reluctant hero, the innocents that need protection, the educated psychotic killer and his brawny psychotic henchman. I get it, it's the hero's journey, but could you please, pretty please, take the scenic road once in a while?<br/><br/>I thought the acting of the people involved was great. Also the idea of making an R-rated Old Man Logan movie was fresh. That is why my hopes were quite high on what else might be different. Other than showing blood, using s and f-words all the time and being depressing, Logan wasn't that much different than most recent action films, mutants or not. It might even have sequels, since it set up a sort of a New Mutants possible story line.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you don't expect the world of this film, it is enjoyable."

"CowherPowerForever","5","1","6","10 March 2017"," Sad ending to an overall great career of Wolverine
","Hugh Jackman has been the face of Wolverine on the big screen since the first live action X-Men movie way back in 2000. Since then not only has he appeared as the character nine times on the big screen, but he has voiced the character twice in video games. No matter your opinion or my opinion of this movie, the fact will always remain that Hugh Jackman will always be remember as an excellent Wolverine. The following is my review of Logan.<br/><br/>Logan takes place in the future, and one of my biggest problems of this film was how they ignored a great deal of the past films, even films that were meant to set up future events, like in X-Men: Apocalypse. I understand wanting to strike while the iron is hot with a R rated comic book movie, and the character of Wolverine truly lends himself nicely to the R rating, but as a fan of the character overall, I wanted more. While the film doesn't completely skip over past events, there are too many plot points they did skip over. Director James Mangold, who also directed the previous Wolverine film(The Wolverine) even skips over plot details he had in that film. While I didn't care for the lapse in story, I thought the overall film was average, I cannot even deny that the action scenes directed by Mangold are stellar works of art for a comic book film. He utilizes the R rating perfectly, and truly brings out the character of Wolverine for the first time in this aspect.<br/><br/>Another great aspect of the film is the acting. Lead by Hugh Jackman in the title role, the supporting cast of Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier and Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 make this one of the best all around best Marvel films in terms of acting. Even though my feelings about the story bring down my rating for this film, I want to emphasize that the action and acting in this film alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Marco Beltrami is the composer of the film, another highlight of the film. While he is known for composing many films that aren't considered good, no matter my opinion of this film, Beltrami delivers greatness in this score.<br/><br/>In closing, Logan in my opinion is a film that suffers from a bad story, a classic arch from the comics that was rushed into because of the success of Deadpool. Nearly every other area of the film delivers well enough to watch, maybe even more than once, but it doesn't delivery enough to make me give this a good rating or higher. Even though I give the film a mixed review, it is still worth the watch for the action scenes alone.<br/><br/>5/10"
"naveenes_krv","9","1","6","9 March 2017"," Brutally Matured!
","So the farewell installment of the iconic superhero wolverine was undoubtedly one of the best x-men movies and the best in wolverine franchise. This movie is so different to all the previous x-men movies made with no mind-blowing CGI and extensive action sequences but with a strong characterization and brilliant performances. The chemistry between all the three main and supporting casts were very much satisfying and minimal action sequences were riveting. If you are obsessed with WOLVERINE, this gem is not to be missed!<br/><br/>P.S. This movie is definitely not for kids as it had realistic depictions of violence and gore."
"DoomCro1","7","1","6","7 March 2017"," Great movie with a lazy 3rd act
","Most users have already written all the pros for this movie so I won't go into explaining the good sides. For the most part I really did enjoy the movie and it is by far the best in the X-men franchise. BUT, am I seriously the only one that has a problem with the transition to the 3rd act of the movie??? <br/><br/>I mean, for the first 2/3 of the movie, X-23 is set up as a character that is basically a savage, raised in a facility with no understanding of the outside world (just like the other kids there), she doesn't speak, she doesn't understand that killing someone because he asks you to pay in a shop is a bad thing, she is just learning how the world works by watching TV and listening to an iPod.<br/><br/>But then all of the sudden, not only she can talk, but she speaks 2 languages, drives a car, understands GPS coordinates, understands the concept of taking a man to a doctor (and finding one), knows how to survive in the wilderness, understands the concept of good and evil (explaining to Logan that she only kills bad people) etc.<br/><br/>And on top of that, all those Peter Pan-lost boys kids... how the hell did they get there all on their own? If they could do it, why was Logan needed to drive Laura there? How do all of them know how to function in the real world when they were also born and raised in a facility? All they needed to make it look more plausible is to put 1, just 1 adult among them. A nurse, a doctor that helped them, anyone could work.<br/><br/>It was all a great, realistic, grim story with even some interesting philosophical moments, but at the very end for me it just drifted to a deus-ex-machina ending."

"ecimir","7","1","6","5 March 2017"," A good but not great movie
","I am no X-men movies or superhero movies fan. I watched all previous Xmen and Wolverine movies and they were OK to me. <br/><br/>This is a movie with no satisfying introduction or ending. There is a lot of good and funny dialog in it but sometimes it is out of the place. The bad guys are easily the worst part of the movie. There is no single memorable villain in it. Action scenes are good but kinda repetitive. There were few times that I could feel that audience in cinema was bored. Overall, it is a good movie more focused on drama then action. I must say the IMDb rating is a way too high. Fairly should have be around 7.5-8."
"jontek77","7","1","6","4 March 2017"," Extremely violent, but well done movie with some major plot holes
","The X-men movie always leave you wanting for more, and Logan is no different. This movie is very methodical about removing any trace of comic book heroism and replaces it with gritty realism. What saves this movie is the acting for the main characters. What makes it terrible is the ridiculous violence. <br/><br/>Question: what was the last movie you saw with men in tactical gear with guns and no apparent order to anything? When was the last time you saw a movie with no gun violence? And why would a super power pharmaceutical company with limitless resources care about the Canadian border? Are they afraid of the Canadian Mounties of 2029? <br/><br/>When I watched this movie, I felt like I was watching any other movie these days. Senseless gun violence, people who exist outside normal society, and absolutely no moral values. <br/><br/>The comic X-23 story was too graphic even for a movie, but they did a good job with the actress they selected. That girl must have lived in a harness for months. The fights were done very well. But again, ridiculous violence.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart was awesome, Stephen Merchant was awesome. Hugh Jackman was awesome. <br/><br/>It was all the anonymous bad guys that ruined it for me. Hundreds of men, all with big beards, robotic arms, tattoos, and full tactical gear who are all following these horrible people for what: money? Prestige? Just plain sociopaths? Were they raised like the X-23 program kids too? These characters appear in so many movies, and it is a disgrace to all of our special armed forces and men who are contracted for security around the world. They are not mindless sociopaths.<br/><br/>So the movie is about Wolverine dying from heavy metal poisoning, trying to let Professor X die without killing anyone with his mind seizures, and going on one last trip to save a mutant after all the other mutants are dead. Clearly the writer has watched old westerns too much. I did enjoy the Shane reference, but it was simply a modern version of a western, twisted by the values of Hollywood in the 21st century. <br/><br/>You are better off watching the actual westerns, which are better written, acted, and have almost no violence compared to Logan. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the end, when X-23 has actual emotions, something she was denied her whole,life, and that Logan was finally at peace, not having to kill anymore. I really hope this is the end of the X-men franchise. I used to love the TV show when I was a kid in the late 90's. The movies always leave you wanting for more and never deliver.<br/><br/>Final note: if you take a child to see this movie, make it a double feature with Fifty Shades Darker, or something with lots of nudity and sex in it. They will end up like X-23, with no compassion, morality, or respect."
"fragya3000","10","1","6","3 March 2017"," The best comic book hero movie ever, period.
","It is a sweet irony that the reason that makes Logan the best superhero movie is that at its heart it is not a superhero movie. Wolverine, in the movies, has always been a reluctant hero but they have never properly captured how tragic of a character he is until now. Here we see him old and broken down, both in mind and body. He isn't an X- man, and he isn't wearing tights. This is the Wolverine movie I have been waiting for. It is grounded, gritty, gory, over- the-top, and surprisingly heartfelt. In short, it is everything it needs to be. A strong theme in this movie is the relationship between Logan and Charles Xavier, and I feel that it has always been a strong theme throughout the X-men movies. It really gives the events of this movie weight and makes the third act soul-crushing if you care for these characters deeply. I can't fault the movie though, because it handles everything so well and gives them the most appropriate sendoff that I have ever seen. The movie left me heartbroken at the end, but I wouldn't change a thing."
"anupapu8","8","1","6","3 March 2017"," Aaaa OK. Its good. And that's it.
","LOGAN - MAY BE , m NOT SURE , but MAY BE , HIGH EXPECTATION is the reason which spoiled the movie for me. Its good , true , but people are comparing it with THE DARK KNIGHT and TERMINATOR . And that's too much to say. Just because its dark , serious and totally ignores MARVEL kind of comedy , doesn't makes it as good as THE DARK KNIGHT. And I will be one of the few persons who will say LOGAN is not GREAT.<br/><br/>Let me tell you in this way. If somebody ask me whats the story of THE DARK KNIGHT or DARK KNIGHT RISES or even BATMAN BEGINS , it will take me a long time to tell the story. Because there were some long and complicated stories there. But if someone ask me whats LOGAN's story , i will tell him this - Its about Old LOGAN who doesn't recovers from injuries like before , have pain in his knees , bad eyesight , trying to take care of PROFESSOR X and who gets a task of saving a girl and delivering her to a safe place. And the movie becomes a ROAD MOVIE. And that's it , with reaching that destination , having action and bringing it to an end. The plot is very thin , they try to elevate it with screenplay which i think couldn't have been any better with this plot. Which make me afraid for some future project , because MICHALE GREEN one of the screenwriter of this movie , has already written three big upcoming movies (ALIEN COVENANT , BLADE RUNNER 2049 and MURDER ON THE ORIENTAL EXPRESS).<br/><br/>I particularly didn't disliked anything in the movie , but many things are just average. But there were some good even great things too. For a start , two action scenes , one in first 45 mins and 2nd at the climax were pretty great. And done with minimum special effects used just for Gore , Blood and Cuts(like cutting the head from the neck). Totally felt real. Will be a dream come true for Wolverine fans. But then again JUST TWO ACTION SEQUENCES , that too of 15-20 min long , not like more then half n hour never ending action sequences from Avenger. Just two action set pieces didn't quite satisfy me. There must have been at least two more.<br/><br/>HUGE JACKMAN in his last performance and LOGAN , a character he has been playing since 17 years , gave his all in the performance. Its not just the makeup but the tiredness in the expression of Jackman's face which actually make him looked OLD. His 'I DON'T CARE , ITS NOT MY PROBLEM' attitude makes us to feel that , he has seen plenty of things in life and now he doesn't care for anybody else . And yes , the aggression in the last action piece was great. Nothing more couldn't have been expected from JACKMAN . Although i would like to add that , even if i like HUGE JACKMAN pretty much as actor(not among my fav though) , the truth is that except playing WOLVERINE , he has done very few good movies , and i don't know what he will do without this character.<br/><br/>PATRICK STEWART is always good as PROFESSOR X (although i like the younger professor x more) , he was pretty good as a father figure to LOGAN in this. Also the FATHER-SON relationship(about which the movie also mocks a little) show in the movie was not very deep but little emotional which this kind of movies doesn't show. But again it doesn't go further in it , didn't explores it as much that it makes me cry. <br/><br/>X 23 or LAURA the new character is the movie was real BADASS. Not that much of an emoting character , she didn't said any dialogue until the last third act of the movie , which makes her relationship with LOGAN a little emotionless like she is not a HUMAN rather a ROBOT , but when she starts to talk , its compensate a little what the previous two acts fail to do. BUT and this is a BIIIIG 'BUT' , she was just outstanding in action scenes. Much more anger then LOGAN himself. And it would be great to watch her future story with a lot of actions. <br/><br/>One great thing about the movie was that it hasn't been made as a SUPERHERO movie rather made as a WESTERN genre film. Same as DARK KNIGHT had been made as CRIME THRILLER. But the problem was that , JAmes MANGOLD (the director , who is actually the director of my fav WESTERN GENRE FILM '3:10 TO YUMA') goes too far with it. He should have made it like a SUPERHERO being in a WESTERN scenario , rather he turn it into a total WESTERN film , having the only difference being the TWP ACTION SEQUENCES and the fact that out Heroes were not riding HORSES rather driving TRUCK. There was a whole section where they stop to eat dinner with some locals who invite them , which turn out to be such a bad decision and was a foolish thing to do from the start. That whole section was too boring.<br/><br/>The background score did nothing to elevate the scenes except the climax action piece . <br/><br/>I have just seen 2 days ago FANTASTIC BEAST AND WHERE TO FIND THEM , which had some exceptional piece of writing, which reminded me , this kind of writing can also be done in blockbuster film too. So sorry LOGAN fans , but i expect more.<br/><br/>. 7.1/10<br/><br/>by ANuP APu KuMaR."

The trailer with Johnny Cash playing in the background was completely apt at describing this films tone. Logan in a post-apocalyptic world for mutantkind finds himself at odds with his place in this universe and his own life over regrets of the past. Though never fully told the viewer is left with enough knowledge to know that Logan has a time limit physically and emotionally and the limit is almost up. The world is dire for his kind because the mutants have lost, and even though there is a few left the future looks bleak. There is no real happy ending in this film, there's questions left without an answer or a resolution only the tiniest bit of hope that the final few will survive as peacefully as they can but not flourish. Logan is a penultimate story of extinction. Well that's what I took away from it."

","This was a very different and much cheaper movie. Basically it was a cross country trip, fleeing to Canada. Family seems to be the basic theme. X Men growing old and dying out without anything to show for it. They lived their lives on the run and didn't have anything to show for it in the end. You would think that the world would gradually have more and more mutants. There are more and more pesticides and chemicals everyday. This was not the case. Mutants weren't born any more and the living were hunted down and killed. Since I consider Logan to be a action movie, I wish that it had more action. The reviews I read claim that this is the best Logan movie. While I am glad that I watched it, it's 3rd in my mind."
"paulstringer-56219","8","1","7","17 March 2017"," What a wonderful way to say goodbye (BIG SPOILERS)
","So I am personally a huge lover of Xmen, as well as Logan/wolverine! I have been since the start. But enough about me and my fanboy love of the series. <br/><br/>Lets talk about the film, so it opens to a gritty and typical fight scene where Logan (Hugh Jackman) is fighting a group of bad guys, however this Logan is old, and seems to be less able than his younger self. He has taken the role of carer for ProfessorX (Patrick Stewart) with mutant help from Caliban (Stephen merchant). So trying to avoid writing the entire plot down, it's lovely to see that marvel has aged the characters and the time as we are now in the year 2029. As the film progresses we get to notice the care between Charles and Logan, they have become like father and son (granted still dysfunctionally) this bond isn't broken through out the film as Logan tries to do his best to protect Charles. Moving further into the film we meet a new mutant Laura (dafne keen) who is portrayed to be like Logan, much to his disgust and anger. You will need to watch the rest of the film to see how that relationship ends! <br/><br/>So moving away from the plot lets look at the acting, as always both Jackman and Stewart's acting pedigree is on top form, they carry the story and plot well, as well as adding there own unique take on there relationship through the film as well as building on it from the previous films. I have to mention Stephen Merchants performance as he did well at being on such a big production, his movement between voice acting to screen acting has been great, long may it continue. Typical bad guy Boyd Holbrook gave an edge to the film, having never seen gone girl I wasn't sure what to expect, but he has a bright future I think, particularly in the hard guy action market. Dafne keens performance kept the film ground in a reality that this was about the future of mutants, although she spends a large part of the film mute, she does get dialogue and it is almost perfect, comedic and great timing for the film. <br/><br/>Filmed across LA and other parts of America, there was some great scenery in the film, the use of texture rendering and CGI was done well and kept the film flowing throughout. <br/><br/>The story was well written and kept you hooked throughout the film with a couple of great twists and turns to keep you on your toes. The screen writers did well to try and keep the story realistic and yet still in the marvel tradition. <br/><br/>Overall this was a brilliant film, with lots going for it, I personally recommend it for everyone who loves the Xmen and previous Logan/Wolverine films."

"dvoon-missy-mcmuffin","9","1","7","2 March 2017"," Thank you Hugh Jackman for your 17 years
","Growing up, i was and still is, an X-Men fan since the age of seven through comics. In truth, Wolverine was never a character that I had gravitated to. But I had a sense of sentiment for the character via association to the X-Men.<br/><br/>In the year 2000, the first X-Men movie was released on the big screen. Again, Wolverine was never a character that I had any inclination for. But it was through Hugh Jackman's portrayal of him, that the story was told from his perspective about the X-Men.<br/><br/>Fast forward 17 years later, this movie is not about the Wolverine, the superhero who seemed immortal, without any weaknesses, that goes on a rampage whenever to save the day by being the best at what he does. No....and i am thankful for that.<br/><br/>This movie is about the man named Logan. A character driven piece that hides a superhero beneath it. It is almost like an independent film that explores the flaws and tribulations of who the character is. We get to see his vulnerability and delves into his code of honor & loyalty to those he cares for. The telling of this story brought forth the man behind the superhero. <br/><br/>All the cast were great and a special shout-out to Dafne Keen, whom plays Laura very convincingly; amidst beloved characters that had years of history on the big screen.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws, but it made me care for the story of the man named Logan, whom defines him as the best at what he does.<br/><br/>If this really is Hugh Jackman's last run as the character, it is a perfect send off and thank you for playing Logan/Wolverine for all these years."
"maiyatang","8","1","7","2 March 2017"," I cry like a fool in the cinema
","I watch this movie today and I cry like a fool. I can't believe Logan, such a big tough man, can be so old and weak.<br/><br/>Besides, Professor X seems to lose all his ability and be kind of insane. He is no longer the people who is knowledgeable and guides others to do the right thing. He can't take care of himself any more. In the past, even though he can't walk, he was still independent. Now, he is so weak and flabby.<br/><br/>It makes me so heart-breaking, for someone loses everything he used to be proud of. It reminds me of myself. I used to be smart, confident and brave until the depression take away everything from me. I broke up with a boy I really loved. I am so afraid to do everything. I am always feel like not good as others. The more you feel proud, the more painful you feel when you lose it. <br/><br/>I don't know why they live so miserably.Where are other people? Are they all dead? Even Magneto, the man who can destroy the earth? I hope the movie can explain more or it has explained it but I ignored it because of my poor English. <br/><br/>I just can't understand what happen. Things go well at the end of X- Men: Apocalypse,but why X-men disappear here? I hope the company have a good plan to explain it. <br/><br/>Anyway, it will be a very heart-breaking movie for fans of X- men,especially Logan. Bring as much tissue as you can."
"gangstah_vino","10","1","7","1 March 2017"," Emotionally Drained by the mighty claws of WOLVERINE!
","Wow! This movie was quite the spectacle.. It felt like happiness, sadness, anger and very satisfied after seeing this movie. <br/><br/>The movie is about Logan being completely broken down and very depressive. He has seen everything and experienced everything in life. Everything he loved and fought for have all been given to him, taken away,given back and taken away again. You see his journey in his eyes which is great. <br/><br/>This is what you always wanted from wolverine. He said in the first x-men film that it hurt every time the claws came out and your finally felt that in this movie.. but the thing we all wanted to see is him going crazy... and boy did he.. I saw more blood, gore and amazinnggg action scenes throughout this movie than I could have ever wished for. <br/><br/>The acting was great all-around, especially the little girl who had to act just through her expressions mostly without words. I was sure almost sure her action bits would be just full of annoying cuts every few seconds, but it wasn't.. there were some long-shots which really made me question how they filmed that. <br/><br/>and yes.. i did let some tears fall out of my eyes. Im not gonna tell you whats gonna happen, but damn those were some emotional moments. <br/><br/>the only negative i could come up with is maybe the slow pace in the middle, but i never got bored. Though it was a lot of showing wolverine is DONE with life itself, it was darn interesting to see him this way. <br/><br/>The direction is amazing. You almost are in shock when you realize the director is the same one as knight and day with Cameron Dias HHS. This movie is another one, like the dark knight, that surpasses the brand great ""comic book film"" and can only be seen as A GREAT FILM PERIOD. <br/><br/>All in All, one of the heaviest films fox ever brought out in recent times... Thank god for dead pool, because that's the reason we got this r-rated masterpiece. I would give this film a 9.9/10. It just missed some story points to make the middle 20 minutes not feel as a slow-burn. that's it.. this movie is so close to perfect its crazy."
"cybit-26361","10","1","7","1 March 2017"," A cinematic feels train we deserve.
","Logan surprised me today in theaters. It is absolutely perfect with the way it makes you feel happy and sad within the entire film.<br/><br/>It is unlike any other super-hero movies (or wolverine movies) as it delivered a message that is always lingering at the back of our mind: ""What does the future hold for Logan?""<br/><br/>Just a heads up...There are no end credits for this one."
"FabledGentleman","8","1","7","1 March 2017"," Dafne Keen, a name everyone should remember.
","Well, just got back from the cinema, and i have a grin on my face.<br/><br/>This is truly a worthy end for the wolverine franchise, the character that Hugh Jackman has played so well for 17 years now. He has said this was his last film in the x-men universe, this movie is his goodbye. Jackman IS and forever will be, wolverine, and whoever is going to fill his shoes, is in for quite a challenge. And in this film Jackman plays wolverine better than ever, near perfectly balancing between the rage and bloodlust that drives him, and that of trying to be a decent person.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart has also announced this was his final x-men film, and taking into consideration that i think this might be the best x-men film to date, and one of the best superhero films ever made, Logan is a must see for all superhero fans.<br/><br/>Pretty much every actor does a fine job in this film, And to my surprise, a totally unknown actress blew my mind. The young Dafne Keen. Oh my god, a 11-12 year old girl that is a perfect cast for her role as Laura Kinney/x-23. I don't want to go too much into her role in this film, but she is amazing, truly amazing. Most fans of x-men probably know who Laura Kinney is, where she comes from, and what she is. It is really disturbing and fascinating at the same time, to watch a little girl play a savage beast, and she nails it like a experienced professional.<br/><br/>As most know this movie is set in 2029, where wolverine takes care of an old Xavier. There seem to be few mutants left on earth and they just try and stay away from everyone, but of course, this is not meant to last. Evil corporations and military hunts mutants down and kill and capture them. This forces an aging wolverine to give all he's got to try and protect what is left. And he is in for the battle of his life.<br/><br/>Rated R, this movie is not exactly ""gentle"". In this film you will see heads being chopped off, limbs being parted, shotgun blasts to the head, and so on. It's a really brutal film, with lots of graphic imagery. And i love it, a savage like wolverine isn't exactly the guy you mess with. But wolverine isn't necessarily the biggest badass in this film. He has some serious competition this time.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well made, the cinematography is good, the acting is good, the direction is good, the script is good, and the story is maybe the weakest part, but still good. But the whole movie is executed with care, and the decision to focus the entire story only on a few characters, was a very smart move.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is lifted one step up by Jackman and Keen, Two actors several decades apart in age. They are the perfect team, and they make this one hell of a finale. I urge every fan of comics and superheros to go see this film.<br/><br/>8/10 - Good"
"davidjemitus","4","1","8","15 February 2020"," A promising idea but a dark unpleasant film is the result
","Logan is an older man and Professor 'wheels' is almost senile.
Hhmm. X-Man films are meant to light and very bright and full of action and surprise.<br/><br/>This is dark and nasty.
The fight scenes are excellent. Hugh Jackman puts in a huge performance and Patrick Stewart helps where his character can.<br/><br/>Showing a young child committing such violence is a bad idea.<br/><br/>Overall the film is lacking the life affirming choices of X-Men and is just dark and unpleasant and I was glad when it ended."
"jamesnicholls-58600","7","1","8","9 June 2019"," A decent film but rubbish for X-Men standards
","Overall I felt this film was a poor and pretty unemotional end to the best X-Men character ever. I never jump on the bandwagon for the sake of trying to have a popular opinion and I won't be talking much about the acting and the screenplay and all the relatively meaningless things professional reviewers talk about in their reviews, the things that mostly make a film enjoyable are it's characters and story, all the other aspects are relatively meaningless, this just common sense. Though with the way other reviewers talk about them in their reviews a brain dead human would think their more important than the story for a film.<br/><br/>Moving on, I thought the acting overall was nothing special but nothing majorly bad either, Hugh Jackman's and Patrick Stewart performance was very good as usual though and for that I'll give the acting a 7/10, as the acting in my eyes only contributes to about 5-10% of how good a film is of course Hugh Jackman's and Patrick Stewart's great efforts are hardly meaningful to how good the film is.<br/><br/>I think Logan's ridiculously overrated, Logan's my least favourite X-Men film. I just didn't connect to any of the new characters and whilst it had Professor X and Wolverine in it the film didn't utilise their full potential. They could've had Sabretooth in it at the end and it could've been so much more tragic and emotional but no instead they had to have the one dimensional Wolverine clone as the villain which got hardly any character development and a random girl as one of the main characters who frankly had barely any personality so I found her pretty boring. There was literally no good and memorable characters in the film apart from Professor X and Wolverine, this is the main reason why it's my least favourite X-Men film. Zander Rice or whatever his name is was completely unmemorable as he was a one dimensional simple villain that had no memorable scenes or lines whatsoever, he had hardly any character development as the viewers didn't find out barely any of his backstory nor his father which they should've done as Wolverine killing his Dad was supposed to make him hate mutants but it's difficult to know exactly why when we know nothing about his Dad or what Zander knew about his Dad and really all his character was a person who wanted all mutants killed and that's it so he was a pretty boring villain.<br/><br/>The Wolverine clone for the pretty much the same reasons wasn't a good villain but I do think the Wolverine clone was a better villain than as at least the Wolverine clone could fight well and therefore give us entertaining action scenes. But strip away all the fancy action scenes the Wolverine clone gave us and what you have is a character that we nearly know nothing about and he seems to be a one dimensional overly simplistic villain that simply wants to kill everyone he doesn't like. Laura was a character that seriously lacked any real creative thought put into it as I can literally sum up her character in one sentence. She was simply a mutant girl who had been experimented on and never knew her parents, she has what I'd say is an average boring personality but with a bit of a temper. I can't speak for the average X-Men fan but that sort of character just bores me, not just for the lack of quality in the character but also the huge lack of stuff we know about her character.<br/><br/>The film wasn't that complex as the villains were very simplistic one dimensional characters we barely know anything about and whilst Wolverine and Professor X are complex characters with huge backstories their roles in the film weren't that complex, they were simply dying and fighting for survival, pretty basic stuff there. I think Professor X's battle with dementia and his arguments with Wolverine were the only somewhat complex parts of the film, so the film is pretty basic and therefore leaves hardly anything to deeply think about. I did like some of the jokes though, Professor X in particular made me a laugh a few times in the film so that was nice, Professor X's role in the film was probably the most complex in this film with his battle with dementia, but Wolverine's role was the most emotional.<br/><br/>The film, surprisingly wasn't that emotional for me, even Wolverine's death at the end was only slightly emotional for me as Wolverine was killed by a character we knew nothing about and his death didn't really affect anyone because Wolverine at the time of death only had Laura in his life whom he barely knew about, so the other characters didn't lose a lot when Wolverine died and I think that's the main reason why his death wasn't as tragic as it could've been. If Wolverine died in the hands of Jean Grey with the entire X-Men team crying at his death that would've been emotional but his real death was nothing like that. In fact his death was almost like mercy for him at the stage he died as let's face it his life was like living hell at the point he died so I wasn't very emotional at all when he died, half-relieved and half-sad more like. Simply put the emotion just wasn't there with this film, beyond a few laughs I was pretty emotionless so this film definitely didn't connect with me.<br/><br/>Wolverine and Professor X were as usual great characters, I enjoyed the aspect of viewing a weak and dying Wolverine, it was fresh and somewhat interesting. The action scenes were quite good too, particularly the final fight between Wolverine and his clone. However the Wolverine and Prof X could've been so much more, a great character can be so much more enjoyable if they interact with other great characters, so after Professor X you had one great character in the film talking to a load of pretty meaningless strangers really so whilst they were both great they were seriously under utilised. It would've been a lot better if Magneto and Sabretooth were in it, it would've been great to see Charles and Erik as well as Logan and Victor getting over their differences and their hostility to one another and becoming friends again for the greater good. At the end it would've been much better if Sabretooth was part of the final battle at the end battling some other villain and witnessed his brother's death, promising the dying Logan that he'll look after the mutant kids and protect them from Transgien.<br/><br/>I don't know why people like this film so much, I guess people somehow connect to random characters that are practically strangers and find random strangers interesting somehow. Overall this film had the potential to be one of the greatest films ever and in my eyes was a stunning example of a wasted opportunity. It was a decent film because of the great action sequences, a few laughs and 2 great characters but as it's an X-Men film I was thoroughly disappointed in it."

"mysteryvoiceman","2","1","8","26 April 2018"," I wouldn't recommend this movie
","To me, this movie was a very generic action movie. Nothing notable to see here."
"dcobbimdb","5","1","8","12 March 2017"," Didn't WOW me, left the movie kind of empty
","Obviously Jackman & Stewart and other supporting cast were really good and the acting is great. Effects are good and being the movie is rated R, there is definitely a lot of graphic battles & violence, as well as a number of F-bombs, some of which were funny. So overall I'm glad I went to see the movie, but there were definitely things I would have changed and / or didn't like. Given it has such a high rating here on IMDb maybe I went in with too high of expectations.<br/><br/>Length, this movie clocks in at almost 2 1/2 hours, and it feels every bit that long. I saw it with a friend and granted we saw a 10:20 pm showing, but I think he actually dozed off towards the end, lol... There are just a number of scenes that could have been shortened and overall this could have easily been under 2 hours and still captured everything it set out to.<br/><br/>So many unanswered questions, where to begin? Now I'm not a critic of loose ends or movies not explaining things, it kind of adds to the suspense and mystery, and if anything gives people something to debate about and can one day possibly be further explained in a squeal. So unanswered questions I'm not against. But this movie just had too many to the point where when it finished I was kind of left asking, wth did I just watch? Did Xavier kill all the other mutants when he seizured out? Did none survive other than them 3? What about all the other mutants in the world? Are they dying off for some reason? Why are Xavier and Logan in hiding or on the run in the first place? Who is Mr Whitey, what's his purpose other than frying in the sun? Then there's the big overall question of why Logan's healing ability is shutting down? We saw in the last movie he had some critter around his heart which temporarily nullified his healing ability, but once he ripped that sucker off he was fine again. It was hinted it might be adamantium poisoning, but after being in his body for 70 years it just now starts poisoning him? Doesn't he care that he's not healing & getting sicker? Is he just fed up with life? How did they manage to clone him into that X-24 younger Logan? I could go on and on and while I certainly don't mind a few unanswered questions, it seems like that's all this movie did was bombard you with a lot of mysteries and unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Finally the ending, so as mentioned ""spoiler alerts"" and while this movie had a deteriorating feeling from start to finish, you kind of knew it was going to end badly end basically every mutant we ever knew and cared about is now gone, except for this new group of kids, who I don't really care about. So maybe it's time to finally bury the hatchet, and we certainly have other Marvel characters and story lines in the hopper.<br/><br/>So whether Marvel tried to one up the Superman vs. Batman ending by killing off not only the star, but pretty much everyone (I actually half expected Jackman's spiked hand to punch through the rocks at the end), or whether they just figured it was time for this story line to end, which is okay... Overall I did like the acting and action, conversely it did run on in parts and I certainly got bored a few times. But to close out a entire MC line while presenting so many unanswered questions was the real kicker and kind of left me with an empty feeling rather than ""That movie kicked ass! What a way to end it!"" feeling."
"prestonwardcondra","5","1","8","7 March 2017"," A movie filled with a bunch of choreography, F-bombs and...not much else.
","My biggest complaint with this movie is that while the choreography, fights and stunts were very well made and put together, it was sometimes nauseating to watch.<br/><br/>The camera would twist and turn for every slash and blood that was shed in the movie. Considering this is a Rated R movie to begin with, I'm fine with the grotesque violence in it but, I felt like I wanted to barf half the time while watching it.<br/><br/>There were other annoying effects where Professor Xavier Charles was having a seizure and you would literally hear nothing but a character's heartbeat for a good 2 to 3 minutes in the film as he was able to recover via taking medications for himself.<br/><br/>In short? These dramatic effects in the movie played themselves too often in the film. This is one of those movies where you might be better off watching it on DVD instead of a movie theater.<br/><br/>Another complaint from me is the constant usage of the F word.<br/><br/>I'm sure I heard the F word in this movie at least 50 or more times. Whenever this movie airs on FX in 5 years from now? It's not going to age very well, if they have to end up bleeping out so much of the filthy dialogue that comes out of these characters mouths. <br/><br/>I heard more filthy dialogue in this movie than in all seven of the Fast and Furious movies put together. <br/><br/>On the positive side of things? For a movie that extended past 2 hours? The least I can say is that I wasn't bored.<br/><br/>But at the same time? This is another one of those mindless, derivative action movies that will appeal to geeks out there but, for everyone else? Not so much."
"cliff_bd","6","1","8","4 March 2017"," X-Men or not X-Men
","After seeing this movie I found myself myself torn between 2 views: (1) On the one hand the movie was good and kept me engaged throughout (2) On the other, I felt the X-Men / Wolverine story was ripped up and thrown away; basically this was not an X-Men / Wolverine movie.<br/><br/>If I look at the movie purely on its own merits, the movie is very good. The movie builds its characters well, fight sequences are great and acting is good. <br/><br/>If I look at the movie as a Marvel/X-Men movie, it left me feeling cold, although its still better then the previous Wolverine movie (not difficult)<br/><br/>The Wolverine and X-Men movies have always had a basic problem and have always failed to produce a story line woven into the X-Men comic/cartoon history. They have always deviated from the core story lines, no doubt the film makers thought that this would improve the film experience, however, they have always fallen short of the mark.<br/><br/>So yes Logan is a good movie but should be kept as a separate movie from the Marvel/Wolverine franchise and viewed strictly as a spin off"
"intrepidami","6","1","8","4 March 2017"," It's the best Wolverine movie...but...
","..to me that's not setting the bar very high.<br/><br/>They're calling this the ""Dark Knight"" X-men movie. I don't see it, I see the ""Leaving Las Vegas"" X-men movie. Where a dying, weak, alcoholic, suicidal guy is making bad choices constantly.<br/><br/>It's pointed out early in the movie that ""the plan"" is to buy a boat and hang out on the seas in their final days. They have some money, not enough. Here's the really not thought out part...why not just sell that really expensive limo? Ohh yeah in the beginning of this movie they have a pretty nice ride! I'm in Comic book Wolverines camp. Comic book Wolverine isn't the guy you surprise, he can literally smell you coming from miles away. Apparently this power of his was tossed in SONY's blast furnace. You can argue this movie Logan was losing that power, but not X-23. I understand why She and He don't display this power in movies, the hero getting surprised is a constant, cheapo plot device.<br/><br/>Comic Wolverine is the guy who can stalk Daredevil and not be noticed by him. Now of course they have Caliban tracking him, but it's not like he's trying to hide from anybody anyway. Wolverines ability to surprise his opponents is actually a mainstay in the comics! What stuns me is all the obvious terrible decisions by Logan that set up conflicts that could have been avoided in this movie. In a movie where he's supposedly trying to avoid conflicts.<br/><br/>Choosing to park a really expensive car in a ghetto, which leads to one. Showing up at a casino with a vehicle the bad guys and authorities are looking for, all shot up and telling them to leave it out front? It's worth a laugh, but is it a sane move? It looked cool to have Peirce show up alone at their hideout, but then to leave him alive? Especially in a movie where Logan kills dozens upon dozens of people? Bull! There's so much of these bad decisions I'm wondering if they were trying to say he had brain damage."
"alfie1275","10","1","8","1 March 2017"," Best comic book movie of all time.
","Logan is a masterpiece. Written, filmed and acted in such a way that it is much more than a superhero movie, it's far from your typical X-Men film. There is extreme gore and heavy swearing, but all of it fits perfectly without being forced into the film in an over the top way to make the most of an R/15 rating. The acting cannot be faulted across the board. Jackman has always portrayed the clawed X-Man well but this was by far his best performance, he makes it easy for the viewers to really feel Wolverine's pain and struggles as he ages. The same can be said for Patrick Stewart, portraying a 90 year old Charles Xavier suffering with Alzheimer's, his performance is truly believable and a much more emotional side of this beloved character is revealed. Dafne Keen is excellent, every expression and word from her is meaningful and further develops Laura's character. Hopefully we will see more of her in the future. The villains of this film are also very well crafted, their characters have meaning and aren't just villains for the sake of being villains which is the case in many comic book movies. The action scenes are everything you'd wish for in a Wolverine movie, with stunning camera shots making you feel like you're in the middle of the action. The music builds up tension well and puts an overall western vibe on the movie. Logan really is the movie Wolverine fans have been waiting for, with the R rating allowing Wolverine to be Wolverine, this film is adrenaline pumping. There are few times that comic book movies have featured effective emotional scenes, but thankfully Logan does this right. A genuinely good film, rather than a stereotypical superhero movie. It is obvious how much effort and care went into making Logan the masterpiece it is, an excellent job by everyone involved. Terrifically violent and beautifully emotional, a perfect send off for Hugh Jackman. 10/10"

You could easily cut out the ""Comics"" part, which by the way Logan himself states that are B.S., and have a thriller in the Mexico and U.S. countryside, with some elements of a road movie.<br/><br/>The fans must have not seen other movies. Honestly. The director changes the mood and feel to something that belongs to another genre, without being original for that particular genre, preserving basically the names of the now elderly X-men and produces an otherwise unremarkable movie.<br/><br/>I write these comments spoiler-free, but the ending has a serious impact to the whole mythology.<br/><br/>In my opinion Superhero movies must stick to their original virtues so can fans to see what they are expecting to see, and leave the unnecessary darkly humane elements for other genres.<br/><br/>."

","I gave it three stars, one for Hugh Jackman, one for the little girl Dafne and one for the visual effects. This last star actually is the reason why I have left the remaining seven stars out. It's hard to criticise these kind of films.<br/><br/>I have never watched anyone of the X-men series. They are just plain boring to my taste. I just saw some of their trailers etc. I cannot see its direct connection with the previous X-men series but this one (Logan) seems to be their follow up. Indeed it simply draws on the same failure lines of the all modern day DC and/vs Marvel series.<br/><br/>The summary of the film is all about hatret, destruction and killing. There is no story line. No character development. No plot. No text. No meaning. No science, no fiction, no use. All is about a hundred of people being killed by the blades of this mutant and his new mutant daughter. It's all about, when you get angry you will be more powerful than otherwise and you can solve your problems much easily that way!<br/><br/>This films targets the audience of age between 15 and 25 and I guess it is most harmfull to the emotional and logical development of young pupils of those ages when young men seek to habituate the correct behaviour under various situations. Ethical development is extremely sensitive. The film is constantly bombarding the same idea: when you are in trouble, use your blades and power and become a hero !<br/><br/>Of course, these films are not produced for supporting the healthy development of youth. Yet, practically speaking young generations are wathcing these sick films more often than they watch the correct examples. The bombardment is so heavy. For the last 20 years, Hollywood turned into an emotional sucker for young generations. Examples are all in the wrong direction. Decisions are all made illogical and emotional. Hate and evil are the driving forces, killing and destruction is the ultimate solution. This is directly and subconsciously bombarded into the minds of young generations.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there's no science or fiction in them either. The idea of a mutant at first seems scientific (and yes it's about DNA modificaiton of a living organism) yet the concept of mutant is used in the same manner as ""a genie in a bottle"" ; a fantasy film rather than science-fiction: It's not ""twenty thousand leagues under the sea""...<br/><br/>What a waste of effort to produce for them and time to watch for us..."

You need a good great director(and a good role) to show how good actor you are... Back to ""Logan"", here all the actors are very very good."

","There are those films that follow formulas and that are very successful and there are those that also become recognized and gain notoriety for not following formulas or for following other types of formulas not inherent to a certain genre. This second case is where 'Logan', by director James Mangold - fits, who had already directed the also excellent 'Wolverine Immortal "". FOX and the director decided to put a definitive end to the most acclaimed hero of comics and cinema, who followed for almost two decades and the final result is one of the great superhero stories ever written for the cinema. We are facing an innovative, courageous, incredibly creative film with performances and direction that enshrine this work and will make it remember for a long time In these more than 15 years on screen, adding both great adaptations and not so happy moments, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was in almost everyone.<br/><br/>Based on a story by fellow director James Mangold, the screenplay written by Scott Frank, Michael Green and Mangold himself was inspired by a more recent Mark Millar and Steve McNiven comic, 'The Old Logan'. From this story of the road - in which the aging and debilitated mutant crosses the United States in a post-apocalyptic scenario in which eccentric villains dominated the country to help an old ally deliver an illegal package - however, Logan's script takes advantage only the state of Wolverine and the idea of a dystopian future. The trio manages to deliver a first-rate drama, with a character development arc, with twists and turns and emotional and action scenes hardly portrayed in films of the genre. Being a superhero film is just one detail in the complex and striking plot. In it, we can follow a whole journey of self-knowledge and redemption of our beloved hero.<br/><br/>In 2029, Logan (Hugh Jackman) makes his living as a limo driver to look after nonagenarian Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). At his side in this endeavor, we have Caliban (Stephen Merchant), one of the few mutants left. Physically debilitated and emotionally drained, he is wanted by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a Mexican woman who needs the help of the ex-X-Men to defend little Laura Kinney / X-23 (Dafne Keen). At the same time that he refuses to return to active duty, Logan is chased by cyborg mercenary Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), interested in the girl.<br/><br/>Developing this idea of a dystopian future well, the director deftly creates this darker, darker world and the tone of pessimism is what prevails throughout the entire projection. However, it is in the list of characters that the great asset of 'Logan' is found. Anxious by the fans, we can see the family relationship between the weakened, calloused and scarred pupil Logan and the master, Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the most powerful mind in the world, who now suffers mentally with advancing age. And when the girl Laura (the excellent Dafne Keen, who dominates the non-verbal expression, showing a variety of emotions with just her eyes) comes on the scene, we have the idea of family again present in Logan's life. The interaction between the trio is what sustains Logan's actions throughout the film. In one of the scenes when they pass for a family, it is one of the best in the film, with several references to Professor Xavier's Mutants School and the relationship between them. Make-up on the edge of the unrecognizable, old and tired, Jackman and Stewart do the best job as these characters have since they started this journey. The film balances these moments exceptionally well with explosions of action and fury, setting the stage for a promising and liberating continuity from the shackles of the confused canon established in the X-Men universe in theaters.
At no time does he worry about being didactic, does not use cards or voice-overs to prepare us for this future, he passes on to us every information we need to know through his dialogues and does not waste time offering us the causes of all that . At no time did we discover Xavier's disease, Alzheimer's is only left in the air through Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), who is also the apparent culprit for the disappearance of the mutants, a fact that we also do not understand how it happened and, fact, we don't need to know.<br/><br/>The film already establishes the state of the mutant in the first few seconds of the projection, making it clear that his glory days are gone. Hugh Jackman arrives with a wistful air, red eyes and a wobbly walk. The excessive use of alcohol acts as a way of escape for Wolverine not having to deal with his biggest enemy: the guilt he carries for everything he did in other times. To work this out visually, director James Mangold bets on open plans to show the ruin of the scenarios and on closed plans to create an intimate connection with the people shown there.<br/><br/>James Mangold makes 'Logan' a road movie with several turns. Forget if you expect a classic superhero movie, with cover heroes and scenes full of special effects. Realism sets the tone, not only in the setting, but also in the action scenes. Logan also knew how to take advantage of his higher rating to give fans the brutal violence they always wanted from Wolverine. However, management did not use this freedom to deliver rampant gore and profanity out of context - everything was used for the sake of history.<br/><br/>It is not an action movie with dramatic sequences, but a drama movie with action sequences. The scenes of violence in the place where Wolverine and Caliban took care of Professor Xavier are visceral. It was also the first time that we saw sweet Laura showing a side that even shocked the viewer. Talent and pure competence of the young Dafne Keen, who manages to pass the innocence and sweetness of a child at the same time that she is able to cut cold and violently with anger and fury several of her persecutors. The graphic violence of blades piercing heads, necks, arms, viscera is present to exhaustion here and is repeated in the scenes of the Harrah hotel and casino in Oklahoma, on the Munson family farm, and the last act near the border for Eden. In all the scenes, brutality, strength and realism impress and shock the audience, on purpose. Filmed millimeter, each blow or injury is felt. In the X-Men movies we never saw Wolverine really release all of his anger and show off the killer animal he is. In 'Logan', the film is not afraid to show all the blood and violence it entails.<br/><br/>It is certain, however, that Logan - even though he idolizes his origin in the comics all the time - could have been more ""heroic"". Were it not for the claws and powers, the film would go very well as an action drama disconnected from this legacy of the hero. By anchoring him in a supposed realism, looking for the adult Wolverine that fans had been waiting for years and without really exploring the potential of villains like Pierce and the Butchers, Mangold and Jackman disregard another aspect of the character that was desired ... the super -classic hero, who is once again left in the imagination - in conversations about the past and what was left behind.
A superhero movie, a road movie, a western, a family drama, a farewell letter, a new start, which teaches you ""not to be what they did to you"". Anyway, a movie. A great movie. No label. Full of symbolism, James Mangold's feature opposes past and present, youth and old age, nostalgia and novelty to make the baton pass to a new generation. 'Logan' is a visceral experience that leaves the bittersweet taste of questioning about life and death, about the past and the wrong choices left in it and also about the possibility of redemption.
Perhaps the film will not appeal to those who seek something similar to other superhero films, but it will certainly delight everyone who seeks a melancholy, harsh, tense drama in many moments, but above all human. This does not mean that 'Logan' is better than traditional superhero films, but it is simply different, in discarding everything we could expect from him. And the most impressive thing is that the film can do this without being pretentious. It is a film full of emotional and unique in which Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career, honoring almost two decades playing the character in a farewell worthy of reverences marking his name in the history of cinema."

"williampsamuel","10","0","2","16 March 2019"," The Send-Off Wolverine Deserved
","After many years and some disappointments, X-Men fans finally have the R rated Wolverine movie we always wanted. And it's all we could have hoped for. Logan is not only graphic, gory, and action packed, it's also a work of surprising depth and thoughtfulness that does as much as the best comic book storyline to show us the real Wolverine.<br/><br/>The last two installments covered his past, to mixed effect. This film instead takes us to his future. And what a future it is. The X-Men are long gone, no mutants have born in years, and Logan can barely remember a time he thought of himself as hero. These day's he's just a down on his luck driver; renting out Professor X's limo by the hour to pay for food, booze, and the medicine keeping the old man alive. Until a seemingly random encounter with a desperate woman and a very special girl forces him to embark on one last adventure.<br/><br/>Marvel has given us many interesting takes on the superhero genre in recent years. They've done it as Hero's Journey, pared down revenge tale, ensemble spectacular, shoot 'em up spy thriller, and riotous self-parody. This is the superhero adventure as Man with No Name western. A visually desolate, slowly intensifying tale of a lone grizzled hero on the edge of society taking a stand to protect the vulnerable, even knowing what it will cost him. There's no happy ending waiting at the end of the line, but there may a measure of absolution and chance to truly feel alive once more.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is masterful in the title role. He's played Wolverine so many times in the last seventeen years that he's practically become the character, and he channels all of his experience and talent into bringing him to life once more. This version of Wolverine is far removed from the rage fueled, semi-feral monster we glimpsed in Origins and Apocalypse. But the anger is still there deep inside. Anger that the dream he fought so hard for is dead, along with all his friends. Anger at his own failing powers and declining health. And anger at himself for being unable to stop it. He's keenly aware that he's become a shadow of his former self, and it's eating him up inside.<br/><br/>The anger shows though in his bitterness, cynicism and disillusionment, his near endless stream of curses, his insistence that he doesn't owe anyone anything or care about their problems. But the anger is overshadowed by an even deeper emptiness. Jackman's every line and action radiates a profound sense of tiredness. It's clear that he's barely going through the motions of life. He doesn't want to fight anymore, or run, or maybe even go on living. But he keeps fighting because he doesn't have a choice and because at the end of the day it's all he knows. This version of Logan is so complex, compelling, and deeply flawed, and Jackman and the writers should both get an Oscar for it.<br/><br/>For his part, Patrick Stewart is sometimes profound, sometimes pathetic, but always tragic as the ailing, addled Professor Xavier. Once of the world's greatest thinkers- and its most powerful telepath- he's now reduced by dementia to a confused and often barely lucid old man. His introduction will make you want to laugh and cry at the same time. And the scenes of him bickering about having to take his medicine will be all too real for anyone who's seen Alzheimer's firsthand. Then in his occasional moments of clarity he's once again the wise mentor and psychic we know and love; a paraplegic Yoda.<br/><br/>Yet in a way it's almost worse then, because that's when the weight of reality comes crashing down on him, reminding him of what he had and who he was. And it's then that the seizures are closest. Seizures that can kill everyone for miles around, and maybe have. Even with this sci-fi twist, Stewart's portrayal is almost stunning in its realism. He probably deserves an Oscar too.<br/><br/>So Logan is obviously grim and somber, but not to the point of being overwhelming. Believe it or not this movie actually has a sense of humor, albeit subdued and rather dark. And rather than a maudlin tearjerker or a brooding emo-fest (like a certain other superhero blockbuster) it feels like an elegy to what might have been. Throughout it there's a profound sense that something went very, very wrong at some point, and that ever since the people in this film have barely gotten by, surviving among the remnants of their shattered dreams. On some level this could be an allegory for rust belt America.<br/><br/>But of course, this isn't just a brooding meditation or intimate personal drama; it's a hard-boiled action movie too. And Logan takes just the right balance between these elements. The slower sections, in which the story unfolds and characters develop, mostly retain enough suspense to keep the film from dragging. And the action scenes are frequent and long enough to deliver thrills and keep things moving, but not to the point of becoming boring or repetitive.
Plus they're really good. The fights are fast paced, expertly shot, and brutally visceral. The gore is a bit less than in DeadPool or Django, but there's still plenty of severed limbs and skewered heads. I particularly enjoyed the car chase battle, which was more than a bit reminiscent of Mad Max. And the final battle against Weapon X's latest creation was impressive in its brutality and sense of desperation. But the best fights are the ones with the girl.<br/><br/>The young Dafne Keen is captivating and downright awesome as a younger, Mexican version of X-23. When we meet her she's shy and unassuming, but when things get hot she turns into a whirling dynamo of claws and feral energy. Seeing her lunge, flip, and hack her way through dozens of opponents, latching on to larger enemies and stabbing them again and again like a homicidal monkey, one feels awestruck and perhaps unsettlingly amused by her athleticism and ferocity. It's like someone crossed Wolverine with Dora the Explorer, and it's absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean Logan is perfect. The filmmakers could have cut about 10 to 15 minutes without losing anything, and I was a bit disappointed that they didn't come up with anything more creative for the final enemy. But these are minor qualms. On whole it's a brilliant and breathtaking twist on the genre, a graphic meditation on aging, masculinity, and the intertwined nature of heroism and violence. It's grim, gory, profane, and sometimes profound, and it's absolutely the sendoff that Wolverine- and the fans- deserve."

","That's the question I ask seen this film.<br/><br/>The leads acting are great.

Could have worked IF this was something like Shot Em Up, or even one of those stupid christian movies like Children of Men. But as an X-men movie it fails on every level.
The timeline is completely ruined. I can make the mental gymnastics even to insert the Deadpool movies on the timeline, but this happening in 2029, and 50 years since no mutant been born - incompatible. Maybe if it'd been 2079, I could come up with a good theory (and I actualy did).
Then there are the Reavers. I mean those generic, throwaway, cybernetic minions. These are NOT Mojoworld's creations, not even anything special, not even technological marvel monstorsities, just tin soldiers.
Or how about an explanation why the Mutant Weapon Program got canceled? Because there is none. Or what about that ending? Where did those kids playing Hunger Games came from?
Also have no idea about The Westchester Incident.<br/><br/>The worst sin though is maybe this whole anti-science element how the mutants died out: the Government put fluorid in the water-system to poison EVERYONE. Not just in the USA, but on the whole Earth even! What's next, Flat Earth?"

I am not a big fan of gore but am ok watching it if it has it's place and doesn't make me gag. I just wasn't ready for the new version of Wolverine, face slicing death machine. Then there was the story line - I won't spoil anything but I found about half way through I was just overcome with kind of a sadness (because of some serious violence towards kids) and it was depressing so I turned the movie off, I wanted more of a fun good guys vs bad guys, explosions, sprinkle in a car chase, good guy wins - you know... every other Marvel movie out there.<br/><br/>After having some time to digest what I saw I went back to it more prepared than I was before.

","I don't know if this was a superhero film, or if it was a drama/action movie with a ""superhero"" lead backdrop. As grounded and realistic as Logan was, it also lacked that sense of adventure and fantasy, however, that is not this movie's greatest problem(s).<br/><br/>Logan never really did explain why or what was happening to, well, Logan. Why was he weak, tired and seemingly not healing? Logan is set after Days of Future Past, and DofP ends around X2 or X-Men at the earliest, so, that means at most Logan/Wolverine has aged ONLY 29 years in Logan, and that's NOTHING for him, so why, is he so weary? How or why is the adamantium now suddenly killing him? It's not explained, and it's suspect how even when the adamantium was ""mentioned"" as the cause, it was mentioned almost, in passing.<br/><br/>Also, Logan and Laura's quest to Eden didn't provide any closure. Did Laura and her friends actually reach Eden? Does Eden actually exist? If it does, is it in fact a Safe Haven? We don't know, and I doubt very much that Mangold intended for an Inception type ending here.<br/><br/>Then we have the family that died, the Munsons. No acknowledgement at all of the destruction Logan and Co. brought upon that innocent family was mentioned. Logan talks about how Xavier, Caliban and HIMSELF never asked for this, and he doesn't mention the very family who didn't ask for it the most, and probably ended up dying the most brutal death of all in comparison to everyone else.<br/><br/>One more thing; Are we happy with how X-24 died?<br/><br/>Logan is DEFINITELY not a bad movie, it is quite good, but, I genuinely do feel that people went crazy over it based on this ""super grounded"" approach it took. But being grounded is not enough to constitute as a ""Masterpiece"". I mean, apart from the above mentioned issues, you also have things like the fight sequences feeling incredibly monotonous and repetitive, especially because of that groundedness... The fights were no different to action movies' constant swinging punches, except this time, it's with claws.<br/><br/>Logan is good, but not perfect or ""near perfect"".

Instead what I got was a ruthless punch to the gut. <br/><br/>I donÂ´t really care much for the plot, which might deserve a lower rating, what I find compelling is how it beams emotion with an unprecedented power for a superhero movie. The setting is an extremely cold, cruel and hopeless future (seriously, way too much for my taste) but I guess this extreme setting is needed since the man isnÂ´t ordinary. The man has a regenerative power and has lived countless years, what would it take to make him tired, seriously tired and old? That is why this film is a triumph: the entire run time conveys how the world just passes us by, our body simply gives up the fight and even the toughest one perishes at some point, craving for eternal rest. The world goes on, for better or worse, but who cares? It might be exhausting but it certainly got my attention."

","What a ride! All my life I was an X-Men and specially a Wolverine comic fan, and than came the not so great Bryan Singer movies, what a let down for a comic fan in my oppinion.
One after another just giant flops that made me doubt if the movies were so bad or if it was just me getting older..until I saw Logan
What a raw, full of rage power riding it was, Logan has all the elements a great action packed movie must have, great performance by the main actors and a wonderful surprise with this girl Dafne Keen, she's got what she needs for a great future in good roles.
Logan nailled me definettely, I doubt one can see a movie like this any time soon

","We don't want the superhero genre to die out the way things do when they run on for too long, like The Simpsons. We want it to end with something beautiful, emotional, and unforgettable.

Seeing ""superheroes you care about in the situation of this film is weird at first, but when you understand it more and get invested into it, is unlike anything you would ever think to see on the big screen.<br/><br/>I watched Logan a few months ago and it hasn't left my mind.

"smucker-35803","10","0","2","12 December 2017"," Logan Review
","The movie Logan brought a dramatic and fitting conclusion to the Wolverine series. The 20th Century Fox film features Hugh Jackman as Logan, Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, Dafne Keen as Laura Kinney, and Boyd Holbrook as the main antagonist Donald Pierce. Hugh Jackman also plays the part of the bioengineered clone of X-24, made by Transigen. The director of this film was James Mangold. The movie is classified under action, science fiction, and drama and was released March 3, 2017. This movie earned an R rating and was the only film in the series to do so.
This movie follows Logan, the Wolverine, in 2029 North America, where nearly all of mutantkind are dead. He is tasked with transporting Laura Kinney, his daughter, from the Mexican border to the Canadian border to meet up with her friends and travel across the border to the refugee camp called Eden. Logan, Laura, and Professor Charles Xavier begin their journey and are immediately and constantly pursued by Donald Pierce and his company Transigen, who want to kidnap and destroy Laura and her friends because they are mutants. The group stops for the night north of Oklahoma City with a family that offered them their home where Pierce and X-24 attack, killing Charles Xavier. After a quick burial, Logan and Laura meet up with the other young mutants as they prepare to cross the border, where Pierce and X-24 attack again, where Pierce is killed by the young mutants and Laura killing X-24 with an adamantium bullet. Logan dies from wounds he sustained during the fight and the kids hold a funeral before crossing to Canada.
Purchasing the movie physically or digitally includes the Logan Noir option, which is the same as the original film but in, black and white, to give it even more of the feel of an old western that director James Mangold wanted. This grayscale helps to enhance the mood of the movie as well as represent that Logan is also aged, yet still a classic, much like many black and white western movies.
The cast of the movie was chosen very well, mostly because of the characters included in the movie. The directors thought that it would be better to keep a major supervillain out of the movie to show that sometimes heroes do not need to save the world, that saving just one person does not make them any less of a hero. Two of the main actors were brought back from other films, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Most of the other actors were not well known, so it is easy to avoid associating them with other works. This was Dafne Keen's first major role and has introduced her to the world in a great way.
Hugh Jackman was cast as the Wolverine and X-24 and helps to symbolize that Logan's biggest enemy is himself. At the end of the movie, after the children bury Logan and leave for the border, Laura comes back to his grave and turns the cross made by the children on its side, making it an X. This symbolizes that above all, Logan is one of the X-Men. It also symbolizes the finality of the series. Logan is the last X-Man, and his death represents the end of their time, the end of mutants.
The film Logan brings the best and most complete conclusion to a series that watched the generation of X-Men fade away. The Wolverine was widely considered the main X-Man, and he was certainly the last. The movie shows the finality of the series and brings a fitting end to one of Marvel's most beloved characters."

","The final Wolverine has come and gone and the review for this seemed to indicate that was one of the best superhero movies of all time. While I don't necessarily agree with this I think the film was an interesting approach to a fan favorite film hero and a balls out action heavy conclusion to the Hugh Jackman fronted Wolverine era in the X-Men franchise. It will please many people but I hope we have reached finality with the Wolverine character before Hollywood goes crazy for a reboot.<br/><br/>This film follows Logan who is now older and weaker. The adamantium skeleton is slowly killing him and he lives in a dystopian future where no mutant has been born for 25 years. He meets a young girl who has the same powers as Logan and has been bred from DNA garnered from mutants. The first thing that must be said is that this is a very different and more somber approach to a popular superhero. He is beaten and near broken but fighting with whatever kick is left in him. While I appreciate this more unique take in the Marvel universe I don't think its as stellar as people make it out to be. That's not to take away from a solid film in the hands of a director who knows what he is doing.<br/><br/>Its a pretty violent film, its expected from an R rated action film regardless of it being in the Marvel world. The fight scenes are intense and don't really let you down. The film is pretty simplistic and doesn't attempt to accomplish more than it should. Its pretty emotional as well. I would have liked more connection with some of the other characters of the X-Men franchise but this was all about Logan and that's probably the best way to go about it.<br/><br/>The film is long which i think kind of works against the film as the film could have been perfectly fine 30 minutes shorter. Logan isn't really my favorite Marvel character nor is he my favorite X-Men, but its hard to deny the giant impact and perfect casting that Hugh Jackman brought to this character. He seriously brought it to life, which is why I hope they let Wolverine in film rest because we don't need another Spiderman situation going on here. The film isn't amazing but its a different approach and a fitting farewell to a beloved character.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Dafne should at least get an Oscar nomination. What a powerhouse at just 4'. I thought all child actors since Natalie Portman in Leon (The Professional) are overrated and although Dakota Fanning was good. Scarlett Johansson grew up to be the liberal troll and Obama-Hillary apologist in chief followed by the latest 'Feminist' but topless, UN ambassador, Disney's first foray into gay icon-hood Emma Watson. Some line-up! Some hard acts to follow!<br/><br/>Along came Dafne (real name Daphne ), a selectively mute, kick-ass X-23. This girl has announced to the world far bigger than her pint-size that : 'I have arrived' and that too with a finely nuanced bang! Whoa Dafne!<br/><br/>But this last installment of the Wolverine saga is not all about Dafne. The plot is deceptively simple, the execution similarly plain. There is the story of some bad guys wanting to capture the DNA (and by extension, their spirit) of the mutants (so that they can make their own). The real X-men in the meantime have fallen on hard times. Money is hard to come by, medicines are expensive, and Border Patrol are seen doing their job. I am not sure if this was Hollywood's first attempt at satirizing the Trumpian America as the traffic of mutants (read 'illegals' or 'undocumented' as the luvvies would like to call them) flow from South to 'safe haven' Canada because the middle, the great US of A is not so great after all because the 'big corporations' with their 'defense-biotech' nexus is out to make a few bucks (for its greedy share-holders no doubt). Even some good old racism is not spared a liberal treatment where a bunch of hicks (Whiteys for you and I) come to grab land owned by a righteous, very nice Black Equesterian family once assisted by Logan and co. <br/><br/>The mutants are an endangered species but there appears to be no UN or PETA or even EPA folks bent to save it. So it is all, 'fight your own fight'. There would be of course no analogy with the gradual extinction of the White folks, and the future of the dwindling bunch of Mutants are conveniently diverse. Blacks, Hispanics, girls and such. I was not looking, but I think it was rather cruel not to have included a Trans-gender. What a shame! <br/><br/>Of the few left, Logan is one. Xavier and Caliban are others. But laws of nature are taking its toll on the aging flock, who retain only a portion of their self-healing, telepathy/telekinesis power which are fluctuating at best. Logan has resorted to being a Chauffeur/courier and if the little X-23 could be classed as a 'Human', a Human Trafficker of sorts! The 'good' type. Bad guys give the chase, meets with resistance, especially the fiery resistance of Laura who is supposedly Logan's 'baby-daddy' (the baby-mama nowhere to be seen). And she kicks some butt! The scene where she is screaming like a banshee to her Uber driver (Logan) in a language presumed to be Spanish/Spanglish or 'GodAloneKnows' (no subtitles- how racist!) despite more and more timid orders of 'shut up' from Logan is pure acting heaven. This girl will go places. And born of American and Spanish parents, I hope she grows up to remember that we are interested in her acting prowess, not her political opinion or one-liners on Twitter pretending that she can solve the World's problems in 140 characters. Lord alone knows if the liberal stalwarts named here can even spell the word politics, although to be fair, Natalie Portman (born Hershog in Jerusalem) went to Harvard and Emma Watson apparently graduated (after suffering much bullying for being famous and a zillionaire..boo hoo!) from Browns. Not that they are privileged or anything!<br/><br/>Across the great landscape of America the trio (three generations of mutants) travel, chased relentlessly by the baddies, shepherded by the good doctor played with the villainous flair Richard Grant has become known for, heads gets beheaded, ass gets kicked, you know the drill. But the real beauty of this movie comes from the humane treatment of Logan, and his nascent and evolving bond/attachment with Laura, and the re-statement of his bond with the aging, cantankerous but essentially well meaning Patrick Stewart as Prof Xavier. There are moments of reflection, self -pity by the bucketful and some home truths being spoken by Logan, played magnificently by Hugh Jackman, better than his previous renditions I dare to add. The cinematography is good, direction pretty tight with minimal grand-standing and the score is fine (it won't get any Oscars, let's stop at that). The baddies do a decent job although why they are so singularly incompetent to take one shot accurately remains a mystery to me. <br/><br/>In the end, it is business as usual. Any more will get me banned for not selecting *Contains Spoilers* and normal service resumes. America has remained Great by having diversity amongst us, Canada remains the ultimate moral high ground from where Justins (both Tredeau and Bieber) rule, Mexico remains the lawless hell-hole and Hollywood after its obligatory America bashing and Trump bashing (although to be fair they do not take his name) leaves room for sequels. Isn't life wonderful?<br/><br/>Now we can go back to protests, hashtags, Geriatric Meryl Streep grandstanding at the pre-Oscar media buzz, bemoaning the good old days as if any one gives a rodent's nether region and Patrick Stewart campaigning for Second Independence Referendum for Scotland. Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer not having left USA despite the fascist regime there, proclaiming that they love the fact that they are fat. Meanwhile, in screens across America and elsewhere, Dafne kicks serious butt. Watch out for this little dynamite."

","I feel obligated to mention that I have seen all the other movies featuring Hugh Jackman. I don't really like any of them especially. Some are decent and others are sort of bad and forgettable. The context and history surrounding it are apparent to me, though they don't do too much to influence my feelings on this particular film. <br/><br/>All that being said, this film is probably the best I've seen featuring this portrayal of this character. It's legitimately pretty good. Some of what some people would say makes it exceptional though I think is sort of relative. The fact that it has a stronger emotional core and more adult story than its predecessors doesn't mean that on its own its a great film. It's certainly refreshing considering the franchise as a whole, but only really from a story perspective. In its execution I can't say that beyond the especially violent action, which is pretty neat, it really goes above and beyond in any major way. Despite one memorable shot, the visual nature of the film doesn't really feel like it represents a unique voice. I have never seen a film from James Mangold before, besides The Wolverine, and I honestly don't think I could make much of an educated guess on what any of his other films are like based on this one. In all honesty it seems like he did a lot more for this film as a writer than as a director. That isn't to say that the direction is bad or that the story is amazing, but relative to the rest of the franchise one did a lot more to elevate this film than the other. <br/><br/>Like I say, the story isn't amazing. It's good, and it helps this film to stand on its own, but there are definitely some logical lapses (How did he not see those cars earlier, how does she know how to use that gun, etc). I will say though, to Mangold's credit as both a writer and director, there were parts of this film that, while cheesy, could have been way cheesier and potentially ruined the film. It is solid on its own, but I would concede that, despite not really liking the franchise all that much, this story inevitably holds a greater emotional value for you if your a long time fan of this character and of these movies. <br/><br/>It's got something for everyone. Check it out or don't. You'll probably get out of it what you expect, and what more could you ask for?"

","Sorry for my English, no practice for 10 years. But i hope you'll get it.<br/><br/>Good: 1. Best x-man universe movie ever made. For the first time they tried to do something close to reality and real man. Behind reality i mean characters. The look and act alive (in most parts). Good guys have their problems and feelings. Casting of good guys is very certain. <br/><br/>2. Picture itself bloody and nicely done. Graph settings is enough :-) and not overloaded as all marvel movie. Its not a same-same marvel movie that hold only at ""look, we destroy 100500 buildings in NY with nice effects"". <br/><br/>Bad: 1. Sadly predictable. You know what is coming in 1-2 steps forward. 2. Bad guys are flatty 2d characters. No character development, no trusted story, no charisma. This movie about good guys and how they make their choices. And what are the consequences of those. Bad guys is just a weak background.<br/><br/>I think marvel wanted to have their own Dark Knight. But Christopher Nolan was busy.<br/><br/>And surely they played ""Last of Us"" by Naughty Dog, exclusive for PS4 :) Even music come close to it. And all story come close to it in characters. Old guy with good soul inside heavily disturbed by mistake he made if past meets girl who reminds him about that silenced good part inside.<br/><br/>When i left cinema i think that overall its a nice entertainment without any bonus thoughts to think about."
"chiendh","Null","0","3","25 March 2017"," A solid Marvel movie worth the theater ticket if you have nothing better to watch and simply want action.
","SPOILERS -------- -------- Many have followed the Xmen since the beginning, and there are many different takes on turning the stories into movies. In this movie, it's pretty much focused on Logan and his young sidekick, and the scope of the movie isn't as big as in other Xmen movies that has Wolverine in it.<br/><br/>For example, the locations Logan visits are pretty simple - factory plant in the desert, hotel tower, home in woods, etc. None of the fancy CG house overlooking the water ala Iron Man, and this makes many of the locations secondary to the strong acting and storyline.<br/><br/>Luckily, the action is solid for comic book heros, and you've got some unique attack ideas going on that makes viewers looking for cool moves keep looking. The fights are well-balanced, and you know it's a pull and push until the end between the good and bad guys. Nothing is so easy that you suddenly stop watching and paying attention because you know what'll happen next. There's enough surprises to make most action flick fans keep watching.<br/><br/>The sidekick is very good in her role. Well cast, acts appropriately for her powers, and matches well with Logan. Looking forward to seeing her in future Xmen movies.<br/><br/>The sound and sound effects support the movie, well done, and sometimes surprising for how much they add to the movie (eg. whenever the Professor has a 'moment'). Definitely Dolby Atmos theaters!<br/><br/>Crisp and clean scenes and editing. Moves along very nicely, much better than sluggish Rogue One or Beauty and the Beast yawners, and exactly what an action film should do. Start interesting, add stakes quickly, and keep that train moving along faster and faster until the end.<br/><br/>This movie along with the prior where Logan was in Tokyo are among the better made Wolverine movies for his character. The ending of the latter was a bit over the top for having his powers sucked into a 'battle armor robot', but here, it's appropriate for all that Logan has gone through and closes the series of stories about Wolverine appropriately.<br/><br/>Decently 'isolated' from the Xmen timeline that you don't really need to understand or see the other movies to enjoy this movie fully. If you do rewatch all of them with Wolverine in it from the beginning afterwards, it simply adds to the enjoyment to this film by fleshing out Logan's history.<br/><br/>Worth the full price movie ticket, and even a second DVD rental."
"davidgee","8","0","3","24 March 2017"," Wolverine and Mini-Me
","This is Hugh Jackman's widely announced 'swansong' as Wolverine/Logan, the mutant with adamantine knives in his knuckles. As the movie opens, he seems more mortal than super-hero, care-worn, drinking too much, driving a stretch limo near the Mexican border to pay for the meds desperately needed by ailing Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). A young girl, Laura, arrives in their lives, pursued by mutant- hunters: she's a Mini-Me version of Wolverine, possessed of similar talons and talents. Logan gets his 'mojo' back and he and Laura fight off the first wave of hunters. But there are more where they came from, directed by a Frankensteinian doctor (Richard E. Grant) in whose lab the girl was created, along with a Terminator version of Wolverine. The rest of the movie is chase and run, fight and run – pretty much the standard fare of the X-MEN franchise. The fight scenes, of which there are many, are fairly visceral with now four sets of blades chopping up the baddies.<br/><br/>The world-weariness and a certain elegiac quality raise this above the mainstream of Marvel adaptations. Jackman and Stewart, two very charismatic players, give more nuanced performances than the genre normally allows. Stephen Merchant makes his mark in a cameo as a kind of super-albino. We may see more of Laura (Dafne Keen) if she takes over Logan's role in the next X-MEN instalment: will she be 'Wolverina'? And will there be another Final Chapter to usher Magneto into the Twilight Home?"

","Plot: In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X somewhere on the Mexican border. However, Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are upended when a young mutant arrives, pursued by dark forces.<br/><br/>I'll be honest when I watched the trailers for this film, I thought it would be a boring and uninteresting film and another failure for a Wolverine film. However, I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this film. I was generally surprised by how the story was told along with the cast doing a very good job playing their characters especially Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant and especially Dafne Keen.<br/><br/>Dafne Keen was a big surprise considering some child actors would just be portrayed as annoying and cliché, this was not the case with her, she excelled as this character portraying the right amount of emotion at the right time. The action in the film is well shot, not using any shaky cam or fast cut editing which I was happy with just like I was with John Wick Chapter 2.<br/><br/>Another thing I should praise is the cinematography which is gorgeous which is shocking to me since I didn't think it looked that great in the trailers which made it look very low budget.<br/><br/>My only problems were the length, this film needed to be cut down about 20-30 minutes and that would've helped the pacing at times, and that most of the villains(save for Boyd Holbrook) were very one dimensional and weak. Besides that this is a surprisingly good film in the inconsistent x-men film franchise, I don't think this is The Dark Knight of comic book films, that is pushing it, but it's a film that you should go see if you're a comic book film or even a movie fan in general."
"nathanpmetz","10","0","3","18 March 2017"," Not the Best Movie Ever Made, But Perhaps the Most Powerful One
","Putting two Master-class actors with Jackman and Stewart together on the big screen for one last time produced a dramatic, heart-wrenching, endearing, and timeless heavyweight. This is not a movie for younger viewers whatsoever.. It grapples with the heavy moral minefields of child exploitation, suicide, terminal illness, messy family dynamics, and undeserved suffering befalling very good people. <br/><br/>These are not Marvel's usual backstories to their vaunted X-Men series, yet Mangold creates a very raw yet real fabric to the film from the first scene to the last. Don't expect the early 2000's X-Men in leather suits with perfect hair - and yet what a welcome detour we are taken down a road untraveled. I can't emphasize enough how much better, deeper, more engrossing, entertaining, and thought provoking Logan is to Singer's dumpster fire with Apocalypse (2016). <br/><br/>Parents beware, your emotions regarding your own children will be seared by Jackman's gritty and cut-to-the-bone performance - I have never seen him better in the previous 6 X-Men installments. The relatively unknown Dafne Keen handles her multi-faceted role with absolute precision - what an impressive surprise from such a young lady that further magnifies the tour de force by Jackman and Stewart. <br/><br/>And if you're keen for some good ol' slashing and gashing by Logan's ill-tempered claws, then you're in for ridiculously well-crafted battle scenes that haven't been witnessed before in the 17-year series history. It will take a lot of time to unpack and digest the 2+ hours of Logan, but it is well worth your mind's and heart's investment. We may very well never see a superhero movie like this again in our lifetime."

And from first scene you know what type of movie this is going to be.<br/><br/>I have to say this though, the version of movie that was screened here in Nepal was cut in different places that amount to about 4 minutes in cuts and muted dialogues.<br/><br/>Even then the movie that I saw was, simply put, awesome. Logan is old and Charles is not that healthy either and their quiet, secluded live is turned upside down when a young girl shows up to their doorstep. And that's it, we have ourselves a road movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing...expected coming from a guy who shot Gladiator. The direction is good and the story is compelling. Not your average bang em up superhero movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as his last turn as the Wolverine does a believable job and everyone expects Patrick Stewart to do a great job, so no surprises there. But the real surprise is the child actor, the girl who show up at Logan's door step.

Like we haven't seen since X-Men 2.<br/><br/>The story of Logan is brilliant, and it is very emotional and powerful. Not only is the banter between Logan and Charles perfect, but the acting is ... gold. I would go on to say both actors deserve Oscar nominations for their efforts, because it is that good. And it is not just them, the young actress Dafne Keen gives a breakthrough performance, and her acting is totally believable, and she acts very well along side these other two power-houses. Every performance is great, from the minor characters, to even the group of kids. There is nothing to fault about the acting at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is not for everyone. While X-Men fans will love it, some may find it to be a little slow, especially when compared to all the other instalments. This is not action packed, it's slow and takes time with the characters. There are parts that are very slow, and halt the story a little, but not enough to make it become boring.<br/><br/>Aside from the overall story and acting, the technical achievement of this movie is its best aspect. This movie had a budget of $97 million, and it looks beautiful. From the fantastic cinematography to the visual effects. It just shows you that you don't need a massive budget to pull a movie this powerful off. Look at Wolverine: Origins, $150 million, and that movie looks like it was made by a bunch of amateurs. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is fantastic. I would say it is one of the best in the series, but not the best, I think Days of Future Past still holds that spot, but this is one of the better ones. <br/><br/>8.4/10"
"avanjit-20257","Null","0","4","16 March 2017"," the truth
","Logan. So this is the end huh....the end of the X-Men franchise....... But unfortunately not quite big of a finale it was, not as expected at least. Was expecting a lot to be honest, a Grand-Show -Down kind of a movie but instead what I got was just a plain old movie with some pale moments that reveal the truths about life with great intimacy. Is that it or is there more.<br/><br/>Probably there is more to this movie than that of course. The thing about this movie is that it doesn't deal with the end of the franchise; instead it deals with the emotions of a human being. Emotions which even the genetically enhanced human beings can't afford to not pay attention to, even if it's done unknowingly. And the way they show it is slightly better than just being considerable. And thus if it rings any bell, this is the main reason the movie is being called ""Logan"" rather than being called ""Wolverine"" or any other name related to the part inside the main character which does nothing but reveals about the temporarily- interesting facts about him like his powers. This movie may not show Wolverine's most capable moments of all time and for the last time but for sure it shows the efforts of a lesser capable Logan to try and protect the last mutant race. It also shows his necessity to die and die for a good old reason that every real hero dies for, and that is to protect others, and that is the moment you become an actual hero. A sacrifice is all you need to become a hero. And finally I'd like come to a conclusion. Not about the movie but about the whole franchise that all this time Eric Lesher was actually right over Charles Xavier and so this brought us to this probable future, the extinction o all the mutants!"
"CJFouraki","9","0","3","14 March 2017"," The first time I've liked Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.
","I'm a big fan of Wolverine in the comics. As for the movies, not too much. I never liked Hugh Jackman in the original 3 X-Men movies as he never really sold the character for me or had much depth to his performance. Origins was a disaster. Then he had his first great Wolverine scene in First Class where he only uttered 2 words. Then came Mangold's the Wolverine, where I actually didn't mind Hugh Jackman and thought Wolverine was getting better as a screen character. Days of Future Past happened and I thought Jackman was alright there as well. X-Men Apocalypse came soon after and Wolverine had a disappointing, B-Grade level action sequence. Now, Mangold returns with a superhero movie to rank with the best. Logan is not just a great superhero film, it is a great film. Period. I finally respect Hugh Jackman in the role. <br/><br/>And it's about f**king time they did an R rated Wolverine film! Can't believe a garbage character like Deadpool got one before Wolverine.<br/><br/>Acting - Hugh Jackman finally delivers a layered, emotionally charged performance as Wolverine, giving the character his first real, proper glory. Patrick Stewart is once again, awesome as Professor X, now more gritty and human, a more developed character than before. Daphne Keen, for an 11 year old girl, had a really good, intimidating persona about her and did well as Jackman's sidekick. Stephen Merchant added dramatic layering to his usual comedic performances and was a joy to watch, even with less screen time than the other characters. Boyd Holbrook played a good villain, being both humorous and savage. Overall, no weak performances from the leading cast. Otherwise, some of the other children were a little weak.<br/><br/>Story - A simple story, but one that allowed the characters to explore their relationship as well as themselves, which is an important thing a story should do. It creates a world where it doesn't jam exposition in your face, but instead lets the audience soak it all in and fill in the pieces themselves. Had the elements of a modern day western, like No Country For Old Men, with almost the same amount as viciousness to it. Had a steady pace and really ramped it up towards the end, providing a really great and emotional pay-off. I was originally disappointed that they were just using themes of Old Man Logan (comic which Logan is based off of) rather than the entire story itself, but I was pleasantly surprised with the final concept.<br/><br/>Action (Cinematography an Editing) - Finally, we get to see the REAL Wolverine. The best at what he does. And what he does isn't pretty. Hardcore to the max, the action scenes are phenomenal and really show the true nature of Wolverine, as a force to be reckoned with. Mangold really nailed the action scenes, all of them feeling unique and fresh as to not get stale. The hotel and forest scene were absolutely brutal and brilliant, being well shot and looking stunning. Since it's an R film, there's no more garbage quick edits or shoddy camera work to hide Wolverine's kills. We now get to see smooth action sequences that have a real meatiness to it, almost to the caliber of a bone crunching Zac Snyder action sequence. The final shot was also really great.<br/><br/>Writing and Characters - The characters finally get to explore themselves, bringing out emotions and thoughts we never usually see from Logan or Prof X in the previous films. We really do get to see the troubled psyche of Wolverine as he learns how to be with others, whilst simultaneously showing a need to distance himself from others. We get to see the beast within as he kills mercilessly to protect innocents. Prof X, as stated before, is more gritty and human, coming to terms with his own mortality whilst trying to help Logan find his, and their relationship feels genuine because of this. The dialogue is mostly great with maybe a few F-bombs being forced at the start of the film, but very quickly felt natural and smooth, flowing with the dialogue. A lot of people are complaining about the nudity scene, but honestly, who cares? It's just showing the kind of society they live in, the people he meets, etc. Overall, minimal problems.<br/><br/>Soundtrack - I heard some unique tracks during action sequences which I liked. There were these sort of skewed, high pitched noises that really built on the uneasiness of the situation.<br/><br/>Although I'd always imagined Mel Gibson as the perfect Wolverine, Hugh Jackman finally proved himself to me in this epic film. It's also a shame now that I've started to like him, he's no longer continuing the role.<br/><br/>Wolverine fans can rejoice now that we have a proper R rated Wolverine film in line with the comic character that we all love. I had a great time with this movie, even though it is quite depressing to watch. I rate this up there with the 4 other untouchable super hero films: Watchmen, Dark Knight, Batman Begins, Iron Man. Logan joins the ranks of the greats.<br/><br/>But I think overall, the reason I like those movies and Logan so much, is that they don't just try to be great superhero films, they also aspire to be great films in general, elevating themselves above the mediocrity of all the other films of its genre. <br/><br/>Logan is a great film. And we have James Mangold, Patrick Stewart and (I'm so happy I finally get to say this) Hugh Jackman to thank for making such a brilliant Wolverine film.<br/><br/>8.5/10<br/><br/>Go watch it, bub."
"alveyhasin","8","0","3","13 March 2017"," Dying mutant meets his daughter and goes on a road trip
","LOGAN<br/><br/>The polar opposite of Deadpool yet similarly unique, I loved how the movie was simultaneously gruesome and emotional. I have been suffering from sort of an exhaustion after the mass proliferation of superhero movies. Every month seems to bring along a new addition to the now uber popular genre. And after the very meh X-Men Apocalypse, Logan was a refreshing entry, defying the conventional nuances that constrain most comic book movies. With a much more considered approach compared to its prequels, Logan establishes characters with touching relationships in a rather realistic setting. No scenes of mass destruction or villains with crazy powers. When it was indeed clobbering time, man the action choreography was majestic. The fighting scenes were very well portrayed with brutal punches and slashing. Laura stole the spotlight with her first action sequence. Seeing grown hard ass military men cowering in fear of her claws was sooo gratifying. <br/><br/>The premise is initially difficult to understand. Disconnected from the previous X-Men and Wolverine movies, we are only presented with two familiar characters. Whatever that has happened to bring them to this scenario is mentioned but not given much The pace picked up once X-23 bared her claws. Then it became more of a pondering period with Xavier playing the mentoring role he has been playing the entire series, Logan the decision maker and Laura the main source of drama. Xavier's fatherly contribution to Logan's development as a character is given due emphasis. Xavier even jokes how Logan was once sort of a delinquent student at his school. Yet fueled by Logan's loyalty, their poignant connection has survived to this day. All this adds to the heart wrenching death of Charles when a Wolverine lookalike kills him, just as he was recounting his past mistakes. Logan's hesitation between saving Laura and checking on Xavier's wellbeing is emblematic of his emotional indecision. He isn't sure whether he should leave his past behind and embrace a new future. Halfway the movie seems to lose bit of its steam. Once the premise has been established, the clash between the heroes and villains fails to gain much traction. The characters take on a retrospective outlook and while the fight scenes are still gold, the emotion comes off as facile and pretentious at times. The conclusion ends up being rather predictably with Logan and Laura fighting off their assailants together, a brilliant partnership between father and daughter. <br/><br/>While it faces problems with its pacing, Logan is way more sophisticated than its action packed predecessors. The previous 2 Wolverine films depicted him as more of a savage hero. Someone who could take down any opponent and obstacle if he gritted his teeth and consequently punched and clawed hard enough. In this edition, mostly stripped of his healing factor, his emotional vulnerability and turmoil are laid bare for us. Isolation, illness and Xavier's mental senescence all lead him to question his life choices till this point and the meaning of the existence of mutants. The introduction of his offspring and her torrid past brings in more drama to the equation and Logan can barely handle it all. The slow and considered pace aids in this introspective outlook, Logan taking on a Batman-esque role in Marvel comics. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in his portrayal of Wolverine, a character he has played for nearly 2 decades. Previously a role that required mostly grunting and brawling demands much more of an emotional quotient here, and Jackman delivers beautifully with gravitas. The unreal hype generated by this movie had me expecting something similar to Nolan's Batman trilogy. Despite its awesomeness, it fails to reach those dizzying heights. An uplifting tale with copious amounts of gruesome bloodshed, it is a welcome addition to the superhero collection. The best superhero movies are those which seem realistic depictions of our beloved characters in a comic book setting and Logan pulls this off with panache. While it doesn't transcend its genre, Logan and Jackman does proper justice and bids farewell to an iconic character in style."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","8","0","3","12 March 2017"," A dark difficult and sickening masterpiece
","After 17 years and 9 movies, we got to the end of the Wolverine saga. As sad as it may sound, it was such an end that generations would speak of it as the definite masterpiece of Marvel comics, and they would not be wrong.<br/><br/>After so many portrayals of Logan, Jackman really has no need to act as the character, as much as he actually is the character. Still, this movie pushed him to his utmost limits, demanding his very best acting skills and dedication that few actors would (dare I say could) do in a comic book movie. His portrayal this time is an extreme in pain, suffering and sorrow, unlike the previous movies where he was just filled with rage. So, the contrast itself is very interesting and it is, at time, so hard to watch. The ""Old man Logan"" is unable to walk (the constant limping and panting after running), to heal etc. which makes him more human than ever. That trait is something he has wanted from the very beginning of the franchise, and now that he finally gets it, he wants it all to end because of the pain he has been through. A complex and staggering performance that is to be inserted in acting textbooks.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Stewart's performance matches Jackman's in every way. The old and demented prof. X is one of the movies highlights, and the way Stewart depicts the aged and sick prof. X is as good as his portrayals in Shakespeare's plays. The impact that kind of acting and portrayal of characters has on the viewer is hard to explain. It leaves one filled with sorrow and disbelief, especially after knowing what happened in all of the previous movies.<br/><br/>The other actors did a decent job but really nothing worth mentioning. Jackman's and Stewart's performance carry the movie all the way and, without a doubt, are unmatched by anyone else in the movie.<br/><br/>One more thing to praise is the atmosphere. Now, comic book movies are filled with explosions, destruction, CGI monsters etc. Logan is a down to earth, western like drama that actually has no need for the classic comic book finale. The movie is driven by the miraculous acting and depiction of characters, alongside the psychological downfall of them all, so tension is present even without the CGI. A bold move that payed of.<br/><br/>Still, Logan has his downsides. The biggest one is the lack of context. While watching the movie and after seeing it, the main problem is the fact no one actually know what happened to the mutants, or how exactly did the world Logan lives in become so, well, ordinary (dare I say normal). There are some notions that clarify these question, but more should have been done in that department. <br/><br/>The part that needed more work is the relationship between Logan and Laura. Now, a few movies have done this type of relationship way better and more emotional (e.g. Man on Fire, and especially the masterpiece video game The Last of Us), so at the end when their emotions become vivid, one is left with the notion that more chemistry was needed. Maybe that is due to the fact that Laura doesn't say a single word until the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, Logan is a masterpiece and it is a fitting end to one of the most beloved characters in the X-men franchise. The violence, the pain and agony everyone is going through is exceptional and the actors who portray those emotions are stunning. X-men fans will worship it, Marvel fans will love it, and everyone else will become either a Marvel or X-men fan because of it.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you THE WOLVERINE."
"ctowyi","7","0","3","11 March 2017"," Sweet adieu, Logan
","You will know from get-go that this is the Wolverine movie you have been clamouring for when the first word out of Logan's mouth is an F-bomb and he proceeds to slice and dice scumbags who are trying to jack his car.<br/><br/>I like what director James Mangold has done here. It's great that I see risky turns being undertaken in a genre that is rife with just adhering to an over-used template of upping the amount of Defcon One city-levelling destruction. Here, everything is stripped down to an almost unplugged lo-fi setup. Titular characters are distilled to their bare essence and everything that they held firm are tested, their resolve magnified as they stand up for one last hurrah before the curtain call.<br/><br/>All through 17 years of Wolverine, the character never had a chance to unleash the level of violence that is synonymous with the claw-for-hands brutish hero. The first one is an embarrassing made for kids action flick, while the second one is a marked improvement albeit with just a sprinkling of blood. I think we have last year's Deadpool to thank for when the studios finally realised an R-rated action superhero movie can haul in big bucks. Of all the Marvel characters, Wolverine practically cries out for the same treatment; he has been crying out for 17 years. It is just gratifying to finally see the character unchained and the balls-up action up to the bloody wall. Hugh Jackman finally gets a chance to flex his acting muscles with an incredible swan song to a fascinating character.<br/><br/>Though distinctively lo-fi in its setup, it is ultimately hi-fi in the way the story respects the characters. The theme here is family with Professor X as the grandfather and Logan as the father figure to a precarious child not in touch with the workings of the outside world. The story also takes a hard look at superheroes beset by everyday problems of putting food on the table and running away from their past. Physically, they are ageing and ailing, their abilities becoming liabilities in a world that find them irrelevant and only fit for the comic books. It is a brave way to tell a superhero story and I only hope this opens the door to more experiments.<br/><br/>Is Logan perfect? Not by a long shot. Some of the expositions have no guile and the actual story takes a while to get going. The middle act has some really inert moments and the pace also slacks quite a bit. So in a sense the risk taking turns are curtailed by some storytelling elements. Still, this is finally the Wolverine movie I have been waiting for.<br/><br/>Sweet adieu, Logan."
"savage1250","8","0","3","11 March 2017"," This movie is the best comic book movie ever. A lot of people are saying that, but I can't.
","This movie is the best comic book movie ever. A lot of people are saying that, but I can't. This movie can't be compared to those other comic book movies. This was a standalone, a far different type or concept from its predecessors. It was basically an independent art-house film that was character and story driven. Not a big budget blockbuster that focuses more on special effects and an end of world story. <br/><br/>Logan story was very well done. You can see that the film makers paid a lot of attention in getting and crafting the right story for the concept there were trying to portray. The story may slow down at times but it doesn't drag along. With a run time of just over two hours the slow parts are necessary to the build up to the final act. My only problem with the story is that it feels like a part is missing pertaining to how Logan, Charles and Caliban got to the point that there at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The performances by all the main actors are great, especially Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Theirs's are Oscar worthy performances and should be real contenders for next year's award season. Dafne Keen, X-23 stole the show in almost every scene she was in. The only problem I had with her is that she wasn't given much dialog to work with. She only started to speak at the very end but only a few lines which were in Spanish. I wanted to see a back and forth between herself and Logan. <br/><br/>The villain's performances were lackluster at best. No real time was spent trying to flush out their story and to really explain their rationale. Zander Rice and Donald Pierce characters both suffered from this.<br/><br/>The R rating was use very well. The use of expletives, violence and blood were done well and didn't felt force. It served the story. But there is one point of needless violence that the movie could've done without. This was the massacre of the Munson family. Will alone could have met the fate he did and his family should have survived. The ending was sad, demoralizing and hopeless. Some people are complaining of this but I have no problem with it. This ending in most part was predictable from the trailers and more importantly the whole movie, which was from the beginning pointing or building up to this end which is a true send off to a great character. <br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie and has some problems which I pointed out above. But notwithstanding that it is a very well done and entertaining film."
"omar-alikaj","7","0","3","11 March 2017"," A Good Film with A Few Things Off
","Basically, ""Logan"" is about an older, washed-up Wolverine now working as a chauffeur... and the whole X-Men thing apparently disbanded. Logan, while confronting Charles in their Mexican hideout in one point, seemed to offer a clue as to what happened to the others. As we watch on, the film's soon revealed to be about Logan now dealing with the fact that he can no long self-heal as before, while trying to escort lab-raised mutant kids to Canada for safety.<br/><br/>But, with escorting the kids to safety, that also means Pierce, leader of the security wing of the said lab, ""Transigen"", chasing everyone, even kidnapping and killing Logan's affiliates, Charles including. The kids were meant to be raised as an ""X-23"" mutant army by Dr. Rice, son of the infamous scientist who enhanced Wolverine in the past. Learning more about Dr. Rice by the climax was a plot twist I didn't expect knowing.<br/><br/>So to clarify, the whole misadventures start off when Gabriela, a Transigen staff taking care of one of the escaped mutant kids, Laura, tries hiring Logan to escort the two to Canada before Pierce catches up to them. Logan returns way too late, but manages to get Laura to his hiding place in Mexico... only for Pierce, who spoke to Logan earlier, showing up expressing his disappointment over Logan not tipping him off on Gabriela sooner. This, since he's very aware that Laura is around, turns into a full-blown confrontation, and Laura revealed to have the same capability as Logan: retrievable knuckle claws!<br/><br/>Outnumbered, Logan, Charles, and Laura are on the run, even hiding in hotels, and even accepting a family's invitation to sleep over for the night... with us audience wondering if Charles is stupid not worried about Pierce catching up, as opposed to not making unnecessary stops. This leads to what seems to be a Wolverine look- alike killing off Charles, kidnapping Laura, and killing off the entire family that took the good guys in for the night! It's made worse for the good guys trying to hide when their colleague, Caliban, was kidnapped to reluctantly share information on their whereabouts.<br/><br/>As it is, there are a lot of things I liked about the film.<br/><br/>With the conflict between Logan and Transigen's sides, there are action scenes. As mentioned earlier, Transigen has a Wolverine look- alike, or maybe a clone, thus that means that he's hard to kill. The same is true with Laura, which is why Transigen is careful when trying to catch her. But, with the R rating, expect bloods, deep wounds, and decapitations.<br/><br/>X-Men comics can be seen in select scenes of the movie. Apart from dissing their premise, they played an important role in pointing out where Logan should be heading to... even though, up till the climax, he doubted the area's existence, even fighting with Laura and Charles over it. Although, that same area was also written down on the money envelop Gabriela handed Logan.<br/><br/>And ultimately, I like that this is Hugh Jackman's farewell letter to his long-time Wolverine fans. It's an open secret that ""Logan"" would be his final movie as Wolverine, after years of service, as it is also implied with Logan's failing health, then death, by the end of the movie, as the kids make it to safety, with Laura re- positioning his grave's crucifix to resemble an ""X"".<br/><br/>But....<br/><br/>...That's not to say that there were some things that didn't put me off, although not greatly to hate the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, ignoring Charles' desire to put everyone in danger by making unnecessary stops, some of us accepted that Charles was killed off in ""X-Men 3"", despite that film not feeling as memorable as ""X-Men 2"". Charles felt like an extra who's too stubborn to take his medications to keep his psyche under control. I honestly thought that the movie's stronger strength would have just been concentrating on Logan and his personal struggles as an old man, and his illegitimate daughter.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Laura, Logan's illegitimate daughter. After she and her friends escaping from the mutant facility, and moving into Canada, what's next for them and Transigen? Like ""Assassin's Creed"", the movie ended with little to no clues on a sequel, or, at least, what happens next.<br/><br/>And also, I think the movie got too much praise for being ""R-rated"", which ultimately alienated this film from the past X-Men movies. I don't mind R-rated films, but I'd seen better ones since when I was a kid like ""Terminator"" and ""Die Hard"", since, as I'd pointed out above, they got nicer resolutions. (Not to forget, changing the rating sort of left teen viewers in the dust. It's a shame, because I wanted my younger cousins to check it out.)<br/><br/>And finally, the movie is surprisingly depressing, from poor Charles accusing Logan ""waiting for him to die"" by keeping him sealed up in their hideout, to watching Logan's failing health... and, ultimately, death.<br/><br/>But, overall, it's a movie I was glad to watch. Sure, Stan Lee is absent here, and there wasn't any tease after the credits but, instead, note on how many jobs the movie created, but it's an X-Men spin-off that is better than even some of the X-Men origin and prequel movies in recent years. If you're interested in seeing how the Wolverine copes with old age, R-rated fight scenes, with a story of hope for younger mutants... and ignoring the lackluster ending, I recommend you guys watch ""Logan""."

","i gave this a 9 only because for the ""comic"" book movie is not the usual stereotypical follow up. the cinematography and direction were absolutely stunning and also a bit reminiscent of Children of men. Unpredictable things keep happening in throughout the movie,which is pretty rare for a superhero film.This is not one of course. The way some of the scenes were set up were emotionally and visually dazzling spectacles,like the final shot in the forest,which was brutal and beautiful usually polar opposites but somehow coalesced and was good. The actors did a fine job especially, Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart. A very masterful ending for a movie with a nearly perfect plot. The movie is not a perfect film but deserved a 9 for the courage to make movie which is said to be comic book movie but is not, but had made many attempts to achieve the characteristics of artistic films.<br/><br/>One of the best comic book movies since the DK trilogy.I think next to the DK Trilogy, Logan follows."

It's a wake up call to our ""progressive"" society that wrongly (research is proving) minimizes the role that dads play in the lives of our children. At the same time they highlighted and honored the men in our society who put their lives on the line each day to protect us. That message is wrapped up in an entertaining movie where you will laugh & cry. I was in tears during scene one and in several others I nearly fell out of my seat laughing.

","First off, let me say I am 76 and have never been a fan of ""comic-book"" super-hero movies, including Superman, Star-Trek, and the Marvel comics. (though I was and am a collector of the EC Horror comics from my youth). A younger friend of mine told me about ""Logan"" being quite good, and that it pays homage to ""Shane"", which newspaper reviews also noted. Well, it so happens I went to see Shane when I was 12, sixty-four years ago, and it was the first film that moved me to tears and showed me what a movie can be as a total experience. So after seeing how well received this film was, I was willing to see it, and I have to admit, despite the intermittent bone-crunching violence, which seemed over-the-top, the film held my interest, had some genuine heart, and was quite entertaining, and even enjoyable at times. Admittedly, for me, showing scenes of Shane was the highlight, along with the surprise dialog near the close. Thus, a 7, overall, which probably would be a 9 or 10 if I were a Wolverine Fan and in my 20s-40's. The only caveat for me is that the violence is so frequent and overdone that it actually seems counterproductive, as it is so extreme, it would only take one hit to knock out or kill an opponent, even a ""mutant"". Oh well. Enjoy!"
"showmethemoviescontact","6","0","4","10 March 2017"," Logan ShowMeTheMovies Review
","The final X-men picture goes out with a depressing whimper instead of the emotional roller-coaster that was intended.<br/><br/>Over time, X-men movies have grown more and more inconsistent in terms of tone and pacing between films; maintaining consistency is a difficult task with such a vast franchise (particularly one with multiple timelines), but Logan manages to be one of the 'odd films out' in that it is far more grounded than its' predecessors. In making the movie more grounded, the film is far more dark and brooding than any other X-men movie, portraying Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as a jaded and depressed mutant and even the presence of a child throughout doesn't lighten the tone.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that having Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in their usual roles is the best the movie has to offer, it is clear that they are completely comfortable in their roles to such an extent that one cannot imagine anyone else performing. Their presence on-screen is fierce and captivating; and I could not praise Logan enough for this.<br/><br/>The movie however is riddled with faults throughout, starting with the primary plot point of the film, the most important character involved: Laura (Dafne Keen). The introduction of this character is key to the entire fabric of how the film runs and functions as a storyline, yet she is unlikable and irritating. I have pictured a version of the film's events without her presence, and she does not add to the story as a single entity at all, despite the fact she is among the centre of events. To put it simply: the film revolves around her as a character, but if not present, the film would not lose an entertaining or vaguely interesting on-screen performance. This is not down to acting talent, but script writing which paints Laura as a damsel in distress despite the fact she can clearly handle herself during action scenes.<br/><br/>The action is undeniably entertaining, yet comes few and far between. Some dramatic moments include Logan having to deal with Xavier having a seizure, which causes the surroundings to be affected perilously and Logan must stop the seizure by calming Xavier down with an injection, which just involves Wolverine walking toward Xavier in slow motion, disposing of a couple of enemies who are frozen and cannot move. This doesn't particularly constitute its' own 'action' segment, and detracts from the real moments in the film in which the protagonists really can entertain the viewer with some incredible bloodthirsty scenes.<br/><br/>Logan is a bloodthirsty film overall, at no point is there a pause in the violence that the movie shows, which again, changes the tone from most of the other films within the franchise. This film is not for the light-hearted, and those that find themselves huge fans of the series are definitely going to enjoy the movie; this is not the first X-men film which I can say has flaws, and while I know that the film isn't perfect and I personally did not find the plot captivating (in fact the plot is not anything we haven't seen before), I know that a lover of the X-men series is going to find that this movie will tug on their heartstrings time and time again.<br/><br/>The need to thrust the important parts of the story upon Laura is completely unnecessary, when this film tries and fails to get the audience to enjoy her as a character, it then attempts to make her relatable by placing her opinions and feelings towards Logan in line with that of the audience: of admiration. This didn't work on me at all, and I still found her an annoyance as the film began to close, and due to the fact the main focus was shifted slightly from Logan and greatly from Xavier to this new character, it meant these beloved characters did not get the chance to really relate like they have done in other films before their exit.<br/><br/>Is Logan a good film? At least partially. Is it a good X-men film? Absolutely. The vast inconsistency with other X-men movies puts it above many others, naming The Wolverine and X-men Origins: Wolverine as the main movies that Logan has managed to top (which wasn't particularly difficult). I can recommend the movie to anyone who loves X-men and Marvel, but definitely not to anyone else.<br/><br/>https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-logan.html"

","Why should anybody watch this movie? Because is the best Wolverine movie. Period. The Wolverine trilogy goes from worst to better, because the world is upside down. With this movie we can properly say goodbye to the character. A goodbye well-deserved and well made.<br/><br/>The movie is not the typical super heroes movies and it is not the so typical X-Men movie that we are used to. It takes a while to remember where we are in the scene: is it after The Last Stans? Or Apocalypse? or The Wolverine? One cannot stop asking that at the beginning of the movie, but then our doubts are done. We are presented with an old Wolverine; not what expected since the day you met him and his special ability. The year is 2029 and many things have changed for the mutants. and of course the bad guys wanted to create more and to control more, same old story that keeps coming back, no mater in what mutant year we are.<br/><br/>The movie was a bit long for my likening, there were some scenes that could have been shortened or directly cut, specially the fight ones, which more were fanservice that anything else. But still, there were well-played and welcomed. The movie leaves some questions in the air and raises new ones that we probably won't get an answer any soon. As for the performances, we see again Wolverine and Professor X together sharing the screen, which it always means that some trouble is coming, and that we get to see two fantastic actors playing these beloved characters and again and probably for the last time.<br/><br/>Finally a movie that gives justice to the beloved Wolverine character and that concludes a trilogy which two first films are forgettable but not this one. A film for Marvel fans to enjoy a different kind of movie than what we are used to."

"skylerisaac","9","0","3","9 March 2017"," Good...But Also A Bummer
","There is absolutely no way I can review this film without touching on major spoiler territory, so BE WARNED. <br/><br/>When it was first announced that Logan was going to be an R-rated film, I was both excited and worried. Excited because it seemed we would finally see Wolverine bloody up his claws. Worried that said blood would be a pointless visceral thrill that would add nothing to the film. <br/><br/>I was wrong there. <br/><br/>Is there blood and gore in this film? Hell yes. But instead of being blood for the sake of blood, the violence displayed actually fits the overall feel and tone of the film. This is a dark and bleak story, Wolverine is in an understandably dark and bleak mood, and so is the action dark and bleak. <br/><br/>And speaking of dark and bleak, let me just offer up a bit of a warning before you see the film. It's sad. Very sad. If the trailer made you well up with tears, the actual movie will reduce you to a blubbering mess. If you don't curl up in the fetal position by the time the credits roll, then you are a brave, brave person in my book. <br/><br/>But that's part of what makes the film so appealing. It's not a traditional superhero movie. The whole world is not in peril, Wolverine is not fighting for the safety of everyone, and the heroes are not at all guaranteed to live to fight another day. Logan is anything but predictable, and that makes it a real breath of fresh air despite all its gloominess. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty great. Hugh Jackman excels as a grizzled old Wolverine whose wounds are no longer healing because the Adamantium inside his body has now begun to poison and hinder him. Patrick Stewart as a dying Professor X gives us emotions galore. Relative newcomer Dafne Keen is excellent as a young X-23, a clone mutant whose entire life has been a living hell of experiments and suffering. <br/><br/>Of course, these performances also speak to the talent of director James Mangold (Walk The Line, The Wolverine), who keeps the film taut and emotional. <br/><br/>The cinematography by DP John Mathieson (47 Ronin, The Man From U.N.C.L.E.) is also top notch, making every portion of the film a joy to witness. <br/><br/>I can't find too much to complain about. The film seems a tad too long, but the convergence of emotional tangents at the tail end of the third act more than makes up for it. <br/><br/>As a long-time franchise fan, I can say that I both hated and adored the ending. Again, you will most likely cry your eyes out, so bring a box of tissues or something. <br/><br/>Despite the absolute anguish you will endure through the course of this film, I still highly recommend it. If you've been with the series and the character for this long, then you need to see this film, as it does close off Logan's character in a profound and deserving fashion. <br/><br/>One of the best uses of a superhero that's ever been put to film. <br/><br/>9/10"
"matthewssilverhammer","9","0","3","9 March 2017"," A Fond Farewell to a Ferocious Friend
","2013's Wolverine saw Jackman's clawed curmudgeon join forces with Hollywood-heavyweight Mangold for some brooding fun that was decidedly more down-to-earth. Back together for Logan, Mangold has not only kept his distinct strengths of tone and combat, but has ramped up the quality & gravitas rarely seen in a blockbuster. In one of the most brutally and beautifully made superhero films of all-time, Logan gives audiences an experience full of gasps, laughs, and thrills& buckets of blood. Taking place in the near-future, we find our invincible anti-hero trying to live a quiet life, driving a limo, and taking care of his dangerously senile father-figure Xavier; yet his world is far from boring, especially when a girl with familiar powers appears. The emotional anchor here is the Logan / Charles relationship; watching them deal with weakening bones, a changing world and oncoming dementia is powerfully relatable. However, the action is far from dormant. Keen is a fantastic mutant newcomer, grunting and fighting in ways that Logan himself doesn't have the virility for anymore. Instead, he lumbers through his fights with vicious intensity and careless selflessness. And when I say ""vicious"", I mean ""vicious""; this is NOT your kids X-Men. The R-rated door Deadpool knocked down has allowed Logan to violently dance on the other side. If you've ever felt like Wolverine's claws and fury felt neutered in a PG-13 world, fear no more. However, the violence is to a purpose; we're shown the difficult effects in honest and effective ways, especially in the jarring use of children. All-in-all, it's a perfect send-off for one of the most successful character / actor collaborations in movie history, and is far-and-away the greatest X-Men film yet."

","Logan is a movie which most people don't understand. Most of my friends and people here who rated it think it has too much action and too less story, it does have a story and a deeper meaning. Firstly we see Logan at his weakest, trying to get money for Charles's medicine. After he meets Laura he is given a purpose again. Many people also think that the deaths were overdone but they weren't the deaths had a bigger meaning as well, the deaths showed us that not every one gets a heroic death and that life can end quickly for you, I absolutely loved the part where Laura turned that cross into an X. This was indeed a dark and bloody R-rated movie but it was worth watching and brought Wolverine to a satisfying end"

They include old man with strong power of mind but this can't make him out of normal brain disease, another man have dying by a day by the thing had made him specially strong and dangerous and a little girl have almost childhood deep in blood and pains. They are stick together by natural way but make a weird family. Not like a regular family but they can die for each others to keep moving on the way which they had chosen. The first message, love can help they past through all fairs and pains that they must have to face. The next message, the killing is always bad. Even killing for a good reason. This reason is can't be acceptable. Life with only one choose kill or be killed is always be terrified life. One sentence in movie make me feel impressive: ""The killing. There's no going back from it. Right or wrong is a brand. A brand sticks. There's no going back"". The final also the most meaningful message is about children. Children, no matter what they are, human or mutation human, they always and forever be ""key"" to open the door to brighten world in the future, not to be ""weapon"" to turn the world to come back in the darkest past."

Laura holds very essence of young lioness that will be integral part of X-men franchise in many coming years.

","Logan was a film that I was admittedly nervous about, due to the nature of X-Men Apocalypse, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. My biggest worry was that it would focus more on Logan alone, without giving him characters to build off of and define his character. He is truly a character that needs other people to care about to be interesting.<br/><br/>I was satisfied when I finally got the chance to watch it, and saw that he was able to define himself with Xavier and and Laura. The character development was excellent. The film truly let you care for the characters and worry for them. <br/><br/>The plot was a fairly cookie cutter superhero movie plot, and I could see many plot points from a mile away. The film still felt more focused on action than the story of Logan and his struggles, which bothered me quite a bit. I loved the X-Men for the reason that it focused on imperfect characters fighting for a world that hated them.<br/><br/>Overall, I wish that the movie took more risks with storytelling, and focused on what I feel made the original films in the series great. The positives definitely do outnumber the negatives, and I didn't leave the theater with any disappointment. It was a fulfilling experience."

"jadepietro","8","0","3","8 March 2017"," The Grey Wolf Returns
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: B <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A more somber and ultra-violence ode to a comic book hero.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The Grey Wolf is back for his swan song.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The claws are still razor-sharp but the man behind them is worn out and losing some of his super-heroic powers in the last chapter of the Wolverine legend. Time has not dulled the pain from the many wars this lone (wolf) survivor has fought. His body is scarred, both physically and mentally. Heavy drinking is his past-time. A hero has fallen on hard times. Hugh Jackman again stars in his acclaimed title role, the third and final chapter to his Wolverine trilogy. His character has seen better days, yet he still ready for action as he takes on the villains in James Mangold's serious slice-and-dice adventure film, Logan.<br/><br/>It is 2029 and most of the mutants are gone or undercover. Logan a.k.a. Wolverine, that Grey Wolf of a man, is now a limo driver (although being a chef at a Hibachi restaurant would have been more profitable occupation). He also has become caretaker to Prof. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who has aged less gracefully and is in the process of loses control of his mind on a regular basis. With his numerous brain seizures, the Professor has a paralyzing effect on those nearby, sort of a mental 6.9 earthquake. Still , he can see the future and tells Logan that he will meet a strong force who will change his worthless life. That person is an 11 year old feral wild child named Laura (Dafne Keen). Soon the trio is on the run from evil scientists and governmental agents.<br/><br/>Logan is one set piece after another, all of high octane battles, most of which are photographed in quick blurry takes and loud clanging sound effects. The body count rises fairly quickly with bloodletting intensity as people are hacked up, beheaded, and impaled. This is an R-rated film due to many of its violent sequences and its non-stop profanity. (The film is definitely an adult superhero film that is inappropriate for young ones.)<br/><br/>Yet it isn't the action that impresses. Rather, it is the skillful direction by Mr. Mangold, the fine acting, and a seriously minded-script by Scott Frank, Michael Green, and the director that is willing to have its quieter scenes build as the film develops relationships and conflicts between its characters.<br/><br/>Mr. Jackman brings a subtly hostile demeanor to his character and his interpretation of the hero shows a man slowly coming undone in search of redemption. He is defeated and tired of life's hardships. Mr. Stewart plays his part with much empathy as a once fearless man grappling with his on-going dementia. The two actors have a convincing chemistry. Ms. Keen is a talented newcomer and she handles her mostly mute-ant part extremely well. Giving strong supporting are Eriq La Salle, Elizabeth Rodriguez, and Richard E. Grant as the evil scientist in charge of the manhunt. Stephen Merchant as Logan's albino friend, Caliban, has some fine moments, as does Boyd Holbrook as the mercenary soldier, Pierce.<br/><br/>Logan plays like a modern day western, with more than a tip of the 10 gallon hat to George Steven's 50's classic film, Shane. The direct link to both films is well conceived but a tad heavy-handed. However, this detail shows the filmmaker's successful attempt to have more gravitas and depth added to this familiar genre.<br/><br/>X does mark the spot in Logan. As comic book blockbusters go, this film is far from comic in its darker tone and escalating violence. The film entertains, if one can accept the brutal carnage on screen, bringing a dignified conclusion to one of the better films of Marvel factory."

"jeannefrancoise","8","0","3","8 March 2017"," Watching Logan in real life
","This movie of X-Men is what I have been waiting for so far. X-Men movie is quite familiar among other superheroes movies because like in the comic, we could also understand about the process of Mutants and the business process behind it. The Director of this X-men movie could present the plots as in comics and adding some values of real life in it. So it is interesting to discuss more about it. In the middle of superheroes movies nowadays, X-Men is quite special to be seen because the characters are so real and the plot is not-so managed dramatically. Like other my reviews, I always start movie review by its title. The title of the current X-Men movie is ""Logan"". Logan is the human name for X-Men. By reading the title, we could assume that the movie is about how X-Men became himself. In the first plot we could see the plot that Logan is working as car driver for life. This is so human, so natural, and so realistic. The money then became the most important thing that lead the plots to be unpredictable. I do not want to give spoilers here, but I just can say the Director is smart enough to make a link between Logan himself, the X-Men power, and the money (business) and finally people will give applause about the importance of being superhero by loving other people around us. The second thing that I want to discuss is that the urgency and the presence of enemies. It is banal to have enemies in superhero movies, but in this Logan movie, sometimes we could see that there is enemy within ourselves, not other people. It could be worse if we are resistant to pardon our past mistakes. Perhaps this is the Director want to give to the audience, that is the superhero has their own secrets that can not be shared to other superhero. Finally, I was quite happy watching this Logan movie, but be careful about sarcastic words and some sadistic scenes. Other thing, I believe you could handle it, especially the ending!! :)"
"ironlion106","7","0","3","8 March 2017"," A Terrific Finale
","Being a movie pessimist has its perks. Logan is the most pleasant surprise I've had with a movie in a very long time. Everybody and their mother has been grinding their teeth in anticipation for this movie. The expectations were absurd. Me? I saw absolutely no reason to be excited for this movie. Not even the ""R"" rating could get me excited, no matter how many times I heard someone claim that the ""R"" rating was what they needed to tell a Wolverine story that is ""true to the character"". All I knew were two things. Thing 1: We all know how the previous two solo Wolverine movies went. Thing 2: This was from the director of The Wolverine which was, in my opinion, painfully boring and dull. So I walked into the theater ready to tell all my friends how bad it was and not to get their hopes up.<br/><br/>Logan is absolutely beautiful. As bleak and emotionally draining as it is, it's beautiful. It's the first superhero movie in a very long time that treats itself as a movie as well as a superhero movie. It's a drama and a character study of Logan. A man who's spent his entire life pushing people away and watching as all the people he ever loved or cared about die one by one. From the beginning, Logan is a very sober experience. Along with the knowledge that almost all the other mutants are dead (including all of the X-Men apart from Logan and Charles Xavier), it's also weirdly sad to see how Logan and Charles have aged. Logan's hair is all gray, Charles is senile. Maybe it's only because of the fact that there are eight other X-Men movies behind it, but another thing this movie seems to have down very well is a world that feels very alive and lived in. Like things have happened. And on top of all of this grim but wonderful detail, Logan even goes to the effort to have a good plot. It would have been so easy to have some throwaway mustache-twiddling villain who's out to end all mutants and blah blah blah and Logan has to stop him (yes, I know it's based on a comic and the story existed beforehand), but this movie really outdid itself with a plot that's engaging and extremely compelling. And to top it all off, Logan is in no hurry to set up another X-Men movie and thus it tells a much more complete story. I only wish the other two solo Wolverine movies could've been this good. Logan is an absolutely wonderful finale."

"feelinesound","7","0","3","8 March 2017"," Finally a decent comics book movie!
","While not quite as incredible as it was hyped up to be (seriously, people in some corners were raving about it as if it's as good as The Dark Knight) it's definitely a *good* movie and these days, that's a big accomplishment. Since Nolan we haven't seen a single film based on comic books that could really be said to have any sort of serious substance and/or artistic endeavor and actually was well executed (amazingly, some TV shows like Preacher, Jessica Jones and recently Legion have gotten closer to that). Rather they've been almost entirely conforming to formulaic block-buster 'rules', which essentially stipulate you are to have X amount of battle scenes, Y special effects and CGI, Z amount of space dedicated to establishing a franchise, a PG rating, and maybe 5% room for originality if you really feel adventurous.<br/><br/>Logan is a breath of fresh air in that, even though there are still a fair amount of gratuitous fight scenes and visual effects, it still for the most part actually seems like a real, non-franchise movie that tries to be something unique and build characters and relationships and a visual identity and emotional depth. Is it great? Not quite, but given how movies get made these days and the financial risks involved for studios and their intellectual property, we have to applaud them even being brave enough to take such a big step in the right direction. James Mangold did a very solid (if not overly ambitious) job helming this movie and giving it a unique character, and hopefully this will mark the point at which major studios realized they may have even more success if they hand these franchises over to even more serious visionary directors and let them do their thing."

","The last hurrah for Hugh Jackman and a tribute to how he grew into the role of Wolverine - that's what Logan is. The movie portrays the grim tale of a once superhero left in shambles with deteriorating powers and striding gradually towards the dusk.<br/><br/>While Jackman impresses with one of the best portrayals of any comic movie character till date, Patrick Stewart further demonstrates his acting chops as Dr X in a one-off miserable state.<br/><br/>The portrayals are grim at every stage with rare humorous moments that just give you room to breathe. The violence, however, is exactly how one always expected from a Wolverine movie. With his last outing as the adamantium touting mercenary-like hero, Jackman has left big shoes which shall be impossible to fill for his successor. Oh, and Dafne Keen is a find! Uttering few words throughout, she shares the screen aptly with her 'father'.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie moves along a surprisingly well-crafted screenplay that is gripping and has a satisfactory end.<br/><br/>Except for the ambiguous explanations via the backstory digging into the disappearance of the X-Men and a somewhat expected conclusion, the movie delivers on all aspects that Wolverine fans shall go to the theatre with."
"azeron40","8","0","3","7 March 2017"," The R rating made this movie awesome!
","Patrick Stewart was amazing as always, Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan/Wolverine, with his best performance ever, and Dafne Keen was a true joy to watch, especially in her stunts. I see Dafne Keen having an amazing future in acting, and I hope too see her again as Laura/X- 23.<br/><br/>The story was a good way to end the very long run of Patrick Stewart, and Hugh Jackman's, portrayal of Professor X and Wolverine. I will truly miss the actors, in their respective rolls. I see this movie as a set up for future, X-Men style blockbusters. Possibly with Alpha Flight, a Canadian super hero group, or variations of the New Mutants or even X-Factor. Time will tell. What I see as the biggest problem with Logan making as much money as it could have is not the rating, but the large amount of new releases. I love variety as much as the next person, but at times it seems that the studios release a movie just to steal the thunder, and revenue from another studio, I hope in this case I am wrong, but I digress.<br/><br/>Great movie, I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen, and I respect Hugh Jackman for taking a pay cut, to get this movie made the way it should be. As such I do not recommend this movie for small children, although my theater was full of them. This movie would have been a 5/10 tops if held to a PG-13 standard, and if I may get on my soap box once more, the rating system is terribly askew, you see far more gore and violence on television, as for the F-Bombs I would say the average person hears far worse at work, school, or social events.

","Now you have 20th Century Fox taking a huge risk with not only this character, but with this franchise as well. If you are thinking that you are getting another comic book movie that follows the same pattern as the others. Believe me, you are getting something new and refreshing in the superhero/comic book genre. This is something the genre has been needing for a long time. <br/><br/>One of the many problems people, including myself, had with the last X – Men movie, X – Men: Apocalypse, was it was more of the same. I did enjoy that movie; on the other hand, I do believe it is one of the weaker films in the series. <br/><br/>This is honestly the most depressing film in the series. It's almost like this film doesn't even like their main character. It's sad to see what Wolverine has come to. He saved the world, has traveled back in time, and has been a hero for people and mutants. Now he is miserable, sick, has thoughts of suicide, he is dirty, and he has a job as a limousine driver, driving teenagers to prom. <br/><br/>Accordingly, this movie is Rated R with a purpose. It isn't Rated R to show you more guts, more blood, more profanity and more nudity. It's not like the ""Rated R"" version of Batman v Superman. Where Batman drops an F – bomb just because. To me that is not really being edgy or taking a chance. Taking a chance is making a project Rated R to challenge the characters morals, have character development, and go in a new direction for a story. Which this film does wonderfully.<br/><br/>This movie is more of a drama, but this movie has a lot of action to. When Wolverine goes berserk, I'm telling you, that son of a b*tch goes berserk, buck wild, and he loses his mind!<br/><br/>Claws exit out of people's faces, skulls, and this is the most brutal I've seen Wolverine. X – 23 is also a real hardcore bad ass as well. Sometimes she out shines Wolverine in the fight scenes. <br/><br/>She is only eleven in the movie, but she is a great actress. Most of the time she stays quiet. She has to show us her feelings through facial expressions, which she captures those emotions very well. When she does speak, both English and Spanish, you can tell she is delivering her lines with passion. She has so much emotional weight to carry, and for this little girl it seems like the weight wasn't too heavy. She also has some funny scenes as well. <br/><br/>The End of an Era for the X – Men?<br/><br/>As much as I loved the series, I do not think this will be the last of these mutants. Even though this movie ended so beautifully, it wouldn't bother me at all if this was the last film in the franchise. I love the way the film ends. Even though it was a little depressing, it was a nice send off for Jackman, it ended where if the movies want to, they can possibly create a spin off, and it seemed to put everything to rest in positive way. <br/><br/>The movie has well developed characters, it's a change in the genre, it's action packed, funny, and it's a perfect send off for Jackman. Thank you Hugh. I believe Logan earns<br/><br/>8 out of 10! <br/><br/>That being said, thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an X - cellent day as always. :)<br/><br/>Review - Nile Fortner"
"rbakas","7","0","6","7 March 2017"," It's not THAT great of a movie, but it was good in many ways. *SPOILERS*
","I didn't love Logan as much as other reviewers. As a long time fan of Wolverine I've watched every X-Men movie more than once, mostly because of Wolverine. I love this character more than any others.<br/><br/>After committing time investing myself into this franchise for 15+ years I just wanted the 2 key characters to have a better ending. No one's even mentioning the fact that Professor Xavier, who some might say is the key figure to the existence of the franchise, meets an unceremonious ending to his life. <br/><br/>I just think Professor Xavier deserved a better end. His death was merely a footnote. His character deserved to be surrounded by all the people he helped in his life. Not alone with one other person. It was too depressing and lonely if you ask me. Also, didn't he already get killed by Jean in X3, or is that some alternate timeline that was altered in Days of Futures Past? I'm confused.<br/><br/>Same for Logan. This guy has lived 200 years and has been a key figure in the story lines. Like the professor, his death seemed underwhelming after everything he's been through. I do like the fact the only person who could end his life was basically himself. The lack of other characters he's been in the trenches with was just lonely. <br/><br/>In the last movie Logan is living in Alaska with bears. Now he's living on the border of Mexico? What happened to Professor's school? Where is Jean or Scott or Storm? Where's Magneto? That was sad and lonely.<br/><br/>Now he has a daughter that he only get to know for a week? That's also sad and lonely.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman put in his best performance as Wolverine. There was enough consistency from previous story lines for things to make sense and be believable, but there were also huge gaps in logic. <br/><br/>I'll let the other reviewers point out all the great things about the film, of which there were plenty. After all we've been through with this franchise, it was a good film but I just think we and these characters deserved a better ending."
"maurice_yacowar","7","0","3","6 March 2017"," Wolverine meets and saves his claw-handed mutant daughter before dying.
","Wolverine's valedictory places him in the mainstream of American mythology. He's the gifted outlaw whose power is needed by the civilized society, so they can survive against less principled baddies. But his power and his accumulated guilt mean he can never settle down there. Society may sometimes need the gun but must shun it. NRA and puppet Trump take note.<br/><br/>That's the great paradox that troubles America to this day. Civilization pretends to ban violence, but it needs to deploy it to survive. That point makes the classic frontier Western and its later sci-fi spin off — the outer space frontier western — the primary American myth. In Logan two major quotations establish this theme. <br/><br/>The end credits play over the old and gravely Johnny Cash's song of the Day of Judgment, ""Hurt."" Cash covered the hit by the — appropriate for this film — Nine Inch Nails. It was part of the ailing Cash's own valedictory, his dark, melancholy, apocalyptic farewell to this world. <br/><br/>Earlier, Charles and Laura watch Shane on TV. We see Jack Palance's evil hired gun bait and slaughter a stupidly proud Southern sodbuster. Then Shane abandons his peacefulness to shoot down that and the other villains. Then Shane explains to young Joey why the gunslinger has to keep moving on. A man is what he is. That whole speech the little mutant girl heroine here recites over Wolverine's grave. The acrobatic clawed Laura is a world away from her earlier counterpart, innocent Joey. <br/><br/>Laura is one of the film's most interesting twists in the Wolverine trilogy. She has been created from Wolverine's DNA, so she's had a kind off virgin birth from him. She has the pluck of the Nancy Drew school but the superhuman powers of Wonder Woman. Thus she tacitly personifies the feminist revolution. She proves most effective when she spurns dad's orders. <br/><br/>Unlike Shane, Wolverine shows very little attempts to be a man of peace. He's introduced as hiding his superhuman powers behind the job of driving a rental limo. Like some Uber- mensch. His superpowers he calls a ""poison"" because it unleashes his animal nature, however virtuous his cause may be. <br/><br/>For all its violence and special effects, then, this shoot-n-slice-em-up is still a film of ideas and — in the final farewell — emotion. It's incidentally a reminder of how dangerous and foolish Trump's plan for replacing public education with a slew of special interest schools is."

The story overall is good though and I recommend people to go see it even if they are not a fan of the X-Men Series in general because its a fine film all in all.

"MarkFaustana","9","0","3","6 March 2017"," Two steps short of greatness.
","The movie is beautiful, I won't try to add on the strengths of the movie every reviewer mentioned, yes it's character driven, beautifully shot and deserves every bit of praise it can get, it is one of those movies that can take you inside the story instead of just showing it to you. <br/><br/>But I'd like to point out a few flaws which as far as I can see, nobody mentioned (maybe its just me then); the movie has a serious problem with sendoffs; I can accept that Charles Xavier is a frail old man now with most of his mind gone and I don't really have a problem with his death but he was Professor X, one of the most beloved characters of the whole Marvel universe and the script doesn't even take a single moment to honor him; giving him a 'moment' with appropriate levels of epicness before sending him off, and I'm not talking about something like a big action scene, for instance, instead of having him die at that moment, they could have kept him alive for 2 more minutes and he could have helped Logan defeat X-24 at that instance by psychically freezing him, or by controlling those hillbillies to help Logan instead of that farmer. This of course is one of the many ways they could have used to honor Charles. <br/><br/>Moving on to the sendoff of Logan himself; I get that his healing factor is mostly gone and it is possible for him to die now but death by impaled gut? Really? This movie had an R rating, they could've had Logan and X24 fighting down to their adamantium skeletons with chopped up faces showing shiny metal skull parts underneath but no, the fight was only slightly better than the previous one and the choreography was way too fast to follow at times.<br/><br/>One other thing; I read that the movie takes place in 2029 because the filmmakers wanted to distance themselves as much as possible from other Wolverine and X-Men movies, so they could basically do whatever they want, why then they didn't use the classic yellow costume? Or some variation of it? We already know it exists because X-Men comics exist in this movie's universe and they are based (though exaggerated as Logan says) on real events, so why not use it? They could have come up with a design with some type of exoskeleton support to make up for Logan's aging reflexes; he could have used it for the final fight with X24. We will never see Hugh Jackman in that costume now, never.<br/><br/>Maybe I expected too much from the movie, I don't know. But when a movie gets so many things right, one can't accept its mistakes as easily as lesser movies. But without a doubt, this is the best Wolverine movie ever made."

","So the X Men films seem to get a bad time when it comes to criticism about its consistency. In my opinion, for the most part, they're pretty decent flicks.<br/><br/>This film however, is easily at the top of the list. We get to see a darker, grittier perspective of the life of Logan in the near future. Aspects like his healing factor slowly fading and having to care for a senile and unstable Charles Xavier is a very different spin and it adds more depth to the story, as well as the fact that the mutants are all but extinct.<br/><br/>Fox/Marvel were definitely taking notes after Deadpool because my God, this film is brutally and relentlessly violent! Not to mention crude. F bombs are being dropped left, right and centre, even from Xavier, which is a tad jarring but hilarious to watch.<br/><br/>The main story revolves around Logan and Charles trying to find sanctuary for X23/Laura, a mostly silent little girl with Logan's abilities. Things heat up when members of this mutant experimentation organization try to capture her, and from there, it's essentially just a chase film.<br/><br/>The performances here are top notch, with both Jackman and Stewart giving their A-game. Many people are saying ""Finally! This is the X Men film I've wanted to see!"" In a sense, I agree with them, although the continuity is still a little iffy.<br/><br/>Overall, Hugh Jackman goes out with a bang in his final performance as Wolverine and this will be a film remembered as a comic book gem."

"mistoppi","8","0","4","6 March 2017"," Maybe not what I wanted but definitely the ending I needed
","I've been waiting for this movie for so long, but also I've been really nervous. The movie hasn't been hiding what it is: the last one about Logan, or at least the last one with Hugh Jackman as Logan, and let's be honest... It's not like they're going to cast a new actor to play Wolverine any time soon, eh? He's been in every single one of the X- men movies for 17 years. Hugh Jackman is iconic in this role, so why would they be in a hurry to replace him? Especially when now's the chance to make movies without him and maybe focus on some of the other characters.<br/><br/>But personally, am I sick of seeing Wolverine in every X-men movie? No. <br/><br/>Another thing that made a bit worried was how I had realised I'm not at all into dark superhero movies, at least not the ones I had seen before Logan. They were a bit boring and miserable, trying to be all gritty and edgy. But when wasn't Logan an gritty, miserable, edgy character? And at the beginning this movie was exactly what I feared it might be - gritty, miserable, dark world with no happiness in it for Logan. Luckily that changed. It changed slowly, but the world did change into something a tiny bit happier, tiny bit more hopeful. <br/><br/>Also at the beginning something felt so wrong to me, and soon enough I was able to place that feeling. It was Charles. I understand he had some kind of disease affecting his brain, so naturally that would also affect his personality, but at first he just didn't feel like Charles, and Charles has always been a very, very important part of the X-men universe. He's that one good spark of hope even in the middle of the worst moments. So when he's clearly not well, it's just awful to look at, to listen to. Clearly that was the intention for the writers, though. It was just really rough to see Charles that way.<br/><br/>Visually this movie was so beautiful, the cinematography was amazing. Also the composer, Marco Beltrami, did an amazing job. I like how the score sounds just a bit like the one in Wolverine (2013), but not too much, not like they were trying to do that same score again.<br/><br/>X-men movies have always been barely violent so they can be PG-13, but finally we get a Wolverine movie that is just as violent as it needs to be. Usually Wolverine stabs and slices and there's barely any blood. Ever since I played X-Men Origins: Wolverine video game I've been waiting for that kind of movie. And now we have it! And it's not just like full on violent content without anything else. The fight scenes are beautifully coordinated, and of course there's so much more to the story than just Wolverine and Laura fighting folks.<br/><br/>The story just is so beautiful I can't get over it. And while the movie wasn't perfect, and I didn't like everything about it, at the end of the day I don't know what else I would've needed. This is the perfect even if sad ending for wonderful 17 years Hugh Jackman has been our Wolverine."

This is by far his best performance as Wolverine. You could even make an argument that this is his best performance period, but I would need more time to compare it to The Prestige and Les MisÃ©rables. But he was exceptionally good in this film. Patrick Stewart was also incredible. While I thought that Stewart was doing a fantastic job acting, for a lot of the movie his character didn't feel like Charles Xavier to me. I know he's gone through some sh*t, but it didn't even feel like the same basic character at all to me. But once we get into the movie, and especially during a monologue he has at a key point in the film, you realize that this is the same Charles you know from the other movies, just completely broken down..."

I feel like someone who hadn't seen a lot of XMEN and early wolverine wouldn't get the back story nor time to really fall in love with the characters, I would have preferred a little more attention to the past throughout. <br/><br/>Overall: Don't expect to be breathless by the story as you were in the Dark Knight but this movie is a must watch, very well done and the action is top notch!

It is a hard watch, but I am happy to say it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. This movie is a love letter from Marvel, the director, and the actors to all fans of the Wolverine character. Jackson masterfully portrays, once again, a hardened and defeated version of the character who has years of pain and suffering pouring out of him. The violence in the film is incredibly fierce and bloody but it works thematically to show just how sick Logan is of fighting. The narrative at times has some logical errors and the villains are a bit underwhelming, however Mangold and the team have created a extremely compelling story. I honestly could not have asked for a better way for Jackson and Stewart to say goodbye to the franchise. ""Logan"" is absolute quality and deserves your money this weekend. Grade: A+"

And the last Patrick Stewart will be playing Professor Charles Xavier, nothing against James McAvoy who plays young Xavier in the prequels, but I'd prefer Stewart.<br/><br/>I really like the way Jackman plays Logan here, looking like he's 60 years old, and his advanced healing isn't working to well. Jackmans performance here is what makes Logan very human. And Patrick Stewart showing Charles Xavier age catching up on him.

It makes you angry and sad and you will also laugh quite a bit. It is very violent and very deep. Some will complain about that it was Rated R, but after seeing this movie, I believe there was no other way to tell this story. It is not violent to just be violent like some other action stories. Every scene has its purpose, and I do not believe the depth of this story could be told in a PG-13 environment. <br/><br/>I am sad this will be Jackman's last time playing this role, but I could not dream of a better story/ending for the end of his time as the character.

For a superhero movie, most of it coheres and makes sense, but then I have two bones to pick.<br/><br/>First, an ailing Logan with his magic injection juice is right up there with Popeye and his spinach. Boo, and hiss.<br/><br/>Second, the mutants are chased by a rabid force from an evil corporation. All the mutants need to do is step over into Canada, and all will be well. Wow, what a clever current political statement. In reality, it seems like the evil corporation would find away into Canada, unless, of course, there's a wall.<br/><br/>Also, Professor X deserved a more dignified exit. Then again, don't we all?"

","From the first word spoken, you know this is going to be a different kind of Marvel Mutants movie.<br/><br/>The power level has always been something that many of the X- Franchise movies struggled with, but in this movie the lines are clearly drawn. Wolverine is a frightening thing to any non-powered human, as are mutants in general.<br/><br/>Prof X is quite honestly a perfect representation as well. We have seen many a previous nod to his power level, but in this film, Xavier might be a broken man, but not powerless.<br/><br/>There are a few nods to X-story lines, but in the end, this movie is clearly not trying to cobble together former odd plot lines. The 'bad guys' are not caricatures, and you can understand their motivation, and the relationship between Logan and Xavier (and oddly enough, Caliban) is a perfect swan song.<br/><br/>if you don't like ""superhero"" movies, then this is still worth a go. If you liked the X-Franchise movies so far, I honestly think you might hate this movie. but if you like cinema, and want to see what old powerful characters could be like when they just don't care any more (Shane / Un-forgiven are obvious parallels) then I think you will love it.<br/><br/>Just wince a little for the damage caused to the un-enhanced characters in the movie, because this clearly shows what happens to the red- shirts in absolute clarity."

","Going in to ""Logan"" I had purposely avoided every article and video outside of the official trailer so as to not spoil the experience.<br/><br/>Having watched every X-men movie and an exceedingly large portion of the original cartoon series of the same name, it was so odd to see ""Wolverine,"" and ""Charle's"" appear so human, so vulnerable and weak. In fact I'd go as far as to say that ""Old Man Logan"" as a character to watch was painful in a way, due to him being the embodiment of the ""The Immortal Wolverine"" up until this point. He's aged and by quite a number of years at that. ""Charle's"" is no exception either as we witness the inevitability of old age take hold.<br/><br/>As this is a spoiler free review, I obviously have to be careful with what I write. If you're curios as to ""Why should I go see this?"" then allow me to put it another way. It was a saddened pleasure to see Hugh Jackman's Wolverine come full circle. After 17 years, The Wolverine we all know and love has come to an end. An era has ended and what a time it was to bear witness to such an award smashing interpretation of one of our favorite fictional characters of all time. As a final note, the Humor is very well placed as is the swearing. It really rings home that Mutants are still humans, in one way or another.<br/><br/>God Speed Mr. Jackman. I look forward to your future roles. And a big Congratulations on beating Cancer for the 6th time. It is far from your time to leave us yet."

","Usually when you watch a trailer, you see some really epic stuff, but then the movie delivers like half the epic stuff (Suicide Squad had an amazing trailer, only to have a mediocre film as an example). So after seeing the Logan trailers, I thought (they look epic, but movie is probably just going to be another decent action movie..). Boy was I damn wrong. This movie has so much depth to it, lots of emotion and drama, amazing brutal fight scenes, and even sparks of comedy throughout (that typical Wolverine comedy we seen from the other X-Men movies).<br/><br/>There was nothing in this movie that felt wasted.

","First i heard that Logan will hit the theater, i had no plan to watch it. As i am not really a fan of Wolvie. <br/><br/>After I heard good reviews about it, then i decided to watch it ASAP. So, I watched it with no expectation and the result was blowing my mind. <br/><br/>From my point of view, the story was pretty simple yet stunning. The setting in the near future, where no more mutans and Logan lives under the radar while he gets old and taking care of Charles, suddenly a Mexican woman looking for him and to help her. from here, the story is getting intents. <br/><br/>5 words i can say about Logan : Brutal, dark, sad, simple and the best. <br/><br/>I think its a brilliant choice to make Logan in R-Rate, which how savage Logan is, it makes him can be himself. Logan is the darkest story i ever watch from X-Men Installments and it works perfectly. I totally can feel how Logan feels. This is the first time i got my tears in my eyes, i even can hear the girl next to me sniff her nose. it always touched me when the movies bring father-daughter relationship. How simple the story is, but its a good decision, so the movie can focus on the problem itself. and simply the best movies of X-Men installment i ever watch. I was disappointed with the first 2 Wolverine Movies and it ends the movie with the great way. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the scene stealer was Dafne Keen. She didn't talk at all maybe more than a half the movie but when she started her action, my jaw dropped. but i was pretty annoyed when she finally spoke. <br/><br/>what can i say, well done. I hope I can see more dark movies of X- Men in the future to show that they go to the next step, not only popcorn movies anymore... well done"

","if you can get past the graphic violence which is at a nearly laughable level there is a good story that takes advantage of established and new characters.<br/><br/>The dispensing of generic bad guys gets a little redundant and perhaps the movie could have been a bit shorter if not so many were graphically eliminated.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is an outstanding actor with many talents. Too bad it would be out of character to expect the Wolverine to sing. Perhaps one day there will be an X-men the musical.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the franchise this might be your favorite of the series. If this is your first venture into this genre there is plenty to like. <br/><br/>The movie looks great on the big screen and should be seen in a theater environment with big sound.

"eparazak","8","0","3","4 March 2017"," A good movie with some flaws.
","I know that Wolverine and the X-Men are a popular Marvel superhero franchise and have had their ups and downs. Let me say for one that I have never been a person who was really into the franchise. I didn't watch the animated TV shows, read the comic or watch the movies. Because of this, I went into the movie blindly. Because of that, I will judge this movie as a movie and not as an adaptation of the comic series.<br/><br/>Unlike what I've seen from most superhero films, the movie's focus seems to focus on the adventure aspect. Whether this is can be considered a good or bad thing is subjective. This somewhat made me feel underwhelmed considering the fact that this somewhat breaks the mold of superhero films. Normally, superhero films have many action scenes, this film on the other hand only has a handful of action scenes, and the only one I found to be interesting was the one at the end. In spite of the lack of fight scenes, the fight scenes were very well executed with interesting camera angles and camera movement, and the movements of the characters especially translated well during that final fight scene. I did really like the character growth between Logan and the girl, which might be one of the main highlights of the movie's story for me. Aside from that, I really can't judge the characters since I haven't read the comics. If there's one thing that I can give acclaim to, it's the acting. I thought the acting performances were really well done; whether it'd be Hugh Jackman as Logan or Dafne Keen as the child or many of the other actors, you'll have a hard time forgetting these acting performances for what they are.<br/><br/>I may not have found it fantastic as many other critics have, but Logan will at least give you a memorable experience. If you're an X- Men fan, then you might like it more than I did."

","Now by no means am I a 'critic' or a specialist in film, but I do have to say, this movie is something special. It is most certainly different from the other X-men and Wolverine movies that we've had before, including superhero movies in general.<br/><br/>It doesn't try and disguise and sugar-code things, as you may have expected from the R rating. There are very brutal scenes in this movie from kids being shot at to an entire family being murdered... and it pulls it off. Every action scene is intense and almost makes you feel like you're there with them. You also really feel these characters, Logan for example, you know why he's beyond angry with the world, you know why the girl is furious with the people that took her and you can definitely see it in her character that she is scarred.<br/><br/>The last 10-20 minutes of the movie you're on the edge of your seat. When Logan takes the medicine and just goes ham on everyone you can feel the strength. When it wears off, you're scared for him, you feel unprotected and insecure. And it's kind of like that the entire movie because you know he's weak, old, so is Xavier. There are moments when you say to yourself, is he done for? Is this it?<br/><br/>By the end scene when Logan is dying and Laura says ""Daddy"" it is the saddest and most gut-wrenching thing you've ever seen.<br/><br/>This movie is everything you wanted it to be, and is a perfect farewell to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine."

","Forget everything you may have thought you knew about comic book movies. Logan makes you hurt, feel, and surprisingly laugh (but just a little) over the two and half hour run time. This is definitely a different Wolverine than you're used to. He's more than a little beat up, and tired. Dragging him down to earth though is what makes this so engaging.<br/><br/>While the movie's over two hours long, I barely noticed the length, it was that engaging. While there's plenty of action to keep the comic book junkie in me satisfied (blood & explosions galore!) it's really the quieter moments that will keep you locked in. Never have you seen a character study done so deeply and so well in a comic book film. If you're a fan of X-men in general, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. If you're not generally a comic book fan, you need to go too, it's well worth the time."

","I will say after 17 years of Hugh jackman playing the popular wolverine character since the first X men film back in 2000, it feels sad that this film is his final portrayal in the role. The film is based off the old man Logan storyline which deals with an aging Logan whose healing ability is diminishing and Charles Xavier whose growing dementia has made his psychic powers more unstable, Logan discovers that he has a daughter named Laura who is part of the transign company who has been cresting mutant children as weapons. After the success of deadpool as an r rated film, wolverine finally gets to show his full bad ass mode with all the cursing and gore as intended. While it feels darker and more realistic than previous X men films, but it feels like a proper final outing for the wolverine character."

Mangold managed to surprise us all by showing the real potential of a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Never before I have seen a marvel movie like this one. Watchers have every right compering it to the Dark Knight series. The director did a pretty good job in the previous Wolverine movie but with Logan he showed us a completely different approach. What he did beautifully is showing us the human side of superhuman characters. The great Wolverine, the indestructible mutant who was almost impossible to kill is now weak, old and ready to die. He even had a cell phone and needed glasses to read. <br/><br/>The relation between the three main characters was full of emotion. Charles somehow represented a father figure which was now old and had to be taken care of. And the girl, she was the exact copy of Wolverine and the daughter he never had. Both portrayal of Charles and Laura deserve attention but this may also be the best performance of Jackman in a Wolverine movie.<br/><br/>This is how I have always imagined Wolverine, full of blood, wounds and fighting to his last breath to save the ones he loves.<br/><br/>There aren't any more guns in the valley."

","Logan is a heart warming addition to the X-men franchise. The film is different to the rest of the X-men films â€“ it is far more subtle. But it does not disappoint; it is an emotional thrill ride packed with action and presented in an 'R' rated format true to the original savage nature of Wolverine. <br/><br/>The acting in Logan is of course of a very high calibre. Hugh Jackman portrays a dishevelled Wolverine effortlessly. It is definitely one of his best performances to date. Patrick Stewart also returns in this film as Professor X. He also acts the part masterfully as he has done for many years. Dafne Keen gives a great performance which adds a really interesting dynamic to the film. <br/><br/>James Mangold's directing is excellent. The shots in the film all look incredible. It truly feels like Mangold cares for the source material and has poured his heart into every frame of the picture. <br/><br/>The film does play a little fast and loose with the mythology of Wolverine. Having said this, it is hard to hold a grudge against this film as it delivers on so many other levels. It really delivers an emotional punch!<br/><br/>I have grown up with the X-men films, so to see this film bring about an effective conclusion to the character arc of Wolverine is satisfying closure. I particularly like the father/daughter parts of the film as they are oozing with emotion. The ending of the film is very symbolic and marks the end of an era perfectly. <br/><br/>To sum up, I feel that the film is very good watch and I recommend it to everyone who love the character of Wolverine as much as I do. I would give the film 8 out of 10 as it is a poignant end to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine."

It's a great movie, a great comic book movie, the best X-Men Movie, the best wolverine movie, etc. It's a lot like Watchmen (to me) in the aspect that it's a comic book movie that doesn't feel/play out out like one. It's emotional, it's (mostly) serious, it's sad, and it really touches you as you watch. Is it sad that this is Hugh's last performance as Wolverine/Logan: yes, but the introduction of Laura/X-23 is (in my opinion) a really good play for Fox. If they try to re-cast Wolvie too soon, fans will be outraged, but by introducing X-23 (a brand-new, but similar character) we can have several new movies, characters, adventures, etc until Fox deems enough time has passed for the introduction of a new ""Wolverine"".<br/><br/>Again, i don't wanna spoil anything so I'll leave you with this: whether you're a comic book fan, an action-movie fan, or just a movie fan, you'll LOVE this movie. It tells a spectacular, touching story, and it has plenty of the brutal R-rated action that Wolverine fans have wanted to see for so long. GO SEE IT! I promise you WON'T be disappointed! <br/><br/>PS - for all you avid comic readers: with the exception of characters that Marvel Studios has the rights to (Captain America, Hawkeye & The Hulk come to mind) this is the most true-to-the-book adaptation I've seen since Deadpool last year."

Patrick Stewart crippling performance as a very old and sick Professor X will break the hearts of many long time X-men fans. Dafne Keen plays Laura (X-23) and does an outstanding job especially with her facial expressions as a young feral X-23. The other complementary characters did okay with what their characters were given ( Pierce and Caliban). The fight scenes in this movie are raw,brutal and have true grit. Some of the most intense scenes that had me and many audiences members in awe of how brutal this movie was. It slows down in the middle for character development but keeps you into it with the performances from Jackman and Stewart. This is truly The Wolverine movie we always wanted and we finally got.

","Not that I'm saying I didn't rate all the little in jokes so far in the xmen movies but this is different. We have moved away from the easy going special effect laden good guys wear xmen outfits and save the day.<br/><br/>This is nasty, violent, bloody and frequent use of strong language. The scene is set in the future, there have been no mutants born in 25 years, Logan is looking old and is visibly limping and clearly ill and tired. He's also not healing like he used to (Hugh Jackman brilliant as the troubled antihero as always). Professor Xavier (a brilliant Patrick Stewart) who is barely a shell of himself, stripped of his suits and having to take high doses of meds to control his abilities. The plan is simple, Logan is working as a chauffeur (yes really), is caring for Professor Xavierwith a former mutant hunter and is trying to save up money to escape and get all three of them away from everybody. Then he encounters a team of mutant bounty hunters and a young girl who is very much like him, but she is being hunted. Best advice, hold on and don't be scared of a bit gore. This is very much in your face camera not panning away violence.

"bastille-852-731547","8","0","3","4 March 2017"," Unique and bleak, this comic book film stands out.
","Hugh Jackman is back to play his signature role of Wolverine in this unconventional, brutal, and very well-made superhero film. From the first frame, it's clear that ""Logan"" isn't your typical Marvel or DC film. Despite the R rating, its unquestionably somber tone is also very different from the dry, raunchy humor that made ""Deadpool"" stand out.<br/><br/>Jackman's performance is powerful from beginning to end. The grit and emotional power he wields while playing Wolverine this time is very different from any previous film iterations of this character. It also invests the viewer more fully in the story, while examining Wolverine as a weary, flawed, and in many ways realistic character rather than a comic book caricature. The supporting cast, particularly Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Dafne Keen as Laura, are excellent as well. The film's dark tone mixed with realism makes the film special. While the film is difficult to watch at times, its setting near the U.S.-Mexico border in 2029 mixed with the tone create a harsh reality and critique of modern society.<br/><br/>Despite the masterful tone and quality of performances, I do have a few criticisms of ""Logan."" While the action scenes are shot very well and incredibly visceral (and bloody,) they do start to feel repetitive by the end of the film, and each of them feels a bit like the last one rather than taking the opportunity to take the action in and of itself in a slightly different direction. Also, the climax and ending feels slightly rushed. While the film is somewhat long, it never feels tedious or too long.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this feature is by far the best film in the X-Men/Wolverine franchise. Its darkness--and its uniquely down-to-earth sense of realism--will give viewers much to think about."

Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine was amazing. Patrick Stewart was outstanding, and Dafne Keen was great as X-23. James Mangold done a great job directing and co-writing. He gave us a Wolverine we all been waiting for and he stayed true to the comics. I just wish it didn't took this long. We all knew Hugh Jackman was brilliant as Wolverine, but it's good to see the writers doing him justice. If any superhero movie deserves an Oscar it's this one. I have to admit this movie left me a bit emotional. My wife loved and felt the film the way I did. Thank you Hugh Jackman for giving us 17 amazing years. I will miss you as The Wolverine.

","I'm probably not the best one to review this film because I'm not an expert in all the X-Men history that goes before nor the comic book world but it is an Interesting case study of a super hero aging out. not the warrior he once was, covered with scars from past battles but now his old bones take longer to heal. It's hard hitting because many of us old timers can identify with him, not only for these reasons but because he now finds himself occupying a world in which he feels disenfranchised, no longer a part of. All of his friends dead. Wolverine's heart is also scared over from too much loss for one lifetime, and watching people close to him die, to the point that he is now unable to bond even with his own daughter who desperately needs him. A born warrior, designed for combat, he doesn't think twice about laying his life down for her... but mustering up any genuine feelings seems to be just out of his reach. As fate would have it, I am actually familiar with the filming location used in this film so I guess that adds another layer of ""touching close to home"" for me. At any rate, he died as he lived, with honor and no excuses. This film is gonna be with me for a while."

","The X-men series is a story that on many levels is close to my heart in the form of comics, games, and the 90s animated TV show. In the movieverse though, there have been some triumphic downfalls and surprising successes in Fox studios' telling of the mutant force. This weekend, Logan attempts to breathe life back into the series, with what looks to be a different take on the hero genre. What's the verdict? Unless you have clairvoyance as a super power, you are going to have to read to find out. <br/><br/>LIKES:  Fresh Twist  Comedic Relief  Strong Character Development  Strong Villain  Action we Really Wanted<br/><br/>Summary: Fox seems to have realized that twists can be a good thing (Deadpool) and have decided to integrate the anti-hero switch-up into the mix. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) journey dives into the darker corners of the X-Men world, to a place where allies are few and hope is practically nil. This more forlorn setting opened up avenues for greater storytelling, primarily in developing Logan as a character (which seems to have been the goal for most of the X-men movies). One will get to dive into his inner character, facing the specters that haunt the supposedly invincible Wolverine from media past. It is in this regard that X-Men finally got the villain quality right in regards to Logan being his own worst enemy. Logan's inner doubt is perhaps one of the strongest villains this universe has known, and provides a constant challenge to the development and well-being of not just him, but the other characters of the film. And it is thanks to this that Logan has a lot more emotion packed in than other superhero films have had in the past. To my surprise, Logan has a nice balance of comedy to relieve the darker moments, timing most jokes perfectly to emphasize the simple dialogue. <br/><br/>Biggest relief from the ""darkness"" though comes in the form of the action, which finally delivers the promised fights we've been waiting for. That five-minute clip in Apocalypse was a sample of the high-adrenaline fights in this movie. Logan traded flashy CGI light shows for a choreographed chaos that involved blending martial arts with classic Wolverine claws. The intense dances of death, mixed with the exciting score and sound effects, will make up for much of the lackluster fights of the past and match the expectations are imaginations set all those comic books ago. And while I wanted more action (because I always do), Logan does a nice job spacing the fights out to be mostly relevant to the plot of the story. A small side note, I wished there had been a little more diversity to the fights, but it's a small critique. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Boring at Times  A Weak Villain  Language at times  Animal Grunting  The Psychic moments  Unnecessary Gore?<br/><br/>Summary: You're probably laughing at my contradictory statements, but Logan is a movie that is kind of boring at times. Character development takes time, dialogue, and more ""peaceful"" moments of not tearing someone's throat out to do right. Unfortunately, Logan's dark atmosphere mixed with these dialogue rich moments can drag at times. Their cross-country journey has more than a few unnecessary sequences, where detailed tangents added little benefit other than a few whimsical jokes or build up to a fight down the road. It's not that these scenes didn't need to be deleted, just shortened to be more relevant (and time efficient). But much like a Western, which this movie feels like, these slower, moral filled moments are the deserts that span between oases. What also didn't help was how the villains in this film were still kind of lame. Inner Logan is deadly, but the ranger with the metal arm and his employer's other ""elite"" projects still fall into the lame category. Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) is all bark and little bite, barely doing anything but making threats and occasionally firing a gun, when his more effective lackeys were spent. It's fortunate these bad guy roles are limited, including the mediocre twist to the mix. <br/><br/>The other biggest dislike is the unbalanced aggressiveness this film has with it. I know, Wolverine is an aggressive character. Does that mean we have to reduce his normally clever dialogue with an unhindered use of the F word? Apparently in this film it did, and the lazy dependence on the cursing still remains a tiresome ploy for me. In addition, this film really dipped into the animal grunting and roaring of not only Logan, but Laura (Dafne Keen) as the two continuously (and at times annoyingly) scream. Also overdone were some of the aggressive psychic moments that became drawn out sequences of torture that is both fulfilling and unnecessary at the same time. And as for the violence, Logan steps this game up (which is why the fights rock), but the level of gore involved has been upped as well. Those thinking of taking younger audience members need to note the R rating, because you'll be subjected to maiming, decapitation, and other blood filled moments that for me really didn't need to be to that level. <br/><br/>The Verdict:<br/><br/>Logan is an improvement over many of the X-men films in regards to storytelling, action, and character development. Yet it's failings for me come in the form of some editing quirks, unbalanced dialogue, and overly aggressive gore. It matches the themes of the modern graphic novels, but I felt with some balancing the movie could have been even better. I feel the movie is worth a trip to the theater though, but please think twice before taking kids to see it. <br/><br/>My scores: Action/Drama/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0"

","After they announced this is going to be last Wolverine instalment there was a lot of mixed emotions but after seeing this magnificently beautiful picture there is no doubt that it will be remembered as one of the best series sequels if not the best. Logan takes us to totally different and unexpected journey of survival and pain. Presenting Logan as old, disturbed and without any positive though whatsoever was really brilliantly melted into this incredibly written plot and story. This relentless and heart breaking drama that is mixed with maybe some of the most brutal and terrifying violence that is show throughout whole movie and never stops to surprise gave movie so much power. Seeing Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) so old and weak but in the same time so powerful and without control over his mind was quite disturbing and frightening but in the same time love for Logan and Laura was greater than anything. Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen) is the girl that is created so she could serve a weapon for fighting. She was so terrifying and violent that it was in some point weird to look at that but also her charisma and emotions and how she starts to understand more was interesting to watch. Logan (Hugh Jackman) gave us a surprise that maybe no one expected because his performance is probably the best superhero/drama performance ever seen. His disturbing character in year 2029 has seen too much and in every scene he proves that point and gives one of the best performances of his. Also a great and funny character was Caliban (Stephen Merchant) and he added something original to movie and gave a good performance in couple scenes that he featured. James Mangold is the man responsible for the Logan as he put a great effort in creating an amazing script and directing movie in incredible way. If time has come for superhero movie to push his way in some of major award this movie could do it because of its never stopping drama and some of the great efforts by cast. 4/4"

","Last night was a blast as we got to go to the theater and enjoy Logan (2017). Which honestly turned out to be a very entertaining movie. At first, when I saw the trailer, it didn't look like much but it did get my attention; it sort of seemed bland. I can honestly say the trailer itself didn't do it justice. <br/><br/>We weren't expecting a whole lot given the last wolverine film as it sort of flopped hard, but we were surprised to see they put a lot of effort into making Logan a whole lot better; they did well. The acting was as good as all the rest, the graphics nicely were done; the story was on point. Very few spots within the movie that I just looked at our team and said (really?), but ya gonna have that in a lot of films.

","First of all, let's thank 20th Century Fox, and director James Mangold for giving us this MASTERPIECE, that changed the superhero genre, forever.<br/><br/>Logan follows, well, Logan, as he must protect Laura from her captors. The first minute the movie goes, you know this is not your average superhero movie, and it shows! Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, both in their final performance as Wolverine and Prof. X respectively delivers their best performances that people may not forget for a while. However, However, the big surprise is the new rising star, Dafne Keen as the titular Laura- aka X- 23. She awesome, her acting's on point, and easily steals the show. The rest of the performances is also memorable, especially the main villain, He's a villain the MCU might never replicate for a while.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the fights were savage, brutal and one of the best in the series. The movie also bring some of the most emotional scenes I've ever seen, and a Oscar-grade ending sequence, all was shot beautifully, and edited perfectly. There's also some great laughs, easter eggs, large amount of profanity (very rare in a superhero movie), a well-placed surprise, and lots of blood. Director James Mangold has crafted us his masterpiece, his own movie where he had the creative control, where he manages to create what arguably the best X-men movie in the franchise, as well raising up the standards for future superhero movies.<br/><br/>As the movie is flawless, the movie has nearly zero room for flaws. For the first time ever, I nearly can't find a flaw in the movie, which is of course great! *SPOILER ALERT* But I truly miss Stan Lee's cameo, I mean, I can't find him anywhere in the movie. Is he sick? Somebody should have a check on him! *SPOILER ENDS HERE*<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is the movie the world's been waiting for. Beautifully shot, flawlessly edited, and a impactful ending, it is absolutely the best movie in the franchise, raising the bar for future superhero movies, and a perfect farewell for Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart as two of our favorites in the X-men franchise (Just, don't bring your kids for this will ya? It's not good for them)<br/><br/>Thank you, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, your performances as Wolvie and Professor X will be missed..."

","Before I go on, I review movies in the way they are supposed to be viewed. That means a rating of 9 for the Godfather and a 9 for Guardians of the Galaxy mean completely different things. Also, I feel that a 10 rating is reserved for ""the best movie ever made"" and a 9 is for the handful of ""oh my god I love that movie"". Most great movies therefore come in at an 8. So my review will pretty much always be lower than the average ratings<br/><br/>First off THANK YOU DEADPOOL CREATORS. Without your success, this awesome film would not happen. It's not even close to the same style, but you guys opened studio eyes that things don't have to be cookie cutter PG-13 good guy saves the day movies. <br/><br/>Now, on to Logan. I'll hit on a the good things first. The acting. My GOD it was fantastic. I'd put it in the world of Ledger's Joker in terms of ""serious"" acting. All 3 main characters really were done excellent and this was Hugh Jackman's best acting ever. His moments of turning into a raged animal made my eyes go wide and blood pressure go up. Stewart crushed his role in every facet. They pulled off excellent portrayals of what the writers came up with. <br/><br/>The character writing was equally superb. Having Xavier's health problems was such a good choice. They expertly bounced equally between angry old guy, to confused sick person, to the wise man he once was on multiple occasions. Having Logan clearly be ""over it"" in so many ways was an interesting take. Dude doesn't care anymore about himself or much in general. He is still angry though. Which is believable for one of the last mutants who saw all his friends pass. Extreme credit to the writing of Laura. Not because it was groundbreaking, but because they did it SMART. A young actor can ruin a movie. So, they gave this girl the Keanu treatment. Be silent, be dark, be angry, be a mystery. And it works flawlessly. <br/><br/>Settings were very good. They reflecting the character of Logan well by being so desolate. <br/><br/>The action. Best of any Superhero movie to date. Closest comp I can give is to V for Vendetta (different styles though). I have been saying for years to anyone involved in a superhero movie conversation with me ""I want them to make a Gladiator style superhero movie. Give me gore, give me good choreography, give me brutal"". And the action in this movie, NAILS THAT. Dafne Keen (Laura) put on a great show in her action shots as well and it really put the fight scenes over the edge. <br/><br/>Now onto the not great. The actual main arcing story was very meh. It was fine, but reluctant bodyguard isn't top notch. The bad guy was extremely replaceable in every sense. Did nothing for me. <br/><br/>To be honest, this movie, with a very few amount of tweaks, could be as good as Dark Night (which does honestly get a 9 in my rating system). No doubt in my mind. But the movie was long and FELT long. The ENTIRE sequence, which was a complete cliché as well, of the poor farmer family taking in the wayward travelers was pointless. Seriously, just cut the entire 20 minutes out please. There was 3 things they tried to do with this. First to show that innocent people die in any type of ""war"". Cool, but that could have been done along the way instead of stopping the story. Second, it was to introduce the Logan Clone. Which didn't NEED to happen. We didn't need the narrator overtones saying ""we couldn't replicate the anger and pain in kids so we did this yada yada yada."" They could have just opened the door in the fight scene in the woods and have the clone jump out and go. We would have all thought ""Oh crap they cloned him exactly"" without any narration. Lastly they killed Xavier here. Which could also have been done in another scene. In fact, I think it could have been even better writing to bring Xavier to ND, kids go on their way, fight breaks and Xavier is killed by the clone there. This prompts Logan to go full injection out of fury and proceeds to go into a blackout of rage on the murderer and everyone around on his side.<br/><br/>To put my 7 in prospective of superhero movies with some other movies:<br/><br/>9: Dark Night, Guardians, V for Vendetta 8: Deadpool, Batman Begins, IM1, Civil War, Winter Soldier 7: Logan, Avengers, Strange, Spider-man, Blade 6: Ant-Man, First Class/Days of future, Ultron 5: x-men 1/2, Wolverines, Apocalypse 4: Thor, IM2, X3,"

","Logan: "" I HURT MYSELF TODAY, TO SEE IF I STILL FEEL. I FOCUS ON THE PAIN, ONLY THING THAT'S REAL."" REVIEW:(no-spoilers) In this cinematic universe of x-men, LOGAN (wolverine)has been alive for 200~ years. So, he has been trough a lot of pain for losing his loved ones. For him witnessing this sort of tragedies is not new. Try to understand his character, if he tears up at least a little bit, it's equivalent to a normal human crying out of misery and heavy pain. 2. This movie is not made to please audiences, means it never compromises its approach in delivering the product so that people can have a good time. 3. This movie is gritty, depressing, humorous and true to its core. 4. Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Hugh Jackman (Logan ""The Wolverine"") and Dafne Keen (X-23) gave ""THE"" performances of a lifetime, couldn't reach anywhere better than this peak of acting. Even the characters Caliban and Donald Pierce have a great Structure and approach. 5. Here I want to discuss a thing called the genre, we got many like sci-fi, Rom- com, comedy, thriller, western, drama etc...Here this movie inherits the genre called ""western"", I personally feel that this is the best genre among all. because here when people die they die, this genre concentrates on the consequences of loss and death, they do not create an emotion of misery we see in drama films. For example, let me consider a movie Hell or High Water in that the characters Alberto Parker and Marcus Hamilton shares the screen time almost 3/4th of the movie. Now, we are totally involved and into these one-one character relation. During the climax char(Alberto Parker) dies in a speck very simple and straight forward by a bullet shot(no emotional buildup no background music nothing extra) The relation that's being built up for a long time is ended in a second without any explicit drama. So, this movie is after that genre ""western"". 6. The director (James Mangold) and cinematographer John Mathieson did a great job by telling the story in the most organic way possible mostly leveling down the overflow of emotions and visual structures. Most of the scenes were shot on the locations Louisiana, new Mexico and few other places, beautiful landscapes, beautiful! 7.R-rating: The most satisfying part in the entire movie ""ADAMANTIUM CLAWS"" when they rip through the skulls they do when Skin gets ripped it bleeds like it has to. When people die they die."" 8. #VERDICT: Thanks, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart.17 years of your services ends on a high emotional note. The Climax will make you weep if you are a fan like me who has been following these character since childhood. The most satisfying movie for me as a cinema lover."

","Finally a Sci-Fi film for an Adult, Logan! ""A"" rating is merely for the abuse and violence; as mentioned by James Mangold in an interview, ""knife stabbing on the chest and passing through the chest is the difference between PG-13 to R-Rated movie"". After watching this film, it stays with you; this is no ordinary Sci-Fi film. Logan is for Mature people and maturity comes in thinking not by age. Logan was always lonely, worked alone, but for the team. He's angry and too scared to be affectionate. This is one of the reasons I love the character; it feels real good about it. That is why I connect with Logan more than other superheros. Moving on, this film brings up the experiences of love, compassion and pain; in a larger frame, Logan lives his last few days as a family being a good son and a father. That's why the title ""LOGAN"" not ""WOLVERINE"". In this film the true value of a X-men is portrayed; like how a good teacher sees a teacher in his student to continue the legacy, Charles Xavier does it too. More than superpowers and battle, humanity is highlighted here, this film is for X-Men fans who have been following since 17 years, certainly not a film to show off powers of VFX industry at all; Logan's boon is a curse and he finally rests in peace doing the right thing. (afterall that's what he wanted) I'm not gonna outline the story- line here because it is pretty much on IMDb, Wikipedia, etc. All though the story-line seems simple and easily has been narrated in many films, the remarkable point is one of our lovable character Logan is finally in it, like he's treated with humane values not just as a weapon or an angry beast. I'm a true fan of X-Men cartoons, comics and films; I just know how certain films are ruined just because of sequels and limitations, but this one is worth it as it takes a huge leap from regular SciFi stuff to another level. Here I was wearing ""Wolverine"" T-Shirt to the movie, sitting alone next to strangers who were disturbing, this is how I keep my vocabulary good. Strangely feels like how I've been adapting Wolverine's character in myself. Also disappointment is, there might be people around you in the Theatre who think the film is slow and has less action in it; once they are bored, they yap a lot. I had a few A-holes surrounded; I mean they were expecting ""Hebbuli"" kind of ""stuff""! And this proves ""maturity"" is needed to watch this film!"

","I'll be real: since 2000 (and until last night) I've disliked or outright hated every Hugh Jackman performance as Logan/Wolverine. I thought that he was overdoing it and not seeming like the jaded, battle-hardened character who I came to love in the comics long before the movies were made. There was too much pep in his step and awkward mannerisms, even when Wolverine was supposedly in a great deal of mental pain. I LOVE a few of the X Men films, but I never bought into Jackman's portrayal.<br/><br/>But this film is a gem. It was the ultimate sendoff for two actors who are retiring iconic characters. Jackman nailed the nuances and behaviors of the comic character this time. It was also my favorite Patrick Stewart-as-Professor X performance. I just wish that it didn't require this film's story's brutal circumstances to bring it out of them. I wish that Jackman had always played Wolverine in a similar manner throughout his run.<br/><br/>The story is outstanding. It has great, gritty character development, real tension (unlike most comic movies) and moments of profoundly deep emotions (again, unlike most comic movies). A couple of years ago I would have laughed if you told me that I was going to shed a tear at the end of Jackman's run as Wolverine. But it happened.<br/><br/>If I have only one very slight complaint it's that the absence of many other mutants is never quite thoroughly explained. Maybe the studio wants to do other films to fill in those gaps.<br/><br/>But that slight deficiency will not cause me to lower my ten star rating.

","It was 2000 when we were first introduced with Wolverine in X-Men, a movie that totally changed on how we conceive super-heroe movies, making them fashionable, and leading to the burst that we are all witnessing. Since then, the genre has not evolved much, and is kind of repeating itself - the differences between movies are few, and each one tries to become more loud or more impressive than the previous one. I'm not complaining - they are pure entertainment! It is now, 17 years later, that Wolverine (again), through Logan, is showing us the way on how the genre should evolve - Logan should be conceived by film-makers as the reboot of the whole genre! What makes Logan different, is that it portrays its hero more human, more realistically, and making him 'mortal'. We complain that there are no good villains in the movies - but it is not about the villains - it is about the heroes: They have been presented as more powerful than anyone, outsmarting them, and making them unbeatable. So, what kind of threat can make us care for them? Worry about them? Connect to them? None! So, instead of blowing more cities (or galaxies) just to have the illusion of a threat, make the hero more down-to-earth - make him vulnerable! I believe that this is what makes this movie special - Wolverine is vulnerable. Not only in his body - in his soul too! But apart from that, the movie also contains all the elements of the genre: great action sequences, a ton of Easter eggs, good humorous moments - everything is in! Sure, there a lot of clichés, and the whole storyline is madly predictable - especially the end. There is no reason for me to extend to particular plot points. Just want to add how great Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are, and how the R rating adds to the whole 'realism' of the movie. To conclude.. you will enjoy the movie, and in the end you will be thinking of the lost opportunities of other similar movies."

There was only a brief moment in the middle where the story slowed down, but it did not last long at all.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance as Logan was on point, and it was his greatest. We finally got to see a different side of Wolverine, Logan. What made him indestructible was now destroying him, the adamantium. It was poisoning him to the point where he was losing his healing powers. But once again, he was faced with more than just himself. He had a daughter, X-23, that he did not know about. She was created in a lab and escaped and was taken to Wolverine. That only led to trouble. The Reavers, criminal cyborgs, were after X-23. Wolverine just happens to be in the way so it was now his responsibility to protect her.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier was hysterical. He sure knew how to crack jokes despite all of the suffering.<br/><br/>X-24, Wolverine's son, was crazy. He was the first mutant that the Reavers were able to control.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie did an exceptional job telling the ""Old Man Logan"" story. Get ready for some blood, violence, tears, action, laughter, and death all throughout."

","Logan <br/><br/>This film is the one of the top two best X Men films ever, Logan is at the same level and perhaps it could even surpass Days of Future Past as the best X Men film. No spoilers but if you are a big X Men fan you are going to love this film, it has a great love affair with the X Men comics of old, how this respect is done in the film is empowering and emotive. I have been a X Men fan since a kid, since the X Men cards collectibles of the 90's, and I love how in Logan the X Men are just like the thing as a kid you imagine the X Men would be. Logan is here an old man who struggles every day, suffers every day, like the Greek Legend of Prometheus, how every day is a new an endless suffering and how Logan still loves the people who help him like Professor Charles Xavier, and how indeed he is like a father to him, Charles is Logan's father. How Logan have to choose again to help people in need or not get entangled, to look the other way, but Logan is a hero, some say antihero, in the end that is the thing that a woman wisely says in the film, that she knows that Logan is still a good man deep inside, that he has been good all along, that Logan had suffered greatly and that all the bad things that he had done were of consequence because bad people had done bad things to him and that is what Logan chooses despite all the wrongs, all the suffering that had happen to him, Logan chooses to help, to be a hero, to do good, Logan is a great film. There are great Easter Eggs for X Men fans, so look out for the Wolverine comic look in Logan."

","I've been a waiting for a X-men film like this for 25 years. I was so emotional watching this film. It was fantastic, not just a excellent comic book film it's a fantastic character building film. Mr Hugh jackman is wolverine please I beg they do not recast the role. The last 10 Minutes of this film I had man tears. This film actually moved me, when wolverine dies I was a wreck, I knew I was watching the last wolverine film. But what a great way 2 end it. I think everyone involved in this great film deserves credit and this should win at least a couple of Oscars"

","I was so excited to watch Logan and I'm glad that it didn't disappoint me. It lived up to my expectations and even more! The first act of the movie is a slow burn but it builds up to a very entertaining action scene. The second act is personally my favorite, I enjoyed every second of it. What makes it special is that the director took time building up a scene, it felt like I was watching a drama instead of an action film and that's a thing that most superheros movies don't dare to do these days. Everyone in the cast did a great job and I'm gonna miss Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier<br/><br/>The cinematography and the soundtrack were so beautiful, the ending was stunning and it was a perfect way for Hugh Jackman to end the his role as wolverine."
"scottingram","8","0","4","2 March 2017"," Logan Film Review
","The new film Logan which is the latest in the X-Men films franchise starring Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. In Logan Hugh Jackman claws his way back onto the big screen in his third – and potentially final – Wolverine adventure. In the not-too-distant future, the ageing Logan/Wolverine (Australian actor Hugh Jackman - Swordfish, Prisoners) is eking out a meagre existence in the Mexico desert beside the Mexican and US border whilst caring for the elderly Charles Xavier (English actor Patrick Stewart - TV Series Star Trek: The Next Generation that ran from 1987 - 1994 not the one from the 1960's which starred William Shatner and the late Leonard Nimoy which ran from 1966 - 1969, Conspiracy Theory). However he then comes across mysterious young girl Laura Kinney/X-23 (Dafnee Keen), who possesses astonishing and dangerous powers. But Logan and Xavier must protect the child from the deadly Donald Pierce (American actor Boyd Holbrook - The Reunion, Run All Night), leader of the marauding cyborgs known as the Reavers. Inspired by the enormously popular 'Old Man Logan' serial by Mark Millar and Steve McNiven, this gripping new Wolverine movie sees Hugh Jackman imbue his signature character with notes of melancholy and more than a few grey hairs. Meanwhile returning director James Mangold (The Wolverine) promises to amp up the violent action to unprecedented levels. Amongst the other actors / actresses in Logan include English actor Stephen Merchant (Hot Fuzz, I Give It A Year) as Caliban who looks a lot like the character Nicholas Hoult played in Mad Max: Fury Road and the character with the pale white face and baldy head from the Harry Potter films, American actress Elizabeth Rodriguez (The Drop, Blow) as Gabriela, South African actor Richard E. Grant (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Hudson Hawk) as Dr. Rice, American actor Eriq La Salle and I should point out that La Salle is French for room (US TV Series ER, One Hour Photo) as Will Munson, American actress Elise Neal (Scream 2, Mission To Mars) as Kathryn Munson Will's wife, Quincy Fouse (US TV Series The Goldbergs) as Nate Munson Will and Kathryn's son, Reynaldo Gallegos (Bad Boys 2, Rambo) as Rey which is Spanish for king, Polish mixed martial arts fighter, actor, stuntman, DJ and creator of the KSOS Conditioning System Krzysztof Soszynski (Here Comes The Boom, Tapped Out) as Mohawk, Australian actor Stephen Dunlevy (Mad Max: Fury Road) as Macon, Swiss actor Daniel Bernhardt (The Matrix Reloaded, John Wick) as Bone Breaker, Hannah Westerfield as Rebecca, Bryant Tardy as Bobby, Ashlyn Casalegno as Charlotte, Alison Fernandez (US TV Series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Orange Is The New Black) as Delilah, Parker Lovein as Lizard Boy, Lennie Loftin (Daredevil the 2003 film, 3:10 To Yuma 2007) as Jackson and Venezuelan actress Doris Morgado (2 Guns, I Am Wrath) as Maria. Filming locations in Logan include places like US States like Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, California and the US / Mexican border. Overall Logan is a good film filled with action, lots of gory bloody violence, swearing, fast paced and on the edge of your seat stuff, stunning effects, car chases, deserts, sunshine, heavy rain, casinos. bright lights, tongue and cheek stuff, sad moments, crazy moments, thrills and spills, some OMG moments and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Logan an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Logan is worth seeing if you like the X-Men films, the Wolverine films, Mad Max: Fury Road, Blood Father, The Reunion, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, Desperado amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Logan in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later."

","From the moment I know Logan until now that Logan is probably the film that I have many mixed feelings to each other more to this. This is the first time,a superhero movie made me cry, every time I think this is the last time I can see him on screen, the feeling was that I mixed in the film as more. With me, there's the only one Wolverine from now and forever, Logan."
"JoeYabuki","9","0","3","2 March 2017"," A Serious drama with lots of action. A dark violent movie. The plot is really touching and exquisite
","A Serious drama with lots of action. A dark violent movie. The film is like Terminator 2, the machines tries to kill a little kid and someone is there to protect her; but if you want me to be sincere this is the new The Dark Knight. A really good movie, very somber, mature and realistic.<br/><br/>The performances are great, OMG Patrick Stewart & Hugh Jackman deserve an Oscar in 2018; Dafne Keen did her part as well; the characters are well written, more humans and you feel them. It also seems like a western film.<br/><br/>Of course it has its flats, for example the children in Mexico speaks English? That doesn't make sense; or at the beginning the tone and the pacing are slow.<br/><br/>It Has very funny moments but sad at the same time.<br/><br/>The plot, the script is really touching and exquisite. James Mangold made an excellent movie, his better one; the best superhero movie ever; it will be really hard for another one to be better.<br/><br/>Good bye Hugh Jackman, good bye Wolverine & Logan, good bye Stewie."
"askjosh","9","0","3","2 March 2017"," A superhero's Western journey
","Logan is what all good Superhero movies are trying to be: a compelling story about the struggles of superpowered characters and the world set against them. Too often I feel that Superheros cruise through their movies with little challenge, swatting away henchmen then finishing the big bad guy at the end. The end. Well, Logan tries to solve that problem by making the violence impactful on the victims and the superpowered characters. Impactful isn't strong enough of a word, haha; injuries are reacted to, people are reluctant, there are deep flesh wounds, there is regret, and limbs will go flying. Without spoiling anything, deaths in the movie will be reacted to and mean something!<br/><br/>As for the acting. Hugh Jackman is good at what you expect, an angry warrior, while Patrick Stewart steals every scene he is in as a senile psychic. I don't particularly believe any children's performances, although none were bad.<br/><br/>Logan is not perfect, it is still a predictable superhero movie, but it is a really solid movie about one character's journey - a demi- god character immune to all the violence he dishes out, mostly."
"diegomagon","10","0","4","2 March 2017"," A true hero movie
","I'm writing this review after 12 hours that I watched Logan, I'm still trying to stop my feelings about what I saw and move on, it was really fantastic! After many years waiting for a true superhero movie I can say: Finally! Logan is about life and lessons, it's heartbreaking, it's exciting, it's about family and finding hope after a traumatic life. Hugh Jackman retired his claws giving the best of him, Patrick Stewart makes everybody laugh and cry, all the cast were fantastic.<br/><br/>Logan is a must watch!"

Can make sense to all the motion pictures lover right there. Great movie here folks, you should watch it Thank you Hugh Jackman."
"brankovranjkovic","8","0","3","2 March 2017"," Logan – Not your typical comic book hero film
","C18 due to brutal, very bloody violence and language content. A very dark, gritty film with some elements of emotion. Set in the near future (2029), this is an action 'chase' film, where Logan is sick and obviously dying, a bitter aging weathered shadow of his former self. He is a heavy drinker and is now susceptible to injury, his healing factor is slow, and this makes him vulnerable and an interesting divergence from his normal character. <br/><br/>Xavier is suffering from dementia, he is a sad character and also a divergence from his normal character. Can a classic stage actor like Patrick Stewart drop the F-Bomb and get away with it?  Yes he certainly can. He was definitely one of the film's highlights for me!<br/><br/>The Mutants are almost extinct, Logan finds himself reluctantly transporting a young mutant girl, Laura, who turns out to be like himself, a manufactured weapon, to 'Eden'. Logan is caring and protecting her, although it's clear she doesn't need very much protecting at all. <br/><br/>The theme for this film is family although there are very few moments of joy. There is a satisfactory conclusion to this most violent Wolverine, X-Men, Marvel (take your pick) film ever made. You also need to be aware that this is the final appearance of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart as their iconic characters, you can guess why!"
"chris-j-stanton","9","0","3","2 March 2017"," An excellent, gritty sci-fi Western
","This is a very, very good, gritty science-fiction road-trip chase movie. Think Terminator 2 or Children of Men, except the child is the opposite of defenseless or helpless.<br/><br/>Don't expect a superhero movie - it definitely is not. Super powers are nearly nonexistent. People expecting cheap laughs, explosions, CGI, and the typical ""the good guys will win"" movie (e.g. Avengers) may be disappointed. This is a character drama with occasional bouts of violence that demonstrate the brutal reality of being clawed.<br/><br/>This is a movie about aging, mortality, vulnerability, parenting and legacy. <br/><br/>It is not a perfect movie, but its a damn good one that has me still thinking about it now, long after the credits ended. Despite a simple plot, there were plot holes and the villains needed more backstory. However, despite the movie running for over two hours I still wanted more. <br/><br/>This movie demonstrates how famous comic book characters can be presented in standalone movies, without blatantly setting up a sequel.<br/><br/>Lastly, Dafne Keen was excellent. Hopefully her career amounts to more than Edward Furlong's."

","Hugh Jackman is a good actor, because to play Wolverine in advance to practice muscle, really is very hard ah ah, the Wolverine end, I am also very sad, but the story must have an ending. But our life is not over, we miss the wolverine, Rogan and X-23. Or try to live tomorrow!!! I am a loyal fan of marvel, but obviously I do not love or love the story of X-Men X, Captain America iron man that a story. But think about it, every superhero is amazing, they've been working hard."
"sumodh5","8","0","3","1 March 2017"," Gut wrenching Gut spilling Noir
","Disclaimer: Chill no spoilers. However not your regular super hero movie. Keep your kids the hell away from it (It's rated R for a very good reason). Watching the movie felt like walking into your favorite bar full of good old friends & out of the blue, being punched hard in the gut for absolutely no reason. Brutal, shocking, uncomfortable, dazed & confused - making you keel over, wondering what's coming next. Take out the mutant powers & it borders around blurred lines of a gritty western & an art house production - stripped of all the glitz & glamour of the usual superhero flick, replaced by the depth possessed by almost none of its predecessors. Paced like a freight train, barreling through the landscape at some points & in others, slowing down at key stations to leisurely meander around & explore the main protagonists. Death is a dear friend, lurking around the corner, with battles so brutally bloody that no movie in superhero history comes close to its visceral viciousness. Constantly reminding you of the throbbing pain of that punch in the gut. Logan is withering & weary, Prof X is almost senile, all hope around is draining away awaiting death's sweet embrace. Enter a pint sized feral X-23 - electrifying the somber mood, relentlessly pursued by weaponized soldiers called Reavers, kicking off a chase reminiscent of T-2, except the John Connor kid here kicks (or should I say slices & dices) some serious ass. A few surprises thrown in, some well-timed but unexpected humor & then it all hurtles towards a satisfying finish. That gut feel, ebbs away when you walk out of the hall, but lingers on to ponder over. Recommended watch after any bad day at the office - except this time, you'll be ready to absorb that punch & mentally relish giving it back with razor sharp interest"""
"buiquanghuyhnks","8","0","5","2 March 2017"," Nice way to close a trilogy and open a new one
","Been waiting for this movie since long time, and it is worth the wait. Very new perspective of the producers (to see the Wolvie age and lose his ability to heal), and throughout the movie Logan's characters are gradually revealed. At first a little annoying, then the disturbance grows as situations get worse. At some point I really dislike our hero cause he seems to give up on everything (except for his instinct to run , as a wolf) and swears a lot (even to the blood of his own). However, as the actions progress, the deepest of his heart also has been revealed - the love for his family, his friends, and his kind - mutants. Death is the only redemption, and he got his death with dignity, love, and fulfillment. Sad to see the end, but we all believe the Wolverine spirit always live, especially in his daughter Laura (what a cool kid she is, haha)."
"MrDHWong","9","0","5","2 March 2017"," A fitting swansong for both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart
","Logan is the third and concluding film in the Wolverine trilogy and the final appearance of Hugh Jackman in the title role. After two mediocre solo films, this one more than makes up for their shortcomings. It is a fitting swansong for both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>In the year 2029, an aging Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) lives in a hideout on the Mexican border caring for the elderly Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). To make ends meet, Logan works as a chauffeur around local towns in Texas. One day, a young mutant named Laura (Dafne Keen), who is being pursued by armed forces, suddenly turns up at Logan's residence and he is forced to come out of hiding to protect her at all costs.<br/><br/>Dark, violent, and highly emotional, Logan is an appropriate ending to the long lasting Wolverine saga. Hugh Jackman once again gives it his all in the lead role. It's sad to know that this is very likely the last time we'll ever see him play this iconic character, but this film will certainly cement his legacy deep in our minds. Patrick Stewart, who also gives his final performance as Professor Charles Xavier, was great as well. One can't help but feel sad for this once great mind succumbing to the detrimental effects of old age and senility.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"
