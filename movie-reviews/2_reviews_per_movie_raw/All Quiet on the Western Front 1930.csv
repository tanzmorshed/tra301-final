","Erich Maria Remarque's novel and the film made from it may possibly be the greatest anti-war statement ever created. All Quiet on the Western Front won a deserved Best Picture Academy Award in the year it came out and brought great prestige to Universal Pictures as the first Oscar in that category won by that studio.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres is the student leader of a bunch of German school boys in 1914 who listen to the voice of their school master and enlist in the war that's just been declared. The whole class enlists and that's not hyperbole because in Germany at the time it was the boys who got the education and the girls if they got it, got it separately from the boys. <br/><br/>I'm sure that viewers of All Quiet on the Western Front today probably are asking why that school master and so many of his generation were urging their youth on to such folly. Very simply that their generation had a quick victory in 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War. Every generation since wars were recorded figures their war experience will be the same for their children.<br/><br/>Only it wasn't. On the western front the Allied and Central Powers armies were locked in a bitter stalemate that ran diagonally across France and Belgium from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This went on for a little over four years. In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I'm sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.<br/><br/>You lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy's trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.<br/><br/>And it shows that from the enemy perspective. That's something today's audience can't appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis. <br/><br/>Louis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page. Adolphe Menjou took the part of Walter Burns in that film which Wolheim was to have.<br/><br/>The third really stand out performance is that of John Wray who some might remember as the brutal prison guard in Each Dawn I Die. Wray plays an officious mail man who is in the German Army Reserve. He gets called up and this little nobody gets rather impressed with himself and his new found authority as a training sergeant to Ayres and his friends. Later on at the front, he gets a view of combat he wasn't quite ready for.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front with its eternal message of peace and life will be one eternal film, it will be shown and appreciated for many generations to come."

","In 1930, three great pacifist films were released, in the United States, Lewis Milestone's ""All Quiet on the Western Front;"" in Germany, G.W. Pabst's ""Westfront 1918;"" and the English film by Anthony Asquith, ""Tell England."" Of the three, Milestone's film was the one that has received most acclaim...<br/><br/>Based on the novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" tells the story of a teenager brought up to believe in the values of patriotism, militarism and the glorious death... The teenager returns on leave to his school where the schoolmaster who has taught him the values that he now despises greets him with ecstasy...<br/><br/>As a fighter he is treated with great respect, and the eager young children wait to be aroused by thrilling tales... He has none. There is no heroism. There is no glory. 'We live in the trenches and we fight. We try not to be killed - that's all!'<br/><br/>The film is totally committed to its proposition war is evil; not only the First World War which is portrayed in the film, but all war.<br/><br/>The motion picture, considered among the screen's most powerful indictments of the futility of war, contains many excellent sequences and set-pieces which still keep their power: the pair of boots being continually taken over as successive owners are killed; Lew Ayres talking impotently on about the brotherhood of man and the futility of killing as he watches his French enemy die beside him in a shell crater; Ayres carrying the wounded Wolheim on his back and talking cheerfully to him, ignoring he has been killed by a shell splinter; and of course, the closing scene of the hand reaching out from the trenches to seize a butterfly only to fall back slowly as an enemy's bullet falls home...<br/><br/>Despite dated moments, this highly emotive war film retains its overall power and remains a great pacifist work... The film won won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director and was nominated for Best Cinematography & Best Writing..."
"kian_ef","Null","120","140","17 May 2001"," Great acting, great directing make a sincere, emotional film.
","To say that this movie is one of the greatest war films of all time would be an understatement.  Naturally, since the picture is based on Erich Maria Remarque's marvelous novel, the screenwriter was given quite a powerful story to begin with.  The three main reasons why I consider this movie so forceful are the acting, the cinematography, and simply the sincerity.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres, the man who plays Paul Baumer, convincingly portrays the main character in many ways.  First of all, the sheer innocence of his facial appearance adds a poignant touch to the film, because the overwhelming theme of the story is how the war effects all young people of each nation, whether that person dies in the trenches or survives only to lament his days in the war.  Ironically, when the film was initially being put together, Remarque, the novelist who won critical acclaim for writing the book, was asked to play the role of Paul.  Having seen time in the war the producers must have thought him aptly prepared to play the role.  But he declined because he had other commitments and because he felt he was not such a great actor.  Lucky for us, because Ayres gives a powerful performance.  Other characters with relatively minor roles have major importance in the film because they portray touching, heart wrenching scene s of death.  These peripheral characters all help add to the general tone of the film (and the book) because they show how dark and terrible the war can be; and they in turn show how propaganda can be so harmful, because most of the soldiers in Paul's regiment are volunteers who receive a very rude awakening when they discover what the war is really all about.  The acting is simply superb, and perhaps this is due to the fact that the famous director George Cukor was an assistant who, although uncredited, came onto the set to help supervise the actors (possibly because director Lewis Milestone's English was not too good).<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is absolutely magnificent.  The film rarely has gory sequences because the director finds other ways to imply death and still have the same emotional effect.  One way in which he does this is by showing single body parts (such as a hand or a leg) and allowing these appendages to show the death of the soldier as a whole.  Also, the cameraman uses overhead angles at times with great skill and also focuses on the trenches at times as the soldiers fall back into them after being shot (which implies that the trenches are a symbol of hell, because soldiers fall into them to die).  In short, the cinematographer Arthur Edeson allows the camera to do the talking and to drive the film, rather than the dialogue (speaking of which, there is relatively little; the actors' facial expressions do the bulk of the talking in the film).<br/><br/>When I say this film is sincere I really can't give you any tangible evidence to prove the point; all I can tell you is to see the film.  The film at times overwhelmed me with emotion to the extent that I got goose bumps from watching some of the more agonizing scenes.  In a way, this movie is much like a silent film.  This stands to reason because it came at the very beginning of the 'talkie' age, only three years after The Jazz Singer (1927).  Also, Milestone directed silent films before this one, and he seemed to know that less focus on dialogue and more focus on acting would bring about an overwhelmingly emotional and well, sincere, film.  The film obviously had an effect on its star, Mr. Ayres, because once World War II began and he was drafted into the war, he conscientiously protested serving in the army because of his opinions towards war.  I believe he admits that his opinions stem from his work in this movie.  Certainly this is a powerful admission, because his protest caused him and his films to be blacklisted in Hollywood, and his career suffered greatly because of his ideals.  So if you don't believe my words about the power of this film, believe his."
"soymilk","10","101","119","20 November 2004"," A moving and durable WWI classic
","As I write, this is probably the oldest film I've currently seen (I haven't seen too many flicks pre-1950s - shameful, I know), but one that still holds astonishingly well to this day; a poignant and hard-hitting anti-war drama that details life in the German side of the trenches of WWI, it has lost none of its knuckle since it first veered onto the screens nearly 75 years ago. It makes its point and pulls no punches doing so, illustrating the impersonal coldness of war and the desolation in rendering an 'enemy' of someone who you'd really have no issues with on an individual basis. This message is particularly well-captured in one especially harrowing scene - I won't divulge in the details, for the sake of those still yet to witness this masterpiece, but needless to say, it's a real tear-jerker. The war depicted here is not one of glory and heroism, but one of hardship, horror and desperation.<br/><br/>(Also, isn't it kinda eerie how those dramatic battle sequences, in which the opposing soldiers become little more than human targets, now, with retrospect, echo the vicious gameplay of a shoot-em-up video game?)<br/><br/>The only really noticeable problem with this film comes in the heavy use of US accents, which clash somewhat with the German setting and therefore sound just a little offbeat. Nonetheless, the well-assembled cast more than compensate with some truly impassioned performances, notably from Lew Ayres, who is simply brilliant as Paul, the young protagonist coming of age in this harsh environment. His friendship with long-time solider Katczinsky adds moments of warmth as well as sorrow, and the dialogue exchanged between the close-knit group of soldiers is both absorbing and believable, drawing you closer into their world and experiencing their own frustration and disillusionment along with them. Right from the start, we know what's inevitable for the optimistic young soldiers as they head out to the trenches, but at the same time we value their hope and innocence and yearn that they might be able to retain it all the same, making it all the more tragic as the events of the battlefield lay waste to their youthful spirits.<br/><br/>With its gripping direction and powerful imagery, it's a film that manages to leave a considerable imprint on the viewer, and I speak from experience on that one - upon reaching the end, both myself and the entire party I viewed it with were left speechless, and it took a good couple of minutes before any of us could pluck up the courage to break that uneasy silence. I don't know for sure when I'll be up for watching it a second time, but that final feeling certainly won't be going away from me any time soon, and I can almost guarantee this the kind of film you'll be glad for watching at least once. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' remains one of the must-see movies of its decade, and it's easy to see why, after all this time, it still has such a firm hold on that classic status - it may have arrived on the scene as far back as 1930, but its emotive edge is timeless.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","World War 1 and a young German, Paul Baumer, enthusiastically joins the Army. With romantic notions of war and idealistic dreams in his head he undergoes training and then is sent off to the Western Front. In due course the romantic notions are replaced by the harsh reality of war and he becomes disillusioned with it all.<br/><br/>Great World War 1 movie, made when the war was still fresh in everyone's minds. <br/><br/>Might well be the first anti-war war movie, as it depicts the grim realities of war, rather than the romantic, heroic non-existent version of it. <br/><br/>Harrowing, shocking, original, unpredictable, and just as relevant today as in 1930.<br/><br/>Surprisingly good production values for 1930. <br/><br/>Solid performances all round. <br/><br/>Far far better than the 1979 remake."
"The_Void","8","59","70","4 January 2005"," A detailed and thought-provoking account of war
","Before watching this epic masterpiece, I never quite understood what it is that makes people want to fight a war that was started by some politician, and after watching this film; I'm even more baffled. With it's ambiguous portrait of war, All Quiet on the Western Front never actually condemns (nor condones) the act of war, but through it's portrait; the anti-war message more than shine through. Multiple scenes show the hideousness of war, and through watching this film it becomes apparent that war is futile and a disgraceful waste of human life. We follow the (mis)fortune of a group of young adults who, due to the patriotic words of their teacher, decide to join the war effort. The rest of the film pans out as a sort of coming of age story in the middle of a great feud. We watch the protagonists as they stare death in the face and learn what is and isn't important when you risk your life at every passing moment.<br/><br/>This was one of the first films to announce America as a major film-making nation as with it's epic battle sequences and first class acting, All Quiet on the Western Front impresses on a technical level, as well as impressing with it's detailed and thought-provoking account of war. The film features numerous excellent scenarios, all of which are thought provoking in the context of the film, but also in life on the whole. Consider the part where one young man is told that maths problems are a waste of time as he could stop a bullet at any time, or the sequence that sees a soldier try to save the life of his fellow man that he has stabbed in the stomach (a French soldier, but still a fellow man). Not to mention the classy finish. Whichever way you look at it; this film is a masterpiece. It succeeds on a technical level and also does what films were created to do; entertain and inspire thought from their audiences. There are some films that every film buff must see regardless of their genre preferences. This is one of them."
"didi-5","10","50","59","2 March 2004"," pure excellence in the war movie genre
","From the fact it was made in 1930, you could class 'All Quiet on the Western Front' as a war movie museum piece, but Lewis Milestone's film is a seminal piece of anti-war propaganda, focusing on the Great War from the perspective of a group of German soldiers, in particular Paul Baumer (Lew Ayres).  Ayres gives a sensitive and powerful performance: by the 2nd World War the actor chose to serve as a medic, where he gained distinction.<br/><br/>Remembered for the sequence with the butterfly at the end in particular, this early talkie manages to set its scene and transmit a powerful message. An involving and clever film which on its recent restoration and cinema re-release has taken on new significance in the 21st century."

","In 1981, we had a screening at the L.A. County Museum of Art of the newly discovered restored version.  I took my girlfriend, who was not as savvy on film history as I was, and warned her not to expect much: that the movie was dated, the acting often awkward and broad, and some of the sound effects just plain weird, and so on.  When the screening finished, she leaned over to me and said, ""This movie hasn't dated at all.""  I could only agree, because the effect on both of us--and everyone in that theatre--was overpowering.  <br/><br/>It's curious to compare it with the very fine tv version with Richard Thomas.  The latter version has more scenes from the book and better acting, yet it's still inferior.  It suffers from the lack of detail that so many tv productions had then along with comparatively flat lighting.  The first version, on the other hand, has a look that resembles a documentary on World War I. They filmed it only eleven years after the war ended, and it contains a power only possible by those who've lived through an era being dramatized. Also, like CITIZEN KANE and DODSWORTH, it baffles one as to how Hollywood of this time produced such a non-escapist piece of entertainment."
"Snow Leopard","Null","61","74","16 May 2002"," Still One of the Best Movies of Its Kind
","Still one of the most worthwhile films about the hard realities of war, ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" has numerous memorable images and thoughtful moments.  Too many war dramas, regardless of their perspective, resort to distortions of history and overblown characters that make them convincing only to those who watch uncritically.  This one works nicely by keeping the characters low-key and by, for the most part, allowing the events and situations to speak for themselves.  It's not perfect in this respect, and it is perhaps a movie more to be respected than enjoyed, but it has many notable strengths.<br/><br/>The characters, most of them young soldiers, are played very simply, even plainly, but this is by no means a weakness - rather, it allows the movie to show what war is like for real soldiers rather than for idealized or stereotyped characters.  The two most important characters are developed more fully, and are played well.  Louis Wolheim's resourceful 'Kat' is the liveliest of the soldiers, and as Paul, Lew Ayres is quite understated but very believable.  His character is well-chosen as the focal point of most of the movie.  <br/><br/>The close-fighting nature of World War I particularly lends itself to this kind of movie, and the atmosphere is convincing and detailed.  The contrast with the civilian scenes is also set up well, although the civilian scenes sometimes seem slightly less convincing.  The overall effect is a movie that, while you probably wouldn't call it exciting or fun, is one you won't forget."

","A film about the horrors and suffering in the First World War. Through the story takes us to a group of young German soldiers. There is an interesting story from the perspective of German soldiers told in English.<br/><br/>The motive, which draws young people on the battlefield is not strong, but it is not questionable. At the beginning of the film can be noticed that the young Germans highly motivated. Youthful enthusiasm and patriotism are not desirable traits.<br/><br/>Horror followed by constant suffering on the Western Front is enough at the moment of breaking down every war motive. The boys continue to struggle even though their confidence shaken well. In the end they became soldiers and nothing more than that.<br/><br/>The film is extremely powerful, emotional and perhaps too realistic. As much as I am shocked scattered body parts during the fight, which is certainly controversial in that period, I was more shocked by the mental state of the characters. Director Milestone has certainly been affected by silent film. I think it's only because of that conveyed the horror of the battlefield on the face of the main character. It is realistic and damn convincing.<br/><br/>I am delighted by the fact that the director is not a single moment involved politics. The harsh reality of the Western Front is all what we need to see. The main message of the film is the absurdity of war. The message is hidden in the words of a young Paul and his comrades.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres as Paul Baumer is excellent. Not everything is about Paul, but through his character we can understand the essence.<br/><br/>Louis Wolheim as Stanislaus Katczinsky is mentor of young soldiers, and his performances are full of humanity and humor.<br/><br/>In the conditions of trench warfare, man is exposed to the horror that it destroys the mind and body. Milestone shows small moments of laughter and joy, without which life would not make sense. ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT brings an anti-war story that must not be forgotten."

","There are few moments in film history as moving as the last shot of this film, when a soldier fighting in the trenches of World War I is able to shut out the carnage around him to focus on the unlikely beauty of a butterfly that has landed only inches in front of him. The power of this image is an example of what set this film apart from all of the movies that had preceded it and ushered in a new era of sophistication in the art form.<br/><br/>""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is one of the first movies to feel like a movie. The camera takes part in the action: it moves in and out, frames people in close up. Some of the most memorable images come when the camera tracks along with the soldiers as they charge the enemy trenches. And though sound in cinema was in its infancy, this movie makes terrific use of it.<br/><br/>Compare this movie's version of combat to the films that would come out ten years later with the outbreak of WWII, and it almost takes your breath away with how ahead of its time it seems. Easily one of the best war movies ever made, and one of the best movies ever made, period.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"MartinHafer","10","33","39","7 February 2007"," Probably the greatest war film ever made
","The film begins in a classroom. Outside, martial music is blaring and the professor inside the room is lecturing the boys about their duty to the Fatherland and encouraging them all to as a group in the German army at the outbreak of WWI. The film is exceptional in how it captures the enthusiasm and naiveté of the boys--as they imagine glory awaiting them after they enlist! Even in boot camp, the mood is light and the new recruits are excited about seeing their first action. This perfectly sets the stage for the actual war--not the sanitized or ""fun"" war of many films but the hellish and pointless mess that was WWI. The rest of the film is brutally honest and harsh and shows how the students die off one-by-one and the remaining students become more and more jaded and emotionally dead due to the fighting.<br/><br/>I love this film and strongly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a film buff. Part of my love of the film is because it was made relatively shortly after the war and the uniforms, trucks, etc. all appear correct for the period. Many years later, a made for TV version of this film appeared with Ernest Borgnine and Richard Thomas. It, too, was excellent but also was perhaps a bit too polished and pretty--lacking some of the grit of the original. Great acting, direction and production all made this original THE best of the anti-war films of the 1920s and 30s.<br/><br/>Other similar great movies I strongly recommend are J'ACCUSE (French), WESTFRONT 1918 (German), THE BIG PARADE (USA--silent) and THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK (USA). All excel at portraying war in a truthful and non-glamorized manner--it's just a shame that their impact of the world as a whole was negligible--particularly in Germany--where Fascism would soon replace the anti-war sentiment of the book ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. In fact, his books and this film were banned once the Nazis came to power just a few years later."
"luis_neiva","10","14","15","8 May 2015"," ""For death is not an adventure...""
","All Quiet on the Western Front is the first great non-silent anti-war movie and arguably the most powerful one to date. Based on the critically acclaimed homonymous novel by Erich Maria Remarque, it portraits the transformations a young German soldier suffers during the World War I: the innocence before the war and the promise of everlasting glory, the shock with reality and the realization of his own mortality and of the hypocrisy of war and finally the return to the world away from the trenches, a world that didn't stop to wait for him.<br/><br/>Full of symbolisms, violence and impressive camera work, the whole film is a cinematographic masterpiece. The viewer is placed directly in the battlefield to the point he can almost grasp the blood-soaped earth of the trenches and smell the rotten corpses in no-man's land.<br/><br/>There's two layers I can find in this movie: the first one tells us about the physical destruction endured in a war – hunger, dirt, explosions, amputations, diseases, death The film does not try to hide the truth, war is ugly and dirty, it is constant suffering and painful. If the first layer is strong enough to create a strong impression on the viewer, the second one is even more powerful: the psychological breakdown the soldiers experience is masterfully portrayed. The excitement turns into doubt, the doubt into disgust, the disgust into anger and the anger into complete numbness. A young promising student is gradually transformed into a soulless killing machine.<br/><br/>Also the acting deserves to be mentioned. The entire cast delivers stand up performances, especially Louis Wolheim and Lew Ayres who depict masterfully two generations united by war.<br/><br/>The only flaw I could find on this is the strong American accent on the few German words spoken, fact that can distract a bit especially on the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an overwhelming experience and a mandatory watch to every war film lover!"

ALL QUIET remains right at the top of my list of outstanding war pictures. Here was a unique depiction of life in the trenches from an enemy point of view, a novel approach. <br/><br/>Lew Ayres gives a memorable performance as Paul Baumer, the sensitive German soldier, and has a fine supporting cast. The vivid battles in the trenches remain in my thought, and though they lack the technological know how of today, are indelible.<br/><br/>One of the most touching scenes is when Baumer kills the Frenchman in the shell hole and remorse overcomes him. Another tragic part is when his buddy is dying in the hospital and is visited by his comrades. A lighter scene is when the company has an over abundance of food due to its losses and the men become satiated. They are so comfortable that they are inclined to philosophize about the causes of war and its solution. <br/><br/>When Paul loses his friend, his depression grows and his death at the hands of a sniper is a fitting end to it all.

"ironhorse_iv","9","8","8","25 January 2015"," All Quiet in the Western Front is a haunting look into a life of a soldier in the trenches of World War 1.
","Unlike other war films at the time, that seem more romanticize. This film shows the tragedy of the 'Great War' in detail. This detailed thought-provoking war film is a great watch. It's a must watch to anybody over patriotic or looking for heroism, because in its depiction of the horror of war, All Quiet on the Western Front presents a scathing critique of the idea of nationalism, showing it to be a hollow, hypocritical ideology, a tool used by those in power to control a nation's people. Directed by Lewis Milestone, and based on the Erich Maria Remarque novel of the same name. The movie tells the story of six German soldiers who volunteered to fight in World War I, and it chronicles their demise intellectually, spiritually, and physically as the war drags on and on. All Quiet on the Western Front is considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare. Without spoiling too much of the film, it's seem so real. The movie is an intense watch, even with today's standards. The movie is pretty gory, and graphic for a film of the 1930s with scenes with machine guns and poison gas. Lots of unromantic visions of fear, meaninglessness, and butchery. It's a hard watch to certain people. Due to its anti-war message, a lot of countries banned it, like Australia, Italy and Austria. The worst had to be, Nazi Germany. Since the movie perceived anti-German messages, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party banned the film in their country in the 1930s and early 1940s. During its brief run in German cinemas in the early 1930s, the Nazis led by Joseph Goebbels disrupted the viewings by setting off stink bombs and releasing white mice in the theaters. It wasn't until 1952, when West Germany re-released the film in theaters without much protest. It's weird that Universal Studios would product the film like this, at the time because it's tell the war in German perspective, the enemy. This was indeed, rare to do in film, even in today's open world. Show the war in the eyes of the enemy. While, the movie is set in Germany, the movie is pretty English in speaking for the mostly English speaking audience. The movie is worth watching in German dubbing. It's a must-do. If you can't speak German, the film has a lot of visual symbolism to tell the story of the war. A good example of this is, Kemmerich's boots (Ben Alexander). You really see the emotional disconnection that war cause, because when Kemmerich is on his deathbed, the most pressing question among his friends is who will inherit his boots. It's disturbing. In Remarque's view, this pragmatism has a hugely destructive impact on a soldier's humanity; main character, Paul Bäumer (Lew Ayres), for instance, becomes unable to imagine a future without the war and unable to remember how he felt in the past. Another great scene with Paul is that with the dying French soldier. You really see, how Paul is trying to keep his humanity alive, while also keeping himself alive. Great acting from him and all the actors. Another symbol in the film is butterflies. You see it, throughout the film. It derives in part from Remarque's childhood hobby of collecting insects and mounting them in a case. In the film, it seems to represent the innocence and joy of nature. In the film final iconic scene, where a soldier is shot while trying to grab a butterfly. This scene is different from the book, and was inspired by an early scene showing a butterfly collection in Paul's home. The scene was shot during the editing phase, so the actors were no longer available and Milestone had to use his own hand, instead of the main actor. Some of the faults of the film could be the film's opening prologue. It felt a little detracting, as if they were trying to appeal to everybody, without trying so hard, not to offend people. Another is the mid-scene with the French women. Yes, I guess, it was there, so the movie wasn't too depressing, but it slow the movie, way down. For the most part, the movie is very accurate to the war. Overall: Does an all time, classic stand the test of time? Yes. I think it's better than the 1979 remake. The black and white film footage really makes the war very eerily to watch. In 1930, it really deserve to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing and others. In 1990, the film was selected and preserved by the United States Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" Since the movie is still own by Universal Studios, most copies of the film are well preserved. Watching in HD Blu-Ray DVD is in the way, to go, when watching this film. If you really like this movie, read its sequel, 'The Road Back', which shows members of the 2nd Company returning home after the war. It's a must read. Anyways, All Quiet in the Western Front is one of, if not the, most effective war films ever made and it works."
"phubbs","10","7","7","22 February 2015"," All Quiet on the Western Front
","Based on a novel and probably one of the most realistic war films I have ever see. WW1 is the setting for this unusual look at life for German troops on the front line. Its unusual because its a 30's American film focusing on German soldiers and not the more obvious Allies of Britain, France and Russia.<br/><br/>Starting off much like 'Full Metal Jacket' the film covers a group (a class fresh out of school) of young German lads ready to join the ranks and fight for their country. From here on we follow them through harsh training and into battle where they very quickly realise the horrors of war. One by one they are killed off as the film becomes more and more tragic, and all this in a 1930's film!<br/><br/>The first thing that hits you are the amazing visuals and hard work clearly put into the film, its incredible! The realism of the trenches, war torn no man's land, the uniforms for both sides and the brilliant special effects, mainly revolving around some pretty big explosions near actors, are all superbly created. By today's standards everything still looks good whilst the old black and white imagery only helps the film appear more realistic and authentic. The film could easily be the 'Saving Private Ryan' of its day, its almost as good as real footage.<br/><br/>Of course the actors are of a different era so one can expect performances without the type of grit that we are used to today. Some scenes are almost slightly pantomime-esque with some slightly funny moments of comedy and slapstick which do lighten the mood (mainly at the start before the characters enter the war). I think we all know sequences of corny acting and dialog tend to add to the charm of old movies like this, they are easily forgiven.<br/><br/>Make no mistake though this film is a history lesson and seeing as it was made about 12 years after WW1 actually ended its amazing people watched! especially as it followed the Central Powers (the enemy). Being so close to the war is obviously why its so accurate. The harrowing sequences of men being mown down by machine gun fire, one after another without a chance, the screams of the young troops as they go crazy from the constant shelling, the mud, barren landscapes, bodies, barbwire and of course the famous bleak depressing ending for the main lead nailing home how cheap life was.<br/><br/>I think the main point in the film is how the lead protagonist Paul Baumer (like his friends) starts out as a patriotic young German wanting to go off and fight for his country. Encouraged, motivated and inspired by his surroundings whilst being practically lied to by his school teacher Professor Kantorek into doing what is thought to be right, to save the Fatherland. Baumer then returns to his home town towards the end of the film only to find his school teacher spouting the same nonsense to more young boys, trying to get them to join up and fight. <br/><br/>He is invited in to speak of the glory of war but instead rages how its all lies and there is nothing but misery and death for all who join up. He is shunned by his old teacher and branded a coward by the young boys, so he returns to the front line. Not long after this the film ends with his pointless needless death. A strong message which we all know of now, yet at the time people just didn't understand or realise, war was glorious and made men of the young.<br/><br/>10/10"

","""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is important filmmaking that still rings true today.  The film deals with World War I combat through the eyes of the enemy (the Germans).

The film was scorned by many in the U.S. as some thought that showing the Germans as sympathetic characters was in poor taste.  Germans hated the film because of its anti-war message.  Hitler was about to become a world power and he wanted all Germans to be excited and enthusiastic about combat.  This film goes against those ideals.  The Academy was brave enough and smart enough to award the film with the Best Picture Oscar in 1930 and Lewis Milestone became the first multiple Oscar winner in the directing category.  ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" has the storyline of Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" and the action and drama of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"".

","ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1930) **** The first - and some say best - war film (and film about war - there is a difference) is still the gold standard for showing the perilous hell men face in war with this character-heavy look at the after-effects of a group of gung-ho students who are goaded into enlisting to fight for the fatherland - Germany - without question and tragically paying for it with literally their lives. Based on German writer Erich Maria Ramarque's novel - with six credited screenwriters including future filmmaker George Abbott - and an uncredited Lewis Milestone - the film's director - and winner of Best Director and Best Picture among its four including the aforementioned screenplay adaptation and the beautifully shot cinematography by Arthur Edeson. With a star-making performance of freshly scrubbed, boy- next-door charm and idealism-dashed chutzpah by Lew Ayres as the green recruit whose loss of innocence still stings while his mentor and world-weary mentor Louis Wolheim - terrific - in fact both should've been nominated for their acting - acts as the voice of reason (and doom). For the film vaults: the chilling battle amongst a decrepit graveyard and the penultimate image of beauty being literally destroyed as a shocking symbol of innocence truly crushed. One of the most important anti-war films ever; a must see for every serious film-goer."
"ElMaruecan82","10","6","6","3 April 2012"," Youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth ...
","""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is Lewis Milestone's epic adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's best-selling novel, the name of the author might sound unfamiliar so let's only say that he was a German World War I veteran.<br/><br/>The film was made 12 years after the end of the most barbaric and devastating massacres that prefaced Contemporary History with bloody letters and won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Directing. I could use so many superlatives to describe it but watching Milestone's war/epic left me cold with all the self- glorification and enthusiasm that only serves as a desire to hide the awareness of our own mediocrity. I will only say that ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a masterpiece because it's the first movie to make a political statement, and a courageous one, not pacifist but humanistic. If only for that, Milestone's film is a milestone on the field of cinematic intelligence.<br/><br/>""This story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.""<br/><br/>If not an accusation, it does admit that a generation was destroyed. If not a confession, the film demonstrates that it takes war to realize life's value just as it takes jail to value freedom. And if not an adventure, it still conveys the strange exhilarating feeling of an escape from the world's lies and politicians' vanity, to reach a point where people can become fully themselves, as said Louis-Ferdinand Celine, a French WWI veteran and author: ""Our youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth"" in 'Journey to the End of the Night'.<br/><br/>More than an accusation, confession or adventure, the story is a tribute to a lost generation, the year of the release is even more significant because those who survived the War were not only alive, but young enough to have kept intact memories. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a tribute to a youth sacrificed by greed, profit and patriotic glory in the altar of trenches, where every mile cost thousands of bodies. The film starts with boys whose eyes harangued by the patriotic speech of their school professor, burn with the intensely proud flame to fight in the name of Germany and desire of victory... and eventually to leave school. The first bombing will shatter all these beliefs, as they'll understand that whether you fight for French Motherland of German Fatherland, Mother Earth is the ultimate destination.<br/><br/>Most of the actors were not professional except for the extraordinary performance of Louis Wolheim as Kat, a mentor for the boys and for us. The actors were as inexperienced and youthful, as the boys who were listed and criticizing the acting on that level is like stamping on an ant when you can admire its strength: the cast embodies the tragedy of a War that dug a big hole in a whole generation. The last shot of the boys walking and turning their faces at us, juxtaposed with the sight of a mortuary, is like a warning for the years to come. But history taught us war is indeed a fever that just strikes everybody, nobody wants it until it happens and everybody wants it until they make it.<br/><br/>It's only at war that the soldiers can question its meaning, its origin, and only at war that the ranks, medals and protocols make no difference whatsoever. The most zealous drill sergeant starts sobbing at the first shell wheezing, highlighting one of war's few consolations: to reveal the true value of people in life and make everyone equal in death. In a powerful scene, Paul, the central character stabs for the first time a French soldier, and as he spends some time hidden with the body, he talks to him and realizes that they're both comrades, brothers, victims of the same political vanity and full of the same desire to live. All that separates them is a uniform, and to Death, even uniforms don't make a damn difference. The merit of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is to be told from German perspective, from the enemy, the other, and what better lesson for empathy than inviting an audience to comprehend that the other side, like in ""Das Boot"" for WWII, shared the same trauma? <br/><br/>And Milestone's film renders the most horrific aspects of war without any other special effects than an extraordinary editing and directing. 68 years before ""Saving Private Ryan""'s iconic opening, Milestone showed soldiers hit by a volley of machine-gun fire, falling but with such a fast-paced directing that we never see them hitting the ground. Some shot show shadowy soldiers jumping from below as to suggest a human submersion, the atrocities and pointlessness of War never seemed so raw and real as in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", because it showed what a slaughter World War I was, whether Spielberg's point was only to show that the second one was a good war.<br/><br/>When the few survivors came back to their hometown, they realize that the attitude and the enthusiasm toward the war were unchanged. Civilians and military, Family, the teacher, the boys in the classroom didn't learn anything. ""And our bodies are earth, and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death!"" says Paul but he only receives insults and incomprehension. But he knows, and we know from his experience that he's the one who owns the truth, because in his mind are all his friends dead in the trenches, in the battlefield, in a lousy hospital. <br/><br/>But the tragedy of life is that as usual, it's not the dead but the living that need to be awakened."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","9","10","14 December 2007"," Among the greatest of all time.
","There were some anti-war movies before this one but none of them hit the mark- and made its point so well such as this one. It's still one of most powerful movies ever made, out of any genre or time period. And not just that, the movie is also really among the best ever made.<br/><br/>The movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers during WW I, of which most of them are still just only school kids in the beginning. First we see how the very young boys are being reprogrammed as soldiers. Then we see how they all are slowly going crazy, due to the madness of war. After that the movie shows the aftereffects of war, on those who fought in it. From the hospital till their leave back home, this movie shows and tells it all. We further more see them dealing with all kinds of problems; the lack of food, rats, the death and see them discuss the point of war. Or like Paul Bäumer sums up in the movie; ""We live in the trenches out there. We fight. We try not to be killed, but sometimes we are. That's all.""<br/><br/>It's not hard to see that this movie influenced many other later war/anti-war movies, even till this present day, with ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Starship Troopers"" as the most obvious and best known examples.<br/><br/>For its time period this was also a very graphic movie, although no way people will now be shocked by any of the 'gore' within this movie. Nevertheless the movie its violence and disturbing moments still haven't lost any of its power. This is also thanks to the great build-up directing by Lewis Milestone. He knows how to create the right certain tension and the atmosphere that goes with it. He also had a real eye for detail, especially of course during the battle sequences. Because of its many little details the movie also becomes a very realistic one.<br/><br/>The movie features some great looking and also at times innovating The camera positions and angles, as well as the good fast editing. It makes this a technical fantastic movie to watch.<br/><br/>Obviously none of the actors are among the greatest of their time but the characters are all nevertheless great, since they are very humane and realistic and each has their own strong identity.<br/><br/>A movie that you HAVE to see at least once in your lifetime.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Tweetienator","9","5","5","23 March 2018"," Where Only the Shells Sing
","Besides Kubrick's Path to Glory imo the best movie on WWI and one of the best (anti-)war movies of all time.<br/><br/>The true excellence of this movie is not only in the war scenes and the acting but in the characterization of the soldier's nature and the nature of war. On top, you get a feel for the war of the trenches - without bombastic and shallow theatrical music like recently in Nolan's (imo far overrated) ""drama"" Dunkirk who tries to make drama with dramatic music where enough drama already should be. The only ""sound-effects"" in All Quiet on the Western Front are those of war - the screams of the soldiers, the ""singing"" of flying shells and the many explosions and the sounds of guns. <br/><br/>Whereas the remake with ""Sonnyboy"" Richard Thomas (playing Paul Baumer) from 1979 is also a good one, the adaption from 1930 of Erich Maria Remarque's epic is imo the more intense and superior one. <br/><br/>Fantastic movie, especially for all young who never watched this piece, watch."
"greenmesamountaina","10","5","5","5 September 2017"," One of those works of art that come only once every few years
","In the early 20th century, war changed from a game of professionals to an all-out contest of whole nations. Generations of young men were fed into the meatgrinder that was WWI; the first really technological war on a mass scale. No general staff understood what modern weapons would mean. These weapons created a war of stalemate and trench warfare, both sides evenly matched, and no breakthrough possible, with the ordinary soldier suffering the most. That is the story that 'All Quiet on the Western' Front tells.<br/><br/>It tells it from a German perspective because it was adapted from Eric Maria Remarque's novel based on his experiences as a combat soldier in the German Army. The book is itself a testament to the grueling fate of soldiers of both sides. Interestingly, another book came out of Germany about the war, Enst Junger's ""Storm of Steel"" which paints the same bleak picture of the war, but concludes with patriotic pride that the millions of dead were worth it as a test of strength.<br/><br/>The film 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is one of those works of art that come only once every few years. The reasons are several. 1. It follows the book fairly closely, and the book was good. 2. The realism was first rate for a film of that or any other period. 3. The acting, while not always modern, is well done in the major parts. The actor who plays 'Kat' dominates the film and the film's hero, 'Paul', played by Lew Ayres, although his performance is also good. 4. The direction was superb, and the movement of the camera during the battle sequences is amazingly good for that era. 5. The sound effects of the warfare scenes are quite good, as good as I've ever heard in that kind of film.<br/><br/>It's also interesting that America was able to produce a film from the standpoint of what was an enemy nation only 12 years before. But is seems less an accomplishment when you consider that the soldiers in the film question the war and all wars. If they'd been in the American Army, there would have been censorship problems about those sentiments coming from American soldiers. Nevertheless, the film is an admiral anti-war statement-- the futility of war at all times and for all nations. Hitler and Goebbels certainly knew the film's power-- it was banned from showing in Germany after the Nazis took power there in 1933.<br/><br/>It's not banned anymore. If you feel a film that old will be too dated, you will come to understand that really good filmmaking happens in all eras. If you haven't seen this film yet, you have a remarkable experience ahead of you.<br/><br/>Have people learned the lessons of this film? I hope so, for the weapons of war are much more terrible than before. That fact is what has stopped war. But this film, and the knowledge it imparts played a small part too."

","I kicked off my February, which is always Oscar's month, with All Quiet on the Western Front. Director Lewis Milestone's wartime drama took home the Academy's top prize for 1930. Capturing the essence of the individuals directly involved in the conflict, All Quiet on the Western Front, is a magnificent look at the effects of war both on soldiers physicality and mentality. A poignant look at a time when many fighting were just young boys trying to be heroes, All Quiet on the Western Front seems worthy of the gold statuette.<br/><br/>Opening inside a classroom, a professor is convincing a classroom of impressionable teenagers to enlist, revealing the first unfortunate aspect of WWI. In the cloak of patriotism, a group of young men vow to support their country in war. Many of them end up permanently injured, some losing limbs, all of them end up emotionally scarred. The incredible part of this is that it was 1930. Seeing such a raw portrayal was incredible. The shots of each young man's face were well-done and beautifully executed each time.

","Can't believe it took till now for me to see this wonderful film. Although made in 1930, it has a currency which did not go unnoticed. Other films, with similar themes, have not equalled or captured so tenderly the complete waste of young minds, bodies and lives that war demands. The film stresses the falsehoods which continue to be told to trick young ""adventures"" into sacrificing all to the theatre of war and the pressure that is put on them if they dare resist. The film emphasises the impact on the stoic but tortured families who are waiting back home, waiting for bad news which can come at any hour or if their loved ones do come home, the families are ""gifted"", often, the role of lifetime carers of their damaged husbands, fathers, brothers, sons and friends and now we can add returning women to the list.

"Dr_Kruger","10","7","9","6 February 2009"," an indictment of the inhumanity of war
","I've just watched All Quiet on the Western Front for the second time. The first time was a long time ago. Perhaps too long. It's quite simply a wonderful film on the morality (or lack of) of war, and perhaps the most convincing anti-war film I've seen, focusing purely on the feelings our lead character Paul Baumer.<br/><br/>It starts off with blind optimism during the recruitment process and after a harsh induction programme in a segment that Kubrick gleans so much from in his 'Full Metal Jacket' film. The dormitories are almost an exact copy and the Drill Seargent is a mean guy just like R.Lee Ermey's was.<br/><br/>During the first night on the field and their introduction to Katczinski, who seems like a man to fear, new recruit Behn, a man who didn't want to enlist is killed in horrific fashion and the new recruits are given a glimpse of what is to come. ""He's a corpse, no matter who he was"" is Katczinski's reply to one of the new recruits who wails ""he was my friend"". Truly awful stuff. We're quickly whisked to the first daylight trench battle which has some incredibly dynamic camera-work and the B&W and speeded up film almost makes it feel real. Here is a film that can use little in the way of gore, but create a far more terrifying atmosphere than even the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>""War is like a fever. No one wants it but it is there all at once"" As the war progresses, the boys receive letters from home. This should be a joyous occasion, and is for some, but Baumer is not so convinced. We start to get the feeling that this place isn't the place for letters. It isn't the place for hope.<br/><br/>One of the key scenes follows where Baumer single handedly kills a man with a knife and is forced to spend the night with him in a hole as he dies. Begging the man for forgiveness highlights his inner fight. Everything is telling him war is wrong, but we know he is being dragged into it and irreversibly changed.<br/><br/>It's not completely devoid of humour though. Part way into the second act and after Katczinski and the other old hand's have softened (or is it that the new recruits have simply hardened giving us an illusion) we are treated to a scene with some lovely French peasant girls, and the betrayal of Himmelstoss, getting him blind drunk so the three young boys can have a girl each is particularly funny.<br/><br/>Possibly the saddest part of the film is towards the end where Baumer is injured and able to spend some time on leave at home. He soon realises after visiting his family and the professor who enlisted him that he doesn't belong there. He'd rather be on the front line with Katczinski and pals where he knows where he stands.<br/><br/>And with that, I'll leave it there. The final 10 minutes is heartbreaking and it is no wonder that the armed forces at the time prevented recruits from seeing this film. It's an indictment of the true inhumanity of war, and a film that is so important in our history as human beings."

","All Quiet on the Western Front is a World War I movie released in 1930. Following the main character, Paul, a young German student that gets swept up by nationalist fever, the story shows the misery of war. As soldiers starve, fight for their lives, and struggle to maintain their sanity, none of them can quite explain what they're fighting for. Paul's notions of life and war are immediately shattered and the film follows his progression as he questions the meaning of his life and the purpose of the war.<br/><br/>An example: ""How does a war even start?"" ""It's when one country offends another."" ""Well, I guess I can go home because I'm not offended.""<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of the mindset and attitudes displayed by the characters who are simply trying to survive and find enough food for another day.<br/><br/>Dramatic and heart-wrenching, All Quiet on the Western Front is one of the best WWI films. As you watch the film, you quickly forget that all of the main characters are fighting for Germany, who are usually displayed in more villainous roles. In fact, you can switch the uniforms and it would have no impact on the story and I think that is the point. Paul quickly realizes that war is not glorious and he certainly does not feel like a hero. This realization directly conflicts with his initial feelings when enlisting for the war in the first place. The main conflict of the story is Paul reconciling the myths and naivety of his youth with a horrific, almost purposeless, reality. Treated as a hero at home and given constant advice about the war from elderly men who are far from the front lines, Paul loses his sense of home and purpose and is left lost in the new world he discovers.<br/><br/>Despite some poor acting at times and humor that has not aged well, All Quiet on the Western Front is a good film. If you're interested in an early film about soldiers in the Great War, it's definitely worth a watch."

","---spoiler---<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is about that and that only. There is not another message for us. Maybe it is the only disadvantage of the film, that sending its message plainly, other than telling it secretly. In the beginning of the film, the characters were having a lively high school time, seeing everything as naive-youngsters, but then with the flame of the youth they decided to join the army with having only heroic dreams. They were shocked in the battlefield. Because there were only torturing by elders, hunger, fatigue, blood, death and horror. The scene of being in a hole with the enemy is a wonderful way to point out the incoherence of war. It was depicted so well that thinking about that enemy had dreams, a family, people who'd wait for him just like everybody else, in other conditions he would not even had an argument with him, and because of the governments would not agree on something, he must kill the enemy. Themetaphor of shoe is perfect. The young man with the most beautiful shoes had lost his legs. The high school friends of him who normalized the situation, asked to him forgive away the shoes to them. A lot of people have these shoes, some of them dies, some of them lose legs. We do not blame the shoes, they are not unlucky, the wearers are not unlucky, all the blame is on the war. The character who turned home for a while told everyone that they were losing the war had different reactions from the society. The elderboldy said that they should going to the Paris, the children who were at his age before the war, told him that he was a coward and traitor. The tried to tell that war brings only death but nobody listened to him and he realized the only ones who understand him were his mates from front line. Front line was his home. Despite the fact that movie was filmed 86 years ago, bombing and war scenes are wonderful.

If any movie demonstrated the absurdity of war, this movie does with images and scenes that are unforgettable.

Initially, an elderly, spectacled, school teacher raves about how they must defend the pride of the fatherland as soldiers can be seen marching outside past the school. ""Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do. Strike with all our power. Give every ounce of strength to win victory before the end of the year.

Later, we watch as our protagonists struggle to make sense out of war and how it started. The most captivating character of the film is Kat (Louis Wolheim) who steals the film. Compared with contemporary films, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" lacks the brutality of war, aside from one shot of two severed hands clinging to a barbed wire fence. Like most memorable war pictures, the action is confined to the trenches with no scenes played out in map rooms as general pontificate about strategy. Milestone would later helm more war movies, including ""The Purple Heart"" (1944), ""A Walk in the Sun"" (1945), ""Halls of Montezuma"" (1950) and ""Pork Chop Hill"" (1959)."
"Red-Barracuda","8","3","3","11 October 2013"," The first classic film of the sound era, still resonates today
","All Quiet on the Western Front is now generally regarded as the first classic movie of the talkie era. Seeing it today, this seems like a pretty fair claim seeing as it's a film that still resonates all these years later. It's pretty uncompromising and hard hitting for its time but this must also surely be a result of it having been made before the seriously restrictive Hays Code was implemented later in the 30's, limiting films for years in what they could show on screen. As it is, this movie was made in the very small window in the early 30's when talkies were not straight-jacketed by this regressive code. It was, nevertheless, a controversial film in other ways. Its strong anti-war message was not one that went down well in many quarters and was considered unpatriotic; while it was also criticised for depicting the Germans in a sympathetic light. It was released only a dozen years after the end of World War 1 and the Germans had been painted as barbarians by much of the then media. But in some ways by centring the story on young German soldiers it was able to distance itself from accusations of an unpatriotic message, seeing as we were not seeing Americans criticising their war effort. But mainly, and more importantly, by focusing on Germans the wider anti-war message is made far clearer, as it's made abundantly obvious that both sides were populated by terrified young men who were fighting a horrific war against each other; a war they had no say in. It was, therefore, a brave and intelligent decision to base the story around young German soldiers. Interestingly, the American Academy clearly agreed and awarded the film best film and director Oscars.<br/><br/>World War 1 was a horrific stalemate war that was fought in trenches stretching from the English Channel to the Swiss border. It was arguably the worst war ever in terms of the conditions that soldiers actually fought in. Trench warfare was brutal with tactics that often had men marching against machine guns. Millions of soldiers died in this ludicrous Catch-22 war. And while All Quiet on the Western Front is about this war, it's really more specifically about the lives of the soldiers. There isn't much focus at the history of the conflict itself, the approach is far more personal. We follow a group of young idealistic Germans from the moment they are convinced by highly charged oratory that to die for their country is a great thing, to the grim and horrific reality of what those words actually mean. The film is a thorough condemnation of war. Its characters are very far from gung-ho heroes that we know from many other war films, they are terrified boys. And in choosing this route, the film is far more realistic. The boys realise that the great adventure they believed in, is in fact their worst nightmare. Their experiences are contrasted jarringly with scenes back in the Fatherland where those not involved in the fighting still spout idealistic nonsense about how noble it all is; it's easy being philosophical when your neck is not on the line.<br/><br/>Aside from its bold message, it's a technical triumph. Because of its age much of what we see and hear is pretty primitive cinematically. The sound is rough and probably needs subtitles for most people, while the battle scenes can't rely on special effect like we see now. The explosions are real and you really feel a danger in the actual film-making process as a result. The rawness of the production works in its favour. There is no background music either which adds to the sombre realistic tone but may very well have been due to sound recording difficulties - in those days the orchestra had to be playing live just off screen in order to get the synched sound and this would have added huge challenges. It's easy to not realise the technical difficulties that the early sound films had to surmount. But overcome them, this film did and especially so in a brilliant battle scene where the French attack the Germans. This extraordinarily well orchestrated sequence encompasses a huge battlefield with hordes of men advancing over it with explosions going off left, right and centre. The fluid camera work moves across the trenches dramatically capturing the mass attack. The violence is strong for the time, with bloody hand-to-hand fights, dead bodies and even severed limbs. It's worth seeing the film just for this tour de force section alone. But this is a film that counters such striking material with smaller, equally disturbing moments, such as the haunting scene in a bomb crater where one of the protagonists is stranded and forced to spend the night with a French soldier who is slowly dying from a wound he has inflicted on him. It's touching and depressing. There are many such moments in All Quiet on the Western Front. A film that is still extremely relevant today, over 80 years later."

","The story follows Paul Baumer (Lew Ayres) and his classmates, heading off to war having been convinced to enlist after hearing Professor Kantorek wax lyrical about the honour of fighting for the Fatherland. The film looks at the impact of war on the soldiers themselves versus the opinions of those back home following the war via media. <br/><br/>It is an excellent portrayal of the effects of war on the soldiers themselves. Aside from the French being referred to as the enemy, the film seems to steer clear of taking a particular opinion on the war, focusing instead on the young soldiers and their experiences. It's interesting to note that some scenes were deemed so realistic they were used in genuine WW1 documentaries many years later, so if you were wondering which gutsy cameramen were wading through the mud filming the action...now you know! <br/><br/>What I liked most of all about this film is that it left more questions than answers, it did not force any particular opinion on World War 1 or war in general. It seemed to show a realistic portrayal of life in the trenches, fighting a war the soldiers themselves didn't really seem to understand. <br/><br/>Expert food-forager Katczinsky (Louis Wolheim) does come up with a novel approach to how a war could be fought: ""Whenever there's a war coming on, you should rope off a big field...and on the big day you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put 'em in the centre dressed in their underpants and let 'em fight it out with clubs. The best country wins."" I like that idea immensely."

","""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was perhaps the first great war epic of the cinema- certainly the first great war epic of the ""talkie"" era. It was based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, published only the year before. (The phenomenon of film-makers raiding the best-seller lists for inspiration is nothing new). The familiar English title of both book and film is the one assigned to it by Remarque's translator Arthur Wheen, and is something of a mistranslation. Remarque's original title was ""Im Westen Nichts Neues"", or ""Nothing New in the West"", meaning ""no change in the military situation"". <br/><br/>The film opens in a boys' high school in a small German town in 1914. We see a schoolmaster named Kantorek giving his pupils an impassioned speech, urging them to join the Army and fight for their country. Kantorek ends his peroration with Horace's line ""Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori"" (""It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country""), a line which to English-speaking audiences in 1930 would have recalled Wilfred Owen's poem in which he describes this sentiment as ""the old lie"". <br/><br/>Almost to a man, the boys are persuaded to join up, and we follow their progress through the war, especially that of the main character, Paul Baumer. (In the novel his surname was Bäumer; perhaps the American actors failed to realise that the umlaut above the ""a"" makes a difference to the German pronunciation. Several names, in fact, are mispronounced; ""Mueller"", for example, is pronounced to rhyme with ""colour""). We see how early enthusiasm for the war was replaced by disillusionment, at least among those who actually had to do the fighting. One by one Paul's companions are killed or severely wounded, and the mood of the survivors becomes embittered. Their preoccupations are not honour and glory but firstly survival and secondly getting enough food. Only on the home front does enthusiasm for the war persist; visiting his home town on leave Paul is disgusted to see Kantorek giving the same speech to another class of students, who react with the same patriotic zeal as he and his classmates. <br/><br/>In a film from this period one would not expect the same degree of realism in battle scenes as in a modern film such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", although Steven Spielberg has stated that Lewis Milestone's film was an inspiration for his own. There is, however, one surprisingly good action sequence featuring a French attack on the German trenches, although the most effective scenes are often those, like the one in the hospital and the one where Paul addresses the dead French soldier he has killed, which do not involve any actual fighting. <br/><br/>Although there are many grim moments, the film's tone is not unremittingly grim. Scenes of bloodshed and pathos are interspersed with those containing a certain, often satirical, humour, such discussion between the soldiers as to the causes of the war. (They conclude that the best way of solving international disputes would be for the kings and politicians to fight among themselves after stripping down to their underwear). Perhaps the best acting performance comes from Louis Wolheim as Stanislaus Katczinsky, a gruff, cynical older soldier who becomes Paul's closest friend and who, even in the early days of the war, embodies a spirit of sardonic disillusionment. (His surname suggests that he is an ethnic Pole who, while nominally a German citizen, has little loyalty to the German cause). <br/><br/>To make a war film from a German viewpoint and which treats its German protagonists with humanity and understanding was, in some ways, a brave move in 1930, only a dozen years after the press in America and other Allied nations had been abusing the Germans as ""beastly Huns"". Yet to tell an anti-war story from the German side was, in other ways, politically expedient. Such a story told from an American viewpoint might have been attacked as unpatriotic, as implying that the Allied cause had not been a just one and that the American soldiers who had laid down their lives in 1917-18 had done so to no good end. America, Britain and France had their own Kantoreks- Owen's poem was aimed at one of them, the jingoistic poetaster Jessie Pope- but such people are never mentioned in the film. Audiences might have inferred that ""God, king and country"", or ""the war to end all wars"" were slogans as empty as ""Gott mit uns"" or ""Deutschland über Alles"", but Milestone never spells this out directly. <br/><br/>Following the bloodshed of World War I, pacifist sentiment was widespread in the twenties and early thirties, and the film takes the same strongly anti-war stance as Remarque's novel. This message was highly popular in 1930; the critic of Variety wrote that ""The League of Nations could make no better investment than to buy up the master-print, reproduce it in every language, to be shown in all the nations until the word ""war"" is taken out of the dictionaries"". <br/><br/>Yet we now know this was not to be. To quote another Latin tag, ""tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis"". (Times change, and we change with them). Less than a decade after the film was made, the world was to be plunged into a second war, even bloodier than the first. Lewis Milestone's contribution to that war would be to make patriotic pro-Allied propaganda films such as ""North Star"" and ""The Purple Heart"", demonising the Germans and Japanese as monsters in human form. It might be unfair to accuse Milestone of deliberate hypocrisy- he was far from being the only ex-pacifist to have his pacifism tested to destruction by the savage inhumanity of Nazism- but there is a certain irony in the fact that the cinema's great chronicler of the First World War should have become one of America's Kantoreks of the Second. 8/10"

","Few movies have used mud so tellingly. The schoolboys dream of joining the noisy glory that marches by their classroom window. So, egged on by their teacher and a wave of patriotic enthusiasm, the German boys sign up. But what do they get instead of military glory--- miles and miles of foot slogging mud as the company marches to the WWI battlefront. And that's after they've crawled face down through training fields of the slimy stuff, looking more like human worms than soldiers. <br/><br/>Worse, when they get to the war front, what do they get but more slimy dirt in the trenches that make up their new home. It's all living, eating, and dying in the same wet ground. And when they get killed, as they almost surely will, what will their flesh and bones do but make more mud for new waves of mud-makers to slog through. No wonder the movie is considered an anti-war masterpiece-- military glory itself is reduced to the earth's most elemental stuff.<br/><br/>I've often wondered how American audiences would respond if the boys were American instead of German, given the movie's militantly anti-war message. But however that may be, the 2-hours-plus never drags as we watch the boys encounter the various horrors—and the mischief, too—of life at the front.<br/><br/>No wonder one kid freaks out when the coffin-like closeness and constant shelling of the trenches finally gets to him. My understanding is that once the battle lines of WWI settled in, the front never moved more than 75-miles in four-years. No wonder the fabled poppy fields of Flanders grew so abundantly afterwards. <br/><br/>And if the horrors of the trenches aren't bad enough, there's the ""dying room"" in the hospital where the hopeless cases are taken. There they can expire alone and out of sight. I can imagine how other wounded boys dangled on the precipice of being moved there or anywhere. It's that constant dread amidst the tidy surroundings and caring hands, and far from the battlefield, that's stayed with me over the years.<br/><br/>Lewis Milestone's staging of scenes along the front remains a technical marvel. What a triumph of fluid camera work is that panorama of troops attacking across the no-man's-land, only to be mowed down by defenders and their hell-fire machine guns. I gather throwing men at waves of bullets was the basic brutal strategy of both sides. Small wonder then, that the war was also called the great European slaughter bench, and small wonder that a lot of generals on both sides should have been court- martialed, as a result. Fortunately, Milestone's inspired staging makes these larger dimensions understandable.<br/><br/>At the same time, it's an inspiration to personalize the impersonal dimension of battle. In a shell hole in the middle of no-man's- land, Paul (Ayers) encounters the face of a dying Frenchman, only to realize that the enemy is a man pretty much the same as Paul. That central scene puts a critical human face on the act of killing, transforming combat for Paul and us into an excruciating personal close-up. For without that intimate encounter, the battle scenes would be reduced to an abstraction of colliding gray figures.<br/><br/>The narrative does have its lighter moments as when three of the boys encounter three French girls, and nature takes its course, helped along, of course, by treasured loaves of bread. In the process, we realize that hunger and lust have a way of cutting through minor matters like who's French or German or anything else. Note too how fairly explicit the innuendo is during this early pre-Code period. There's also that black humor scene of the shells blowing up the graveyard as though dying once just isn't enough in wartime.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there's Louis Wolheim as Kat who steals the film with his gruff humor and unforgettable mug. The final scenes between Paul and him manage a poignancy rare in any film. In fact, as Paul says, Kat has become his ""family"" now that soldiering has consumed them both. Too bad that the boy's horrific experiences have likely separated him forever from mother, sister, and hometown. To me, this is one of the more subtly unsettling aspects of the movie's anti-war message.<br/><br/>Ayers hasn't as much depth as I would like, but he does have that critical air of innocence that magnifies the story's tragedy. It's his mere presence, rather than ""acting"", that gets the point across, which is pretty much the case for all the young actors. At the same time, it's hard to forget their one-by-one glances at us as they march off into the anonymous pages of history. <br/><br/>In fact, the war has done this to thousands like Paul and his comrades, and all the patriotic hype of their elders cannot bring them back or heal the psychic wounds of those who survive. Thanks be to Universal studios and director Milestone for sparing no expense in bringing Remarque's epochal novel to the popular screen. For what they left us with is a truly remarkable film."
"trenchantinsight","10","5","6","13 October 2012"," Stands the test of time
","This is a truly fantastic film, based on a wonderful narrative from the book by Erich Maria Remarque. It is an honest, poignant, thought provoking as well as life affirming anti-war film, which speaks out to the brotherhood of man. Shot over eighty years ago, you might expect that a lot of the films powerful effect to have faded, but the pathos is there and you undoubtedly left with the sense of the senseless monstrosity of WWI.<br/><br/>The acting throughout is superb and the pace of the film well-judged. What I really liked about the film was its use of silence. Being shot only a few years after the arrival of the 'talkies', by a director (Lewis Milestone) who was used to directing silent films must have helped in this regard. The haunting conclusion of the film, after the main protagonist has finally been forced to give up on life is perhaps the best example of the volume of silence within the film.<br/><br/>Don't be dissuaded by the year this film was made, nor by the use of American accents portraying German soldiers (any detrimental effect is negligible). It will be one of the best war films you have seen in a long while."

Removed from the tumultuousness of combat in central Europe, the United States had manufactured a conception of WWI as a scenario of glamorized heroics!! Once defense and attack initiatives commenced in Germany, as well as many other battleground nations in Europe, the entire plethora of unfriendly combat zones now evoked an onslaught of many visceral displays of distasteful reality!! World War I was known as one of the bloodiest wars in history!! Relentless in the pursuit of patriotic cause, the United States marched through Europe during WWI with rose colored glasses on!! These elements of apocalyptic miscalculation were what articulated some fatal delusions of grandeur!! This complicated rancor was the primary focus to the film ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is considered by movie experts to be one of the greatest films ever made!! This website ranks this film 207th best film out of the top 250 films ever made!! AFI (American Film Institute) ranks ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" one of the top 100 American films to ever hit the cinema!! Such accolades are largely due to the fact that the emotional revelations of WWI which this film necessitates, presented themselves with a very disconcerting premise; in turn, it became something that served as a stark awareness to the American public!! Lewis Milestone directs this film, he directed ""Pork Chop Hill"" and was very involved in the making of ""I Want You""; Both of these films are Korean War films, Lewis Milestone pinpoints the dismal realities of the cerebral repercussions of American military conflicts!! A bittersweet concept emanating from the film ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" is that there is always a tragic price paid for getting involved in a war!! All three of these war films delve into the devastating aftermath of battling in the trenches. These acts were veritable nightmares which resulted in killing the enemy for survival!! The desperation to comprehend such remorseful consequences, which initially started out as a preconceived camaraderie, that eventually became a line of logic which was thoroughly vitiated in every conceivable manner, wound up being a ubiquitous form of psychological disarray for all the American soldiers coming home. The aggregate tragedy from WWI which this film ""ALL Quiet on the Western Front"" depicted, left the movie audience spellbound!!!! Bear in mind, in 1930, American movies were all about escapism, not about the scathing moral drawbacks to wartime combat!! The movie ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, and, the film expedites the same candor as the novel does about what the acrimonious truth to what World War I was actually about.. The end of the film depicts how the guise of national omnipotence, which translated to the loss of thousands of young lives for questionable motives, became something that the United States government was peccant for!! ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" won for best picture in 1930, deservedly so too!! This movie encompassed many components of a devastating interruption to a glossy and stilted mendacity which the American movie goer was accustomed to accepting!! I do not think that any other movie up until 1930, the year that ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" was produced, had accomplished such an unprecedented feat!! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS MOVIE!!"

The results are of course tragic. Before Paul's first leave of absence, only two of about fifteen boys remain alive, and only one has both his legs.<br/><br/>Paul does much soul-searching throughout the film, and he is amazed at how euphoric he feels about life after the death of a close friend. He also finds he cannot stand being home, having become a creature of war, he cannot function in the normal world.<br/><br/>Ayres performance is a moving one, and it is a great shame we are unable to get further into the mind of this young man via Milestone's film. Remarque's superb novel enabled us to delve deep into the psyche of a young man at war, with more than just the enemy confronting him. Alas screenwriter Anderson found it impossible to convey this on celluloid.

This is a warts-and-all look at the horror that was WWI.

","Surprisingly powerful after almost eighty years, this is a true ""anti-war movie."" ""Anti-war"" is an adjectival phrase flung around too easily these days. Any recent movie with an excess of gore can be called anti-war, but if you leave the theater glowing with pride at the sacrifice and heroism of our own boys and girls, anxious for the next opportunity to display those old-fashioned virtues, you're not talking ""anti-war."" This one, like a few others, leaves you feeling that you've witnessed not a brave last stand but a moral tragedy as well as a material disaster. Few movies make that cut. ""Das Boot"" and ""Go Tell the Spartans"" come to mind. They're not necessarily great movies, but they're definitely anti-war.<br/><br/>""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (the title is ironic) tells the story of a handful of school boys who leap at the opportunity to join the army at the beginning of World War I and kill the enemy. By the end they are disillusioned and dead. We know they have lost hope not only because they tell us so but because the director (Lewis Milestone) and the writer show us a few of the details by which ideals are lost.<br/><br/>The dialog and some of the acting are pretty corny by today's standards, and the general outlines of the story, a kind of Bildungsfilm, are overly familiar by now. But it must have been quite shocking on its release because, as a matter of fact, it's STILL shocking. Much of its success is due to the special effects. The incoming artillery shells seem to whistle this way and that, up and down the scale, before exploding in what looks like lethal bouquets of crumbled soil. The mortar rounds don't even whistle. There's only a quick, silly ZOOP, a small pop of dirt, and a man is dead, a stylized fatality.<br/><br/>Lewis Milestone has been criticized for being too obvious but I don't know why. He puts his camera on a dolly and runs it at speed across a line of charging men, watching them fall in irregular groups, and it's a powerful and original technique. And the scene in which Lew Ayres tries to talk to the dying French soldier he's just bayoneted is clumsy and ill acted but still wrenching. Particularly effective is Milestone's set-up after the Frenchman has died. The corpse is propped up in a sitting position, a slight, strangely peaceful smile on its face, and Ayres must spend the night next to this horrifying apparition.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres turns in the performance of a novice. He was to become a conscientious objector in World War II and it damaged his career, although, as a medic, he performed under combat conditions like any other soldier. Louis Wolheim is Kat, the wised-up veteran with a face like the rear end of the huge, dirty truck you get stuck behind on the Sunday night Long Island Expressway. <br/><br/>I think I'll let it go at that. It's an iconic film and not one you're likely to forget in a hurry."

Literally a Milestone film this was the first Great talkie, its primitiveness and simplicity increasing its stark lustre.

","Based upon Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 novel of the same name ('Im Westen nichts Neues,' in German), Lewis Milestone's 'All Quiet on the Western Front' stands as one of the first great war films, a powerful condemnation of human war and conflict and only the third recipient of the now universally sought-after Academy Award for Best Picture. A vividly realistic account of the effects of War World One on young soldiers, the film also boasts some solid acting, grueling cinematography and an unforgettable message, highlighting so poignantly the sheer folly of war.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most curious thing about this film is that, despite being an American production, it follows the misfortunes of a young group of German soldiers. All our German characters speak in fluent English with crisp American accents, though this significant lapse in historical accuracy is extremely effective in allowing us to forget that these men are, after all, the perceived ""enemy side"" in WWI, enlisting our sympathy towards their plight. No longer is the German army portrayed as a mass of faceless, babbling, immoral evil-doers, but each man feels pain, sadness and terror just like any other person would. In this case, it is the English Army who is reduced to becoming the faceless enemy, though the filmmakers stop well short of condemning their actions. In many scenes, it is made irrefutably clear that, with the exception of the politics of their respective governments, there is little difference between the soldiers of either side. Indeed, remove their uniforms, and two opposing soldiers could conceivably become the best of friends. Many of these soldiers are young and scared; many have wives, children, families to come home to; many will ultimately never return from combat.<br/><br/>Particularly poignant is the film's conclusion, as the story's main protagonist, Paul Bäumer (Lew Ayres), is fatally shot whilst reaching towards a quivering butterfly, his outstretched hand falling limp just centimetres from the only remaining thing of beauty in the sullied war zone. This final scene was different from the ending in the book, and, indeed, so late was the decision to shoot it that the director himself was forced to double his own hand as Paul's. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is considered exceptionally graphic for its era, and the Milestone, in order to illustrate the full horrors of war, did not shy away from including brief glimpses of lifeless bodies and severed limbs.<br/><br/>Perhaps a bit melodramatic at times, and not always riveting to watch (some sequences move a bit slowly), Lewis Milestone's classic war film is, nonetheless, not an experience that you are likely to forget anytime soon. Indeed, war is hell, but too often we simply forget that war was hell for the other side, as well..."

The movie is also completely devoid of background music to artificially stir the audience, allowing the quiet dignity of the boys themselves to be the sole focus. <br/><br/>This movie could never be made today because American filmmakers (and film-goers) would expect to impose 21st Century cunning and bravado onto what was a very innocent generation of kids who had never traveled more that a mile or two from their farms or towns and who found themselves in an overwhelming nightmare of mud-sucking trenches, mustard gas, and mortar shells, who died without glory and without their mother's comfort. The movie was made 12 years after the war ended, reflecting a less complicated Germany, and could not even have been made a few years later, after Hitler perfected hatred and killing as a national sport.<br/><br/>It may be hard for us raised on pro-war anti-Nazi movies to believe that the German soldier could be so tender as this  but consider the German-initiated, unofficial Christmas truce of 1914, when German and British troops defied their officers and ventured into no man's land between the trenches to exchange Christmas trees, gifts, beer, food, photos, and even addresses with promises to write each other when the war ended! They even played an impromptu game of soccer and sang Christmas carols together. There was probably less hatred between the German soldier and his enemies in WWI than there was between Americans in the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Remember, too, that this was the last major war between Christian countries, when Christian values and old-world chivalry made their last stand on the battlefield. (Another great WWI film, also made in the thirties, that reflects this chivalry is Jean Renoir's ""The Grand Illusion."") Later opponents of the U.S. were either atheists (Nazis & communists), Buddhists (Japanese, Koreans and Vietnamese), or Muslims (Iraqis), none of whom would ever wax warm and fuzzy over Christmas or come singing across the battlefield to the tune of ""Stille Nacht."" So the enemy armies of WWI had a lot in common and no real reason to hate each other. In later wars, Americans have found it easier to dehumanize and even ""demonize"" the enemy because he is not Christian and therefore not ""like us."" All Quiet On the Western Front reminds us that ALL our enemies are ""like us"".<br/><br/>Above all, All Quiet On the Western Front is a damning indictment against war, not by preaching or pontificating, but by the stunning, haunting, utterly silent ending image of all the dead boys who walk silently away at the end, each looking back at us over his shoulder with an accusing look -- accusing the audience, accusing us, for their deaths."
"deideiblueeyez","7","4","5","30 April 2015"," A very sobering depiction of war in general
","I cannot really say much except that this film is a piece of work that would make anyone who watched it a pacifist; the grim anti-war message is further supported by the loss of innocence by the main character Paul, the ignorance of the slaughter on the home front by the folks and general behind the front lines in relative safety, and the romanticism of the glories of war held by Paul's professor. With all this is a dark coming-of-age story and a test of manhood and what it means to be a ""brave, noble soldier"" in spite of terrible conditions and unwinnable battles.<br/><br/>My personal problem with this film is that, due to the time it was made, over-acting and melodramatics are employed by the young guys in the film. The adults are very believable and play their part succinctly and without a thespian air--the young men in this film are almost wincingly bad in some places regarding subtly: It's almost non-existent in some scenes. Thankfully, all of that goes away when the characters are forced to charge enemy lines or retreat under shell fire.<br/><br/>Another bump in the road that I don't know if it was intentional or not was that when a person fell I had no idea if they had been indeed hit by enemy fire or shrapnel or if they were simply taking cover. It was surprising when someone I thought must have been sniped actually continued to move forward, and somebody I thought was fine turned out to have a bullet in the leg.<br/><br/>The slightly jarring fast-forward of enemy/ally advancement towards one trench or another with absolutely no sound calls upon the style of a silent newsreel. It's horrifying and sobering to watch, and I enjoyed every minute of it."
"PyroSquirrelX","9","4","5","10 January 2007"," A very well-done, emotional film.
","'All Quiet on the Western Front' is an amazing movie about World War I, but on a larger scale, about all war and how what it brings is pain, death, and disillusionment. The transition that the boys make in the film--from schoolboys who are delighted and cheering at the thought of war to embittered, hardened soldiers who only want to go home before they die.<br/><br/>The battle scenes shook me more than several of the more gory, explosion-riddled war scenes that I have seen. When the French are advancing on the Germans, and they come charging across the field only to be picked off one by one by machine guns, they are nothing more than targets. It is a frightening mentality that is shown, when all the soldiers could concentrate on was bullet--man dead. Bullet--another man dead. Another, and another.<br/><br/>The ending was perfect for this movie. The acting was a little faulty at times, but the rest of the film more than made up for it. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' does an amazing job of showing the feelings experienced during war. A must-see antiwar movie."
"km_dickson","5","17","32","7 August 2005"," Disappointing for such an honored classic
","Disappointing for such an honored classic. This sweeping war epic was another victim of that period of adjustment between silent and talking motion pictures. If it had come out just two years later it could have been great. As it is, Erich Maria Remarque's grim war novel is turned into a piece of bubblegum melodrama by the poor writing and horrible cast. It's the acting, really, that brings the film down more than anything else. Aside from Louis Wolheim as veteran soldier Katczinsky, there is not a single actor who can say a line without striking a pose and giving the hammiest over the top performance. They kill nearly every scene. It's a wonder that Wolheim was able to turn in such a good performance next to these deadbeats. On the upside, it is a great production. The visuals are grand, and the battle scenes are impressive, even by today's standards. Aside from not being able to tell good acting from bad, Lewis Milestone did quite a good job directing the film. In the end the movie pretty much breaks even."
"filmguy-1","9","5","7","11 August 2001"," A powerful anti-war film!
","All Quiet On The Western Front message truly stands the test of time, as well as the film in general. While the film may be scarred from a video point-of-view, the film is nonetheless entertaining. Young soldiers tricked (so to speak) into fighting for their  country by their patriotic people at home who say they should serve their country during the war. And as young men, they do so, only to find out that war isn't what they thought it was. Death and turmoil is the only things these kids see. All Quiet on the Western Front demonstrates very well, the emotional struggle that war has on young people. You really learn how these young soldiers feel, especially with Paul's famous quote ""We live in the trenches and we fight. We try not to be killed -- that's all"" - Outstanding film, and a must see, for even the most jaded movie goers!"

","There are so many versions of the original print, all are outstanding. This is the story of youth in war. The Platoon of the 1930's, this is far one of the earliest best films ever made. There are moments as touching and still as powerful now then they were back in the cinema 70 plus years ago. Paul, who is the hope of the audience portraying the innocent generation that was sold into war. This is not only the German view but the view of the soldier. No matter what side they are fighting for, this is truth of the battle. The scenes of the soldiers eating and drinking together are as strong as the battle scenes. The story of the passing of the boots and the questioning of why they are there, fighting in the first place are what makes this movie great. By the end, when Paul dies, the audience is shocked as there is no happy ending, no redemption for the character. Like the Deer Hunter, the ending keeps the audience guessing and thinking about the nature of war. Some versions have the movie ending with music, others have the film close in silence. The silence is more fitting as we see the young faces walking away from the audience after they look back. Before them stands hundreds of white crosses marking their grave sites along the quiet western front."

","Judging by how long ago this movie has been made, I really don't think other films can tell its message in such a compelling and memorable way.<br/><br/>All Quiet is a story of a naive German boy who becomes desensitized to the horrors of war. It's a tragic character study as we watch one young man lose his innocence. A sad story for many of those who had to fight at such a young age.<br/><br/>Not to mention that bone-chilling ending.<br/><br/>5/5. It deserves it.

"coolantic","10","2","2","12 November 2019"," The Benchmark
","I actually read the unexpurgated version of Erich Maria Remarque's novel when I was eleven years old and it had a profound effect on me. Suddenly, I was able to see that being British or German was irrelevant. This was about a group of ordinary young lads, not that much older than me, who were tricked, corrupted and dehumanised by war. Something always started by those who rarely have to fight it. The descriptions of battle are disturbing; a naked corpse hanging in a tree with a still-smoking cigarette between its lips, raw recruits falling into shellholes and choking to death in the poison gas lingering there. The main character Paul Baumer escaping a bombardment by climbing into a shattered coffin alongside its long-dead occupant in a ruptured cemetery. It certainly removed the idea of glory from my psyche.
Later, in about 1964, the movie was shown on TV, appropriately on Armistice Day. I knew I had to watch it and I wasn't disappointed. With the limitations of censorship at the time, it stuck pretty closely to the book. I felt that the schoolboys were old friends I knew well. Consequently their inevitable successive departures were very poignant. The spectacle of the battles was awesome. Thousands of extras racing across the screen to some frightening sound effects of screaming shells. A rail-mounted camera, representing a machine gunner's point of view, sweeps across a line of advancing French troops, cutting them down, literally like wheat under a scythe. The mayhem is decidedly reminiscent of the beach assault in the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. And I understand that Spielberg acknowledges the influence of the earlier movie on his opus. There are quieter scenes of course. The troops' elation at being given double rations due to the number of casualties sustained by their unit and a tender love scene when Paul and two others spend the night with three French girls. Possibly the only time he will ever experience intimacy. The scene is frank without being explicit. Relying on shadows on the wall to depict what we all know is going on. The final scene is a gut wrencher. Paul is the only one of the group left. Whereas in the book, the manner of his death is not detailed. Here director Lewis Milestone pulls out all the stops to show us the futility of the whole obscene practice of war. It is all quiet on the Western Front. From his trench Paul sees a beautiful butterfly resting amid the squalor of no-man's land. Instinctively he reaches for it. We see his outstretched hand and arm inching ever closer to the creature but, the staccato crack of a sniper's rifle causes the hand to clench and then go limp. It's over, and silently the ghostly figures of Paul and his companions walk away from the camera. Each one looking us straight into the eyes for the last time as if to say ""You won't let this happen again. Will you?"""

","Hailed as one of the best pictures of all time as well as the very best anti-war picture in history ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" sets a standard that all war films that would follow. From the pages of Erich Maria Remarque's widely read book of the young German soldiers in World War I, the director Lewis Milestone has made a trenchant and imaginative audible movie. Many will say that this is one of the greatest war films of all time. It may possibly be the greatest anti-war foundation in one film ever created. It is a sincere and earnest experience for the audience. the horrors of battle are presented in an amazingly effective way.<br/><br/>The story follows a band of schoolmates who have been preached to that they should sacrifice their lives to save the fatherland of German during the World War I. Paul Bäumer is a respected student in a bunch of German school boys in 1914 who listen to the voice of their school master and enlist in the war that's just been declared. These boys have become soldiers, who going through boot-camp, being thrusted into the riggers of war as green-footed soldiers, and through a matter of a few short years watch as each other are dissolved by the wounds of war, including psychological breakdowns, psychical ailments, and even the loss to death, learning that what they are fighting for is not the same things the people back home think they are fighting for. The survival become the only thing important in their life. An older soldier, Stanislaus Katczinsky, helps young people to cope with the horrors of trench warfare. However, every battle has its price...<br/><br/>The sequences are not too long. War horror is presented through the eyes of a young man. The Truth comes to the fore, when the young soldiers are elated at the idea of joining up, when they are disillusioned, hungry, shaken with fear and burdened by the death of their comrades. The cinematography of this film is absolutely magnificent. A bloody sequences are very rare. However, the director finds other ways to imply death and still have the same emotional effect. The parts of human bodies in wartime are part of the true horror. The story is told from the enemy perspective, but the experience in the trenches was universal. The epic film structure is awe-inspiring and putting the audience in the middle of the action in a World War I. Mister Milestone has tried to put you in the middle of a battle but the middle of an entire war, enticing you to become as emotionally involved with the happenings as the characters themselves. The story is flooded with emotions. Mister Milestone has directed silent films before this one, and he has seemed to know that less focus on dialogue and more focus on acting would bring about an overwhelmingly emotional and well, sincere, film. The feeling of the movie can be felt equally by anyone who watches the picture. In fact you forget that while watching the film that the characters are German soldiers. We see the war from a German perspective, despite the fact that the actors speak in American English.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres as Paul Bäumer has offered a great performance. Paul is a brave, sad and disappointed young man, who is struggling with a terrifying fact that people on the first front are much better than warlike people in a free zone. His meeting with mother, who he can not tell the truth, is one of the most touching moments in the film. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans.
Louis Wolheim as Stanislaus Katczinsky, is an experienced soldier who is trying to adapt to conditions of war. Louis teaches the young soldiers how to survive in the trenches. He is a kind of father figure.
Slim Summerville as Tjaden, brings the necessary amount of humor in the film. Arnold Lucy is a warlike and passionate Professor Kantorek. John Wray is a vicious and cowardly postman Himmelstoss, who has seized the lieutenant's rank.<br/><br/>The movie preaches that war is hell and their is no glory in fighting a war for something you don't believe in. The people are dying while fighting for other people's plans and ideas, because human lives lost in the war, can not be returned.<br/><br/>It was the first talkie war film to win Oscars. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was won two Oscars in two category (Best Picture and Best Director)."
"CubsandCulture","10","2","2","9 September 2018"," Didactic polemic but emotionally gripping after all these years.
","This film has one purpose: to lay bare the foolishness of war and nationalism. All the characters, situations and dialog point towards that end goal and there isn't much counter argument in the film. It is a political essay, a pacifist manifesto in disguise of a story. I think the film goes a bit too far now and then with the message and a slightly better film would have been more subtle. Nonetheless, the story works and is gripping.<br/><br/>The best feature of the film is its unflinching direction and commitment to realism. There's several scenes, especially for the time period, that are shockingly graphic. The film rips your heart out because of this. <br/><br/>It is nearly impossible to make an anti-war film that doesn't inadvertently glorifies war. I don't think this film quite pulls it off but of the various Hollywood efforts it comes the closest. That final shot is still devastating nearly a century later."

At that time, the teachers persuade the students to get enlisted into the army. Getting excited by the words of the old teacher all the students got into the army expecting a beautiful army life. After they have entered the fields, they realized the real situation and felt that it is better back in school. But, now these innocent guys got into the army, they have to face the enemy. It shows the fear of these new recruits and the real difficulties they face. They began to see their friends in front of their eyes.This makes them feel to go back home. These new people, even don't know that even the army people suffer from hunger. They really expected a good life, but the reality turns out to be exactly the opposite. At one point of time, they feel like they are just living to die. Paul( Hero ) kills a man in protecting himself and later cries that he didn't actually wanted to kill. This shows the innocence. And later when he goes home on leave, he sees the same teacher persuading the minds of the young students to join the Army. This makes him angry and tells the truth and called by the students as a coward. He feels that he doesn't belong to home anymore and returns to the Army and eventually dies."
"beardedmovieguy","10","2","2","10 March 2015"," One of the best Anti-war Movie Ever
","Well done movie that was influential enough that at least 2 remakes were made of it. It is pretty interesting, it is a war movie, but it is from the German perspective, starting with how the a group of youth are convinced to join the war effort by their teacher, being told it will be glorious and fun to fight and die for their Motherland. These same boys are all shocked when they finally do get in the war at how loud and ugly it is, and they are forced to grow up real fast as their friends are dying all around them. The story is good, and it looks decent considering when it was made. It is also cool to see when one of the boys who is now a man comes back and sees the teacher that talked him into going, just to find him giving the exact same speech that motivated him to a new class of teens. He is then asked to tell the students all about the glory of war, which he can't and after telling the kids how it really is, they consider him a coward and a traitor. All Quiet On The Western Front does a great job of showing war as the terrible thing it is, and how it is very different for those fighting compared to those who stay behind and criticize from the safety of their homes.

"JosephPezzuto","8","2","2","8 January 2015"," Reel Look: 'All Quiet on the Western Front'
","""You still think it's beautiful to die for your country. The first bombardment taught us better. When it comes to dying for country, it's better not to die at all."" Indeed a breakthrough in American historical archives, 'All Quiet On The Western Front' (1930) was the first anti-war film of the sound era, faithfully based upon the timeless, best-selling 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque (who also had experienced the war first-hand as a young German soldier). The actual film itself, shot in grainy black and white, truly captures the essence of the time during World War I in the year of 1914, and what the characters are going to be sucked into nonetheless. As the soon-to-be German soldiers are sitting in a classroom being lectured on how great is to die for the country is suddenly drowned out by music being played outside bypassing troops marching their way through the town. The war was indeed on, and the boys sitting in the classroom soon come to the fatal realization that they would very soon be unready become real men who, too, would end up dying for their own country. Was there no other option but to enlist, with the naive boys keeping their fears hidden deep within? Let's take a look. <br/><br/>The film stars wonderful actors as such who also become central characters. Lew Ayres portrays Paul Baumer, the lead character of a group of seven unknowing boys who are each young, impressionable and are recruited and trained to fight for the glory of their blessed homeland. Ayres was only twenty-one years old when he played Paul in a star-making role. His other friends among the seven were Kropp, Leer and Kemmerick. Also, a shy postman named Himmelstoss, played by John Wray, eventually becomes Sergeant Himmelstoss to the boys when he also enlists. His reputation while in uniform is anything but shy as he angrily barks out orders to his new recruits during training. <br/><br/>In discussing the history portrayed, it tells the viewer that it was a time near the beginning of twentieth-century Germany where the young men were unready stripped of their innocence to be molded into the ways of becoming a real man because World War I was indeed on. Neither boy knew from another about what truly was about to unfold in the days and hours to come. All they knew were from what they were taught about how gloriously they must defend their fatherland and how wonderful and gallant it was to die for the certain cause. They boys did not know what they were headed into. The future looked bleak and gray; a haunting shadow that hovered over them wherever they seemed to go. They knew that they had to stay together and fight with all they had, even to the death. <br/><br/>In prevailing attitudes/prejudices, one example would be when Sergeant Himmelstoss is training the new recruits and is making them track through thick, gloppy mud and also marching them for hours in the heat of the day. His attitude towards his regiment was so horrible and demanding that the boys were fed up with it all and decided to pull a prank on the sergeant at night when he would come back to base in a drunken stupor. They made him trip over a long piece of wire and then surround him, put a sack over his head and began kicking him repeatedly in the rear while laughing triumphantly. <br/><br/>In describing historical accuracy, it probably comes as close as to how the soldiers were dressed in the appropriate uniforms of the time, the weapons that were used, and to where the heat of the battle of World War I is on full throttle. The young recruits are reduced to standing in damp, muddy trenches encompassed by other soldiers as missiles whistle their deadly note through the air and as bullets rampaging from machine guns portray rhythmic timing with the cries of death. The world the boys had once known was now leveled down to a barren wasteland infested with horrible images and darkened skies choked in the thick smog of war. Some parts were saddening, including one memorable scene where Paul visits his wounded, dying friend Kemmerick lying in pain in the dying room in the makeshift crowded hospital in a French cathedral. Only nineteen years old, he is afraid of what is going to happen to him. He complains to Paul that there are robbers amidst the place, saying that they have stolen his watch. He even wonders about the pain in every toe on his right foot, which, unknowingly to him, has been amputated. When he discovers that not just his foot but his whole leg is gone, he breaks down and utters a startled cry that fills the place, emanating his sorrow and loss. Shortly after this, he dies. Other scenes were downright gruesome, as soldiers are running across the field being blown to bits. Even in one graphic scene evoking surprise and disgust was of a soldier clinging on to a fence. An explosion followed, swallowing him in fire and smoke. When the dust had settled, all that remained of him were his bloodied hands still gripping the meshes of the fence. There is a scene at the end where Paul reaches out his hand for a butterfly on the field and is immediately shot. This portrays to the viewer that true innocence is stripped clean amidst the terrors of war. <br/><br/>This spectacular film was a great experience to reflect upon and to thoroughly enjoy. Made on a large-scale budget of only $1.25 million and with an employment of over two-thousand extras, this film went on to win four Academy Awards nominations. A mastery war film from a mastery filmmaker, and a true milestone for the eponymous director!"

","While catching up with some old classics I came across this brilliant piece of cinema which is made 84 years back. Though it is nearly a century old right now the sheer amount of creativity in this is simply mind blowing. Maybe looking at the long journey the cinema has come up to now from the time this movie was made comparatively the key point that comes to my mind is that 'not much improvement'. Because in a world where we believe that Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece (It is no doubt) of war cinema All Quite on the Western Front (AQWF) has done it in a magnitude beyond its time and that's some mind boggling truth to realize. <br/><br/>The background of the movie is based on a set of teenagers who joins the German army on the first year of World War 1. Thought they are still very young and attending to school the motivation they received through their school professor make them want to fight for their country. However they realize that the true face of war is brutal, unforgiving and severely stressful than the picture they received of it back at home. On blood, sweat and dead bodies they struggle to survive one day at a time seeing the devastation of war getting heftier by the night. While the story follows several individuals in a group the key character is Paul Bäumer who finally gets to return home after getting injured. But once he come back which is after 3 years from being in the front line he realizes that the place he call home is not what it used to be. And he becomes a stranger amongst the people of his home town. <br/><br/>AQWF is based on a German novel (Im Westen nichts Neues) by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The movie is directed by Lewis Milestone. The storyline is very effective in terms of depicting the mentality of the soldiers who are fighting in the front lines and how the hardships of the circumstances break them. Lack of food, long hours on duty, fear of death, being homesick, losing their mates are all taking a toll on their motivation and ultimately the significance of their existence is lost. But the courage these young men show staring at death day in and day out is not to be underestimated. The other key point which made AQWF on top of my war movie list is the cinematography. Right from the start the details the movie concentrates upon is magnificent. In an age where CG was not heard of most of the scenes have being staged live and that must have being a tremendous effort from the whole crew. And there is one astonishing battle sequence that runs for a whole of 8 minutes nonstop and by the end of it the viewer will be sweating for sure. <br/><br/>The true beauty of AQWF is how the director mixes up the selfless war and the humans full of emotions in to one. This mix ultimately proves that wars are fought by ordinary people in extraordinary situations and their lives are just as valuable no matter what side they fight for. But on the battle ground that is the only thing that seems to have no value and it's devastating. No war can be justified."

"Prismark10","8","2","2","3 April 2014"," War is hell
","Adapted from the book of the same name this is the experiences of the Great War from the eyes of the German soldiers and particularly the sensitive Paul Baumer.<br/><br/>The films begins with their teacher giving an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the Army for the 'Fatherland'. The students all enlist and we then see them in basic training under Himmelstoss, who a few days earlier had been the town's postman before he enlisted. He is a strict disciplinarian who is hated by all the recruits.<br/><br/>Soon the boys are on the front fighting with the enemy and under constant bombardment. Some will die, some will go mad, others will get injured, a few may survive. The effects of the war causing a profound change to those who are still fighting.<br/><br/>It is important to note that this film was made before the second world war so its not tainted by knowledge of that war. Yet hearing the teacher of saving the fatherland leaves you unsure as to what war he is talking about, so fresh the words still sound.<br/><br/>Given the film was made in 1930 it really did set the template for the modern war film, you can see the lineage down to even films like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. The director Lewis Milestone served in the Great War and brings great visuals to the battle scenes and profound sorrow for those dealing with their injuries either physical, mental or both.<br/><br/>If there is criticism, sometimes its not clear what the injuries to the men are. This might to do with the fact that the scenes are non graphic reflecting period the film was made. Many a time it seems the soldiers died from what looked like a minor injury.<br/><br/>Still this is an important war film in the history of cinema."
"bm-25","7","2","2","15 February 2014"," Does an all time classic stand the test of time?
","This film is widely considered to be an all-time classic, and I thought it worth showing my 12 year old as we are approaching the 100th anniversary of the start of World War 1. <br/><br/>We watched the digitally remastered version, so the reproduction of sound and visuals was near on perfect. <br/><br/>This highlighted some of the sophisticated cinematography used, but equally some of the quite crude sound. (It is worth remembering that it was released only some 3 years after The Jazz Singer, so is a relatively early talkie.)<br/><br/>The overall production values are also really quite high: authentic looking European towns and villages and some impressive battle scenes. <br/><br/>Germans speaking with an American accent is rather quirky to an English ear, the dialogue and acting are very much of their time and often something of a disappointment. Again, this was quite early days for talkies and it is easy to forget how rapidly things developed to the more naturalistic style that we are used to today. <br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, it is a simple but powerful polemic about the futility of war. The scenes of fighting are very telling. (After long waits of frightened boredom) struggling for a strip of land, to gain a few hundred yards only to then lose them again as quickly, with a huge cost in lives, The naiveté of the young volunteers as they join their cynical elders at the front, after being encouraged by their parents' generation at home to go and fight and die gloriously. Their dawning realisation of the reality is well made, even if it seems a bit clumsy by modern standards. This is further highlighted by a visit home on leave to a population largely ignorant of the harsh, painful, life-or-death drudgery of life at the Front.<br/><br/>Authored by and from a German perspective, the telling of the story by an American film company and crew is itself pretty remarkable. It did make me think that we still hadn't got the plain, simple truth that they are all ""our boys""..."

","Only it wasn't. On the western front the Allied and Central Powers armies were locked in a bitter stalemate that ran diagonally across France and Belgium from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This went on for a little over four years. In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I'm sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.<br/><br/>You lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy's trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.<br/><br/>And it shows that from the enemy perspective. That's something today's audience can't appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis.<br/><br/>Louis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page. Adolphe Menjou took the part of Walter Burns in that film which Wolheim was to have."
"eabakkum","8","2","2","27 December 2010"," The horrors in the trenches of WWI
","Each film has its own audience. Until today the war film ""Saving private Ryan"" managed to attract more than 2000 reviews. I guess that the film ""All quiet on the Western front"" draws a somewhat more advanced public. On careful consideration, it is the First World War that appeals most to the imagination when reflecting upon the horrors of war. After WWI war has never again been the same. With ""Im Westen nichts Neues"" Remarque wrote an outstanding account of the misery in the trenches. This is the first try of a cinematic translation, and than there was a remake, in ""The Hallmark Hall of Fame"". Most reviews appreciate the 1930 version, but to me it seems that the remake more closely follows the narrative and the atmosphere of the book. I also found some comments lamenting that it is an English-spoken produce, and so the typical German expressiveness is lost. There is some truth in this critique, and in fact there is a really German counterpart. This is the film ""Westfront 1918"", which was also made in the early thirties and based on a novel (titled ""Vier von der Infantry""). If you appreciated ""All quiet on the western front"", then ""Westfront 1918"" is definitely a film for you. The main difference between both films is that the German version has an almost documentary style. Both films have a similar main character (resp. Paul Brenner and Karl), but in ""Westfront 1918"" the story line is even thinner. The central theme is war, trenches, barbed wire, death, destruction, and decay. I guess the documentary style of ""Westfront 1918"" was inevitable, since the makers had been in the middle of the conflict and had experienced the horrors by themselves (even on the ""homefront""). Whereas the American makers of ""All quiet on the western front"" maintain some distance and try to give an interpretation from a personal point of view, the makers of ""Westfront 1918"" can only recount what happened. There is no room for empathy with anything. This makes in my opinion the latter film more impressive and horrific. Therefore I will probably not like ""Saving private Ryan"", since it tries to transform the collective nature of war into an individual affair. Anyway, ""All quiet on the western front"" goes like this. In 1914 Paul Baumer volunteers together with 20 of his classmates. At the front in France they soon discover the gruesome reality. They are confronted with the terrible routine in the trenches. A highly emotional aspect is the proximity of the conflict, since apart from the perpetuating anonymous shelling it is still largely a man-to-man fight with drawn bayonets and experimental flame-throwers. You can yet by accident find yourself in a bomb crater, together with an armed enemy volunteer. It also helps to place the film into the context of military history. In the second half of the nineteenth century the wars were often short encounters between professional armies, which hardly affected the population. However, by the end of the century the rise of imperialism had caused an arms race (something like the Cold War), which stupefied the common people. The mass destruction reached proportions, that surpassed the contemporary human imagination. Man lost what had remained of his innocence. It was this war, that ended the remaining absolute monarchies and even caused the birth of an entirely new society system in Russia. It created the first insane forms of art (Dada), and strongly furthered the foundation of pacifism and the League of Nations."

","""Excellently harrowing."" This is a great film, for all of the reasons previously expressed by others at this web-site. To me, the essence of the film is encapsulated in this exchange that takes place one hour and eleven minutes (approximately) into the film:<br/><br/>The German soldiers are resting, changing clothing, discussing what they would do if it was suddenly peacetime again, dreaming of the beautiful and gratifying nature of their past lives, realizing how fortunate they had been back then; then the following scene takes place. I only recall a part of the scene in this comment.<br/><br/>The German soldiers are resting, changing clothing, discussing what they would do if it was suddenly peacetime again, dreaming of the beautiful and gratifying nature of their past lives, realizing how fortunate they had been back then; then this exchange takes place:<br/><br/>Former student - ""...You've all got something to back to, wives, children, jobs.......but what about us? What have we got to go back to, school?""<br/><br/>Learned Soldier - ""Why not? You know everything already.""<br/><br/>Former student - ""A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously.

It follows a class of high school students in Germany who enlist in the war, and find out that its none of the glory and beauty that they were told about. Each character has a detailed story and you will end up caring about each one of them as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb. As most of the actors are under 25 years old, they all give touching, thoughtful performances. Lew Ayres gives a standout performance as the main character, Paul. This is definitely a milestone for director Lewis Milestone. The battle scenes are all authentic and many of the extras actually served in the war. This movie is beautifully directed, capturing the terror and the darkness of the war, while still managing to show the characters' fading hopes and aspirations.<br/><br/>Anyway, unbelievable film.

Second place (to ""With Bryd at the South Pole"") on Mordaunt Hall's Ten Best in The New York Times.<br/><br/>COMMENT: Erich Maria Remarque's semi-autobiographical novel, ""Im Westen Nichts Neues"", was first published in Berlin in 1927. Other Remarque books that have been filmed include ""Drei Kameraden"" as Three Comrades, ""Der Weg Zuruck"" as The Road Back, ""Flottsam"" as So Ends Our Night, a short story ""Beyond"" as The Other Love, ""Arch of Triumph"" as The Arch of Triumph, ""Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben"" as A Time to Love and a Time to Die.<br/><br/>In its original form, All Quiet on the Western Front ran 140 minutes. This has now been restored. Continuity, however, is still somewhat jerky and abrupt. The film is constructed along the lines of a stage play with a fade-out at the end of each scene replacing the curtain fall. There is a tendency to make the individual scenes run too long, and despite the large amount of action footage — fully half-an-hour of the film would be solid action — the accent is firmly on dialogue. The pace is slow, sometimes excruciatingly so by modern standards, though this was contrived quite deliberately both for contrast with the sudden bursts of action and also to emphasize the dreariness and monotony of front-line sub-existence.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Milestone's technique often seems uncompromisingly dated and this could prove a drawback for many audiences.<br/><br/>Available on DVD through Universal. Quality rating: 10 out of ten."

","Early in the war, Germany is winning and everybody is eager to fight. A group of schoolboys are rallied by their jingoistic teacher to be the Iron Youth of Germany.

The young Paul Bäumer struggles to save a french soldier after stabbing him. He returns home to confront his teacher. Then he ends in the horrors of the frontlines.<br/><br/>This is one of the great anti-war movie stemming from the first World War. It is heightened by the fact that the movie follows the German soldiers as if there is no difference in the war experience. It takes away the easy patriotism and jingo slogans. There is the great machine gun scene where soldiers are mow down like wheat. It hits the ugliness and the pointlessness of war hard. Also it's simply a well made film."

","It's no wonder this masterpiece was banned from numerous countries for years. No one is excluded from Remarque's indictment of the politics, social myths, and economics of War (set in Germany, WWI). Except for an occasional bit of over-acting (a leftover from silent film and stage training - which is very forgivable, considering), this work is an amazing experience - NOT at a hokey, dated, poorly visualized 77 year old period oddity. For an audience in 1930, it would have been especially horrific, disgusting, and full of painful truths. On the other hand, at that same time, Germany was in the process of secretly rebuilding their war state.

Made right before the studios really started to enforce the standards code for cinema of the time, the realism and graphic impact of this film blew me away. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a cinematic masterpiece and makes a very powerful statement on the condition of war as (war) takes it toll on the human psyche. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is one of my favorite movies, and surpassed ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Platoon"" as my favorite ""in the trenches"" war film.<br/><br/>jay PS-""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was the first film to win the Oscar for best picture!"
"mOVIemAN56","9","3","4","9 April 2007"," A gritty and realistic WW1 film that is true to the book
","All Quiet on the Western Front is remembered for several different reasons and is a common household name today. Some say it is because it was the first 'talkie' to win Best Picture. Others say it is due to the amazing phrase its title is (common admit it is catchy). Yet others still insist it is due to the amazing adaptation of the book it was based on. However, All Quiet on the Western Front is best remembered by me as a gritty and realistic portrayal of a war nearly entirely forgotten.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front follows the story of Paul Baumer, a German teenager who enlists in the army upon the onset of World War One. Along with his classmates, he believes the war will be more of an adventure than a war. That is until they are thrown into the trenches and confronted with the horrors of trench warfare and no mans land. Slowly the many teenage soldiers begin to lose their innocence in this war to end all wars. <br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front is one of those few films that takes us into the lives of a soldier. It does not drop us into some distant battlefield and hold us there until the end. Instead the film gives backgrounds and liveliness to the characters. Everyone is made out to be someone you could run into on the street any day of the week. This is a work of Remarque (the man who wrote the book) and is brought forth perfectly by the actors portraying the characters.<br/><br/>What made the book so wonderful was its accurate portrayal and feelings of World War One soldiers. Neither side had a vast majority vicious fighters who sought to destroy the enemy, they were there because that is what their government told them to do. These men were not glorious heroes because of the killing they did but for what they did for each other. The movie (just like the book) shows us that these men are not soldiers but human beings who are trying to survive in the war to end all wars. <br/><br/>Another upside to the film is its realistic showing of trench warfare. The battle scenes are anything but watered down. The three or four scenes of actual battle are gritty and unnerving. The slaughter shown is accurate to the point of pain when compared to casualty statistics of the First World War (1,058,407 lost at the Battle of the Somme for anyone doubting that). Lewis Milestone paved the way for epic war battles with this film.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres is an unknown actor to me. Granted I don't see many films from this time period but I thought his work as the young Paul Baumer was excellent. We literally see him age throughout the film and are easily able to relate to him and understand him. We understand the pain he suffers, we understand the emotions he is feeling all through Ayres fine acting. I hope to come across more of Ayres work in the near future, he was a great actor from what I saw in this movie.<br/><br/>While Ayres gives a magnificent performance he is overshadowed by Louis Wolheim who portrays the leader of the bunch, Kat. Wolheim died a year after making this film and to me this was his best work. He is so close to perfection as the battle hardened Kat that it is almost unreal. His acting isn't like the melodramatic work of most actors of this period. It is as if you were watching an actor out of the present day. <br/><br/>The work other than what is on the screen is marvelous. How the film did not win Best Cinematography is beyond me. It won two Academy Awards and perhaps the two biggest (Director and Picture). Remarque's anti-war classic is brought to life and loyally followed in the film adaptation. All Quiet on the Western Front goes down as one of the earliest war films. It also goes down as one of the most intense, most gruesome, and most brilliant anti-war films I've ever seen. Do not miss this timeless classic.<br/><br/>4.5/5 Stars"
"fwgrhouse","10","3","4","30 March 2007"," Very Good Film
","I saw this movie in my AP History class when we were studying about World War one. When I saw it I knew that this was one of the most memorable war films of all time. It does a very good job of depicting the lifestyle of the German soldiers during the war, especially considering this was made during the thirties. The acting is also superb. I believe that this is also one of the films that paved way for other memorable war films to follow on. I also think that it also does a good job of showing that even though the Germans were the enemy, they were still human beings just like you and me and that for once it shows their point of view on the war. Anyone interested in war films has to see this one."
"AndrewPhillips","8","3","4","23 January 2006"," It still works
","Having only recently watched this film for the first time, the thing that strikes me is that it was filmed over 75 years ago, yet it still stands up as an effective piece of cinema, quite amazing.<br/><br/>OK the acting could be a bit better from the majority of the cast, but I can make allowances, they were still getting to grips with sound for goodness sake. The battle scenes can rival any modern blockbuster for the shear power they convey, the moment when a man is blown up in front of Paul leaving just his hands and wrists on the barbed wire, strong stuff.<br/><br/>It shows the growing bond between the old hands and new recruits well, especially in the scenes acted by Louis Wolheim, who I think sets the bench mark for the many gruff ugly soldiers, who followed in countless war films, and take the newies under their wing. There are some real moments of tenderness like Paul visiting his friend in hospital and watching him die and the scenes between Paul and his mother.<br/><br/>That war is stupid we understand, but 75 years ago it was thought of differently by the masses, which makes the success of this film all the more impressive, best film at the Oscars no less.<br/><br/>It is when Paul gets back to the front after his leave to find the regiment is now made up of 16 year olds, who looked so young, but we were right back at the beginning of the film, they were just like Paul and his classmates, nothing had changed, no lessens had been learnt. Except by us, having watched these children turn into men and die one by one, until finally it is just Paul, we understand that war serves no purpose really, that young lives are lost for what leaders want. That Paul dies at the end reaching for a butterfly, a reminder of his life before the war, is both poignant and beautiful.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone, it surprised me with how good it really was and yes it still works."
"robmeister","10","3","4","3 November 2005"," Compelling, Daring, and Ahead of Its Time
","In a word, ""All Quiet On the Western Front"" is a masterpiece! When watching this movie, it is sometimes hard to believe it was released in 1930.<br/><br/>While there have been several ""anti-war"" movies released over the years, this is among the first, and it is executed with tremendous effect. The scene that sticks most in my head takes place inside a bunker in the trenches. The shelling, the constant debris falling from the ceiling, the rats, and the men mentally breaking down are all amplified by the claustrophobic camera work.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are terribly realistic, rivaling those shown in more contemporary films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998). The mortar explosions very strongly resemble the real thing, such as those shown in World War I archive footage. And the tracking shots of soldiers falling onto barbed wire will leave an indelible impression.<br/><br/>I won't kid around here. This movie is arguably the most violent film of its time. Released before the creation of the infamous Hayes Code, ""All Quiet On the Western Front"" graphically shows hand-to-hand combat, a soldier killed by a mortar shell (with only his dismembered hands remaining), and an agonizing death in the trenches over the course of hours (and the eyes stay open when the man dies). All of these events (and more) were shown from the perspective of a young German soldier named Paul Bäumer. Lew Ayres, who went on to gain fame as Dr. Kildare and then notoriety as a World War II conscientious objector, gives a strong performance as Bäumer.<br/><br/>This is the second review I have written in which I mention the Hayes Code, and I have no doubt that this movie had at least some influence in its creation. Fortunately for us, Universal Studios felt the subject matter was compelling enough to allow the film to remain basically as-is. Seeing this film makes me wonder what movies would have been like had the Hayes Code not been enforced. Conversely, this particular movie would have been far different if it was produced with the Hayes Code in mind.<br/><br/>""All Quiet On the Western Front"" is a movie that is ahead of its time, and I think it is among the best movies ever produced and very deserving of its Best Picture win. If you notice it in a video store, or you see it listed on a classic movie channel some time, do yourself a favor: SEE THIS MOVIE!"

But it still works.<br/><br/>Lewis Milestones' direction helps. The battle scenes are long, vicious and pretty graphic (for 1930) and he really makes you feel all the pain and agony the soldiers endure. There are many unforgettable scenes: a young man, his eyes shot out, screaming and stumbling in a battlefield; a young soldier trapped in a crater with a corpse of the enemy; the sequence where the soldiers are being driven mad by nonstop bombing from the enemy and a final scene that packs a real wallop.<br/><br/>It's also interesting to see flashes of male nudity (this was pre-Code) and Lew Ayres so young and full of life.

"ecjones1951","10","4","6","9 February 2008"," Faithful rendering of the greatest anti-war novel
","Most of us have probably read a wonderful novel and found ourselves casting a movie version and envisioning how certain scenes would appear on screen. Most of us have probably been disappointed in a movie based of a favorite book.<br/><br/>Lewis Milestone's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is in every way equal to Erich Maria Remarque's World War I novel of the same name. Milestone recreates trench warfare in scenes that still have a raw power, with their gut-wrenching depiction of violence and danger, their rodents and dysentery.<br/><br/>How Paul, the young German soldier who narrates the book, gets to the front lines with his buddies happens quickly in both the novel and the movie. Paul's bellicose schoolmaster has whipped his students into a frenzy over the glories of war and service to one's country. He quotes the famous declaration of the Greek poet Horace, ""Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."" The English translation is ""sweet and fitting it is to die for one's country."" But Professor Kantorek conveniently forgets the lines that follow: ""sweeter it is to live for one's country, and sweeter still to drink of it."" As the camera pans around the classroom it reveals only little boys, and even viewers who have not read the book know that they will soon be cannon fodder. Before that happens we learn a little about all of them, enough to care when they are gravely wounded or killed. The war makes men out of these boys in only a few weeks.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres plays Paul as an Everyman for all the boys in Division 2. The story is told through his eyes as it is in the novel, in a straightforward, highly effective narrative. As Paul, Ayres does some of the best work of his career. The horrors of war, and many are suggested here; speak for themselves. The screenplay is faithful to the spirit of Remarque's novel. Subjective commentary is really superfluous. The film does several things the book can't, one of which is to use slow tracking shots over the trenches. It's a subtle effect unusual for its day. The production design is so vividly detailed it's nearly impossible to believe ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was shot entirely on studio back lots.<br/><br/>It is only towards the end of the story, when Paul has a lengthy leave and goes home, that he departs from his blunt narrative to ask himself the big questions. He worries if he will be able to live a civilian life, to carve out a career, have a family. His excursion from the front, far away from the constant bombardment of the shells should bring him some respite, some pleasure. But he finds none. And maybe it takes a soldier to understand that a lice-infested redoubt where one false move can leave you holding your intestines in your hands can, in a strange way, feel like home.<br/><br/>Milestone and his screenwriters made a smart move in treating the cast of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" as an ensemble. As the men grow up -- and many of them do survive for two years or more -- it is obvious that these young soldiers have formed attachments of a kind they will never have again even if they live to be old men. When Paul is out on leave and runs into old acquaintances, they ask him ""so, how is it out there?"" What can he tell them? When he drops in on his old Professor he is giving the same rousing call to arms he gave to Paul and his buddies several years earlier. Kantorek wants Paul to echo his sentiments. Paul won't lie, but the truth is impossible to describe.<br/><br/>Rarely in the book or the movie are the names of specific battles given. It doesn't matter; they were more or less the same. Visitors to the battlefields of Northern France might be amazed at how much evidence still exists of the trenches and the battle lines like those where Paul and his comrades fought ""The War To End Wars."" 90 years later, farmers and hikers in the woods still find unexploded bombs (UXBs). Many a farmer tilling his land has been killed by one. If found before they go off, there are three depots in France where UXBs are taken and detonated safely. Children used to decorate fence posts with rusting German and French helmets. Bone fragments were routinely found by anyone working the soil until the 1960s. There is still so much metal in the ground near Verdun that very little green will grow there. And every few months some country loses its last WWI veteran. They are over 100 years old now. How many of their stories mirror those of the men in Paul's Division? Time and the elements are eroding the memories of WWI, but Remarque's story and Milestone's superb film will ensure that they will last, even if their message is never absorbed by any country preparing for war."

","Considering that this film was made in 1930, it is a remarkable achievement that a film with such a powerful message was allowed to see the light of day, especially considering the circumstances.<br/><br/>Centering on the first World War from a German perspective, it is a story about a group of teenagers who are recruited to join the army. At first, they see it as a great honour and something of an adventure, but as they all face the brutal realities of War, they are soon left disillusioned. When the main character returns home from service and shows his hatred of War, he finds his own compatriots now hate him, and decides to return to the battlefields were he dies, now a mess.<br/><br/>Viewing it from a modern perspective, I was quite amazed by the many messages this film had, and the sad truth that they are even more relevant today in some respects.

I don't understand why many critics don't see it like a top movie and why they consider ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""The thin red line"" so superior . I mean , I love those movies but considering this was made in 1930 I think it is more or at least equally important . I am actually astonished by the fact that a pacifist , high budget , movie could be done in those years . And what style , what poetry ! The battle scenes are very realistic and still enjoyable today : probably in 1930 they had a more shocking effect than Saving private Ryan's first 20 mins have in our days . This movie is technically amazing . Some of the lines are just unforgettable and incredibly sincere . Characters are real human beings: they cry during bombings , they steal things from dead friends , they fight for bread and women . It's so ahead of its time that it's often hard to believe it : most of the scenes here became war movies clichés . Even masterpieces like Apocalypse Now , Paths of glory and the ones I already mentioned stole a lot of ideas from ""All is quiet on the western front"". And there's some room for humour too , it's just perfect . War movies didn't take many steps forward after this . My personal beliefs in life are not the one of a true pacifist : it's not that I think that war is good it's just that I consider it as an inevitable aspect of human behavior . This is to say that I don't fully agree with the message behind the movie . Still , if I had to choose only one anti-war movie to show to someone I'd take this one . I give this 9 on 9 which is the best on my scale since I don't use 10 nor 1 . Only 21 movies on 1052 gets that mark on my vote history , and ""All is quiet ...

Originally intended as a silent, the soundtrack works splendidly and improves many of the bunker scenes. For example, it helps one accept American actors, such as Slim Summerville, as Germans. The stabbed Frenchman scene is the main exception; unfortunately, it lacks the famous death gurgles. Also, occasionally, instead of trusting the visuals, there are too many dialogue titles.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres is so great being mentored by Louis Wolheim (check out his bio), presaging his later relationship with Lionel Barrymore."
"Elizabeth-328","10","4","6","28 August 1999"," A different kind of WWI movie...
","""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is different from most movies about World War I, because it tells the story through the Germans' point of view.  Lew Ayres is heart-breaking as Paul Baumer.  My favorite part is when he returns to his school while he's on his leave.  He tells the young boys what war is really like.  ""When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!"" he says in disgust.  But the boys only argue with him, and call him a coward.<br/><br/>Another moving part is when Paul is stuck for hours with a man he has stabbed.  Paul is guilt-stricken, and promises to write to the man's family. He is so overwhelmed by the fact that he killed someone.<br/><br/>With all his friends dead, Paul feels lonely and hopeless.  But then he spots the first beautiful he has seen in a long time: a butterfly.  He comes up over the trench to reach for it, but one of his enemies sees Paul and kills him.  It's so sad, because Paul was reaching for something alive and beautiful...almost like hope.<br/><br/>""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a movie everyone needs to see because of its powerful message.  It shows the viewer the true horrors of war, which most people never even think about.  Most people, like most of the boys in this movie, only think of being heroes, and dying like men for their country.  But there's more to war than just that."

","Just let me say a few words about it:<br/><br/>In my opinion, this should be the true number one in the list of all time best movies. Only shades in front of Citizen Kane, but considering the time, it was 1930 when it was made and the subject it deals with, it has to be ranked at the top spot.<br/><br/>Extraordinary cinematography, brilliant directing, very good acting (25 years before there was any ""method acting""), realistic and superb writing!!! Do I have to say more?<br/><br/>Yes!<br/><br/>Take a look at the reviews for ""Saving Private Ryan"": The movie to end all wars. This has not been topped in stupidity by any other living being on this planet. SPR is technically brilliant (several Oscars deserved) but the screenplay was such a bulls***. And even this crap earned an Oscar nomination. Hahahahaha.... Ridicules. Shame on you Hollywood. (But that is another story) I just wanted to make clear, that in comparison to ""All quiet on the western front"", SPR is extremely badly written. Watch this movie and you'll see war movies with another eye. It is so great, that I can't get it into words, sorry. But do yourself a favour: BUY this one. And see for yourself. It is worth ten times the price you'll pay. Believe me. And thank me later.<br/><br/>By the way: This is not the only good war movie. Also ""Das Boot"", ""The deer hunter"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The thin red line"" are, in my opinion, very, very good. But ""All quiet on the western front"" tops them all.<br/><br/>

"Hitchcoc","10","4","7","22 March 2006"," How Appropriate in This Time
","Wars are fought for many reasons. Most of them have to do with money and property. Lives are thrown away, frequently, so someone can have a little more for themselves. We should know from our current situation, how true this is. It's always the soldiers that get stuck in the middle of all this. They heroically go off to war and when they get there, they get to see first hand what it's truly about. The simplistic and romantic that are spewed by those who are not asked to fight become an unrecognizable din. Most of these people in their comfortable offices, their big houses, have no conception of war. Remarque set out to show what World War I was all about. The parades of young men going off to this ugly war with its trenches, bombs, and mustard gas, took enormous casualties. The pontificating professor, telling his students how glorious it is to fight is appalled by the returning young man who has been there and doesn't fall into line with his rhetoric. War is chaos and despair. If you ever saw the first few minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" you wonder how we can do this to each other. I am not an old man, but my father was. He was in World War I. He wasn't in the combat shown here. He was a trumpeter in an Army band. He did carry bodies off people who had died of flu in Brest in France. He mentioned what some of his less fortunate friends went through in that conflict. This is a marvelous film. Soldiers should be honored for everything they do. Somewhere we need to get a handle on our need to wage war. Yes, we must defend ourselves. But ask yourself what you're willing to sacrifice so this doesn't happen. Like a few gallons of gas?<br/><br/>This movie depicts the bleak panorama of combat. The scenes for the time are marvelous and hurtful and hateful. Also, remember, this is from a German perspective which makes it ever more interesting."
"RossRivero99","10","3","5","13 May 2015"," One of the most rousing war films ever made
","Lewis Milestone's adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's "" All Quiet on the Western Front"" was definitely a better film on his military resume than the flawed but still good Pork Chop Hill (1959). The movie is a character study of a young man named Paul Baumer (played by Lew Ayres in an Oscar snubbed performance) who is in college during the start of the film with some classmates of his and a teacher who convinces them to serve in World War I and that ""It is a wonderful thing to die for your country, which is the heroic thing to do"". Then as soon as Paul persuades his friends to enlist and go off to war they begin to realize that killing people isn't as fun as they previously thought to which they go from a pro-war to an anti-war stance. Although I disagree with the film's point of view I think that is a great thing for people to serve their own country, and the great thing about movies is that people can tell a story from a certain perspective. The movie compares to some of the greatest war films of all time for example Platoon (1986), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Patton (1970), The Deer Hunter (1978), and The Hurt Locker (2009). Even though the war films that I just listed take place in different wars that we have been involved in, the thing that made me love the movie a whole lot more was reading the novel because it gave me a better understanding of what the film was about and the emotions of the characters, which is why in the film's case it is great on so many levels even the storytelling, acting, photography, and writing, etc. Also these are reasons why I personally think that the movie should received more Oscars and nominations that it ended up receiving at the 3rd Oscars ceremony."
"Theo Robertson","8","3","5","10 November 2012"," Despite The Dated Aspects It Remains A Great Testament To The Cult Of The Soldier
","This is a film that has seared itself upon the collective memory of the human race. Nearly everything mankind can remember about The Great War 1914-18 is derived from the film version of Erich Maria Remarque's ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT , the brainwashing of a nation's youth in to joining the army , of having no personal animosity towards the enemy etc . This mindset runs deeply and despite continual factual accounts on the reality of the war such as Gordon Corrigan's Mud Blood and Poppycock the idea that the First World War was for nothing and was nothing more than senseless slaughter of young men remains. Let's put it this way - Is there a difference between Germany invading Belguim in 1914 and Nazi Germany invading Poland in 1939 and if so how is it different ? <br/><br/>One can see clearly see the case against war and director Lewis Milestone reinforces the anti war aspect to the hilt . The Germans are just like us so much so that they all speak with American accents and have American mannerisms and by trying to make the Germans identifiable to a Hollywood audience he overstates the case and one can't help thinking that perhaps it would have worked better as a silent film though to be fair to the director this would have meant a silent battle sequence where Paul Baumer and his battalion attack the French lines . Despite being made 82 years ago this battle sequence still remains breath taking <br/><br/>One literary critic argued that the book is not an anti-war novel at all but is instead a celebration of the cult of the soldier . Even if you disagree with this you can see what the critic is saying . In this film version a group of old Germen men violently argue how best to win the war . Later Paul's schoolmaster invites Paul back to class to address the pupils . When Paul gives a lecture that the war is a hell on Earth he is despised for being a traitor . But Paul is the expert on war , none of the civilian characters have been on the front line his views about the horrors of war are the only ones that matter . It's interesting that in 2012 roles are reversed with human beings who are vocally opposed to war are those people who have never actually been in one . ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT can indeed be interpreted as a testament to the soldier"
"McQualude","8","3","5","10 February 2008"," A realistic portrayal of the horrors of war from a soldiers perspective
","My all time favorite war (or anti-war) book. It has been some years since I read the book and there are some details I believe are missing from the movie but that is common enough and certainly doesn't hamper the anti-war message of the film. All Quiet on the Western Front won four Oscars in 1930 and it's no less brilliant or relevant today. In many ways I believe it could be considered the grand-daddy of war movies and many of its elements will be familiar to fans of the genre. Modern war classics such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon have nothing on All Quiet on the Western Front which is a brutal and shocking film despite the lack of explicit gore. The first scenes of trench warfare are as violent and terrifying as the Omaha Beach scene in Saving Private Ryan. Director Lewis Milestone shows us the despair and and the fear that at times overwhelm the soldiers. When new recruit Paul Baumer cries and hides his face in shame during his first bombardment, veteran soldier, Corporal ""Kat"" Katczinsky grabs him and tells him it's happened to better men and it's happened to him (Kat). After returning from their first mission, the chow sergeant won't feed the men until the rest of the company shows up. Upon learning there are no more men, the chow sergeant is angry he cooked for 150 men but only 80 showed up to eat. Hunger is their constant companion and what little food they can scavenge must be protected from gangs of rats that patrol the trenches. Wounded soldiers seem to have little more chance at the hospital than they do on the battlefield.<br/><br/>After being injured and earning a bit of leave, Paul goes home and faces the pro-war sentiment of his town who have no idea of the horror of war. Paul discovers that he is a stranger there, that he can no longer relate to people he's known all his life and it's impossible to explain his experiences to them. So Paul does the only thing he can do, he goes back to the front lines, to the only place where people understand."
"vovazhd","8","3","5","26 January 2008"," Touching antiwar story
","All Quiet on the Western Front is an early antiwar film about World War I. It focuses on the German side of the war, opening with a scene at a schoolhouse where a patriotic teacher enthusiastically tells his students to support the war. The students are converted and join the infantry. Soon after being deployed to the front lines, they realize that war is not as heroic or honorable as they came to expect.<br/><br/>For being such an old film, All Quiet on the Western Front feels surprisingly modern and refined. The battle scenes are excellent, even though there is not all that much time devoted to them. The trench warfare and shell shock was very accurately recreated. It is considered to be one of the most violent films of the period, which is not a surprise. As Paul Baumer (the main soldier the film focuses on) goes around, he witnesses many gruesome deaths. The most touching moment comes when he kills a French soldier. Watching the slow death of the enemy, Baumer realizes that the war is pointless. This signifies a turning point in the film. There are a couple equally touching deaths toward the end, but I best not spoil them.<br/><br/>There were some pacing and continuity problems. Although several parts were slow, the key scenes are well worth sitting through the whole thing for. The ending comes full circle, revisiting some of the important places and people from the beginning. The last scene is simply beautiful.<br/><br/>The film has important antiwar themes and forces you to think about death in a different way. If you enjoy war films or complex situations, and don't mind sitting through older films, then you need to see this one."
"netwallah","10","3","5","5 March 2006"," An anti-epic, one of the first films to undermine romantic notions about war
","Perhaps one could call this the anti-epic, the tale of an ordinary German boy who joined the army in the first heat of idealism, only to watch his friends die, one after the other, for nothing. The professor who preaches honour and glory is a jingoistic fool, and the people at home want the army, underfed and undersupplied with every sort of necessity, to march on to Paris. Through more than two hours of the storylong, but not overlongthe film-makers, faithful to the original novel by Erich Marie Remarque, stress the effort to hold onto whatever it is that makes us human. This is not easy in the midst of a steady rain of death that renders all pre-war notions of sense meaningless and absurd. Disillusionment is epidemic, and in the face of a necessity that makes no sensethe war goes onsomething else emerges. Camaraderie is paramount, the link that binds soldiers together in the face of death. Also the simple things, food, drink, dry clothing, sleep, and the dreamed-of things, home, love, and a coherent worldbut in the grotesque absurdity of trench warfare, such dreams are hopelessly remote, and the war is near. The film is brilliantly acted by a very big cast. The central figure, Paul Bäumer, grows from a sensitive, romantic youth to a seasoned, disillusioned soldier; still, he retains a bit of his core of integrityLew Ayres is wonderful in this part. Over all, the movie produces a sense of painful recognition of waste, just like the great national cemeteries with their miles of crosses and gravestones. The final shot is a montage showing one of these graveyards seen from above, perhaps from the crest of a hill, and superimposed over this is a scene from early in the movie when the young recruits marched off to war in their clean,.new uniforms. As they pass, some of themthe main characters of the story, look back briefly over their shoulders directly into the camera, turn back, and march on toward death. Their faces are young and sober. It is one of the single most affecting shots I have ever seen, and perfectly holds this true masterpiece together."

","After watching this movie, I was amazed that it had every good war character ever made (like the guy in the platoon who can always trade for food or supplies). The first hour of Full Metal Jacket (one of my favorite hours in movie history) is basically cut from this movie and re-shot. I am surprised that the movie was ever released, because the protagonists are German. I think that is why this movie is so horribly under-rated. I think viewers in many decades were reluctant to support a movie about Germans in the First World War. Most of the viewers today probably won't be offended by the German protagonists, so I suspect younger viewers will rank this movie extremely high. Older viewers might have had trouble empathizing with the characters, if they bothered to see the movie at all. Also, the camera work is as good as anything you'll find today. It is hard to believe they used so many different angles and shots back in 1930."
"moviemanMA","10","3","5","15 July 2005"," The First Great War Movie
","Ever since Saving Private Ryan, the genre of war films has been changed for good. They all put war in full perspective, focusing on the special effects like explosions, gun shots, and their results on soldiers. But, some movies just use that to carry the film. For the most part, war has an impact on the mind. ""Shell shock"" and other mental breakdowns are the result of warfare.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front focuses on German Soldiers from recruiting in schools right up to fighting in the trenches. This war is not fought not just on the field of battle but in their heads. With their teachers influencing them to fight the good fight and die for your country, the boys think it is gonna be fun and exciting. Boot camp is a wake up call and they don't like it. They despise their commanding officer and play tricks on him. Soon it is time to go to the front, the Western front. Their they meet other soldiers, much older and war savvy. The battle there is to find food. Constant bombardment from shells by the French force the German's to stay in their trenches and try to wait it out. This could go on for days but for these men, they have no choice.<br/><br/>Through the course of the movie, the men talk about why they are fighting and how nobody knows. Women, good food from home, and the small luxuries they left behind are all tossed aside to fight a war they don't even understand. When the war gets to the men, they make rash choices. Men are dying all around them and all they can do is sit and talk about something else. This piece of anti-war propaganda really does a fine job of illustrating the hardships and harshness of war. The first world war is turned into the first great war movie."

","Technically advanced by the looks of it. The camera swoops above the trenches and below people's knees, unlike the films released before this where the camera was mostly stagnant. The unpolished black and white imagery looks as if I'm looking at actual newsreels of WWI battle. Interesting thing: there's no background music here. It's either silence or the sound of constant bombardment. The acting is fantastic. Perhaps not as natural as it is in today's movies but the important thing is that the performances fit the overall texture of the film. Every soldier is fleshed out. I didn't feel that swell of emotion I was hoping for but there are images that stayed with me long after the sign read THE END. Images like a soldier's disembodied hands hanging from wire, Lew Ayres making a speech to the next generation of soldiers, and him reaching for the butterfly at the end. Brilliant."

I have seen most of the famous war or anti-war movies, but with the exception of ""Paths of Glory"" not one of them ever comes close to this. We see here how young men get coaxed into volunteering to become soldiers by their teacher in school and we live with them in the trenches and one by one we die with them.

"Mr_Hulot","10","4","8","15 September 2002"," Greatest Pacifist Film
","All Quiet on the Western Front is the finest film ever made about war. Germany during World War 2 suppressed it, so powerful a statement it is against the inhumanity of war it is no wonder our leaders fear it.<br/><br/>     The film focuses on the process by which young men are turned into killers for the state.  We see naive boys deceived by a nationalistic sermon on the virtues of self sacrifice and the glory of combat delivered by a loathsome schoolteacher.  They are thoroughly indoctrinated, and the lot of them signs up to fight in the Great War.  Only after basic training begins do they begin to realize the magnitude of what they have set themselves up for.<br/><br/>     There are some of the most stunning and grisly combat scenes ever filmed.  One remembers a soldier hit by a bomb near a barb wire fence, when the smoke clears we see nothing left of him but his hands desperately clutching the barb wire.  Another scene involves a soldier forced to spend the night in a crater with the corpse of a man that he has just killed.  In a fever of madness, he engages the body in an imaginary dialogue, first attempting to justify his action then finally begging the inert object for forgiveness.  The scene is lurid, nearly surrealistic and terrifying.<br/><br/>     The main character of the film is death, and the soldiers slowly getting used to his presence until they are hollowed out and numb.  They come to realize not only the brutality of but also, more importantly, the pointlessness of war.  In one discussion they wonder what they are doing trying to kill the English and the French, considering that none of them have ever known an Englishman or Frenchman.  <br/><br/>     Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket was modeled on this film in both structure and theme, but despite that film's undeniable value, this one remains superior.  At the time of my writing this review George Dumbya Bush is planning to push America into yet another pointless war with Iraq, I wish I could get every American to watch this film, it might just turn popular sentiment against the war and save tens of thousands of lives."

Some of the film was amateurish, and some of the acting excessively hammy. I put much of that down to the style of the day. However, some of it was surprisingly sophisticated.

","That this picture won the Best Film Oscar in 1930 should come as no surprise. I've seen hundreds of pre-1950 movies, and can pretty safely say that most range in quality from abysmal to almost good. You have your exceptions, such as ""Casablanca"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Citizen Kane"", but we're talking about 1930 here. Certainly one of the best war films (or anti-war depending on your view), depicting the utter desperation and futility of life and death on the battlefield. That perspective is driven home time after time as waves of advancing soldiers descend upon German trench positions and the grim brutality of combat death is depicted in all it's horror. The picture deftly juxtaposes the insanity of war against the unbridled passion of academic devotion to the Fatherland, as depicted by Paul Baumer's university professor Kantorek, emotionally whipping his pliable young students into a patriotic frenzy. Baumer's education as a battle hardened soldier is not enough to convince them that honor and glory has it's personal price.<br/><br/>Eighty years' passing may have diminished the film's appeal to present day audiences who thrive on the blood and guts realism of modern films, but the underlying message is timeless.

","This movie is based on the book you read in High School. Yeah... I didn't either. But the film is definitely worth watching. It's hard to believe it was made in 1930 - for several reasons. For one thing, the war itself couldn't have been over for a decade yet when they started making it. That alone is impressive. Furthermore, sound hadn't even been in film for very long, and most war films were more fantasy than reality back then... but not 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. No, this film is a brutally honest portrayal of war. And, despite it's age, seems to ring true today as well. It's a reminder that despite all our technological advances, for the front line infantry, war really hasn't changed much for nearly a century. Some call it an anti-war movie, perhaps it is, but not in the blatant way of, say, Renoir's ""Le Grande Illusion"". Mostly it's just best described as honest."

","While most movies made these days almost automatically take an anti war slant (eg Jarhead) back in the 1930's most war films had a Boys Own feel to them, emphasising only the glory and honour of battle. In it's day then, All Quiet on the Western Front really broke new ground by overtly criticising the pro-war rhetoric that was common on all sides in the First World War. It also shows in grim the detail the appalling conditions the soldiers lived in on the front and the inadequacy of the training the young volunteers received. There are some good scenes showing the soldiers coping as best they can with food shortages. The varied reaction to the soldiers to non stop artillery bombardment is also great , though tough to watch. Even though the famous final scene is familiar even to people who haven't seen the film it still has a great impact. The same goes for the replaying of the young friends first march to the front before the end titles. The scene showing the machine gunners slaughtering the soldiers in a frontal assault is also harrowing as first the French and then the German infantry die in their droves.<br/><br/>To a modern eye some aspects of the film jar slightly, such as the over the top acting (eg Lew Ayers in the main role) and a few melodramatic scenes.<br/><br/>Overrall, though it really is an excellent movie and has stood the test of time."

","The original anti-war film and visualization of the Remarque novel. If this doesn't make you hate war, it is safe to say that nothing will. I watched the remake of '79 before this, and that allows me to draw comparisons(something which the high quality of both films demands). Certain decisions were made in the case of either film being produced; creative calls. Both versions have something that the other doesn't. On the whole, I'd say that this includes more of the most important scenes, apart from two major decisions(in the field of editing and revealing of information... how much the audience is allowed to know and at what point) at the end. Also, one scene close to the end wasn't included in this one, and it proved to be powerful in the later version. The plot is great, and it evolves at an excellent speed. The pacing, in general, works much better than that of the latter film. It's dreary when that works in the context of what's going on, intense when it needs to be and you're never bored. I couldn't take my eyes off the film for a single second. The acting is for the very most part exceptional, though there is some noticeable overacting(almost certainly due to the fact that this was so soon after sound came to movies... the actors simply weren't that accustomed to speaking yet). It hurts the film a little bit, but it's easily ignored. As is the comedic aspect of the film, which is just a tad too dominant and bears evidence of the humor of the time(that of The Three Stooges and the likes), though it does harm the serious tone some(if only slightly). The film is amazing. The effects are incredible. There's no Hollywood in this; no fireball explosions and no heroes. Just realistic effects and real people. The tone is bleak and unpleasant. This comes as close to how real war must feel like as is possible through the film medium(at the very least at the time it was made). The battle scenes are noisy, chaotic and unsettling. The time spent in a bunker is claustrophobic and echoes of uncertainty... what will come next? The writing is fantastic. Though lacking the story-telling crutch of voice-over narration that the later-produced film utilized, the points are made perfectly and the story well-told. The cinematography and editing are practically flawless, and work astoundingly well. The details are magnificent, so much is covered herein. I cannot help but admire the sheer amount of planning that went into this. All in all, I'd rate this a bit higher than the remake... but I urge for anyone watching one to watch the other and decide for themselves. Both are marvelous films, and both have something that the other lacks. As an anti-war film, as a piece of well-rounded film-making, and as an accurate and effective account of war, I consider this the superior of the two. The other has more steady acting and better build-up of some important plot points(the human beauty in the main character, most noticeably). I recommend that anyone who has the chance and who believes that they have the fortitude to sit through such strong and painful films watches both. Not to be missed. 9/10"
"Poseidon-3","Null","2","3","20 October 2006"," Must-see account of the agony and destruction of man against man.
","Every bit as meaningful as it was when it was first released over 75 years ago, this examination of the horrors of war is an eye-opening piece of movie-making for those who are used to the routine, almost-sterile, gung-ho war films that came after it (until a relaxation in censorship began leading to more realistic treatments of military carnage on screen.) Set in WWI Germany, it follows the enlistment, training and wartime experience (and in most cases, eventual death) of a group of young men, egged on to volunteer by their rather fanatical teacher. The bulk of the attention is given to Ayres, in a star-making role, who plays the most thoughtful, even-keeled member of the group. After envisioning all sorts of idealized perks and prestiges associated with becoming soldiers and war heroes, the cold reality sets in soon after the boys enlist. Their former postman is now a stern drill instructor, their personal comfort, including clothing, bedding and meals, matters not one bit to the German army and they are worked over continually in order to turn them into emotionless fighting machines. Once into battle, the men are practically overcome by the inherent hardships and torments of their daily lives. A hardened sergeant (Wolheim) takes some of them under his wing along with his sidekicks, burly Alexander and amusingly discontented Summerville. However, death and injury come swiftly and without warning to many of the recruits. The film is astonishing if for no other reason that it accomplishes so much visually and thematically despite being made in 1930, when sound film was in its infancy and camera movement was stifled by the process of recorded sound having to be put in synch with the pictures. No music score is heard after the opening credits, adding an eerie realism to the proceedings and allowing the endless shells and firepower to provide background noise. (Speaking of backgrounds, there is nearly always something occurring in the backgrounds of the film; passing trucks, marching soldiers, etc... giving the film an urgency that others sometimes lack.) There are many memorable sequences including a claustrophobic stint in a crumbling bunker, a face-to-face killing along with the emotional fall-out from it, a playful diversion of skinny-dipping and romance with a trio of French girls, a pair of decidedly unlucky leather boots and, of course, the unforgettable final minutes. The battle sequences here are startlingly realistic with all the dirt, grime, explosions, gunfire, hand-to-hand combat and graphic injury right there on the screen. The frank approach to sexuality and the carefree handling of semi-nudity will surely be a surprise to viewers used to films from 1934 to the 1950's. It makes one wonder how cinema would have progressed without the shackles of stringent censorship just after the beginning of the sound era. Though he isn't first billed, Ayres is really the leading man of the picture and is an appealing presence. He (and many others in the cast) can't quite shake some of the mannerisms and acting styles that were used in the silent films, but this isn't hard to overlook after a while. Top-billed Wolheim does an excellent job. His performance is as accessible now as it was then. Sadly, he died of cancer not too long after this film was released. Gleason, a beautifully handsome young actor who plays one of Ayres' cohorts had an unfortunate accident in 1945, ending his life. Mercer, who plays Ayres worried mother, was also felled within a few years of the film. Summerville, a lanky actor known more for his comic roles, appeared in the much lesser known sequel ""The Road Back"" in 1937. Once seen, the film's message that war is hell isn't easily shaken. The film benefits from a repeat viewing in order to fully digest the sizable cast of young men and watch their stories unfold."

","This is a great movie. Plain and simple. Sure the sound isn't great but it's 1930, and besides the sound is like a documentary. This captures World War 1 far better than any film about the war. Probably because the director was a veteran, and the film extras were all real German soldiers. Because of those two respects it gives the viewer a greater sense of the anti-war feelings associated with World War 1. You watch as Paul Baumer's friends slowly die off one by one until he's the last one. And when he reaches out for the butterfly at the end and is felled by sniper fire, we are sorry that he is dead. But also relieved that he met a quick and painless death unlike many of his friends. And when he returns home on leave and talks to the old men who know nothing of war or of the situation who practically scold Baumer for correcting them, almost makes the viewer want to shout at the screen to set them straight. But the most heart wrenching sequence was when the camera focused on the boots as he went from taking them from his dead friend, on the march, through combat in the trenches and finally his death. That was beautifully shot. Overall I'd recommend this movie to anyone who can overlook the films age, but I say this to everyone: the age doesn't matter! The message is still fresh and useful."

","Along with this version,I am also going to be reviewing the 1979 remake because I feel both should be talked about.<br/><br/>Well,while I'm sure anything I can add here,will not be anything that hasn't been said already,I'll do my best. In the early days of ""talkies"",the first motion pictures with sound,a lot of film-makers chose the musical (like 1929's ""Braodway Melody"".) They also did comedy,to which a lot of silent comics lost their gravy train. Silent actors too.<br/><br/>""All Quiet On The Western Front"" is not just a great war movie,it's also a great ""anit-war"" movie and for the time a daring and bold choice. So great are the scenes of the young men in the classroom upon graduation day,being given a speech by their mentor. A speech about school being over and their ""duty"" beginning,in terms of joining the German military andfighting against the French ""for their Kaiser"",then ruler of Germany in 1916.<br/><br/>They all go out and join up and one way or another,the war destroys them. Physically or mentally they are either killed in battle or lose their mind and can no longer be the people they once were. The over all message I came away with,is not just the usual ""war is insanity"",I also find the message that one's duty begins with a duty to one's own self and not what others feel it to be.<br/><br/>Had this movie been attempted after the ""censorship reign"" in Hollywood,it most likely would not have been allowed. This movie won Best Picture of 1930 for all the reasons a film should win. A great subject,great story,great acting and a great,first rate drama in the new era of talking pictures. <br/><br/>(END)"
"elsinefilo","Null","2","3","12 July 2006"," When a man stand face to face with death surviving is not an adventure.
","It's not easy to recognize the artistic value of this movie without reading Remarque's original book version first so I suggest you read the book first before seeing the movie.All Quiet on the Western Front is a unique work of art because above all it is not a war movie where you find heroism,bravery or undaunted warfare deeds.This is the story of Paul Bäumer-a young man of nineteen who fights in the German army on the French front in World War I with his classmates Tjaden, Müller,Albert etc...They are actually enlisted in the army voluntarily after listening to the passionate over-patriotic speeches of their teacher, Kantorek. But after experiencing brutal training at the hands of the unassertive,ignorant, and authoritarian Corporal Himmelstoss and the inconceivable brutality of life on the front,Paul and his friends start to question the value of nationalism and patriotism. Thay start to ask how the war started anyway and who the major provoker of this meaningless brutality was?Among the monotony of the artillery fire,the difficulty of finding some decent food,their pushing their luck for fleeing from the inescapable death shows them they are fighting the war for a few persons whom they have never met and most likely never will. They are the only people that can gain anything from this war, not Paul and his friends. The movie displays the brutality of the war not by means of one-to-one combat in the field. The director regularly shows the bombardment fields and how soldiers are trying to flee from their death not they are running to fight.The after-amputation scenes in which soldiers presume that their legs just hurt as if they really had their legs,the difficulty of finding food in the dugouts surrounded by artillery bombardments,the struggle to survive in the trenches depict the cruelties of war and how these soldiers are disconnected from emotions like grief,benignancy,and fear and each being turned into a robotic mechanism who tries to survive under these circumstances.<br/><br/>The bombardment scenes in the movie are purely realistic even by today's standards.To shot such warfare scenes which look realistic even today must require a lot of cinematic skills but the acting is merely melodramatic and gushy at some points like Paul's crying out ""Oh Albert I've come back"". The soldiers who are supposed to be isolated from their humanly emotions are not supposed to display such acting I suppose.It just spoils the perfection of the movie. That's only fault I could see in the movie.One note for those who both read the book and saw the movie: Definitely read the sequel of the book: The Road Back which details the post-bellum life of young men in Germany who have returned from the trenches of World War I and are trying to sort their life out back into the society."

","In the light of what has been going on with war that we see every single day, and I'm referring to the Iraq war, this film is every bit as pertinent to the idea of war as it was in 1930. It pulls no punches, it certainly doesn't glamorize war as many others have, and it strikes the heart very fervently.<br/><br/>This is the downside of any war we may romanticize about. I honestly feel the truth is being told here. Don't expect it to be uplifting-it isn't! It is horrible, as wars usually are, but the public usually gets a glossed over version of what it's really like.<br/><br/>It's a story that needed to be told, and there is no difference what time frame is encapsulated. It's all the same.<br/><br/>I was very disturbed after viewing it, and I would hope that others, including warmongers would get the gist of the powerful message it conveys.<br/><br/>Excellent movie!"

","Having read the book, I caught this film on TV late one night. As other users have commented, it's amazing that this story of men at war was made at a time when the majority of Hollywood's output was designed to transport movie-goers away from grim reality. <br/><br/>It's also remarkable for portraying a recent enemy as a human being rather than a racial stereotype. Despite his German uniform, Paul Baumer could be from any country involved in World War I. His experiences in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" were certainly shared by the soldiers on either side of No Man's Land.<br/><br/>There are other anti-war movies that deal with the attempted de-humanisation of those who are trained to kill and the sheer horror of modern mechanised warfare, but this film is one of the first and there are few that can ever equal it. Perhaps, as other users have said, this is because the people who made it were so deeply affected by the experience of the Great War. <br/><br/>The power of the film could also be due to the power of its source material. Erich Maria Remarque based his book ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" on his experiences of combat in the trenches. The team of screenwriters who transformed the book into a film script did not dishonour it in the process."

","What an amazing film for the period! Even though the movie is at times quite graphic, it is consistent with its message regarding the futility of war and its attempts to uphold the dignity of man. My only criticism relates to the dreadful acting by many of the cast. The poor acting, in my opinion, spoiled much of the interaction between the various characters. Thank goodness people such as Louis Wolheim and Lew Ayres saved the film from relying solely on effects. Clearly, some of the later war epics, such as Deer Hunter, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers have learned from and followed on from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' by similarly attempting to portray the senselessness of war through the medium of cinema."

","Although made over 70 years ago, Lewis Milestone's "" All Quiet on the Western Front"" is the greatest anti-war film of all time. There isn't a single false moment in this entire film.  This is the quintessential film that shows the idiocy of war. War is all about a group of old men sending their youth to die for a cause that has nothing to do with anything. None of these young German soldiers have the foggiest idea why they're being sent to fight and this film captures that  spirit. War sucks and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" conveys that feeling in a way that no war film has captured since. 100 years from now (if man is still alive) this film will still be the greatest anti-war story of all time.

The story is centered around Paul and his 19 year old friends who learn the obstacles they must over come while living among the trenches. Paul and his friends are befriended by Kat, a veteran of the German army who teaches them the ropes and skills needed to stay alive. The battle scenes are incredible even for today's technology especially the brutal machine gun and bombardment bits.

Often the enemy is shown as inhuman evil-incarnate, whose death is not only justifiable but deserved.<br/><br/>All Quiet On the Western Front, however, attempts precisely the opposite. It follows a group of young German students who, with intense pressure from their teacher, enlist to fight in WW1. Never throughout the entire film are their experiences with war glorified or shown in such a way as to somehow justify or rationalize what they're going through and doing. For example, in one powerful scene, they are situated in an underground bunker while they are bombarded with artillery from above. The shot is intentionally long, to show the tension building among the men, with some being shaken to the brink of insanity and others trying to repel the nightmare surrounding them by playing a game of cards. There are many such scenes in the film.. all of them cause us to look at war through the eyes of real people, not fictitious heroes triumphing in completely unreal scenarios.<br/><br/>Yes, it's depressing.

That fact that you could hardly hear what they were saying, that you could see them shaking the sound stage when they were showing the bunker scene.  However, as the movie pressed on, it started to grab hold of me.  Each scene divided from the next by fade outs and fade ins.  The film builds on itself.  Each succeeding scene more intense than the last, building to that memorable finale.  This is a movie that makes one hate war in a deep and passionate way.

","90 years after its release, All Quiet on the Western Front remains a masterpiece as well as a powerful warning against the jingoistic drumbeat to war and vapid nationalism. This film adaptation was released just a year after Erich Maria Remarque's novel achieved critical acclaim, and 10 years after the armistice with The Great War still well within memory of soldier survivors.<br/><br/>It must have been seen as a risk to film in English and release in America a story that was sympathetic toward German soldiers, especially as the Hays Code was adopted (though not yet widely enforced) in the year of this film's release. Its likely that enforcement of the Hays code would have severely impaired this powerful film, as it did many other films over the subsequent three decades. Kudos to Director Lewis Milestone and German-born Producer Carl Laemmle for emphasizing the common humanity that resides in both victor and vanquished.<br/><br/>Even as an early sound picture, Director Lewis Milestone the took full advantage of the new medium to drive home the dangers of war with every whistling mortar shell that pounded the earth.
A particularly powerful performance was turned in by Lous Wolheim, one of the most physically unforgettable actors you will ever encounter on the screen. This would be among his last screen appearances as he died an untimely death the following year.<br/><br/>In short, this is a great move, still relevant, well written, directed, photographed, edited and acted.

"movieman998","8","1","1","1 November 2019"," Review for Film Class
","All Quiet on the Western Front in a 1930 film based on the novel of the same name. Although it was controversial at the time for its pacifist, anti-War themes, even being banned in not only Nazi Germany but countries like Australia, it has overall had a great legacy from a filmmaking standpoint. Let me start with my favorite element of the film: The cinematography. The cinematography is supremely good. The final shot of the butterfly before Paul is shot by an enemy sniper is iconic. The battle scenes are very well filmed and even hold up to this present day, despite the movie being almost 90 years old by now. I found the cinematography to be very engaging in this movie, and it was what sold it to me as a truly great film. I really felt transported to a WW1 era battlefield while watching this film. Another amazing element of this film, in my opinion, is the acting. Lew Aryes is really amazing in this film- so amazing I didn't really get the feeling he was actually acting in this movie. He carried all of his dialogue naturally and the emotional scenes were the strongest. He was one of the main reasons why this movie felt like being transported to a WW1 battlefield. The supporting cast was really great too. Not only in this film artistically important but also historically important as well. The first evidence of history in this movie is World War 1 but also themes of the aftermath, which constituted of the Treaty of Versailles and the failed state that was the Weimar Republic, which led to a resurgence in German nationalism, (and later eventually led to the formation of Adolf Hitler's National Socialist government, more commonly known as the Nazi Party, although this movie was made before Hitler was Fuhrer). Evidence from the film includes characters such as the teacher, Professor Kantorek, who is a proud German nationalist and truly believes in the Fatherland and it's army, and successfully convinces some of his students to join the German army to fight in World War I.The character of the teacher represents initial hope (similar to Germany after WWI) but eventually, when the film depicts the process of war being awful, that hope is transformed into a misery that will seemingly never end. This movie is therefore somewhat representative of the Weimar Republic at the time, seeing as how the economic situation for Germany in the 1920's and early 1930's was so dire. This represents German nationalism at the time which was rising due to how dire not only the economic situation but socially too (the lack of German pride, thanks to the harsh standards of the Treaty of Versailes), eventually resulting in Adolf Hilter's NDSAP (Nazi Party) coming into power, which was not until 3 years after this movie was realeased. The second historical element in this movie is the real life reaction this film spawned. What this means is the decision of the Nazi Party to ban this movie, with them feeling the movie (and novel based upon it) was anti-German and specifically against German nationalism due to its negative depiction of war, something Hitler and the NDSAP viewed as very noble. In the early 1930's, Joseph Goebbels was noted to have personally hated the film so much he would also lead his Brownshirts into theaters and release mice and set off stink bombs to disrupt viewings of the movie. He claimed the movie's (and probably Hollywood's as a whole) Jewish influence promoted anti German values, because the movie was pacifist and anti-War in nature. In 1930, even before the Nazis came to power, the film was banned in Germany and other European countries and was not released again until the 1950's in Germany, and as late as the 1980's in countries like Italy. Overall, this film is a very good movie in terms of quality, and although it is controversial, it does help understand the perspective of European matters between the 2 World Wars."
"zbossvideo","10","1","1","16 July 2019"," The War Movie To Start and End All War Movies
","All war movies should be compared to this movie and this one is better, more intense, and more accurate than most of them. The fact that it came out so close to the end of the war and really shined a light on the horrors of war and how terrible a thing it is for all involved is groundbreaking. It is from the German perspective and although us in America might think the Germans deserved what they got and they don't deserve sympathy it shows a bunch of kids getting killed, injured, or mentally damaged and no one deserves that. The most memorable scenes for me are the first trench warfare attack sequence with a soundtrack of a constant barrage of explosions in the background, people being beat to death with shovels, stabbed, and more and the scene where the young soldier carries the older one on his back and he dies as he's speaking to him. It captures the fact that a lot of people just died and that was it and the war didn't pick or choose who lived and died - bad things happened to good people. Anyway, I've gone on long enough - watch at your earliest convenience for an important history lesson."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>From the abundance of war films created, not too many cover as vast a spectrum of being a soldier from their point of view. The film follows a group of young boys from initial recruitment, to basic training into actual combat, down time, killing the enemy, what happens to wounded soldiers in the hospital, their family and close friend's perspective and it really dives into the psyche of the soldier through authentic scenarios. Overall, the film shows its age but it did stage some serious battles and explosions for 1930. It holds your attention yet can't compete with the modern war films that ooze with deep and riveting emotions. I am aware I just used the ubiquitous riveting descriptor in a movie review. This is an all-time classic so check it out for educational purposes if nothing else."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","4 March 2014"," War as Hell . . .
","We know, first hand, that the First World War was a nasty, ugly and brutal experience. That's true of any war, but this one was different because of the magnitude of new technology. The tank premiered, and made it possible to get across enemy lines into places that soldiers on foot could never go. Most importantly, the motion picture camera, which captured moving images of war for the very first time. It was the first war to have documentation of the actual event and record interviews with survivors who could tell the story of the Hell they endured. All Quiet on the Western Front, like the book,sugarcoats nothing. It charges headlong into battle in an effort to portray a war that was unholy chaos. The soldiers in the film are German but they have American accents. If you took away their uniforms, you'd never know where they hailed from. The movie makes the point that all wars are the same, that war is the same thing over and over and the only thing that changes are the uniforms. <br/><br/>Sixty countries were involved in the First World War and they all suffered under the same delusion: Young naive boys with wonder in their eyes listened to patriotic speeches in which war was presented as a glorious adventure, that doing one's duty was simply a matter of putting on a beautiful uniform and riding into battle on horseback with a saber flashing in the sun. They soon know the reality that the First World War was a contest of endurance. <br/><br/>The film opens in a classroom in Germany where are seated two dozen young men who are being spirited on by a jingoistic teacher who tells pupils ""You are the life of the Fatherland, you boys -- you are the iron men of Germany. You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy when you are called to do so. It is not for me to suggest that any of you should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads."" He concludes boastfully that ""Sweet and fitting it is to die for the Fatherland. Now our country calls. The Fatherland needs leaders. Personal ambition must be thrown aside in the one great sacrifice for our country. Here is a glorious beginning to your lives. The field of honor calls you."" <br/><br/>We meet him twice, once at the beginning and again just before the third act. It becomes uncomfortably clear that this man has never set foot on a battlefield. Then again, no one could have understood the magnitude of this war. Recently, there had been The Boar War and the Spanish American War with its romantic tales of glorious battles on horseback with the saber flashing in the sun. No one understood the impact of 20th century warfare, of tanks and bombs and mustard gas.<br/><br/>The boys have fantasies about the spoils of war and that's mostly what urges them to join the cause. As they march off to the front, as they fight, as they quickly become disillusioned by the horrors of war they begin to die one by one and their number dwindle. At first, our focus isn't on any one particular soldier but as the body count goes up one soldier, a nice kid named Paul (Lew Ayres) comes into focus. He is more thoughtful than those around him and we see that most especially in one bone-chilling scene in which he finds himself alone in a trench with a French soldier (the first Frenchman he's ever seen) that he has stabbed in the chest. Feeding him water to keep him alive he finds that it doesn't work and as the soldier dies Paul asks his forgiveness and promises to send news of his bravery to the man's wife and daughter when he finds their photograph in the his coat.<br/><br/>Paul's growing disdain for the whole mess reaches further than even he can understand. After being wounded he returns home to see his mother and finds that he doesn't fit anymore, that the war has torn something from his soul and that he can't return to his life, therefore that he must return to the battle. During the trip he finds himself back in the classroom where he confronts the professor who inspired his classmates off to war all those years ago. We find the professor again boasting of the glory of battle and the spoils of war to a group of boys who look even younger than Paul and his classmates had been. Urged by the professor to tell the boys about the greatness of fighting for one's country he instead tells them: ""It is dirty and painful to die for your country. When it comes to dying for your country, it is better not to die at all. There are millions out there dying for their country and what good is it?""<br/><br/>What stays with me about All Quiet on the Western Front are the battle scenes. We see the boys lined up at the trenches, firing out into No Man's Land, not especially at anything but just in case. Then the enemy emerges from the gas clouds, maybe a hundred, maybe a million, charging at the trenches, some are shot dead, some make it to the trench. The boys fire their rifles and machine guns and sometimes they hit something but how could anyone be expected to fight them all off, there are just so many of them? How could a survivor sleep at night with those memories? As Eric Remarque put it in the novel: ""We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces"".<br/><br/>**** (of four)"

"AaronCapenBanner","8","1","1","28 October 2013"," Powerful Early War Film.
","Lewis Milestone won an Academy Award (as did the film itself)directing this adaptation of the famous Erich Maria Remarque novel that stars Lew Ayres as young and idealistic Paul Baumer, a student at the beginning of WWI in Germany who is encouraged to enlist by his jingoistic professor, who fills all their heads with the glories of war and victory, but Paul later learns to his shock and regret the realities of war: the death, mutilation, starvation, thirst, and stench that permeate the battlefields and trenches that all these young soldiers inevitably found themselves in, which they were certainly not informed of. Harrowing film with a fine performance by Ayres and indeed the whole cast. Intelligent and poignant, right to the end. Is a bit creaky at times, but still remains one of the finest films of its kind ever made. Contrast early naive Paul with the Paul later on leave, especially when he confronts his old professor in class who had first encouraged him...unforgettable and chilling."
"TheMulderFox","7","1","1","7 July 2013"," Look : A Talkie on the Western Front
","""All Quiet on the Western Front"" deserves every accolade that is thrown in it's direction, no argument from me there. It is impactful, poignant, relevant even to this day and there is no mistaking it's overall message.<br/><br/>I truly wish I could rate this movie higher, and if it was produced only a few years before of after 1930 I likely would have. The film fell right into the middle of the transition between talkies and silent films(there were even parallel versions made for theaters that didn't have sound yet), and this is plainly evident on screen. But should I really hold this against the movie, or rather concentrate on what was achieved in-spite of it? And the achievement was considerable indeed. ""All Quiet..."" stands today as one of the most memorable war movies of all time. The action scenes do a fantastic job of illustrating the near futility of trench warfare. The evolution and growth of the main character of Paul, as played by Lew Ayres, from naive schoolboy to battle hardened soldier is one of the best in cinema history.<br/><br/>Perspective. That is where this movie truly shines. We get to see the war from the perspectives of schoolboys being recruited(almost goaded)into the war effort. The soldiers on the front lines both experienced and fresh out of boot camp. The old men back home arguing over their maps, completely removed from the realities of modern warfare. The families left behind and the civilians caught in the middle of two armies. As I said already there is no mistaken the anti-war message of the film but it is in the presentation of all the various points-of-views and the impact that war has on ordinary people where it shines.<br/><br/>In so the movie manages to rise above the technical issues and natural grow pains that movie makers experienced during this time. The end result being a remarkable experience sure to stay with you long after the film's end."

","I watched this movie for the first time last night. It's amazing that it was made in 1930 but still holds up so well today. One of the best stories I've seen that shows the futility of war and the waste of life and resources is causes.<br/><br/>It's a little weird at first adjusting to the German perspective in WW-1 (especially since it's in English); but this story would have the same poignancy if placed in any nationality or language. Well made for the era (only 12 years after the Actual war) with good performances all around. I recommend it for anyone interested in war films or as a study in film making. <br/><br/>The anti-war message is as relevant as ever and I think this film should be mandatory viewing for all high school students.<br/><br/>-Randawg."
"Steffi_P","8","1","1","8 January 2012"," ""Beautiful to die""
","It seems almost inconceivable today, or indeed any time in the last sixty-odd years, but there was a period between the two world wars when the United States was deeply anti-militarist, both in public opinion and government policy. This was reflected in the movies of the time, a trend which reached its peak with this 1930 adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's novel All Quiet on the Western Front.<br/><br/>An early sound movie, All Quiet on the Western Front features technical feats that, according to some, weren't possible in the first talkies, especially extensive camera movement and outdoor shooting. Director Lewis Milestone it seems couldn't do without having his camera on the go, and All Quiet on the Western Front incidentally contains some of the most graceful examples from his entire career. We open with a crane-shot zooming over a parade of troops and in through a classroom window over the heads of students – a neat and engaging introduction to the movie. There was also a great deal of experimentation with new technology around this point, some of it very effective, such as the juxtaposing of the teacher's voice over the montage of student's imaginings of army life. Milestone's big thing for this movie however is placing the viewer inside the combat, with some dynamic trench-bound point-of-view shots. Importantly, Milestone stages these scenes with a cleverly-orchestrated chaos that eventually makes it nearly impossible to tell one side from the other.<br/><br/>But All Quiet on the Western Front is not without a few flaws common to the era. In particular the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Lew Ayres is horribly overwrought, and yet he is still the best of the lead actors. Some of the supporting players seem a little more realistic, but only because they don't have to emote. It's when people get angry or upset in this movie that all credibility goes out of the window. And some scenes feel rather awkwardly constructed and overlong even when they are fairly short. One example of this is the bit when Ayres comforts a French soldier he has fatally stabbed in a shell hole, which was presumably a moving moment in the novel, but here seems stilted and corny.<br/><br/>Still, the movie's haunting imagery and clear point-making have made it the touchstone anti-war picture down the generations. However, despite its initial critical and commercial success, its popularity would wax and wane along with attitudes to war, and it would be rarely seen in the gung-ho 40s and 50s. The tendency continues to this day. In 1998 All Quiet on the Western Front was #54 on the American Film Institute's ""100 Years 100 Movies"" list. When the list was revised in 2007, post-9/11 and post-Iraq war, it did not appear at all."
"Kubris","9","1","1","12 November 2011"," All Quiet now
","IMDb Top 250: 212<br/><br/>First of all: I saw the silent version on TCM. This threw me off, because I had anticipated a talking film, but once I learned there were several versions I shrugged it off and watched the film.<br/><br/>Remembrance Day (Canadian) is an important day to me, a history fanatic. I believe it's so important to not forget what previous generations have done for us. So All Quiet on the Western Front's message of peace seemed fitting to watch on this special day. <br/><br/>It is important to realize what the world was like when this was made. The Great War had ended only 12 years ago, and WWII had not occurred, and in 1930 it wasn't even really on anyone's horizon. 1929 was the start of the Great Depression, and when this film was made. It was also the time when silent films transitioned into talkies. This film was a big gamble- tough topic, big budget, large cast, and it all paid off.<br/><br/>'All Quiet' is a visual representation of Grade 10 History. Everything I learned about WWI is present in this film: propaganda at home, peer pressure, poor, unexpected conditions, trenches, mud, loss: but this was new to the people of 1930. So while a viewer now won't be so shocked, they would've been 80 years ago. But 'All Quiet' nails the visual aspect of life in the War.<br/><br/>We follow a group of German schoolboys, as they sign up and find out about the horror of war. Through the first half, they are a collective, but eventually the film focuses on Paul. Lew Ayres crafted a character that affected his life. We see a boy become a man, and then the shell of a man.<br/><br/>I found some sections to be a tad over-dramatic, like the hospital scene with the boots. It just went on and on, and it didn't help there was lots of dialogue and few cards of words.<br/><br/>But 'All Quiet' is best, and most heart-wrenching when everyone stops talking and we see battle. The first real fight we see, after days of shelling, is one of the most nauseating fights ever. And for its time, easily the most violent. The massive scale, the incredibly accurate battlefield, the sheer number of men- it's unbelievable. Seeing the machine gunner mowing down people in a single camera shot, seeing a man disappear with only his hands attached to wire- it's downright upsetting and one of the most epic battles ever. No amount of talk can emphasize a message like dramatic reenactments of trench warfare. And then, when the allies jump into the trenches, the guns go away, the bayonets go away- and the shovels come out. I hate to make this comparison, but Saving Private Ryan wouldn't be possible without this film to pave the way.<br/><br/>Some may be turned off by its age, but 'All Quiet' is one of the earliest essential films, and maybe the earliest essential war film. It absolutely deserves its accolades. The message, always relevant, and the ending, always shattering, create an amazing tragic drama that is a very important viewing. 8.5/10"

","This is the one War movie that stands true to what a film about War is.<br/><br/>Plus why no one want it to ever happen in the first place.<br/><br/>It's honest, accurate, and bold.<br/><br/>What made this film so relevant still is how boldly and honestly it depicts that War isn't all patriotic as it's cracked up to be.<br/><br/>That those who're prideful, inconsiderate, tepid, and deceptive would fill the heads of these young, vulnerable, respectable, and dignified men into thinking War is a thing a beauty. Like it's a form of Entertainment. Like its a thing that everyone in your country sees it the same way. That once you apply that you'll wear the finest uniform when you serve and once you return that women would want you.<br/><br/>When War is SO not in anyway like that! It's about sacrificing yourself for the freedom of your country; whether you survive it or not. That you're likely to have your body part or parts of your face shot off in battle. That you could have your leg amputated when you go under surgery from a bad injury. That your likely to develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) when stuck in the trenches for far too long. That food is scarce plus limited and you can go without it for weeks; maybe even longer than expected.<br/><br/>THAT is what War REALLY is like! This film also shows how no one likes to be fighting others in War over something that they only wish they would learn for what reason. It also shows that when you have a bond with a group of friends around you during War, it makes being in it less painful and horrid.<br/><br/>This film also shows how death could happen at any time when you least suspect it.<br/><br/>The first time I watch this movie, I immediately fall in love with it! Since 2008 I've watched this film every Remembrance Day and have NEVER stopped! I HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who like to see a War film about what War truly is and how no one want it."
"barryrd","8","1","1","31 July 2011"," Strong anti-war message in early movie
","All Quiet On the Western Front is an anti-war movie that follows a group of German schoolboys who enlist in World War I without any hint of the dire consequences that lie ahead. They expect to repeat the experience of the previous generation who conquered the French in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. As the war drags on in the disease-plagued trenches of Europe, the youths come face to face with the cruelty of war. Before long, they realize that the bravura of going to war is a total mirage and the war isn't going to be short and sweet. <br/><br/>The story shows the reaction on the German side but the onset of war was received in much the same on the British side with people reacting in a frenzy of false hope for a quick victory over the ""Huns"", only to come face to face with the reality of a lengthy war. This movie is a very sober view of that war, made 12 years after WW I was concluded. It was awarded an Academy Award for best picture and Lew Ayres was named the best actor.<br/><br/>While the dialogue, imagery and acting deliver a strong anti-war message, the script is flat and the movie seems ""staged"". It also shows a great unease among soldiers in battle. The dialogue of the soldiers is unashamedly anti-war. It seems highly unusual that men in battle would allow themselves this luxury with discussions about the merits of war during their timeouts on the battlefield. Can soldiers adopt this mindset and still fight effectively? We even see the leading character, Lew Ayres, nurse and talk to the French soldier he has shot in battle. <br/><br/>While this movie conveys the reasons for not waging war, it doesn't take into account the fact that people in the warring countries of Europe were fired by nationalism and the belief that they were acting in their country's interest. Soldiers have to at least rationalize their mission or turn a blind eye to any doubts they might have.  I have never fought in a land war or any other kind of war so I can only surmise how people might react. I can certainly understand that soldiers would come to hate it and never want to see it repeated. <br/><br/>The movie was well received in its time and shows the revulsion that many people must have had for the war. The anti-war message clearly resonated with audiences"

","Paul (Lew Ayres) is at school when he signs up for war (World War 1). He is German.

The whole class go to the war front where they meet a couple of old-timers including Kat (Louis Wolheim)..... How many do you think survive....? <br/><br/>A group of boys meet a group of war-weary men. The idea of the film is to sympathize with a whole class of schoolchildren as they go to war. Unfortunately, a classroom full is too many to remember so the audience watches and wonders as to who is who. Lew Ayres is the schoolkid ""top dog"" as the camera spends most time on him. Great - I know who Paul is. But who are the rest...? And that is the problem with the film in terms of cast. Louis Wolheim is memorable....but who is that other person....or that other bloke.....or him......<br/><br/>Maybe that's the point.......<br/><br/>The most memorable scene for me is the last image of all the new recruits marching onwards in the yuck conditions and turning around individually to face the camera.

","I only gave this movie a 6 out of 10, but maybe that is because I read the book first.  The movie, while pretty good, does not do the story justice. The book captures the imagination so vividly that any glorifying thought of war is immediately stricken from your memory.  If you do not have the time to read, or just cannot get into a book, at least pick up the movie. Portraying war from a non-American perspective not only gives us a better respect for other cultures, but also a better idea of what war actually does to humans and to society.

"yossalu","10","3","6","5 January 2000"," One of the best movies of all time
","Absolutely amazing.  This film destroys all notions of ""dulce and decorum"" for war.  Remarque's story is devastating, showing boys become men all too soon on the front, only to die at too young an age.  Even worse, he shows the vicious cycle--younger and younger boys are being sent to the front, all with the same illusion that Paul and his friends left with.  Paul tries to find his lost innocence throughout the film, but he can never regain it. He can barely regain anything of what he was before leaving for the war.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front is more adept than most movies in showing the grit and grime of war in one of the most horrific wars of recent history, World War I.  However, despite the fact that the movie is about Germans in WWI, there is something universal to the plight of these soldiers.<br/><br/>
All in all, the film is tragic yet extremely moving.  The film is well made, well acted, and well written.  This is a war film that looked beyond the aura of glory to really get down to the raw realities."

","Lewis Milestone made a close study of Sergei Eisenstein's techniques, and we have a mimeograph of them here, the kind that came off the bottom of the pile where the machine had been running out of ink. This film was a revelation in its day, a real eye-opener. Cinema-goers in 1930 had trouble finding authentic Eisenstein; that's not a problem we have now. This version has genuine value as an historical artefact, but any person born since 1920 would probably be far happier seeing the Richard Thomas / Ernest Borgnine TV remake, which feels far closer to Remarque's Im Westen nichts Neues (Nothing New in the West)."

This film was far too tame to have an impact on me, and I must confess that I found it to be frequently boring as well.

","Lewis Milestone's First World War epic is fondly regarded as a classic, but it may appear stale to viewers not conditioned to the shortcomings of early sound cinema. The battle scenes (shot mostly silent, with sound effects added) are still quite powerful, but the dialogue sequences come across as clumsy and stilted by comparison. The problems of pacing were very much a worry for sound productions in the early 1930s; new techniques of exposition and editing had to be acquired, and the learning process was often slow and painful. Had it been made just two or three years earlier, with judicious cutting and with silent intertitles replacing the labored talking scenes, the film would have been unforgettable."

","In the First World War, a group of students are convinced by their teacher to join the German Army and fight in the war. They witness and participate with the worst that a war means: deaths, wounds, starvation, stupidity, brutality. This excellent movie is amazing: the realism and cruelty of the scenes are remarkable. It almost looks like a documentary. And it was shot in 1930, where the resources were very few when comparing with the special effects of the present days. The message of this masterpiece, although not learnt by most of the governors of our planet, is very deep and touching. Strongly recommended for all audiences.

"Anonymous_Maxine","8","2","4","24 February 2008"," ""Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.""
","The irony of this quote (""Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland) is what All Quiet on the Western Front is all about. The movie paints a very clear, even blindly obvious, picture of the difference between the young recruit's expectation of battlefield glory and the battle weary veteran's knowledge of the bloody reality of war. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie suggests a military atmosphere that will stifle everything else in American daily life, as a military marching bands trudges past, drowning out the words of a lecturer in a classroom, but then changes directions when we realize that that professor is spouting militaristic propaganda at his young male students, vehemently urging them to join up and fight for their country. By the end of his speech, modern audiences might be astonished at the naked lies about battle, but the young men are cheering by the end and desperate to enlist.<br/><br/>There is, of course, massive difference between the audiences that first saw the film in April 1930 and today's audiences, and the thematic elements make this abundantly clear. Remember that this movie, one of our first Best Picture winners, was made for an audience most of whom had never seen moving images of war, and had no idea what life was really like on the battlefield. Because of that, the movie lacks in realism, although mostly only in the behavior and dialogue of the men. The actual battle scenes are startlingly realistic.<br/><br/>The men remind me of reading old Hardy Boys books, which contain dialogue which can't possibly be at all realistic. Some of the dialogue here in this movie is funny because it is so different from how people would speak today (""You are the gay heroes that will repulse the enemy when called upon to do so!""), but mostly it is simply the ham-handed delivery of the thematic elements that gets a little tiring (""You're just a man, like me, and I killed you! We only wanted to live, you and I. If we didn't have these guns and these uniforms, we could be brothers!"").<br/><br/>Needless to say, the men quickly realize that they are not running off to the glorious battle. As with any war, when they left home, they were leaving to fight for their country. But when they arrived at their destination they find that they're not fighting for their country at all, they're fighting for their lives. <br/><br/>My historical knowledge of World War I is pretty limited, so I was a little confused at one scene where four American soldiers are bathing in the river, and soon notice three attractive French women casually strolling past the river. Initially I thought that they were just camping near a small village, apparently oblivious to the war, until the men managed to seduce the women using some soggy bread that had been soaked in the dirty river water, suddenly revealing that these smiling young women are virtually starving. The plight of the French civilians is hardly portrayed well.<br/><br/>One soldier goes home on temporary leave, and the movie also gets his battle remorse totally wrong. When he sees his family, he mumbles and trudges past, indifferent to see his loved ones again. It is as though he has lost his job, not returned after months and months and months at war. Soon he is at a table talking to some of the old politicians pulling the strings of the war, who accuse him of not knowing a thing about it when he tells them that the war isn't what they think it is. <br/><br/>To say that this is an anti-war film is certainly an understatement. In fact, the film ends on a decidedly unpatriotic note. A soldier speaks in the same classroom he used to go to, telling the eager young men about the reality of war. ""It's dirty and painful to die for your country, And what good is it? Death is stronger than duty to one's country.""<br/><br/>He then returns to the front, which now feels more like home to him than his home. The film has a great, meaningful ending, as well. It is as anti-climactic as you can imagine, but has a deep and resonating meaning. <br/><br/>The movie has not dated well, but being one of America's earliest war films, it is certainly successful."

","This movie shows war as it should be shown. Devastating. The young boys shown in battle act as young boys would who are being shot at and bombed. There are no snappy clichés and no macho banter making one think war is glory and soldiers are all great pals. These guys, while being friends from one town, are just trying to survive. Yes, they care for each other but not in the John Wayne, John Agar way. They are tough only because they have to be, not because they want to be, and, are made that way due to their circumstances. Initially they are ""wet behind the ears"" and fear bombs falling from a mile away. This is a great movie and every young person should watch it for balance. War should be banned from this planet forever. This movie will show you why. 5 stars out of 5."

","This film is everything that most of the reviewers have said...and then some. I believe it to be among the greatest war films ever made. Don't be fooled, this is not a war movie, but an anti-war movie. It's about the destruction of both life and innocence, the magnificence and futility of war. In the next war, Gen. George S. Patton, US Army was quoted as saying, ""Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavor pale to insignificance"". And he was right - man pours more time, effort and money into war than any other pursuit. When the soldiers on both sides of World War I marched off to war, some even called it ""a lovely little war"". When it stalled into a stalemate that resulted in the slaughter of millions of people, it was no longer lovely. This film follows some German soldiers through from enlistment till the end. There is a great deal of emotion in this film and it comes through to the viewer. There was a fine remake of this film starring Richard Thomas and Ernest Borgnine, but it pales next to this one. This is truly one of the epic best films of all time. Watch this one, then the remake. Both are good."

","Some films during the golden age of Hollywood tended to romanticize things wether it be love, the West, the old south or war. But not this film. It's amazing what the filmmakers were able to get away with in All Quiet on the Western Front.<br/><br/>This film, despite being made in 1930, has no rose tinted glasses. No lines like, ""well we lost a lot of fine young men but it was worth it"". Young German teenagers enlist to fight in WW1 because their teacher told them that they need to defend their country and prove their bravery. Guess what? It's hell. Lewis Milestone's Masterpiece is possibly the most harrowing and realistic portrayal of war ever filmed. Blind nationalism and dreams of glory are the last things in the minds of these soldiers after their first battle. I can't imagine seeing this in theaters when it was first released. It had to feel like a punch in the gut. Western Front doesn't care about heroism. It cares about people and peace. It doesn't matter if it's Germans or French. These characters were living peaceful lives. Not all will return.<br/><br/>The movie was made during the beginning of the Sound era. A lot of early sound movies haven't aged well. The dialogue and camera are stilted and uninteresting lots of the times. It was still a new technology and people were trying to figure it out. However, Western Front is still very watchable today. Not only is it's message timeless, but it is so different and leagues ahead of its contemporaries that I'm amazed it's not talked about more often. Young Lew Ayers is brilliant as the lead character of Paul. His development as a young idealistic teen into a jaded and emotionally spent adult is so sad but brilliantly portrayed. It's shot so well too. For an early 30s film the cinematography seemed way ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Now it's not a happy film. At all!!! I'm glad it was made when it was before the Hayes Code was strictly enforced. It would have been an incredibly different movie and I can't imagine it being any different. The 1979 remake isn't bad, but it's power is far more muted then the original. I can't praise it enough. It's one of the best movies ever made."
"gab-14712","9","0","0","13 May 2020"," A Movie Ahead of Its Time!
","Upon completion of All Quiet on the Western Front, I had a myriad of thoughts flashing through my brain. The thought on the top of my head was, ""how on earth was this film made in 1930?"" It is a film that is way ahead of its time, cinematically and thematically. The film is clearly an anti-war film that discusses the horrors of World War I, which only ended about a decade before. This is a powerful, thoughtful movie and its one that is relevant some ninety years later. This is one of the first war films in the sound era, and it really revolutionized how war films were made. Steven Spielberg later credited this film for his 1998 picture Saving Private Ryan, which is often heralded as one of the genre's best.<br/><br/>Lewis Milestone's film is based off the controversial book written by Erich Maria Remarque. The book, which details the horror of war, was banned in many countries because of its anti-war message. The book and film were banned in Nazi Germany because the Nazis thought Germany was put into a bad light and of course, the Nazis considered themselves a proud, nationalistic political group. Regardless, the message of the movie is correct. War is a horrible thing. World War I was a total war that was a slog for many European nations. Trench warfare was a grueling nature. Being stuck in the trenches, with no food and consistently under enemy fire, often took its toll. Through the eyes of the main character, we see that there is no glory to be found under war.<br/><br/>The one unique thing about the film, and still is amongst today's war films, is that we see the point-of-view from the other side. We see what unfolds from the eyes of Germany's new recruits, and keep in mind that this is an American film. I really liked that technique, but it almost backfired. The soldiers hardly seemed German. I could pass them off as American or British. Because the performances were masterful, the direction was excellent, and the message was clear- it does not really matter. It did take me some time to get used to it.<br/><br/>The film follows a group of schoolboys who are talked into joining the German Army during the first World War by their war-loving teacher. Their teacher hammered home the point of heroism and lessons of humility to be taught during the war. War means glory! The German recruits, led by Paul (Lew Ayres), quickly find out that this is not the case at all. Death, pain, and suffering are all around them. Surviving this brutal war will be a hard task. If not being shot or stabbed, they may starve to death. There is a scene where Paul tries to save a French soldier in a shell crater. A very harrowing and emotional scene that details the consequences of this war.<br/><br/>Lew Ayres gave a powerful, heartbreaking, and unforgettable performance in his role as Paul. He became a star after this performance and this role actually turned Ayres into a pacifist. His speech at the end made my eyes well up in tears. Trying to tell a bunch of kids, who want the path of glory all to themselves, is something no man nor woman would want to do. I also liked the performance of Louis Wolheim. Wolheim was noticeable for his brutish looks and his career took advantage of that. Here, he plays a mentor to Paul and he did a great job. He definitely deserves more recognition.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why I questioned if this film was actually released in 1930 (and yes, I know it was) was the look and the depiction of war in the movie. There may be no actual big battle sequences (outside of a few shots), but we see the mortars and the shells exploding at a rapid pace. We see how easy it is to be killed under the line of fire. That scene in the crater provides a great example. Arthur Edeson did an amazing job showing the terror of war.<br/><br/>If you like war films or films that are against worldly violence, I recommend All Quiet on the Western Front. It is a movie that will be relentless towards your emotions, so be forewarned. The film shows how ugly war is and also how the average person is lied to in order to join the military. There is no glory or fame. Just suffering and death. It is easy to see why the film was banned around the world, because it was sandwiched in the two World Wars. Each country depended on their citizens to fight these wars for them. But it ain't pretty.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"

","This movie needs to viewed by everyone in the world due to the impact it has by showing war in the grizzly non-romantic way that it needs to be shown.

","The first silent film I ever watched was Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush, as part of a film class in college. I thought it worked well as an introduction to silent film, and as a way to convince steadfast casual viewers that very old movies can have just as much impact as anything today.<br/><br/>Then I saw All Quiet on the Western Front.<br/><br/>This is the film to show to people who refuse to touch anything made before 1985. It's not a movie to passively appreciate like so many other influential silent films, it's a movie that grabs you by the collar and forces you to stare at unthinkable tragedy. All Quiet on the Western Front is a war film as viscerally and emotionally powerful as any ever made.<br/><br/>What impresses me most about All Quiet on the Western Front is its complete confidence. We may think of silent cinema as simplistic, juvenile even. Maybe it was more of a realm where filmmakers had to find their footing rather than show off their skill. And yet, as a piece of storytelling and as moving pictures, All Quiet on the Western Front is extremely assured. It has the David Lean-ian breadth of scope, the Spielberg-ian iconography (a masterful sequence follows a pair of boots' point of view through the war), and the kind of filmmaking craft that doesn't even seem possible from a movie made in 1929.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front gives proper credit to the colossal bravery of WWI's soldiers, but it is emphatically anti-war. The miraculous thing about the film is that it earns every bit of its lofty message. Nowhere is that message better visualized than in the film's final images, of a butterfly, and of innocent faces that look directly at us, silently pleading to make it stop. Those final seconds, and the film as a whole is a burning reminder of the tragedy of war. If you only see one silent film in your life, this is the one.<br/><br/>95/100"
"trevorwomble","9","0","0","9 December 2019"," After nearly 90 years this film still packs a punch
","An amazing early sound film, this filmic translation of the classic novel really is an incredible effort. Whilst most dramatic films gradually lose their sting over time, this was so well made that as it hurtles towards a century old it remains powerful on every level and the only film I can think to compare it with in holding its own both dramatically and visually as a representation of the futility of war is Kubricks 'Paths's of Glory' from 1958.<br/><br/>Many early sound films struggled to cope with 'natural' dialogue as writers found it hard to make people talk convincingly real. Whilst 'All Quiet' occasionally lapses into melancholy and wooden delivery, for the most part it works extremely well. The lead character of Paul Baumer (played by Lew Ayres) does a fantastic job going from optimistic and eager youth to battle hardened cynic on the edge of a breakdown after seeing things no 18 year old should see.<br/><br/>Despite the technical limitations of sound filming of the time, director Lewis Milestone does an admirable job in keeping this film both visually and narratively interesting. Fluid camera movement, interesting camera placement, realistic film sets and great editing all add to the appeal of this classic anti-war film. Another reason this film has stood the test of time so well is that it was made prior to the Hays code, so it didn't need to sanitize the story to appease the censors (well, not originally anyway). Yes the film suffered butchery in the editing suite upon later rereleases but fortunately the original uncut version survives thanks to extensive restoration by Milestone and Universal Pictures back in 1980, as Milestone wanted the film to be viewed in it's original form before he died.<br/><br/>Another reason to marvel at this film is just how well it catches the savagery and pointless bloodshed of WW1. Whilst many have remarked upon the moving battle at the start of more recent war films like 'Saving Private Ryan' , Peckinpahs 'Cross of Iron' and Samuel Fullers 'Big Red One', here we have the granddaddy of graphic warfare. We see people blown up by mortars, Baumer stuck overnight in a trench with a French soldier he has just knifed to death, people losing limbs, people suffering shell shock, the filthy squalor of life in the trenches, food shortages and Baumer watching as his friends all either die violent deaths or are permanently maimed, leaving him a veteran at just 19 but with the optimism knocked out of him and replaced by dark cynicism and the patriotism sucked out of him.<br/><br/>With an ending that will break your heart as he mentally struggles to cope with how his world has been turned upside down in just a year, this is an extraordinary achievement. It is also surprisingly adult for it's time , and whilst it may look tame in comparison to movies made fifty years later, you have to remember that audiences were not used to seeing the horrors of modern warfare depicted in quite so much detail prior to this, and for many years after too (thanks to the Hays code). So strong was the anti war message that it was banned in Nazi Germany, in France (for its humanising of the Germans) and severely edited in the US for a rerelease in the mid 1930s.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best war related films ever made and one of the most powerful to come out of pre WW2 Hollywood. An absolute must watch!"

"leftistcritic","10","0","0","8 March 2019"," A strong antiwar film for the ages
","Last night and this morning I watched this 2 hour and 16 minute film in its entirety. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie, but it is undoubtedly somber, a criticism not only of the horrors of war but also of the uber-patriotism/jingoism that leads men to die for a cause they don't even believe in. In 1914, these young German men go from the classroom, where their professor (played by Arnold Lucy) encourages them to enlist for the ""good of their country"" to the training camp, and then to the battlefield of World War I. They are not automatons however, but are angry at their treatment by the officer training them so they take him and put him in the mud on the night before they are set to go out to the front. They arrive there utterly naive, thinking it will be a licking, but soon realize and live the horrors of war, as these men decline rapidly to a smaller amount as the war continues onward, with them hunkering in their trenches.<br/><br/>Most of the movie takes place on the battlefield, mirroring in some ways Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line (1999), which focuses on World War II, or Paths of Glory (1957), which focuses on World War I, with Kirk Douglas playing a starring role, the slight antiwar themes in Hacksaw Ridge (2016), or those of the absurdist film on the WWII-era, Catch-22 (1970). As for this film, it e depicts charge after charge by the soldiers against the enemy as artillery blasts surround them, killing people right and left whom are not killed by enemy machine guns. All in all, it is an utter slaughter, making you think: is this really worth anything? What are they really fighting for? In one of the film's pivotal scenes, the soldiers discuss who and what the war is all about, not coming to a conclusion about why it happens, with one saying that the generals of both sides should fight each other in their underpants, making it an utter absurdity. At another, a soldier asks why he stabbed another French soldier who was ""no different than I,"" another young man supposedly trying to fight for ""his country."" Clearly nothing is sacred, not even a cemetery, where the German soldiers fight ""the enemy.""<br/><br/>Perhaps to indicate the brotherhood of the male soldiers and to make this antiwar drama more effective, women are rarely mentioned at all, as it is seen as an ""all-male affair."" In an absurd scene, the soldiers swim across the river to visit a group of presumably French women, talking with them and such, but that is all, as they quickly leave. They show that even with the war, their chauvinism and need to be appreciated by women has not abated. At the same time, the movie shows the horror of war is not confined to the battlefields or trenches but to the hospital where many people languish until they die, saying that they are brought to the ""dying room"" (as one soldier calls it)/""bandaging room"" (as the doctors and nurses call it) and never come back. One of the men, Paul Bäumer (played by Lew Ayres) goes home on furlough, visiting his sister (played by Marion Clayton) and mother (played by Beryl Mercer), realizing that people do not know the real state of war. The telling moment is when Paul speaks before the class of the professor whom had pressured him to go to war, telling the reality of the situation and the horrors of war, where he has been for 4 years (indicating it is 1918), as many of his fellow soldiers have died, with the young students calling him a ""coward.""<br/><br/>Feeling disillusioned, he goes back to the front, to stay there for four more days until his time is over, with the 2nd Company, he was part of, being extremely under-staffed as most have been killed. He soon finds Stanislaus Katczinsky/""Kat,"" as they talk about how people do not recognize the futility of the war, while Kat gets injured by a bomb dropped by an aircraft. But he is later is killed by a second explosion! As the film ends, Paul reaches out, only to be killed by an enemy sniper, with the find shot showing the company marching to the front for the first time, along with a shot of the cemetery. The latter indicates the lasting horror of war, which only leads to death and destruction. This film is more than ""greatest anti-war statement every created"" or a ""sincere, emotional film,"" to take from reviews by bkoganbing and kian_ef, but this rather a film that makes a strong statement against the institution of war, perhaps more than any other film created, being realistic about what happened rather than sugarcoating it like Peter Jackson did in his 2018 documentary, They Shall Not Grow Old. With that, my review of this film comes to its conclusion."

","ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Universal, 1930), directed by Lewis Milestone, often classified as an anti-war film, is best summed up by this opening inter-title: ""This story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war ..."" Taken out of context from Erich Maria Remarque's powerful 1928 novel resulting into a prestigious screen adaptation to win an Academy Award as the year's Best Picture. While few films from 1930 stand the test of time, this one definitely does.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, it's not a western but a drama set during the Great War (World War I) from the German's point of view. The story opens in a German village with a big parade of soldiers marching down the street; Himmelstoss (John Wray), a kindly postman delivering his last letters before going off to war; and students inside a classroom listening attentively to Kemmerick (Arnold Lucy), their schoolmaster, dictating to them to become ""iron men of Germany"" by going to war to ""save the fatherland."" The youths, headed by Paul Baumer (Lew Ayres) make arrangements to enlist. Once in training camp, they encounter their friend Himmelstoss now the most brutal sergeant making high demands on their services. After going through the basics, Paul and company soon meet Katchinsky (Louis Wolheim), an tough old Army veteran whom the boys look up to as their father figure. After Katchinsky teaches them the basics of day by day survival of dropping to the ground during bombardment, the real test comes for Paul and friends, consisting of Franz Kemmerick (Ben Alexander), Albert Kropp (William Bakewell), Muller (Russell Gleason), to witness full hand the harsh realities of war during their endless days on the battlefield and the trenches. Upon military leave, Paul's venture home finds him witnessing dramatic changes. Before returning to camp, he visits the classroom where and some of his now deceased friends once sat to tell Kemmerick's pupils the real meaning of combat: ""We fight, we try not to be killed, sometimes we are."" With these words, to his dismay, Paul's labeled a ""coward.""<br/><br/>For anyone unfamiliar with the principal cast, it's understandable since it lacks top- names in its assortment of performers. Feature billing goes to Louis Wolheim, a character actor dating back to the silent screen era. A familiar face in 1930, Wolheim's career was cut short in 1931 when he succumbed to cancer. His role, basically a supporting one, is good enough for an Academy Award nomination. The real lead goes to the second billed baby face Lew (billed Lewis) Ayres, in his first major role. Best known as the title character in MGM's ""Doctor Kildare"" movie series (1938-1942), his career lasted for several decades. Slim Summerville, who originated in silent comedies, provides some general humor as Tjaden, reciting this classic line, ""Me and the Kaiser, we are both fighting with only one difference, the Kaiser isn't here.""<br/><br/>For anyone unfamiliar with Lewis Milestone, he won an Academy Award as Best Director for the most vivid war drama since King Vidor's THE BIG PARADE (MGM, 1925) starring John Gilbert. Of his many motion pictures from the director's chair, many claim this to be his masterpiece. For an American made production, it's very much European influenced through its visual style and camera techniques of tracking over dugouts and war zones covering every angle and movement, a style reminiscent to stylish American silents of the 1920s. Once seen, it's hard to forget such intense scenes as a soldier's screams (""My eyes! I'm blind!""); disembodied hanging hands on barbed wire; Paul's apologetic manner towards the deceased Gerald Duval (Raymond Griffith - in a mute performance), a French soldier he killed in the dugout; a long shot view of a one-legged soldier on crutches, along with lighter moments as four soldiers (Paul included) skinny dipping while bathing in the river to be spotted by three observant French girls. The scene that gets me every time is one where Paul reaches out for the butterfly. Only drawback is Paul unconvincingly telling himself after his mother (Beryl Mercer) leaves his room, ""Why can't I put my head on your lap and cry?""<br/><br/>When sold to commercial television in the late 1950s , all prints to ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT were taken from the 1939 reissue, giving Ayres star billing over Wolheim's, the Academy Award statue inserted in the opening credits, and underscoring in place over film's original scoreless finish of youthful soldiers looking back as they go marching, quietly, all quiet on the western front. Initially released close to 140 minutes, reissue prints were cut to 104. Later restored by the Library of Congress, the close to accurate version was then distributed to home video in 1987 and DVD years later. Cable television presentations consisted of American Movie Classics (1992-2004) and Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere April 2, 2002). Remade in 1979 as a made-for-television movie starring Richard Thomas, it's the original that continues to have a solid impact, even today. The long overdue/ forgotten sequel, THE ROAD BACK (Universal, 1937), directed by James Whale, with Slim Summerville reprising his role of Tjaden, is one worthy of rediscovery some day.<br/><br/>So popular was Remarque's novel that it was reportedly translated into 25 different languages. The book was also required reading in high school. As for this edition, an artistic achievement by Universal standards, it should be worthy study for film school scholars. (**** helmets)"

When Lew Ayres settles down late in the film, stops mugging, and speaks calmly, he's much more appealing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the direction and camera work are very good throughout, especially in the outdoor scenes. The ruined villages behind the lines are convincing, the front itself is a horror: flat, cratered, featureless, never more dreadful than when the bright sun glares down on it. The attack scenes, which skillfully employ only modest numbers of extras, are as vivid and unnerving as anything done since, especially the explosions. Once or twice they detonate in a vicious line across the advancing troops, driving them back. The use of sound during the bombardments is surprisingly good by any standards, not just those of 1930. All in all, the battle scenes lose nothing by comparison with those in Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Even when the guns are not firing, there are scenes that work in spite of the problems with the old-fashioned acting. In one, three soldiers bed down three French farm girls in a scene that is as gracefully suggestive as the standards of the day would allow. Better is an interlude late in the film, when Lew Ayres, home on leave, finds the old life utterly alien after his horrific experiences at the front, his family unable to comprehend anything about the world he lives in. This sets up the famous ending, in which he is shot while reaching from the trench to touch a butterfly. In the blasted moonscape that is now his real home, a butterfly is too much of a miracle to resist."

","040.1: All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) - released 4/21/1930.<br/><br/>DOUG: We watched this film as part of our exhaustive War Movie Odyssey two years ago, and it was definitely one of my favorite movies in the set, not to mention one of the all-time best movies about WWI. It shows the war from the German point of view, but I got the feeling they could have done practically the same movie from the point of view of nearly any nation in the war. The themes are pretty universal for what happened; the needless massacres, the officers who had no idea how to handle an army, the soldiers asking ""why is this war happening?"" The movie is made up of nothing but memorable scenes; the scene where the soldiers get back at their drunken CO for spoiling their leave; the scene where a fellow soldier realizes that his leg has been amputated; the scene where Paul spends the night in a foxhole with an enemy soldier he has killed; the scene where Paul enters the class of students, just like the one he was in years ago, and tells them all how war really is. War movies of the day were clearly about how war was pointless as that was the feeling about WWI (or, as it was called then, The Great War); this would change when WWII came along, when the word would be that the war was necessary, and worth fighting.<br/><br/>KEVIN: We watched this film years ago to kick off our massive war movie odyssey, and there were no other films throughout that list that equaled this one in anti-war sentiment. Most war movies are anti-war on some level, but All Quiet spends every frame of its 130-minute running time driving home its point. I remember so many scenes in this film. The scene when Paul and his friends are listening to their teacher go on about the honor and patriotism of going to war and fighting for their country, and the scene later when he returns to the same classroom after his disillusionment to find that his old teacher is telling the same bull story to a new flock of prospective corpses. The scene when Paul finds himself in the hospital bed being wheeled through the door of no return. And of course there's the unforgettable scene when Paul winds up in a shell hole with a dying enemy soldier. I remember the battle scenes were gritty and graphic to a degree that we would not see again until Saving Private Ryan, the way the camera tracks viciously across the trenches as the enemy forces advance. One of the interesting things is that the fact that the characters are German is incidental, as the conditions and the despair were nearly identical on all sides of the conflict. Had we watched it again, it would have been the first film depicting World War I on the list (after the more uplifting The Big Parade), and it would have been almost unnecessary to watch any others, simply in the way that this film captures in every way the disillusionment the world saw during that war, brought to life from the point of view of a few scared youths facing horrors no one before them had ever experienced.<br/><br/>Last film chronologically: The Divorcée (1930). Next film chronologically: Hell's Angels (1930)."

","When I was waiting in line at my local 7-11 the other day, I mentally made a list of the so-called ""great war movies.""  Such prominent names as Apocalypse Now, Patton, and Blackhawk Down passed through my mind, but I couldn't decide.  Many directors have tried war films, Wolfgang Petersen was phenomenal with Das Boot, but has fallen into a Hollywood money pit.  Ridley Scott barely avoided the claws of Jerry Bruckheimer.  Oliver Stone hasn't changed in 20 years, but he served before making his attempt, I will give him credit for that.  Stanley Kubrick wants to understand, but his war films never excelled as to the purpose, Paths of Glory came closest compared to his narrative failure of Full Metal Jacket.  Then I remembered Lewis Milestone...my first experience with Milestone's work came when I was 11 with Pork Chop Hill.  That movie changed every way I look at war along with A Bridge Too Far.  <br/><br/>Before Kubrick, Kurosawa, and even Hitchcock got off the ground, Milestone holds my honor as being the original cinematic genius.  All Quiet on the Western Front is everything that Terrence Malick wanted to do in The Thin Red Line.  Malick must not have seen this because he just tries elaborating on it.  He failed because he doesn't understand the audience anymore than the topic.  <br/><br/>AQWF presents an image of the novel that defines everything in a war movie. Many films like Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, and Windtalkers have tried to repeat the same message, none as successful.<br/><br/>""Rejoice o young man in thy youth.""  That phrase from the beginning of Platoon sums up the movie as the German boys leave school for enlistment.  I find it interesting in the first few minutes how Milestone enters the thoughts of each student in all their delusions.  That is genius.<br/><br/>Even stronger is how Milestone manipulates the camera during the war.  The synchronizing of the machine guns to waves of Frenchmen getting riddled resembles the bunker shots of 'Private Ryan.  Spielberg and Kaminiski obviously studied this many times before filming their epic.  The camera is all about movement at war, perhaps to emphasize the fact that the soldiers can't go anywhere but die.<br/><br/>The subtle signs of power and intelligence on Milestone's part are sprinkled throughout, from the slowly dying Frenchman in the shell crater to the butterfly ending.  This is a hallmark of filmmaking that will never be equaled.  The camera, the ear, the cast, the editing...everything is perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, the greatest war movie ever made.  Period.  5 out of 5 stars."

","No remake can quite capture the gritty reality brought to the original motion picture through the early, ""faster"" film and less speedy camera shutter.  Black-and-white is so much more horrific and bloody than color filming.  War is death, mud and darkness.  Violent death and waste are conveyed via acting, not spread around the set by prop managers or special FX. Reading Remarque's book adds insights that are not onscreen, and should be an essential follow-up to viewing the film. I agree with the earlier comment: ""...

"jboothmillard","8","2","6","23 March 2011"," All Quiet on the Western Front
","This was a war movie I had heard the title of several times, and the first sound one to win the big prize at the Academy Awards, so I was certainly keen, from Oscar winning director Lewis Milestone (Ocean's Eleven). Basically a group of German schoolboys have been talked into joining the army, enlisting just at the start of World War I, and we follow all these young men as they enter, train and fight through it all. For a while it is mainly a multi stranded story with no main character to focus on, but this changes after all the men witnessing mutilation and death, and concerns about the rights and wrong of the conflict and the enemy themselves. The main protagonist appears as Paul Bäumer (Lew Ayres) who survived it all, and the biggest guilt he feels is when he mortally wounds a French soldier, and he uses the body to hide himself. In the end he longs to go home unsure that he is really on the right side or whatever, and the final scene with him in the trench is poignant for him spotting a butterfly which he would like to collect, and the last image is his hand dropping to the ground. Also starring Louis Wolheim as Kat Katczinsky, John Wray as Himmelstoss, Raymond Griffith as Gérard Duval, Slim Summerville as Tjaden, Russell Gleason as Müller, William Bakewell as Albert Kropp, Scott Kolk as Leer and Ben Alexander as Franz Kemmerich. Besides the memorable butterfly moment, there are many others that make quite an impact, the battle sequences are of course among them, it is unusual to see Germans speaking with American accents, but it is also clever because you can almost empathise and feel sorry for them, despite the fact you know they are the enemy and will lose, a most worthwhile classic first world war drama. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Writing. It was number 54 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!"

","There is not much more to say about how good this film is--everybody agrees that it is the classic anti-war film, the movie that you will most likely copy if you decide to go into the genre. I found it simply heartbreaking, and not just because the movie so accurately and compassionately portrays the terrors of war. What this film also does very well is portray the myth of heroism, which along with modern weaponry was so clearly instrumental in producing the mass slaughter of the Great War. It is completely believable that these boys were talked into thinking that they were fighting for a just and noble cause, and that they would be back soon with few losses. One kid after another has this myth shattered, and the scenes where they come to grips with it--that they are going to die, that their leg is gone, that they have been profoundly lied to and were the victim of colossal stupidity of the elders that were supposed to love them--this makes the film an almost unbearable watch. This is a brilliant, devastating movie."

As you ultimately read through this and get to know characters you will feel great sorrow as very likable and relatable (in the sense that you can feel for their saddenings) are torn to bits mentally and physically.

If nobody wants war, why do we have it? Of course, there are reasons, but it can all seem a bit silly.<br/><br/>Because of the period this was made, there is plenty of over the top, theatrical acting. And the anti-war message is so incredibly blunt, it almost cannot be taken seriously at times.

","This was the first true war movie ( don't give me that nonsense about birth of a nation).  It presented war as a bad thing, not the propaganda commercials and pictures that governments feed the people, showing how soldiers live an easy life and become heroes. The beginning of the film shows the propaganda in progress, by way of a school teacher, who brainwashes his students into thinking that its an honor to fight for your country and an obligation.<br/><br/>This film presented many social issues, however it was also a great war battlefield movie. The scenes are realistic and powerful, showing how there are no action heroes in war.  You can be alive and well one second, and lying motionless on the floor, the next. The young boys realize after about 2 days what a horrible mistake they made, and how full of crap their teacher was.  The best scene was when one the soldiers came back to the school, and saw the teacher dishing out the same propaganda to a new wave of young kids. The reason that this is one of my favorite war movies is because it teaches lessons, its not just a movie with great explosions and good battle scenes (though it contains both).  Overall I would give it an 8"

","One of the most important war films ever made is this excellent adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's fine novel, directed by Lewis Milestone. A group of eager German students enlist for service in World War I, heedless of warnings from their professors and families. These guys are just itching to be heroes, and the army propaganda has promised them that they will be. The cinematic ballet of war scenes is unlike anything cinema had seen before, and the realism of war in this film is completely at odds with the candy-coloured beauty of propaganda films made a decade later. To make sure World War II hopeful soldiers wouldn't be deterred by the gruesome images seen here, this film was banned in America not only for its pacifism but also because it presented German soldiers as sympathetic protagonists."

","The movie is great, with a devastating, quiet and simple ending. What makes it so effective is the lack of background music. I also liked the fact that the it doesn't try to make you puke. War is obviously more horrible than this. At times the movie looks less like an indictment of war, and more like an indictment of life itself. It seems to mourn not so much the evils of war, as the evils of sickness and death. Let us not forget that civilians die horrible deaths in peace time. The movie seems to realize this. Hence the prevalence of melancholy over anger and indignation."

As Paul, brilliantly played by Lew Ayres, becomes a war weary vet he realizes that the war has no purpose and no victory or good can come from it.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>These things fascinate me: films that are about something but are presented in a way that contradicts that something.<br/><br/>Often it is a film whose message is to strive for the extraordinary, but the film itself is strictly formulaic. Here we have something much more interesting and profound: we have the future of film. We have - not quite independently - the future of the world. And along the way, we have the war film as a key factor in defining the national character.<br/><br/>Even in 1930, the vocabulary of film was still in its infancy. Griffith (and many others) had already frozen the template as stage drama plus sweeping vistas that one could only get on screen. The two alternated: first you would see the lavish, grand scope. Then you would zoom in on some small personal drama, sculpted and dramatized as if it were a stage play. Like, say, the encounter with the dying Frenchman in the crater, or the counterpiece in this project: the two classroom speeches.<br/><br/>This was a very bad thing. Very bad for our imagination as a society. Instead of the new medium taking us to new places (and yes, a new moral perspective) we remained trapped in Victoriam morality plays. We stick there even today. Much has been made of the use of some of Eisenstein's techniques. But he was highly individualistic, very personal - even iconoclastic. Tarkovsky's films appear radically different but were in this independent spirit. Both were non-stage derived, non-moralistic.<br/><br/>Here we have what we would later call a Hollywood film: grand, slick, moralistic (headsmackingly so) and thoroughly mundane in its dramatic sequences. It is, one could say, a militaristic film with a non-militaristic message. I dare say that this type of drag on the collective spirit of the people is as much a curse as any war and indeed a straight line can be drawn from this type of film (yes, even this very film) and the cinematic techniques used by the Nazis to codify and communicate<br/><br/>nationality.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","""All Quiet on the Western Front"", the 1930 Oscar winner for Best Picture, is based on the novel of the same name by German author Erich Maria Remarque. The film illustrates the physical and emotional hardships faced by German soldiers during WWI, along with their growing detachment from civilized society.<br/><br/>To be honest, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is far from a perfect film. For instance, the sound is spotty, which is no surprise given the film's release only a few years after the advent of 'talkies'. The editing also leaves something to be desired and some of Lewis Milestone's directorial choices are debatable. Furthermore, the script is unfocused in the early going and Lew Ayres' acting is sometimes underwhelming.<br/><br/>All of that being said, the film succeeds despite its many flaws. Once the script finds its stride the story is quite satisfying, both in terms of plot and theme. Likewise, Milestone's direction may be somewhat erratic but the battlefield scenes are nothing short of spectacular. As for the acting, Louis Wolheim is a standout and even though Lew Ayres' acting isn't great it doesn't prevent us from caring about the fate of the film's main character.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think that the two Oscars that the film won (Best Picture and Best Director) were warranted but it is the film's story that makes it timeless. Eighty years on, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" remains a powerful anti-war film."

"charlytully","10","1","3","14 July 2009"," What this movie really proves
","Skimming through the top-rated comments on the WESTERN FRONT as of today, I noticed that several stepped outside the movie and proclaimed that IF the generation of young Germans represented by FRONT author Erich Maria Remarque had not been ""lost,"" they would have prevented the Nazis from coming to power. Ahem. Remarque himself was not ""lost,"" nor was the majority of his generation of German youth, however broadly or narrowly it is defined. A similar proportion of the counterpart generation in Great Britain was ""lost,"" but the surviving majority helped weed out those trying to impose a Nazi-like fascism in the isles at the same time Hitler's band of misfits was taking power in Germany. The difference? FRONT played widely to large audiences in Britain, leading to such a pacific mood that the government took an attitude of appeasement toward Germany, no doubt prolonging the eventual WWII by years. On the other hand, one of the first moves of the incipient Nazi Party was to successfully suppress the showing of FRONT in Germany. Since their well of movie-going youth was not ""poisoned"" with FRONT's anti-war message, these young men were easily bamboozled into believing in a thousand-year Reich, or Germanic Empire. Just acting in this movie turned lead Lew Ayres (who played protagonist Paul Baumer) into a pacifist, and he remained one even AFTER Pearl Harbor. The upshot of these facts seem clear: wars will NEVER prevent future wars; only anti-war movies can do that job. Therefore, the United Nations MUST adopt a program wherein the youth of EVERY nation are compelled to watch an anti-war film at least once a year. If that means wiring the deserts of the Sudan, the mountains of Afghanistan, and backwoods of Virginia for electricity, so be it. (On the other hand, all the warlords and defense contractors probably want to stay in business, so we can keep movies optional, and just end the charade that any country is seriously interested in ""world peace."")"

"FilmOtaku","8","1","3","7 September 2004"," One of the first of its genre, and one of the best
","After viewing 'All Quiet on the Western Front', made in 1930 and directed by Lewis Milestone, I have been trying my hardest to come up with something to criticize regarding the film. The story of a band of fresh-faced German teens who enlist in the army at the behest of their propaganda-spewing teacher during the height of World War I, it examines their journey from idealistic novices to (for those who are left) war-torn and bedraggled soldiers who have lived through hell, uncertain of why they are doing what they do. The evolution of these men are told through both obvious means, (focusing on each of them before deciding to enlist, and showing their fantasies of how their lives will be better if they enlist) and in more subtle ways (the idealistic protagonist, Paul Baumer) quietly deciding that it is more painful to remain at home on leave than be on the battlefield, so he goes back four days early) <br/><br/>'All Quiet on the Western Front' is probably the granddaddy of the war film genre. I'm sure that Steven Spielberg studied it before creating 'Saving Private Ryan' because I saw aesthetic and situational similarities between the two films, filmed six decades apart. There are extremely well-done battle scenes, regardless of the fact that it was filmed in 1930. It only makes the film that much more awe-inspiring that it WAS such an early film. The script is equally impressive. In a decade (heck, a few decades) where films/scripts that took chances or were not overt in handing the audience the desired reactions, emotions and thoughts, were few and far between, 'All Quiet' is disturbing and cerebral, and clearly an anti-war film. I have not seen it, but judging from what others who did have told me, it sounds like the original took far more chances and was far more subtle than its remake, fifty years later. Equally surprising, in an era where the audience is told who the bad guy or good guy is simply by the color of their hat or the sinister look on their face, the 'hero' of the film is not established until nearly the middle of the film. Until then, the audience is left to look at the entire picture, just as the characters on screen are. In terms of a 'happy, hopeful' ending  look elsewhere. This film ends with such power and effectiveness that I was literally numb as the words 'The End' came onto the screen.<br/><br/>My original statement of this review was that I tried long and hard to come up with something I could criticize about the film 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. Even after putting a brief analysis on paper, I can't come up with anything, because this film was made seventy years ago and was so far ahead of its time even then that the slightest thing I can come up with can be answered by 'But it was made in 1930'. This is an excellent war film, and an excellent example of brilliant, visionary film-making. It has been studied in film schools for decades, analyzed by critics for even longer, and all of the praise is well-deserved. For anyone who enjoys contemporary war films, be sure to check out their obvious influence, 'All Quiet on the Western Front.'<br/><br/>--Shelly"

I desperately wish to find a cleaned-up DVD copy of this film that will due it justice.  Some of the dialogue, mind you, is inspired, and stands the test of time - Soldiers mulling over just how a war starts (""One country offends another country""...""How can a mountain in Germany offend a field in England?"")<br/><br/>(Spoilers within) The scenes in this film are some of the most famous in movie history - a machine gun's view of the carnage, indescriminitely mowing down hundreds and hundreds of soldiers who drop dead six feet in front of the camera, soldiers ceasing to exist after a shell hit (all that remains, in one case, are the soldier's hands, clutching a strand of barbed wire). The battlefields are miles of muddy, shell-cratered wasteland, the soldiers too numerous to count.  The ending is definitely one of the top 3 movie endings of all time in terms of emotional power.  The main character reaches for a butterfly that lands near him, the only object of beauty he's seen in a long while.  When he leaves his cover to reach the butterfly a sniper takes careful aim and fires.  The hand goes limp.

Devoid of any political infusion, silly pro or anti war propaganda, its a strikingly realistic account of war as drudgery, commonplace and non glorious mechanized waste. Its message is simultanelously ambivalent and sanctimonious.

The story follows a group of young German soldiers who go off to war, being patriotic and fighting for their country. They learn the hard way that war tears people apart.

","I first saw this film in 1950 while in highschool and I was impressed.<br/><br/>It was different from the World War Two films made in the 1940's that glorified war with the possible exception of the excellent ""Pride of the Marines"" starring John Garfield.  (This film showed very effectively the horror and the nightmares suffered by a soldier blinded in the heat of battle.)<br/><br/>Although I served on active duty with the U.S. Army Signal Corps during the latter part of the Korean Era, I was blessed with the fact that I was still in radio school when the war ended.<br/><br/>Later stationed in Germany (12/53 to 2/56) I saw many military memorials for the 1914-18 war.  I asked a German acquaintance why there were no WW-II memorials.  His reply, with a cynical laugh, ""There were so many dead, military, civilians, - everybody  - that they didn't even bother!""<br/><br/>This symbolized the sad failure of this otherwise fine film.<br/><br/>Mankind failed to learn about the horrors of war.  Goebbels, who became Hitler's propaganda minister, and other Nazis set off stink bombs in Berlin theaters showing the film.  Yet it, other fine anti-war films, and a knowledge of history right up to the Vietnam conflict should convince most thoughtful persons that ""War is Hell"".<br/><br/>A footnote: I was once told that Erich Maria Remarque's last name was really ""Kramer"" and that he reversed the spelling to ""Remark"" and replaced the ""K"" with a ""que"" presumably to give it a ""French appearing"" spelling.

","A powerful anti-war film, which captures both the awful experience of fighting in the war, as well as the disillusionment of those who were persuaded into enlisting. It is a remarkable piece of cinema for its time, with some cinematography that is still impressive by today's standards and high production values. Nevertheless it does feel slightly outdated, and there is a lack of authenticity, with an absence of any reminder that these are the Germans who are featured. Still this barely hurts a film with so much to say. The major flaw of the film is an ineffectual performance by Lew Ayres in the lead, as he is only ever half-convincing.

"tylaw93","7","1","5","5 February 2011"," Soild ending for an alright film
","All Quiet on the Western Front is a 1930 war drama about the horror of war. A scene close to the beginning of the movie it shows young men who are encouraged to for fight and die for the father land. Most are excited to go off and serve for their country although some are hesitant they all end up enlisting. They go off and find that war is hell but stay to fight, serve and die for their country.<br/><br/>The story was while written for the most part but a few things did bother me. One of those thing was the French soldier (if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean, if not stop reading now). The problem I had with it is if the soldier Paul played by Lew Ayres was fighting for three or more years and was hardened by battle should not have a problem with killing one more soldier. Another problem I had was the American accents, I had to keep remembering they were German or it just seem like an alternate history of the Americans trying to capture France. The only way you could real tell they were German was from their uniforms. Something else I did not like was the battles it was either motor fire killing troops in a field without any gun fire or a machine gun cutting down soldiers down with little to no fighting back. This isn't true for all scenes of fighting but will be seen a few times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The real strong point of this movie, and the only reason I gave it anything over five was the acting. I thought the acting was good nothing truly amazing but still memorable to say the least. Another point I like was the older soldiers especially Kat. He was the one guy I think every war movie needs, and what really strengthened the scenes of fighting. The reason I believe he is a character every war movie needs is because he is the unflinching tough been through everything in battle soldier with a kind heart and a watchful eye over the younger troops. The other major selling point of the movie to me was Paul and his mom. This really brought together and put some purpose behind Paul and gave us a better understanding of him as a person and soldier. The last thing that Paul did on his leave made this movie in my opinion. He goes back to his old school were his former teacher is preaching the same thing he told Paul and his class mates the years before. Paul over hears this and gives an amazing speech to the young boys about the horror of war, this is disregarded by the boys as they are ready to fight and die for the country and Paul is seen as a coward and unpatriotic to his country.<br/><br/>Overall for a 1930 movie I think it was really well made for the year but war movies have progressed so much in the eighty one ears since it's release. With that being said I think it's great and should be watched if you are a fan of war movies. Although it isn't all fighting and action this is a classic film and has really stood the stand of time being eighty one years old and ultimately still being entertaining is worth a watch and fans of classic war movies will fall in love with this film but it isn't for everyone."

What a sad conclusion! But, you know what? Despite the fact that WWII was far more cruel and barbarous that WWI, the WWI was still more senseless, meaningless. At least in WWII was something comprehensible: the evil force wanted to conquer the world and use it at her evil's disposal, and the brave courageous people stood up to the evil to save their lands. <br/><br/>But in WWI who wanted what?

"Lorenzo H.","7","1","5","25 January 2000"," Powerful, but dated World War I epic.
","Many early sound films are at a great disadvantage when it comes to pleasing modern audiences.  This problem stems mainly from two causes.  For one, actors and actresses were still using the exaggerated mannerisms of the silent film school.  Today, this results in what we would call embarrassingly bad acting.  Secondly, it is painfully evident that an effective combination of sound and music, which should have complemented the onscreen images, was back then an as of yet unmastered technique.  These rough edges were eventually smoothed out by the mid to late thirties when actors and filmmakers began acclimating themselves to the art of sound film. Unfortunately, ""ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT"" is one of the films that falls into the above-mentioned category.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, This having been said, every serious film lover should still attempt to catch this movie at least once in his or her lifetime for it does contain many unforgettable moments.  What will keep the film in your memory years after viewing it are its well-staged battle sequences, its pacifist message and of course its haunting final images which are pure poetry.  Dated, yes - but also worthwhile.  7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Modern viewers can experience all the same emotions and issues tackled by ALL QUIET without any of its drawbacks, by viewing Peter Weir's memorable ""GALLIPOLI"" released in 1981.  It also takes place during WWI but it is a more character driven film, which benefits from excellent direction, cinematography and music.  Of the two, I believe it is the better motion picture."

","Read the book.  Excerpts are adapted into dialogue for the film with somewhat stunted results; people just don't talk that way.  Nonetheless, an extremely advanced film for its time, superior to most war films of any time.  The battle sequences are vivid and realistic.  (And, I might add, considering practical film effects of the time, probably much more like actual live fire exercises than most of the actors would have liked.) People are being a little lazy in their political commentary on the film, though, extrapolating from a legitimate expose of the grim reality of war and its effect on men and societies to a naive questioning of the occasional necessity of war itself.  War is hell, Sherman said, but on to Atlanta he drove anyway.  Surely no one thankful for their freedoms and privileges in the U.S. alone can unhypocritically indict war as a last resort for the liberation and preservation of liberty and men's souls.  Peace and unity at the expense of human dignity are worthless.  Let's not forget that in avoiding the calamity of war, which All Quiet is so effective in portraying, as much as we can."

"bkirbyson","5","1","9","17 February 2014"," Disappointing for a Classic
","I have heard about All Quiet on the Western Front, and finally had a chance to watch it yesterday. It certainly didn't live up to the hype for me. Technically it was quite good, especially considering it was made in the very early days of the ""talkies"" when the actors and directors didn't have much experience with the medium and were experimenting with a lot of new techniques. The sets were outstanding, including the battles and scenes of war-ravaged France, and the cinematography was excellent for the time (if you watch it after seeing Saving Private Ryan or something recent, you will be disappointed), but for 1930 it was very well done.<br/><br/>My problem with the movie is that it (and the novel it was based on) is really is just a pacifist propaganda piece. The film does a good job of portraying the plight of the German infantryman in WWI, and it was truly terrible by any measure: The soldiers lived in terrible conditions, were treated like disposable cannon-fodder by their leaders, and not even the most basic logistical services (like food) were provided for them. What the movie does not allow for is the possibility of a war needing to be fought as an absolute last resort. Had the novel/film been content to limit its scope to the horrors of the German infantryman in WWI, that would be one thing. But it is not content with that. It has to make the point that all war, by definition, for all time, is not worth it and there could be no conceivable justifiable reason for a nation to go to war. As a universal message, it just doesn't stand up.<br/><br/>Maybe from the German perspective in the aftermath of the pointlessness of WWI when the novel was written, the author just could not conceive of a valid reason for fighting a war or that countries sending their young men off to war might make efforts to provide some everyday comforts to their soldiers, and not expose them to any more danger than is absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>But we know better now, and I suspect a lot of people in 1930s Hollywood knew better too. They certainly did during and after WWII, and countless books and movies have thoroughly explored the concept of the ""just"" war while still showing the horrors of war. The message espoused by the film just doesn't stand up today, unless you're prepared to make the case that fighting against Nazism and Hitler just wasn't worth it. <br/><br/>That's why, for me at least, this film doesn't stand the test of time. I really don't see why we are still calling this movie a classic more than 80 years later, except as an excellent example of film from the era."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","14 April 2019"," Probably among the more significant anti-war movies
","""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (really like the title despite the reference being so quick (yet so accurate) you might miss it if you don't pay attention for a moment) is an American movie from 1930, so this one is almost 90 years old now. The director is Lewis Milestone and he won a prestigious Oscar during this early Academy Awards ceremony and the film itself took home the big prize for Best Picture as well, known as Outstanding Production back then. Milestone is also part of the writing team here, many writers included in fact, but not surprisingly because this film is based on a novel. It is a black-and-white movie which should also surprise nobody really given the year it came out. And it is from the early days of sound film. The silent film classic Metropolis for example is from 1927, so it really should not be taken for granted not just that there is sound in here, but that it is really good. There exist all kinds of versions of this movie we got here, the one I watched is probably the most common nowadays and also the shortest at around 100 minutes. This is the story of a group of young men who basically hear a speech at their school that was inspiring enough to leave and move right into war action, exactly what the speaker intended. German boys by the way. Played by American actors. One of the most interesting aspects here is certainly how the boys' mood changes. Early on they are so motivated to fight for their country. But the training already reduces their good spirit and one of the kids says on one occasion that he is surprised how the one in charge of training them is not as nice anymore as he was before the training. Then the war action starts. Many of them die and despair and sobering are omnipresent. One of the soldiers says that the one who started this war should be damned. And eventually until the credits roll in, they are basically all dead.<br/><br/>I must say I struggled a bit with the beginning. The only thing I found memorable in the first half hour was the aforementioned spirit in which everybody was for being allowed to fight for their country. This was really very early on. What followed afterwards, the training as well as a really lengthy sequence of war scenes did almost nothing for me. But that is probably just me because these specific war scenes also in other war movies rarely make an impact on me. Sadly this also includes the scene with the dead Frenchman and the photo of his family, which could have been a more emotional moment for me otherwise. The war this is about is of course World War I (1914-1918) and it is kinda ironic that the 2nd World War was already closer when this film came out than the first if we look at the number of years before/after 1930. Oh well, there are some quotes memorable enough to mention like one character saying towards the end that this war will not end before dies. Which did prove true as you could expect. When that quote came out, basically all the characters the young ones were already killed in action or severely wounded. There are two scenes after these specific war scenes that stayed memorable for me. One would be the injured friend with the noble boots that he can't carry anymore and he begs his peers to stay with him. The other would be the quote by one character about why war exists. Because two countries insult each other. So how can a mountain and a field insult each other? Nope it is humans of course. It always is. And those who lose their lives are not insulting or insulted. The one who said all that which may seem childish initially, but does include a great deal of truth, was maybe also my favorite character. If anybody deserved a supporting nomination here, then probably him. But it is an ensemble performance and all about the cruelties of war than about unique performances. I am glad the film improved more and more the longer it went.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to watch this one on the big screen again as it was shown here as part of a special series and I think it was worth checking it out in a theater and not just on a small laptop or television screen. I have seen by far not enough from 1930 to say if it is my favorite film from that year. Most certainly it is not, but I still liked it and after initial hesitation definitely give it a thumbs-up. There are many moments and sequences I could mention here, like when apparently most of the students fromt he original group have died and we see the next generation. Or how the soldiers try to distract themselves from all the mayhem and desctruction with the help of women and alcohol. If there is one scene that is slightly funny and was also intended slightly funny, then that would be the one with one character taking one beer after the next and not letting another have any. It wasn't mean, they were all buddies at that moment already. Other than that, it is a really serious movie without anything to laugh at all and you don't get these films that often, especially back then when the likes of Lloyd, Keaton, Chaplin and others were among the biggest movie stars and they were (initially) all about the comedy. Sure there was D.W. Griffith, but 100% dramatic films were nothing that common and if they were then they frequently included an element of horror like several German films that were huge successes during that era. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the final shot of the film. We see the students moving forward and their marching is mixed together with these thousands of tombstone graves on these green fields of France. Haunting. Stuff. After the sub-par beginning, I definitely would not have expected this film would still touch me as much as it did in this particular scene towards the end. very well done there. A really sad film overall. But one that needs to be watched. Go check it out, preferrably on the big screen if you get a chance to so like I did. I give it 3 stars out of 5 and a thumbs-up. Oh and yes this is of course not a war movie, but an anti-war movie."

"talula1060","7","0","6","19 January 2018"," EXCELLENT BOOK, MOVIE COULD BE BETTER
","I absolutely love this book and have read many times, so was expecting to feel a similar love for the film. Although there were parts that were gut wrenching (the guy who discovers his leg has been amputated, the madness that ensues after repeated shelling), I had a major problem with the acting. Because sound was so new in film, many of the actors were doing a lot of exaggerated movements and making faces after every line. Lew Ayres was the biggest culprit. He yelled many of his lines, constantly posed for the camera, and in several instances, he started to say the wrong lines and came off sounding like he was reading it. He's not very good at sound movies and it's really a plum role for an actor. He only redeemed himself when he came back home and gave his little monologue in the classroom. He spoke with passion and resolve and was believable for the first time in the film. I was very disheartened to see how badly acted most of this film was because the story is a heartbreaking statement on the horrors of war and the pointlessness of it all. 
Another pet peeve is the way so many of the actors smile throughout the film as though they were on a Broadway stage. It wasn't written that way in the book and there are certainly other ways to show satisfaction with comfortable boots than having the actors grinning as they march into certain death. It's ridiculous.
 Someone else mentioned that if this film had been shot a couple years later, it would have been better and I agree completely. Sound was so new that the early years were filled with silent actors who brought that same dramatic, expressive sensibility to the screen. I know there's also a silent version of this film which might work better with the way it's acted. 
I can't express enough what a complete shame it is that Milestone couldn't have directed these guys better or else cast others in the role who understood the importance of the subtleties in each character and the changes wrought by the war. He had a very large budget for the time and was able to reshoot all of the mother's scenes so why not have the actors do more than one take? Why not notice that the dead French soldier has a different expression every time the camera is on his face? If Paul is dreaming of home, you don't need Ayres to have a dreamy look on his face. Also, bread submerged in water would fall apart. There are so many little things that should have been be caught. 
I know there's a remake of the film from the 70s, but this movie really only works in black and white. This was shot 11 years after the war's end which is only fitting. I would have loved to see a German version of this movie as it would be interesting to see how they approached it. Great story, but film rendition is ruined by shoddy acting and sloppy blocking."
"JaydoDre","7","0","3","15 December 2014"," Effective but with many flaws
","All Quiet on the Western Front has been hallmarked as one of the best and most important movies of the 20th century. However, despite this being an influential culturally important film, there are a number of problems with it that have to be addressed without influence from the film's popularity.<br/><br/>The story has a well-paced traditional progression of the teenagers happily enlisting for war, then experiencing it and changing through it. It is interesting, even if you already know more or less what is going to happen, considering the subject matter. The movie proclaims at the beginning that it is not meant to show an adventure because war is no adventure, but it does have a very adventuresque and epic feel to it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the writing and the way this film is directed make it feel very unnatural at times. There are times when the characters do not talk like real people would and their acting is very artificial, like ""I am acting now"". Actors either overact or underact. Some scenes last shorter than it feels they should.<br/><br/>There is a short scene where a guy looks sad, the other guy says ""Oh come on"" and the first guy smiles. Of course, that is how humans work. There was a moment when during a battle someone exclaimed out loud ""This is terrible"" and it was hard not to laugh at a line like this.<br/><br/>It is entirely possible that this is a style of dialogue that was chosen purposefully, but that does not make it any better. As a result of the lack of believability it is hard to get engrossed in the film.<br/><br/>Yet again there are also a good deal of well-acted, heart-felt performances, especially towards the 2nd half of the film. Louis Wolheim and Lew Ayres play the two most prominent roles and are good charming actors. Lew, has a lot of subtle but deep expression in his face.<br/><br/>However, the overall problem with the characters is that they are hardly introduced. We know almost nothing about them. The story centers the characters played by Lew and Louis and therefore, simply as a result of them being a lot on screen, you get to know their characters and recognize their faces, but everyone else is just the same. When these other people inevitably start dying you hardly notice. The movie tries to make a big deal out of one of the deaths but I could not even remember the guy's name.<br/><br/>It is an impressive looking film, with good night scenes and explosions. It must have, at least for a while, have been the record holder for the most explosions in a movie. It is grim and good at delivering tension when it wants to. There are some really effective scenes that convey the tragically ironic nature of trench warfare.<br/><br/>However, in the visual department there are also some problems. You know how in the older days there were not many special effects for people getting shot. Well that is fine, but when soldiers are pretending to throw grenades and there is clearly nothing being thrown, you must admit that is weird. You are telling me you could afford all those giant explosions but not some cheap props to use as grenades? <br/><br/>At another time, an actor plays dead but you can see him breath. The director could have ordered the camera further back; could have only shown the face; could have made the actor stop breathing and make only short takes. Why keep a shot with a clear mistake in it? <br/><br/>It can only be presumed, that just as with the unnatural dialogue, the makers see the message as the important thing and do not care about the details, but that is poor choice because the details do get noticed and they do detract from the realism and therefore from the belief.<br/><br/>The film has good sound effects for explosions and gunfire. Interesting choice is that there is no music, apart from what you hear during the credits, but then perhaps music would be antagonistic to the message of the film. The silence and special effects are used to a good effect and do not need music for more dramatisation.<br/><br/>All quiet on the western front is a valiant effort, and definitely memorable, but has quite a few flaws. It is well shot and has many cool looking moments, but some of its effects are surprisingly poor. It has good actors but a lack of realism that makes it feel sanitised."

Following the advice of their teacher, a couple kids in Germany decide to sign up to fight during The Great War in order to have the chance to become recognized as heroes. Upon entering, they come to realize that war isn't all that's cracked up to be; it's dark place to be where people all around you die, and your number could be up at any moment.<br/><br/>The problems I have with a story like this is that under the wrong mindset, it could be viewed as a way of showing that war is bad and we don't need it in our lives. And maybe if these characters were awful human beings, they would most definitely be correct. But it is called an exploitation film for a reason; it shows the experience rather than preaches anything, leaving one to make the proper interpretations out of this film.<br/><br/>But no matter how one interprets this film, it is definitely a reality check (especially under the right mindset). Rather than glorifying (quite the opposite) or criticizing it, what you see is what is really going on out of the battlefield. It ultimately works because it's real. Right down to the characters themselves serving as blank slates for the audience to slip into their shoes.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in this film is just perfect. There's very little to no music in this film at all, and the only sound you hear are, not to sound melodramatic or anything, the sounds of war. You don't even hear anybody talk. And you know what? Focusing all the sound on the battle around them rather than on the characters talking or the background music makes it quite an effective direction. It actually ties in with the horrors and the suspense around these soldiers. And there's a point to be made here; this is the first Best Picture winner to have won Best Director, a trend that closely ties the 2 categories for the remainder of the Academy's history.<br/><br/>But what this film does for me the most is enforces me the belief that we need to be more supportive of our military than we have been. And I don't mean that we got to keep them out of war as much as possible; but rather, sympathize with why they ultimately go into battle and are willing to risk their lives for our freedom. This film doesn't tell us at all that war is wrong or these people are bad; they are simply doing what they believe is right, and as the people sitting out, we should support and encourage their choices until the bitter end.<br/><br/>But regardless, this is an exploitation film anyways; it's not preaching what I'm saying at all; it's just giving us the experience. And that's what this film is; an emotional experience. And unlike something like Sunrise or Platoon, it actually works because what we see is very much what the battlefield is really like. It's a film that makes us understand reality, but allows us to make our own judgments. The only reason why I felt this film's a tad overrated is because it's frequently regarded as one of the best Anti-War films ever made. It's not. It shows us the realities of war; this film makes absolutely no interpretations whatsoever.<br/><br/>But to be fair, it isn't all that logical either, but it doesn't have to be. Sometimes, it's best to show us for what it really is; not a place for heroes, but a living Hell. I'll give this film and 8.5 out of 10, and round it up to 9 out of 10."

","All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Ambitious anti-war film about a young German soldier (Lew Ayres) who enters WW1 thinking that he's got a great adventure ahead of him. He and his buddies quickly learn that there's nothing fun about war as they experience all the horrors that come with it. This film and director Lewis Milestone both picked up Oscars and I'm sure most important to the studio is that this is still considered one of the greatest anti-war pictures ever made. There's no question that there's a lot of energy, passion and terror built up in the film but I think at times it crosses over into some preachy moments that really don't work too well but more on that in a second. There's no question that the greatest strength to this film are the tremendous battle sequences, which were considered great at the time but when viewed today they're all the more impressive. It's clear that the director and studio weren't too worried about the production code because they go all out in the grit and this includes some rather graphic battle sequences where we see body parts separated from the bodies and of course there are some violent gun battles. The battle scenes are certainly among the greatest ever shot and there's a beautiful sequence inside the trenches where the men get up against the wall to do battle while the camera glides over their heads and prepares for battle. This is followed by another terrific sequence where the other side goes to jump down in the trenches and the fights that occur are so realistic you feel as if you're watching a documentary. That documentary term fits the film well because these sequences look so real that you really do feel as if you're watching the real thing. The performances for the most part are pretty impressive, although I'd say that Ayres comes off just Luke warm. He handles some of the later stuff quite well but there were a few sequences where he just didn't work for me and this includes one very preachy sequence where he talks to an enemy soldier he has killed. For my money it was Louis Wolheim who stole the film as a veteran soldier trying to teach the new kids the ropes. As I mentioned earlier, the one issue I had with the film is how preachy it was at times. I think less could have been more as the message is quite clear and to me there really wasn't a need to push the issue. It's funny that this film was such a hit in America since it was showing the German side of the war and I also find it quite ironic that Hollywood would make a film like this. Then, less than a decade later, another world war would strike and they went back to the message that dying for your country is good, which is the exact opposite of the message here."

","""All quiet on the Western front"" (1930) directed by Lewis Milestone as a free adaptation of a well known novel concerning the absurd of war, when made on the back of soldiers inside the trenches, it was also as movie in itself a spell for attention and too concerning the stupidity of a necessary and anguished delay during the First War to finish the job. Meanwhile, continuing the conflict in Europe, just when the countries engaged were also on the mud, to coming out with the help of such generals. In which the bad luck was at that moment in both sides, but remaining on the back of the warrior's situation on the ground. There are some scenes very famous in this movie : the beer house as place for fraternization among inmates from an inner circle of Thule, supporting the continuation of the war in 1916 as it was an envision and a prophecy, the overexposing sights with the helmets on the heads of the soldiers dead on the trenches as ghosts on a dark sky and a battle across the wires which took an aura of fame to this pictures around the world. <br/><br/>The story of this movie was not also only an epic reconstitution, but otherwise like much more as barely the reconstitution of a small world with some turnabouts of destiny daily, either as if it was worsen the economic situation and even open a new global crisis, almost after the end of this kind of an unique warrior's epic story of trenches. The book of Remarque putting in sight by Milestone's direction was a synthesis of honor, expressing mainly the idea that school is the place where teenagers had learned the defense of war by a given teacher, who inflames them for fighting in support of nationalism and expansionism of their country. However, after that experience of one of the young men from this classroom on the very hole of the front's trenches against French army deployment, this one returns during a break telling his own reality there as pure horror and by this contrast between classroom and school teaching with his mates on the backward, the personality of this teacher is questioned and demystified in his retrograde speech of submission, before the inevitability of war and its fake greatness on the ground. After that, this same soldier returns to the trenches, when things apparently were on an impasse. <br/><br/>Such an advantage for making a plot with recent history, imagined as story of an opening conscience from the contact with the destruction as result of a war, whose trenches were the artificial new borders like a cemetery of souls in collective despair, it was the must of the novel itself, when by chance after it was pictured on the screen with much more compacted strength by its plasticity. Also discovering in the main character as an absurd of representing any young human being dead, before the range of searched happiness since the childhood and scholarship. Depassed, suddenly, without the time for maturity and for loving another half a face of other genre, not keeping in touch even with such dreamed development for his hopeful future, on the landscapes from a nowhere finished countryside, for the sake's owner mentality of a citizenship, interrupted by an anonymous shot. Thus, provoking such a fortuity, like this same casualty before the peace arrival, instead into a social disjunction not waited by the old society, responsible of bloodiness and lack of adjustment to the losses, indeed in fighting for a wanton defeat as metamorphosis of beauty from the horror and pain in staccato."

","First it must be emphasized the difference in genre & era about this movie. Later movies ( the ""Platoon"", ""Full metal jacket"", etc ) were shot primarily to ENTERTAIN. Of course the are ""messages"", but you can detect messages even in ""Starship Troopers"" or ""The golden voyage of Sinbad"". This movie comes from an era when the mass entertaining value was minimal. It looks & feels more like a war documentary than a ""movie"". There is no bothering with style, no SFX complacency, no starlets overacting. Of course some acting looks today overboard, but remember that was 1930. I still think they had a better way to film-making back then than most lurid movies of today or fimmakers splurging millions hiring crowds of stand-ins & shooting at eleven exotic locations."

","Before seeing this film I had already read the book All Quiet on the Western Front (in German) by Erich-Maria Remarque and seen the 1979 TV movie All quiet on the Western Front. Being a great fan of the book and having been told by my German teacher in high school that this was a great film, I decided to give it a try. I must say that I was very impressed by the special effects and the great care of the director and the crew in capturing the spirit of the war and depicting the surroundings as realistic as was possible. They did a really great job in making the film believable and I must confess that I've seen more modern films than this, with worse effects and care taken to make it look realistic. <br/><br/>Overall the film was well made (obviously leaving out many gruesome scenes from the book) but I felt that the scenes in which Lew Ayres (Paul Bäumer) tried to be reflective / moralistic or sorrowful were quite cheesy (in an old-fashioned Hollywood kind of way). I mean the guy did a good job in appearing frantic and cheerful, but being filled with sorrow or trying to be reflective on what he did just didn't fit him at all. Also I felt that Marion Clayton (Paul's sister in the film) did a pretty bad job in the few scenes she had. In addition to that, I thought it was a pity that the film didn't end exactly the way the book did. I mean the ending of the film is quite powerful, but the ending words of the book are so much stronger and much more powerful. Of course I read the book in German and considered from that point of view I could have imagined / would have liked to see the ending lines of the book scrolled onto the screen, as the picture slowly faded away.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front (rated from low to high):<br/><br/>1979 Verison: 7 out of 10 <br/><br/>1930 Version: 7 out of 10 (because of the better ending and the overall bigger / better effort this one ranks higher than the 1979 TV version) <br/><br/>Book Version: 9,5 out of 10<br/><br/>post scriptum: I'd like to see a German film version of the book, staying true to the book (especially to it's gruesomeness and it's ending) since I think a totally German version will be much more powerful to begin with"

Milestone stayed true to the realism that Remarque portrayed in the novel: the movie, besides being in English and with American actors, is not Hollywood- or American-ized.<br/><br/>The ending IS the death of Paul. One must notice the 'quietness' as Paul is shot: it is just as Remarque would have intended it to be.<br/><br/>Nothing positive came from WWI; women would have received the vote despite the war; the League was a dismal failure and to a certain extent, the UN is following in its foot-steps; the Treaty of Versailles made WWII inevitable, especially with the war guilt clause for Germany; and millions of people lost their lives in vain. Milestone, more than anything, portrays the war in all of its senseless brutality: this is made clear by Paul's speech to his old Professor's class close to the end of the movie."

","Some people classify this as an anti-war movie. I guess I would not. I would look at it as more of anti the traditional war view you see in most every other movie. Here you see young schoolboys sold on the idea of becoming a soldiers by people who have never been on the front line and sell it as a heroic patriotic duty. On the front line reality sets in, you are fighting for your life and a small piece of land, over and over again, against people just like you on the other side. Any friends you might make can die without warning, you can't sleep normally, you may or may not get the food and supplies you need. Other movies focus in on ""heroes"" accomplishing some ""patriotic"" mission. This movie focuses on individuals living the grueling day to day life of a soldier during war and how it changes their lives forever."

","A faithful and inspired adaptation of the classic pacifist novel.  Set in the First World War  and made in 1930, when Europe was starting to slide towards the Second  it follows a group of German schoolboys inspired to enlist by their zealous teacher.  Their own patriotism is quickly crushed by the brutal reality of war.  As their leader Lew Ayres puts it: ""We live in the trenches and we fight.  We try not to be killed.  That is all.""  Though veteran soldier Louis Wolheim takes them under his protection, the seeds of eventual tragedy are sown right from the start.  The film, lavish for its day, doesn't always work.  Some scenes are clumsy and Ayres gives a slightly strange performance.  But the innovative camera work of director Lewis Milestone is generally impressive, especially during the battle scenes.  The blood and guts of later war films may be lacking but he invokes a pervasive, unforgettable mood of horror."

While Lew Ayres may be a little theatrical sometimes, his last few scenes are incredibly moving, especially because this movie pulls you in and makes you care about these people.  Also brave for staying true to Herr Remarque's novel and not Hollywoodizing the ending into something uplifting that would leave the audience feeling good.  War is not supposed to make you feel good.  It is a sad, tragic thing, and this movie deserves respect for presenting it in such a truthful fashion.  I'm not a big fan of war movies, mostly because Germans are invariably presented as bloodthirsty morons, which may be true of the Nazis but is a slap in the face to German soldiers who fought and hoped and suffered and died just as much as anyone, if not more so.  This movie actually presents the enemy as human beings with feelings and morals and families and fears and dreams just like our side, and that makes me respect it and the people who put it together even more (I'm not just saying this because I'm German-American)  This movie is more truthful than most made after it, even today when the quality of filmmaking should be better than ever and the world wars should be far enough behind us for the ""enemy"" to be portrayed in an honest manner.<br/><br/>10/10"
