","I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly."
"JustCuriosity","8","316","399","12 March 2013"," Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a Stinging Critique of Modern Relationships
","Don Jon was very well-received in its regional premiere at the Paramount Theatre during Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The film was written, directed and starred Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He did a really fine job for his writing and directorial debut, but he may have been trying to do too much. The acting by Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headly, and Brie Larson is quite good. I think it is Gordon-Levitt's script that leaves something to be desired. His character Jon is a very successful ladies' man who is also heavily addicted to masturbating to internet porn – numerous times daily. Many people will find the film to be quite funny and enjoyable. However, the graphic use of porn will not be to everybody's taste and may be off-putting to viewers – particularly female viewers. I'm also wondering whether the extensive use of porn will lead to the MPAA giving it the kiss-of-death NC-17 rather than an R rating.<br/><br/>JGL's script is well-intentioned and he is trying to make the point that many people become so self-absorbed that they lose the ability to interact with others on a human level. Jon is deadened to real romance by his reliance on porn. His girlfriend has an overly romanticized view of relationships based on watching too many romantic movies. They are both so self-absorbed and selfish that they can't really build a real relationship. Still, it was often difficult to figure out what JGL's point was and in many ways became clearer listening to him during the Q&A after the film. JGL is attempting to raise profound issues about human relationships in the modern era, but he hasn't quite figured out how to do that as a writer and director. I expect that he is going to become as fine a director and writer as he already is an actor. He has a fine future ahead of him."

","(Somewhat Spoiler-y) I've dated an older woman, and in a lot of ways she tried to tell me the same things Esther tells Jon. In fact I remember a few distinctly similar interactions, so on that level the movie really spoke to me.<br/><br/>I imagine one could say the movie relies on some clichés, just enough to satisfy the romance/comedy genre, but it uses them in very unique ways to tell a story that at least seems a little more real. Sort of like 500 Days (of Summer) on steroids. No pun intended. In fact it may be even safe to say that Don Jon is the next chapter in the 500 Days saga, albeit with a different character. Perhaps one made cynical by the events of JGL last romance comedy outing.<br/><br/>Don Jon has graduated beyond puppy love, certainly, and onto full blown adult fun. But the movie is very biting, and sort of tears apart his self-serving agenda.<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to be caught up in the ""porn"" aspect of the movie, but honestly the ""porn"" is a metaphor, no more important to the gym-tan-laundry-sexualized commercials.<br/><br/>There are only two real female characters in the film: Esther, and Jon's quiet-except-for-one-powerful-line sister. The sister in fact almost makes the movie, as they use her small character to incredible effect.<br/><br/>The movie does a nice job of tricking the audience into rooting for Jon and Barbara, of course it's all a ploy. They even set up Esther as a sort of antagonist. She is enticing yet feels all wrong for Jon. Older, sort of run down, maybe a bit of a predator of weak men, the movie isn't very clear about her at the start. She runs completely counter to the stereotypes of women as set up by the film. She is far from perfect, but Moore makes her believably beautiful. I truly doubt many other actresses could've sold this role in the way she did. While her age played right into the character she probably was right for the character for mostly other reasons.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie is overall that outstanding. Many of the jokes fall flat, and some of it is tedious. In fact the vast majority of it could be considered filler, but the end is so incredible it does a great job of tying all these scenes together in a way that makes perfect sense and delivers a powerful message. Without completely ruining it the end embraces the typical cliché, but flips it on it's head. What results is a very mature version of what audiences have come to expect from these types of movies. The same, but also very different.<br/><br/>I would expect JGL will have continued success as a Director and actor.<br/><br/>The guy truly gets it."
"eschetic-2","7","115","150","6 October 2013"," Solid, hard to define indie satire which will make some very uncomfortable - EXCELLENT first directorial effort!
","Defining what kind of film this is had to be the hardest part of getting DON JON made, but ultimately it was worth it! It isn't really a ""guy"" film even though *technically* it tries to look at sex from a guy's perspective. It may actually best be called a ""chick"" flick, but one they would see alone rather than with a date. At the screening I saw, ALL the raucous laughter was coming from very obviously female voices - falling out of their chairs laughing over what they viewed as stereotypical male behavior - and even as the supposed ""10"" played by Scarlett Johansson reveals herself to be the kind of demanding (insert the word for a female canine here) who a very stupid - make that excessively immature - straight boy (like the one played with supreme élan by author/director Gordon-Levitt) would make a fool of himself over! <br/><br/>The film heavily satirizes stereotypical straight New Jersey Catholics - the easily offended of which should probably stay away along with anyone who expects a slick date night romantic comedy that doesn't require them to THINK - but it IS a beautifully structured and polished first directorial effort and very funny in its way. Man or woman though, it is not your usual DATE film to see with the opposite sex. The litmus scene for the film was probably when Johansson (Barbara) confronts Gordon-Levitt (Jon) over watching porn! Foolishly trying to evoke simple reason, he (accurately) tells her that ""EVERY guy watches porn - and that anyone who says he doesn't is lying."" The theatre got absolutely quiet there for a moment in any section where dates were sitting, as each side wondered what the other was thinking. What YOU may think in that scene will determine a lot about how you view and react to the film. You may enjoy it regardless of what you think of that (for the film) core issue, but you sure won't want to see it with anyone who you can't comfortably talk about it with.<br/><br/>The ""home"" scenes with Jon's family and Barbara's are probably excess baggage, but they give the central characters broad context (the broadest performance in a very stylized film is probably Tony Danza's performance as Jon's father) - and set up the one totally human moment in the film when Jon's silent sister defines what a good sibling should be when she finally has a line! Ultimately, there is one unexpected, rational woman (Julianne Moore giving a remarkable imitation of Susan Sarandon!) who Jon meets in the night class Barbara insists he take who not only ""gets"" him but broadens his horizons for the kind of growth any central character in a good film must have.<br/><br/>Don't expect a pat happy ending or a cheap thought-free throw away comedy (and DON'T make it first date material with someone you don't know yet!), and the open minded will have a wonderful time. My take-away image is really of a few years ago at the first Broadway preview of a Tony winning musical called AVENUE Q. Just before it started, a student of mine at the university where I teach came over to introduce his mother who was seeing the show too, sitting in front of each other all the way over at the side. Midway through the show there was a very funny, very outrageous musical number called ""You Can Be As Loud As You Want"" (When You're making Love). I glanced over to see how my student and his mother were taking it and, as you can imagine, my student, sitting in front of his mother, was sinking onto the floor with embarrassment. What he *couldn't see* was his mother rocking with laughter both at the insouciance of the number and her son's embarrassment! I think my mother (who, as far as I know, probably doesn't approve of pornography) or my minister would be howling with laughter at DON JON too - but they probably wouldn't want anyone they knew to see them doing so.<br/><br/>Recommended - but with noted reservations."
"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","173","242","28 August 2013"," Solid directorial debut by the most likable American actor of his generation, Joseph Gordon-Levitt
","""Don Jon"" (formerly known as ""Don Jon's Addiction"") is the feature directorial debut of the talented and ridiculously charismatic Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He also wrote the script and plays the title character, a young man from New Jersey who's developed: a) an unhealthy addiction to porn; and b) such unrealistic expectations about sex and love (and sex) that not even a ""10"" like Barbara (a hilarious Scarlett Johansson, in what is easily her best work since ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") can satisfy him in real life.<br/><br/>""Don Jon"" reminded me of a great, half-forgotten French film: Bertrand Blier's ""Too Beautiful for You"" (1989). In that film, a wealthy car dealer (Gerard Depardieu) who has everything – including a beautiful wife (Carole Bouquet) – falls for his plain, slightly overweight secretary (Josiane Balasko). ""Don Jon"" is also like Blier's film in the sense that Jon finds his ""10,"" yet he's still unsatisfied. Both films are very different in tone, aesthetics, and geography, but they delicately touch in the realm of our own emotional misconceptions and immaturity. We live in a world where our ever-growing concern about self-image, and the belief that we must abide by unattainable beauty standards in order to find a decent match, have grown so out-of-hand that all we ever do is find obstacles to getting to know anyone who doesn't meet our own ridiculous requirements. We are always waiting for the illusory perfection. Levitt sharply illustrates this issue by way of porn addiction; it might be crude for some, but he manages not to fall into excessive vulgarity or toilet humor.<br/><br/>Also featuring the always wonderful Julianne Moore in an important role, plus Glenne Headly (I've missed her on the big screen), Tony Danza, and Brie Larson as Jon's parents and sister, respectively; ""Don Jon"" is worth the visit. Here's hoping for more JGL directorial efforts!"
"themissingpatient","8","29","36","29 December 2013"," Anti-romantic Comedy
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Jon, a confident, promiscuous, foul-mouthed, obsessive-compulsive, Catholic New Jersey boy. Though he is able to sleep with any woman he likes, which is how his friend's gave him the name Don Jon, he is unable to find the same level of satisfaction he attains through his addiction to online pornography. After meeting Barbara, played by Scarlett Johansson, Jon falls in-love and struggles to choose between her and his addiction.<br/><br/>Where a typical Hollywood romance would end, Don Jon just gets started. This is not a romantic comedy, this is a character-study within an anti-romantic comedy with great performances by an excellent cast in perfectly written roles. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly, as Jon's parents, provide some of the film's biggest laughs while Julianne Moore's character gives the story genuine heart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt proves to be just as talented behind-the-camera as he is in-front of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon does more in one small, 90-minute film than most 2 hour big films have ever accomplished. There is much to learn about relationships in this little tale yet it's never preachy and it keeps the laughs coming. This isn't the kind of film couples will feel comfortable or even want to see but it's the film they need to see. It's sincere and honest truth, no fluff."
"starsandpopcorn","7","95","132","5 October 2013"," Sex, love and pornography.
","As if Joseph Gordon-Levitt couldn't get any better. The former child star has turned into quite the up-and-coming young actor as he's worked to re-brand himself as something more than that kid from 3rd Rock From the Sun. Over the years, he's starred in such films as Brick, The Dark Knight Rises and Looper, and has proved to be the type of actor whom everyone loves - and who actually deserves that love. However, his most impressive performance to date might just be the one he gave behind the camera with Don Jon.<br/><br/>The film marks Levitt's first time writing and directing a feature- length film, and it makes one hell of an impression, especially because he tackles the lead role as well. Don Jon is one of those movies that has plenty of laughs and a few heartfelt moments, and it's certainly entertaining. But it also touches on a few interesting social issues. I think I'll just go ahead and say it, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives away a few trade secrets, much to the horror of men everywhere: Don Jon touches on that dreadfully embarrassing fact that every guy is terrified will come out. What secret is that? Well, it's probably best to put it in the words of the protagonist, Jon, himself: ""Every guy looks at porn, every day.""<br/><br/>Well, that last part might be a bit of an exaggeration, but Don Jon does bring up the point that pornography has become so readily available through the internet and even television that it's just simply within arm's reach at every single second of every single day, and every guy now and then reaches out to take a handful. However, society still treats it as something shameful and embarrassing, rather than a fact of life.<br/><br/>Don Jon doesn't treat the use of pornography as something that should destroy relationships or cause significant others to fly off the handle in fits of jealousy. In fact, the movie seems to indicate, it's a habit that's probably pretty healthy. That isn't to say that Jon has a healthy habit, as he's reduced to having to look at pornography constantly throughout the day, even after sex, but you know, that's an extreme example.<br/><br/>Then again, maybe it isn't. Maybe the film offers a bit of a warning about how a little pornography is perfectly normal, but a lot can create a monster. Too much porn can make it so that it's nearly impossible to connect with someone else on a meaningful level. After all, watching too much sex can create expectations that are as unrealistic as the ones the romantic comedies create.<br/><br/>What really impressed me about Don Jon, though, are the performances that Levitt pulls out of his co-stars. I've honestly never seen Scarlett Johansson give a better performance than she did as Jon's trashy New Jersey girlfriend, Barbra. She's absolutely despicable as she slowly begin to reveal her true intentions and tries to paint Jon as the bad guy when she discovers his addiction. On top of that, Tony Danza gives a side-splitting performance as Jon's hot-headed father who gets into dick-measuring contest with his son every Sunday night (figurative, people, come on).<br/><br/>However, the most impressive of them all is Levitt himself, who has repeatedly proved that he is one hell of an actor and one who has earned my trust as a moviegoer. The role is something so far from what I would have ever pictured him portraying, but he pulls it off beautifully as he plays the scumbag good-guy stereotype.<br/><br/>Now for the hard part. I really enjoyed Don Jon. It strikes as a solid balance between art and entertainment, it's filled with lots of laughs and it touches on a sensitive topic in a way that doesn't seem preachy. The ending is a little weak, but everything up until that is golden. However, I'm not sure if it's what one would call a date movie, since it will probably lead to inquisitive stares during a quiet car ride home afterward. And honestly, that's really too bad. For the people that are willing to embrace the fact that everyone looks at porn, this movie is well worth the price of admission. However, I'm not sure if most of its value comes from the first viewing. It's no Shame, but there's really no shame in that."

","I saw this at a pre-screening for SXSW and I was really impressed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really holds his own as a writer/director, and it was nice to see him in a role I hadn't really considered him ""right"" for. Scarlett Johansen and Julianne Moore are both wonderful as well. Basically, you should see this if you get the chance. It's funny, charming, different, and tells a great story that ends up going in a direction I hadn't anticipated.<br/><br/>This movie basically tells the story of a young guido (Gordon-Levitt) who has a porn addiction and ends up in a relationship with Scarlett Johansen's character. One thing leads to another, blah blah blah.... you'll see when you see it. I don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>Anyway, yeah! Really good movie, great directorial debut, and a well told story. I'd recommend this film."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","83","124","9 October 2013"," One of the Most Confident Films You'll Ever See
","Don Jon (2013) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, director and stars as Jon, a twenty-something man who loves women but what he loves even more is watching porn. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) who demands that he gives it up for her. DON JON isn't the greatest film ever made but I will say that I don't recall ever watching a movie that was so confident. Confidence is something most people lack and even most brass movies lack it but DON JON certainly isn't afraid to say what it wants to and stick by it. Having a romantic comedy that says watching porn is better than being with women and then tells you why that's the case is something incredibly rare. What's even rarer is that this type of subject is usually just played for cheap laughs but here there's a complete story wrapped around it that asks a lot of questions, gives a lot of answers and as I said, is 100% confident about itself. The confidence just really jumps off the screen unlike any movie I've ever seen and that's where the original aspect of this film comes. There have been countless movies that downplay women but this one here just does so in such a fresh and original way that you can't help but enjoy it. It also is very smart about guys, their mentality on sex and various other issues. Gordon-Levitt does a wonderful job all around but especially in the acting department. As the writer he certainly knows this character very well but it still takes a very strong performance to get that to the screen and the actor does a fabulous job. Johansson also turns in her greatest work outside of a Woody Allen picture and Tony Danza is very memorable in his supporting bit as is Glenne Headly and Julianne Moore. The screenplay is certainly dirty and covers a lot of topics but the film never crosses the offensive line. The main reason it doesn't cross the line is that it remains smart no matter what it's saying and how dirty it's being said. DON JON is certainly a refreshing film that should get one excited thinking that Gordon-Levitt could turn into someone to keep your eye on not just as an actor but as a writer and director."
"joshh2007","8","18","23","11 November 2013"," A powerful insight into the modern day mans psyche towards women and relationships
","The first half hour of this film makes you feel quite uncomfortable, I saw a pre-screening with my girlfriend and It made me feel a little tense as I wasn't able to gauge how she was perceiving what she was watching.<br/><br/>There are a lot of sexually orientated scenes, cut scenes from porn movies, scenes of our protagonist Jon getting off with a hell of a lot of women. Scarlett Johansson's arrival doesn't slow any of this down, despite her being cast in the archetypical female role. That being the girl Jon is going to give up his wicked ways for. I won't spoil how this ultimately pans out. Around this point the humour kicks in and I must say there are quite a few laugh out loud scenes. Jon's relationship with his family in particular and just his strange character in general provide a good comedic vibe. <br/><br/>This film will not be for everybody. Those faint hearted souls who wont be able to stand anything more offensive than the solitary use of the F word, well you guys should certainly pass this by. Overall the F word is used in excess of 120 times in this picture for starters. For me, as the film plays out the sexual cut scenes begin to have more substance. They start to mean more than just the showing of perverse acts, I believe what JGL was trying to show was an insight into how modern day men perceive women and relationships. How expectations are raised by pornography and advertising to create an image that will never be fulfilled in normal life. <br/><br/>In some ways the film ends a bit of a damp squib, despite being an enjoyable ride there is somehow a lack of conviction in the ending. Our 'hero' does see the error of his ways, but it could have been done more convincingly in my opinion. All in all though this is a solid directorial debut from JGL, there seems to be a real pace about the film from beginning to end. The way the dialogue is delivered and the temperament of the characters keeps things running steady and keeps you hooked.<br/><br/>Definite recommendation from me."
"bill_the_butcher7","6","17","23","1 January 2014"," 'Don Jon' Puts Jersey Spin on Romantic Comedies
","New Jersey guy Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) only cares about a few things in his life: his family, friends, church, and porn. After many one-night-stands, he finally decides to settle down with a ""dime"" named Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). But not even this relationship can compare to the happiness Jon has when alone with his pornography. When he realizes his porn may be too influential on him, he begins to change his lifestyle and beliefs with help from an older woman (Julianne Moore).<br/><br/>Stories of sex addiction aren't new, having been dealt with most recently in 2011's Shame, but Don Jon feels different. Jon loves porn; he says it many times in voice-over and is consistently shown getting up in the middle of the night to go watch porn after just having sex in real life. He doesn't see it as an addiction, saying ""It's porn. It's not heroin,"" as his excuse. To show the media influence on sex, the film opens by crosscutting many sexualized commercials, film scenes, and television clips over the credits, while actual pornography clips are spliced throughout. But unlike Shame, which treats this topic in an intense, dramatic way, Jon keeps it light, funny, and tries to show how easy it is for someone to unknowingly fall into this addiction in today's sex- obsessed culture.<br/><br/>The film also tackles an exploration of today's relationships. Barbara's own ""porn"" is romantic Hollywood films that Jon hates. These films have influenced Barbara's ideas on dating (she yells at him to stop cleaning his apartment because it's not sexy) and enforced her beliefs that typical gender roles are the only means to a happy relationship. This film speaks truths about ideas young people may have about dating in today's culture, and while spinning these topics in a mostly comedic light, it is still interesting to consider how much media pertains to our understanding of the world.<br/><br/>Don Jon succeeds in most areas, and one large part is due to its cast. Tony Danza is really funny as Jon's father and Scarlett Johansson (and her hilarious Jersey accent) steals every scene she in. The film offers up a good amount of laughs, and the purposeful repetitive narrative works in showing Jon's changing lifestyle. Most of the film is so upbeat and fast that the last twenty minutes may feel like its dragging, but it can be considered necessary due to Jon's slowed-down new lifestyle.<br/><br/>The fact that this is the first film by writer-director Gordon-Levitt is extremely impressive. Don Jon flies at a mostly fast pace, has a fun cast, and gives a great commentary on sex, relationships, and addiction."
"cultfilmfan","10","109","182","7 October 2013"," Don Jon
","Don Jon, was a film that I had to be a little patient with. What first started as a vulgar, raucous and teen oriented film having little more than jokes involving perverseness and sexual humour and was something that I figured I had wasted my money on, turned out to completely surprise me and ended up as one of my favourite films of this year. Yes, the film does have a lot of sexual humour and content in it, but it has some reason to, seeing as the film is dealing with addiction to pornography. And what may have seemed immature and like teenage humour for the first little bit of the film, soon went away and it became one of the most insightful and intelligent films of the year. I have heard the comparisons to this film from 2011's Steve McQueen directed film, Shame which is also about sexual addiction. Unfortunately, I have not seen Shame yet. I missed it at theatres and every time I go to the library to rent it, it is out, so for obvious reasons I can not compare the two of them. Don Jon, did have a lot to say both about young men and women, sex and relationships. It's the kind of film you would almost want younger teens to see in order to learn something and perhaps plan their own lives and future relationships a little more differently. Here the internet pornography sites serve as a form of escape for this main character and while he likes being around women, he can not connect with them in the same way as he feels he can with things he sees on the computer. This further complicates things for himself because what we see on the internet and in magazines often times are things that are made to look perfect, beautiful and however you want to put it, but other than just looking at it, there is no real connection, or relationship to it. It is hollow and empty and void of any emotional connection or feelings to another person. Perhaps that is why this character can not relate to real women. Everything up to now has been completely empty and void of any feeling, or connection and in his mind if he doesn't have to attach himself in any way to a real woman, he wonders what the point of that is. Throughout the course of the film, our lead character, Jon, meets two very different women, who will both change his outlook and outcome of his way of handling relationships and finding truer meaning to both himself and others as well. The film while crude and a little graphic at times, is far more into psychological and character study than one may think and it is one of the most insightful and accurate looks at young, or basically any type of relationships that I have seen in a long time. Jon, is with one woman who seems to be his dream woman, but right from the start we do not really like her, or at least I didn't. She herself had an unrealistic view of relationships that was more about status symbols and image than about real love for one another as well. The other woman we meet knows more about relationships and more about Jon himself than he may want to admit, or care for her to know, but there is a whole different type of connection and intimacy level there. The film shows that so often young men treat women as sexual objects and fantasies and actually how we can be so demeaning and almost sexist towards them. At the same time, this selfish attitude hurts other people and ourselves because we can not truly ever find anything that is real if we continue on this way because everything has to be perfect, or just like it is on movies, magazines, or the internet and it gives us a false distortion of reality, relationships and other people. The film is the first film written and directed by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose acting has impressed me over the years, especially in films like Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. Now he shows that he can not only act, but write and direct as well. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour, but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. It examines these people and what is really behind them and the hurts, or the things they have been through and it is honest both about men, women and relationships in general. As the film ended, I could totally understand the way the film ended and why Levitt, decided to do it in that way. It felt realistic for his character, but at the same time also connected to beauty and happiness. I enjoyed the screenplay and direction immensely as well as the performances were all quite good as well. I liked the quick jump cut editing and the film's use of music in certain scenes, I felt worked really well also. I know some viewers will be turned off by the material and subject matter, but it really is a film worth seeing if you are in a relationship, or even if you are not and this is a film that definitely has something to say. I look forward to future writing and directing projects for Levitt, and as it stands Don Jon, is one of 2013's best and maybe most misunderstood films as well."

","Joseph Gordon Levitt proves he can act and direct at the same time. Bringing Tony Danza back (in a different more extreme Dad role than most know him from) was a great move too. But the movie is all about JGL performance. In front and behind the camera, choosing how to cut a movie together that some might call pornography (though it isn't, it's a movie about addiction).<br/><br/>Sex addiction is something that people take very lightly, making fun of it most of the time. But it can be more serious than that. And Don Jon proves that in a very comical way. Where Michael Fassbender went on and played it like a drama (equally good at least in ""Shame""), this movie is lighter in tone most of the time. Still having drama to sit through, but the comic moments, make this an easier film to watch. If you don't mind the sexual theme it has, you will get a powerful movie about the Downfalls of addiction"

","Usually when watching movies, even new ones, you can feel that even though they send an interesting message and make you think, often their context is already outdated.<br/><br/>Not so Don Jon, the problems here seem more actual than ever in our generation. Media and commercials are giving people ideas how their life should be and in consequence how their partner should be.<br/><br/>Of course, this differs according to gender just like this movie shows - girls, growing up with Disney movies and romantic comedies, are taught that they need to find the perfect boy with a good salary, the wish for a family, and of course so romantic that he basically can fulfill her every wish without her even telling. Boys, on the other hand, are conditioned by the omnipresence of pornography, starting with naked women in commercials and music videos up to internet porn that creates exact expectations on how their girlfriends should look like and how they need to perform for them in order to get pleasure.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this ""one-sidedness"" on both sides creates a contrast that makes many relationships struggle just like we can see it in this movie - Barbara, the young, gorgeous woman played by Scarlett Johansson, sets all her demands on her boyfriend clear on the beginning, while Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who could have every girl he wanted does not even get the satisfaction he needs from this ""perfect girl"" alone.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a very good psychological analysis of today's society. Although it might contain content some people might view as offensive and you shouldn't probably be watching it with your family or small children, it gives a lot to think about."

","This movie is worth every second of your time to watch it. Joseph Gordon- Levitt did an amazing job and created a piece of art. Visually rich and interesting, great cast and a truly beautiful story, I believe it to be timeless. It's a movie I intend to review in a few years because I think that our life's perspectives change the way we look into it, and I'm sure that I'll discover something new about it in a few years and a little more life experience. Scarlett Johansson was amazing and breathtaking. Julianne Moore played a very interesting role in this movie and I believe she managed to capture the essence of her character. She makes you fall in love right away. Julianne and Joseph had such a great screen chemistry, it was amazing. The ending gave me the best feeling I could hope for! With unexpected twists, the story takes you smoothly to the real world, for the best part of it, and the best you can have of human relations. Also it makes you see and love the human being as a whole, with its cracks and flaws, its weaknesses and its greatness. I tried to express myself the best I could but I'm not an English native speaker and on top of that this movie has so much to talk about and it's so rich!!"

","Sing-a-long – ""It's such a – good vibration It's such a – sweeeet sensation."" Marky-Mark's Good Vibration serves as a very apt soundtrack to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut Don Jon, as the dramedy immerses itself within the art of adult entertainment If you're not quite with me, never mind.<br/><br/>Levitt pops his director cherry and for his first time behind the camera, he delivers a bravely honest depiction of male sexuality, as his character Jon takes a bazooka to the erotic taboo: porn. Nicknamed Don Jon by his meathead mates for his ability to woo the women, our New Jersey lothario is a porn-junkie who prefers ""beating it"" to the real thing. ""Unlike porn, real pussy can kill you"", says the Don, and with justification like that, who can argue?<br/><br/>Although it favours a cartoonish superficiality over the refinement and sophistication of Shame, McQueen's movie of similar narrative sort, it totally works as entertainment anyway.<br/><br/>Just when the confession-goer believes that no woman can fulfil his carnal desires in the same way that porn can, enter Barbara Sugarman, a Scarlett Johansson gone ghetto as she chumps of chewing-gum and sports the slick street vibe. On a scale of one-to-ten, our blonde bombshell scores a ""dime"" and Don Jon is convinced she is the answer to his prayers. Finally, our masturbation-addict begins a serious relationship with something other than his computer.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt takes a confident first step on the road to what looks to be an equally illustrious career behind the camera. Will it win an Oscar? Probably not – but as Jon remarks, ""They give awards for porn too."" Go on, feel the vibration.<br/><br/>www.moviematrix.co.uk"

"SundSideUp","9","29","51","26 September 2013"," There's a lot to like about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as Writer/Director and as starring actor.
","(This review is based on an advanced screening at the Revere Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts.)<br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way right from the start: if you will be offended by a movie with lots of F-bombs and/or one that's about a guy from Jersey who's addicted to porn—or more specifically, masturbating to porn —then Don Jon isn't for you. That said, there's a lot to like about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as Writer/Director and as starring actor.<br/><br/>Don Jon doesn't waste any time letting us know what it's about. There's nothing subtle in an opening that shows Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Jon Martello, masturbating to porn. His matter-of-fact voice-over explains precisely what he likes about getting off to porn and why he prefers the women on the screen to actual warm-bodied women in his bed. His friends call him 'Don', though, because he manages to score 'dimes'—meaning a '10'—whenever they go out.<br/><br/>Enter Scarlett Johansson (for whom Gordon-Levitt wrote the role) as Barbara, a 10 in any movie, but especially in this one. It's a jolt initially to hear her accent—which some argue sounds more like one from Staten Island—but if you're not from New Jersey, you won't have a problem with it. Barbara is the game changer for Jon, perfect in every way, except for one minor problem: she's not happy about the porn.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore and Tony Danza round out a stellar cast that includes cameos from Channing Tatum, Anne Hathaway, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. Danza plays Jon's dad in a performance reminiscent of (and just as strong as) Robert De Niro's fatherly role in Silver Linings Playbook. Moore plays a middle-aged student in a night class with Jon. She provides an older woman foil for Jon's girlfriend/porn issues—someone other than his buddies and family to heckle and care for him. Moore gives a layered performance, ably demonstrating the disappearing effect of age when hanging out with students half her age, gracefully revealing that there is much more under the tender shell of her character Esther than Jon can possibly imagine. donjon1 Gordon-Levitt's screenplay is solid and well structured, built around themes like the fact that Jon Martello is a devout Catholic. With welcome regularity, we see Jon back on the pew with his family, followed by a weekly rendezvous in the confessional in which he itemizes his sexual transgressions to the priest on the other side—the number of times he had sex out of wedlock, how many times he masturbated to porn, etc. The next scene invariably shows him in the gym working out to the prescribed number of Hail Marys and Our Fathers (and we get to peek at just how buff Gordon-Levitt has been keeping himself). The laughs get louder every time the screenplay whips around to this place keeper, and we fall into pace with Jon and his routine as we get to know him.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt takes what should be a ridiculous premise for a movie and through strong writing and directing outputs a sincere plot. Though full of the American Pie-style humor requisite for a story about masturbation, Don Jon more importantly takes its characters (and us) somewhere—and it's not where you think. In the wasteland of cookie- cutter movie plots, Don Jon's story is a breath of fresh air—one that makes us laugh, makes us think, makes us cringe, and makes us come out wanting more from Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
"tedbennett_88","8","10","15","30 December 2013"," A film about relationships and porn and for the first time Julianne Moore doesn't show us her tits.
","Don Jon is Joseph Gordon-Levitts first run as a writer-Director and already I can see his potential. He has a strong sense for character and friendship development which is played in the film nicely, his two main buddies are realistic everyday guys and you feel like they have known each other for years. Scarlett Johansson's character is a 'Princess' and very well played, the couple works and it's nice to see real relationships in cinema, you don't always have to find the one. His family are chaotic and fit perfectly into this world and Julianne Moore smashes her performance yet again but I feel her story leaves you a little confused.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt's use of light was great, Having Scarlett Johansson's light react to Jon's feelings towards her is an interesting move that doesn't detract the viewer from the story, also the panning shot reverse shot is definitely something I am going to have a go at soon.<br/><br/>The story works for me and I like the repetition throughout the film, I would and will recommend this film to anyone, it has many layers that will appeal to all audiences."

","Joseph Gordon Levitt isn't just a dreamy actor anymore, he is officially a cinematographic artist. I am thoroughly impressed with his directorial and screen writing talents. He did an astounding job considering it was the first feature film he has ever directed. Although the idea of making a movie about a sex addict is a little risk-ay, JGL worked it into something really special. Don Jon isn't just another love story or addiction drama, it is about a man who isn't capable of getting ""lost"" in another person, a man who has trouble sexually connecting with women. This film was visually very striking and beautifully executed. Hats off to Thomas Kloss for his wonderful cinematography. Overall I definitely felt some 'good vibrations' and will not be able to get JGL's multiple sex faces off my brain for some time. -absolutely not suitable for children"

I highly advise NOT to watch this movie with a girlfriend, because it can be VERY awkward. <br/><br/>However,the movie itself contained a very important message, about how the media affected our vision of relationships. Don just wanted real life to be like internet pornography and his girlfriend just wanted life to be like romantic movies. This causes unreal expectations of the opposite sexes. I felt very attacked by the movie and so should a lot of other young people be. because movies can be fun, but a great movie deals with topics that surround us, like drugs, violence and religion."

","""It's not that I can't stop I just figure why should I...it's not like I'm cheating on her."" Jon (Gordon-Levitt) has a fun group of friends and is passionate about a few things. One of which is porn. Because of this obsession he is unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. When he meets Barbara (Johansson) he thinks he found the perfect girl. Little by little he begins to wonder if he will ever feel about a woman the way he feels about his porn. First off I will have to say that this is not for everyone. If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isn't necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this won't be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame. Overall, a very well done and good movie that won't be given a chance by many people because of the subject. I give it a B+."
"maurice_yacowar","8","12","19","24 October 2013"," Porn addict learns sensitivity.
","In Don Jon writer/director/star Joseph Gordon-Levitt evades the shallows of both romantic comedy and hardcore porn by moving from isolating artifice to a genuine human engagement. His opening clip of a cartoon announces the silliness, flatness and artificiality of hero Jon's (Gordon-Levitt) life. At the end he and a mature woman have started ""to get lost together."" <br/><br/>Initially Jon and his two buddies indulge adolescent rankings of the women they see and lust after and that Jon has the unfortunate luck to enjoy seriatim. But the other characters are also locked into mechanical behaviour. His father, Jon Sr (Tony Danza), shows where Jon Jr gets his anger, profanity and fear of human connection. Where Junior retreats to porn for fulfillment Dad invests his -- preferred fantasy -- life in his large-screen NFL coverage. He's too Old School for Tivo. Jon's mother (Glenne Headly) is locked into her reflex role, submissive housewife yearning to become a submissive granny. In her ultimate revolt she shuts off the macho TV.<br/><br/>Two women shake Jon Jr out of his reliance on porn to complete his hyper-successful but failed sex life. The first, emblematically named Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), manipulates his randiness to bring him to heel. She's so perverse she wants him to give up cleaning his (and future their) flat: ""Because it's not sexy, that's why!"" Her submission to romantic fantasies parallels his to porn. Both kinds of movies, like the TV ads, exploit a shallow sexuality to desensitizing effect. When she finds he's still dependent on porn she dumps him. <br/><br/>Jon stumbles into a genuine relationship when he connects to Esther (Julianne Moore), at the night school business class Barbara compelled him to take. Older and both more vulnerable and knowing than Jon, Esther opens him up to exploring someone else, caring for her and trying to make sensitive connections where formerly he performed only ritual responses. Where Barbara's surname evokes indulgence, the Biblical Esther connotes devotion and care. <br/><br/>This relationship is too personal, too serious, too deep to move into conventional labelling. Esther's husband and son were recently killed in a car accident -- presumably by someone else who drives with Jon's rage and danger -- which he also now outgrows. As she brings Jon what he needs to learn he brings her the joy of life that she needs to recover. They may or may not have a future together. The film refuses us the conventional happy ending, whether the gauzy wedding of Barbara's genre or the money shot of Jon's. The point is that each has brought the other the open honest connection they need now. For more go to www.yacowar.blogspot.com."
"nathanlemin","9","15","25","23 October 2013"," Unafraid and believable
","Despite one of the most awkward movie openings I've ever been witness to, Jo Levitt's Don Jon hits. It hits hard. With nothing held back, Levitt makes his directorial debut a deeper than realized and very realistic dramatic comedy. The romance is raw and current, not laced with bullshit anecdotes of what love is, and the comedy is natural and situational. Jon Martello, the lead character (also played by Levitt) is a conceded, underemployed womanizer. We watch as he fumbles to decipher relationships amidst the distraction of deceptive devices such as pornography and Romantic Comedy films. The writing (also done by Levitt) very skillfully crafts a cast of authentic characters that aren't exactly bright, or even likable. The film is composed of a few scenes that repeat at different stages of Jon's life during the time of his relationship with Barbara (played by Scarlett Johansson). The scenes are representative of the things he ""really cares about in life"" and how those things change as he wises up on relationships. If a Jersey bartender who works out more than works and is—let's be honest—kind of a douchebag can figure out a little bit about how to love it gives the rest of us some hope. Cheers JGL."
"trublu215","8","16","27","26 September 2013"," A solid comedy with a surprising amount of heart
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has knocked it out of the park with this directorial debut. Don Jon is funny, touching, raunchy and is definitely worth the price of admission. The film explores the relationship between a porn addicted ladies man and a woman that thinks he can change him for the better. Don Jon's strengths are not only in it's unique story, but in the performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an award worthy performance as the titular character, playing him not just as a Jersey Shore wannabe with shallow interests, but someone that is more than what they seem. He brings heart and charm to a character who is, in any traditional sort of sense, unlikable. Scarlett Johanssen is truly remarkable as Barbara, a beautiful and mouthy woman who looks to change Don Jon for the better in hopes that she will ride off in the sunset with him. The supporting cast, which includes the likes of Tony Danza and Julianne Moore, keep the film interesting even when the Jon and Barbara story line begins to wear a bit thin towards the third act.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of this film, is the cynical take on Hollywood romantic comedies. Don Jon is a film that does not follow the Hollywood archetypal romantic comedy formula, instead, it relishes in making the genre a joke, including a mock film starring Channing Tatum. Gordon- Levitt establishes his cynical nature in the trailer of the film but that is nothing compared to the fun this film has with the genre clichés.<br/><br/>This is a film that will catch a lot of people by surprise, it is funny, heartfelt and very intriguing. The best way to describe this film is a funny and more audience friendly version of the brilliant 2011 Steve McQueen film, Shame. It will make you laugh, it will make you cringe but most of all, it won't make you feel that bad about spending the twelve dollar ticket."

This movie was simply brutal and not funny.<br/><br/>I lasted through 45 minutes of it until I had enough and left the movie theater. Not once during this film did I even chuckle. The humor in this movie boils down to: recycled ""bro"" jokes, rehashed ""guido""/""Jersey Shore"" humor, and audio/visual vulgarity.<br/><br/>Had this movie been the least bit funny, I would have lasted throughout the whole thing. This movie is not ""brilliant"", and completely fails to be funny in any way, shape, or form. I appreciate films for being done well from technical aspects (It was part of my major at college), but this movie was simply not funny and was entirely too repetitive.<br/><br/>If you want to stare at Scarlet Johansson or see boobs, just stay at home and look at porn by yourself.

One night stand after one night stand the main character is never satisfied so of course turns to porn in order to get himself off. Eventually he gets into a destructive relationship while pursuing sex with someone and finds he is still unsatisfied and looks for the purity that he finds from porn in a sexual partner. He gradually explores himself as well as some interesting people along the way and changes for the better.<br/><br/>The End<br/><br/>""Critique""<br/><br/>I thought the movie was crap, I wanted to walk out of the theatre and thats never happened before. First off the display of porn is so over exaggerated to be borderline ridiculous. The accents in the movie were nerve grating and made my ears bleed and were so terribly done people in New jersey should be offended. The Main actor in the movie was alright and Tony was epic in his performance but every other person portrayed in the movie were rank amateurs and it was really hard to believe anything.<br/><br/>So in total I think this sums it up best, Stupidest movie I've ever seen to the point where it was the only movie I ever wanted to walk out of the theatre.

","Halfway through Don Jon, the point of its madness all hit me; this is the Easy Rider (1969) of Generation Y. To explain, Don Jon is pure social satire. Joseph Gordon ""The Situation"" Levitt's directing debut is a mirror into what our generation is. Not what's wrong or right with it, just a mirror. And like the reflection in said proverbial mirror, you either like what you see, or don't.<br/><br/>Jon, nicknamed ""The Don"" due to his skill of always picking up at least 8's every night, meets and subsequently falls in love with the girl of his dreams. He then must come to terms with his routine-infested little life, the superfluous B.S. that comes with having a relationship these days and, oh right, his porn addiction. I suppose it goes without saying that there is gratuitous explicit dialogue and pornographic clips intertwined into the story. <br/><br/>Don Jon is visually exceptional and expediently acted. It's editing is off the Richter scale and its comedy is as tongue-in-cheek as it gets. Don Jon pings and fizzes with energy and feels positively alive. For that, Don Jon gets two stars. And one bonus star for being truly original, both in its seismic delivery and its tenacity.<br/><br/>There's a clear sense that Don Jon has been honed for people that love film, in that it's singular purpose is to inspire thought and discussion. It's message is 100% subjective. Unfortunately, and perhaps in and effort to highlight its point as a satire, Don Jon has a story with all the cohesion and structure of balsa wood. There is no background, buildup, climax, or falling action. Don Jon fails on the premise of basic storytelling. And that is unforgivable.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this movie WILL be looked upon years from now as a concealed insight to our psyche. I know this may sound excessive, given this movie's La-De-La approach, but look past what's on the surface. And you'll be looking at us. You may just not know it yet."

Don't get me wrong, I like all of the actress/actors in this film. I'm blaming this one on the writing. The plot could be summed up in one sentence or about 5 minutes. I think that's why so many porn clips were added in-to make it longer and seem cutting-edge. The only thing cutting edge about this film is how much porn was shown and it was only rated R.

","If you want to go to a movie where you are assaulted with 90 minutes of almost non-stop vulgarity, the characters (with the exception apparently of the Catholic priest who's never on camera) saying ""f'ck"" seemingly every alternate word, if you want to see a movie about a man unrepentantly absorbed with pornography and the relentless objectification of women, then you might want to see ""Don Jon."" The movie is no doubt a hit on the coasts but in fly-over country where I live (albeit, 250 mi from the coast) there was a grand total of four people who attended the viewing I went to. I was going to walk out after the first 30 minutes but managed to doze off for a bit.<br/><br/>The movie is probably going to be compared to ""Auto Focus"", the bio-pic about Bob Crane and his sex addiction and murder. ""Auto Focus"" is far superior and it shows how a man's life falls apart due to his obsession. ""Don Jon"" takes the attitude that sex addiction is just no big deal. By the end of the movie Jon seems to have found a woman he can connect with but you also know he has absolutely no inclination whatsoever to quit his porn obsession."

"edgereviews","9","8","12","11 January 2014"," An excellent social commentary on today's relationships....
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has already proved he's one of the most talented actors in Hollywood right now. With Don Jon, he's setting out to prove he's just as good at writing and directing, with this being his directorial debut. By choosing to make a movie about porn addiction, he picked a pretty risky subject to centre his first film on but he pulls it off perfectly, giving us a vision of what will hopefully be an outstanding directorial career for JGL.<br/><br/>Don Jon features an incredibly original story written by JGL, that has a lot more to it than is alluded to in the trailers. It's more than your average rom-com; it's intelligently written and has some great social commentary on relationships in today's society. The characters are extremely well developed, and a lot of them took unexpected turns. In fact, the whole last third of the movie took a very unexpected turn, because although the trailers show a lot of the major events of the first part of the movie, none of this last third is shown so it completely comes up out of nowhere. I'm sure there are many people who won't like this surprise but I thought it was great, and something that many movies today wouldn't dare to do. Even though the trailers show a lot, it still feels fresh and unique whilst watching, which is really a testament to JGL's great skill. If I had to pick a negative, it would be that the film seems to end very abruptly. I was really enjoying it, wondering where it would go next but then it was suddenly over. I don't think it was necessarily a bad place to end, it was just very unexpected.<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding, it's a shame that this years Oscar race is already so crowded because there are some award-worthy performances here that probably won't get recognition. JGL hits it out of the park as he always does, never failing to impress. I was very surprised by Scarlett Johansson, in the past I've always thought she was just good, but in Don Jon she's excellent. Another noteworthy mention is Brie Larson, who has about three lines of dialogue in the whole film but still impressed me, she does a great job just using facial expressions and is often very funny.<br/><br/>I've already said how JGL does an excellent job writing and acting, but that would mean nothing if he wasn't able to get the directing right. That's not the case though, as he does a phenomenal job directing. The soundtrack is great, the editing is incredibly sharp and there's some great cinematography. If JGL continues to direct like this (and let's hope he does) then we're in for a treat."
"sniperx360","8","8","12","22 December 2013"," A few tweaks from greatness!
","I really liked Don Jon. I love every second on this screen, but its what is not on screen that cap its' potential. This movie had potential to be wonderful and charming while still vulgar and real much like Silver Linings Playbook, but better. The two of these films line up very closely, but Silver Linings takes much more time on the characters ultimately leading to a better film.<br/><br/>Let me first say how much I enjoyed the premise of this movie. The premise is only porn. That's it. It moves from many different sub-stories within that that form one comprehensive story. This premise is absolutely genius. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fantastic job here as he dives deeper into each layer and giving new perspectives every few scenes. The plot of this is very simple, yet complex, much like the ideology of porn. There is something about it that is simple and easy (to access or rid), but there is always something bringing us back, and we don't know what that is.<br/><br/>Here is where the movie falls short though. Standing at 90 minutes, Don Jon lacks depth. We see many main characters and we are only scratching the surface with them. Julianne Moore and Scarlet Johansson's characters both are very interesting, yet we only see them for face value. We see a broken Julianne Moore through her interactions, but never dive fully into her brokenness. We see a sheltered Scarlet who upon confrontation refuses to accept reality and goes about her way. Primarily though, we see Jon. We go through all these changes in concrete and perspective with him. Jon is a very relateable and venerable character. His perspective is the only true depth we get. We go through his trials every step of the way and every step brings a new perspective we did not see before whether it be something unnoticed through Scarlet, Julianne, the Church, or even his workout routine.<br/><br/>When it is time for the movie to end, JGL takes 5 minutes to wrap everything up. The way this is great because it shows the true unfinishedness of life and choices, but the problem is we don't get enough of the other characters for the ending to make a real impact. If these characters were explored throughout the movie for total of 30 minutes extra, the impact would be phenomenal. I love the way the film ends, but it seems rushed. With an extra 10 minutes to see Jon pour himself into these other characters, I would have been much more satisfied.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Don Jon is great, but with an extra 40 minutes of completing characters, this could have been exemplary. Silver Linings Playbook spend an hour more and had about the same amount of story. It was that extra filler that really made the movie great, but it was missing relatability. Silver Linings was wonderful, but I felt a real connection with the character of Jon. I gave Silver Linings a 9/10 and I give Don Jon an 8/10, but with more character, this could have easily been a 10/10."
"justinktobin","10","8","12","21 December 2013"," Don Jon, one of the raunchiest comedies of 2013
","Don Jon is one of the raunchiest comedies of 2013. We're The Miller's is also one of them. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a porn addict living in New Jersey, the story is about his day to day life which is preoccupied by taking care of his pad, his ride, spending time with his family, his church, his boys, his girls, and his porn.<br/><br/>The first line in the film makes way for what to expect, when Jon presses the power button on his Macintosh laptop and – referring to the start up chime – says ""this sound, gets me hard as a f***in' rock."" Filled with pornographic images and used tissue paper for clean up, and his brutally honest narration about his behaviour and with his confessions to his priest, makes this film very raunchy.<br/><br/>There's plenty of hilarious dialogue, and visuals. He works out while reciting Our Father's and Hail Mary's, looks at porn on his cell phone while attending a night school class, and when caught by his girlfriend looking at porn, he denies it and says that only losers look at porn, and he was simply looking at a joke video that somebody sent him over the internet. His says his record for masturbating is 11 times a day.<br/><br/>He's often seen being frustrated in traffic while driving his retro Chevy Malibu SS, and at one point gets out of his vehicle to confront another driver, smashing his rear driver side window and cutting his hand in the process.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson's character gives some comical lines too. At one point she confronts Jon for looking at 46 porn sites in one day. He denies it at first, but she traps him by saying it was in his history. He seemingly doesn't know what browser history is, and this makes it all the more comical, as if he only uses his laptop for porn.<br/><br/>The acting by all characters is stellar. Johansson's accent and attitude is well executed, and might be her best acting performance yet. The dinner table scenes with Jon's family are well acted. Jon, his father (Tony Danza), his mother and sister who is often preoccupied with her cellphone throughout the film make way for hilarious chemistry.<br/><br/>Jon's character has an arc, he goes from being a single guy who gets plenty of pussy – but admits that it doesn't quite do it for him when compared to porn – to somebody who can actually make love and be in a committed relationship. There's a love story within the comedy, especially towards the end, with a much older woman played by Julianne Moore.<br/><br/>Don Jon is an excellent comedy, and one that I'll watch over and over again, like listening to a favourite song. The editing is very cool, very snappy at times and is in tandem with the narration. Cinematography is great, with shots of a church and a bright blue sky, cutting to Don Jon running up the church steps, then cutting to him in a confession booth. For a directorial debut, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is off to an awesome start. I look forward to him writing and directing another film.<br/><br/>Another raunchy – albeit serious – film he stars in is Mysterious Skin. I'd also check out Havoc for those that haven't seen it. It's proof that Gordon-Levitt can play a wide variety of characters and is a dynamic actor."
"nikola-borissov","9","8","12","17 December 2013"," A rare and hilarious, multi-layered insight of the world of the little man
","Well, well, that was quite the surprise! Everything else being said by other reviewers, I'd like to add that it made me realize how rare movies like this are. That is, about the little man. The dumb man. Not the hero, not the intellectual, not the sociopath, not the victim of injustice or any other, you know, *interesting* type. Nothing glamorous, just a regular dumb-ass dude. Italian from Jersey, too. The leads are extremely good, Scarlett Johansson kills it in the part of the uber-stupid and annoying hot chick. The dad was brilliant, too. Beautifully shot, masterfully edited, great pace and structure, the constant cycling of elements beautifully reflects the routine of Jon's painfully ordinary life devoid of anything but satisfying the most basic animal needs. <br/><br/>All the imaginable clichés, all at once and way overdone - fantastic and hilarious! Way better than the trailer would make you think, a skilfully crafted piece of merciless, if light, social satire. Unfortunately, I believe that aspect of the film is being neglected by the audience in favor of the more attention-grabbing element of the porn-addiction, which (in my humble personal opinion) is not at all the leading motif. <br/><br/>Addendum: reading some of the negative reviews posted here made me shiver and remember why I opted to live in the much more liberal EU. I believe Americans have gone waaay too far in the way of obsessively trying to be politically correct. Oh yes, and religious and proper and tidy and non-smoking and all that, too. Not a ""date movie""? What on Earth is a ""date movie""? Offensive and vulgar?! Improper language? I found it as innocent and heart-warming as a little white bunny. Humping a ton of other bunnies, all right, but still :)"

","... unless you like to get bombarded with meaningless porn clips.<br/><br/>Before I went to the movie I checked rotten tomatoes. Critics 82%, audience 71%. It must be good, right, perhaps something like the 40 years old virgin... Wrong! It was awful. Whatever message it had it was lost between between the porn bits. The characters didn't have any depth, they were just stereotypical. The men were libidinous and disgusting, and they didn't have any preoccupation other than scoring women. OK, one guy liked to watch NFL in addition to being libidinous. The women were stereotypical as well, a mother that had to put up for decades with her lewd husband (whose house uniform was a wife-beater), Scarlet's character uneven and controlling (in her world her man becomes a puppet in exchange for being provided with an object of desire or love, and sex services), the sister who texted the whole movie, and, well, Juliane's character, artificial, ready to give advice and live sessions about the art of sex and love making to a stranger (yeah, like that happens a lot to other guys - I know, I am just envious).<br/><br/>A recurring theme was to take a poke at the catholic church. These days it seems fashionable to do it over the different channels, but for the life of me I am not too sure why the guy bothered to go to church. Or perhaps, they were making fun of the people going to church, being hypocrite and all. Well, it kind of got as tiring as the porn clips, the scenes with the guy making his bed or throwing napkins in the garbage bin after masturbation sessions.<br/><br/>If I were a woman, I would probably feel uncomfortable watching this movie, if I were a feminist I would probably bring my boom box to the theater."

","Ever since '3rd Rock from the Sun"", Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been proving himself as a serious actor, and this time he's proved himself to be a serious writer and director too. 'Don Jon' is probably one the most sincere and unpretentiously great films I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>I expected to see a romantic comedy with a slight twist, but what 'Don Jon' ended up to be was a real character study of a contemporary young adult male of today, riding through different genres with ease and ending with a real moral of the story (which is kind of a rarity these days). What started out as a self indulgent mild-shock-flick on the verge of porn (during the first ten minutes or so, I really thought I'd hate the rest of the film), soon turned romantic comedy, then drama and ended up as an accurate and a very colorful portrait of a young man today sorting out his issues.<br/><br/>Though it may seem sexist and over the top, I honestly found myself in a lot of situations JGL displays in 'Don Jon', and I believe many men will. For such an unpretentious feature, it made me think about myself more than most other films recently, and that certainly can't be a bad thing.<br/><br/>It might not be the best film ever (it may not even be the best film of the year, for that matters), but I can honestly say I really loved it.

"PassPopcorn","8","9","14","16 November 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","Don Jon is young actor's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as a director and a writer. I always admired Gordon-Levitt as an actor (in addition to writing and directing Don Jon, he also plays the title role) and I was eager to see how he would handle the director's/writer's chair. And I must say, Gordon-Levitt didn't disappoint: Don Jon is a rather sweet and entertaining movie that deals with the sensitive subject of pornography – a subject you'll won't see frequently tackled in mainstream movies. I wouldn't go as far as to call Don Jon a revolutionary movie, but it definitely is a fresh movie that deserves to be watched.<br/><br/>The movie is about Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), called The Don because of his success with the ladies, who enjoys several things in his life – his friends, his family, training in the gym, going to church and, of course, the ladies. Bust most of all, Jon likes pornography, he even explains how he prefers porn to real sex; he watches it daily and is, what you might call, a porn addict. One night, at a club, he meets the beautiful Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), whom he describes as a 'dime', and soon starts a relationship with. The problem with Barbara is that she dislikes men who watch porn. Jon has no choice but to simultaneously maintain his relationship and his porn watching habits, because he doesn't want to give up either.<br/><br/>The thing I like the most about Don Jon is how it deals with ""taboos"" in a genuine, intelligent way – and because of that it somewhat reminds me of Kevin Smith's 1997 classic Chasing Amy. Like it or not, porn plays a role in almost every man's life and will – sooner or later – be the topic of a discussion in a relationship. Don Jon deals with this topic in a very mature way. It shows that too much porn can cause the developing of unrealistic expectations in a young man, as well as other things (like romantic movies) which, if consumed in excessive amounts, can lead to unrealistic expectations. The movie deals with this topic in a very subtle and appealing way, and it may be considered a relationship study. However, due to the nature of its topic, the movie is written exclusively from a man's perspective, and it might not be as entertaining for the female audience as it is for the male audience.<br/><br/>Overall, it seems to me that Joseph Gordon-Levitt was able to achieve the hat-trick of movie making with Don Jon. His screenplay is fresh and intriguing, his acting is top-notch and even his directing style is interesting and captivating. The rest of the cast – especially the female leads Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore – are charming as ever, and Tony Danza is great as the, arguably, funniest character in the movie – Jon's dad, also called Jon. In spite of not being a full blown comedy, Don Jon is a movie that will definitely put a smile on your face. With directing and writing Don Jon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showed he is not just a talented actor, and I can't wait for him to direct more movies.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"

","I originally wrote this as a reply to a post for this movie, but realized it could be posted as a review as well.<br/><br/>I've checked the 'Contains spoilers' tab, but I'm not sure it actually contains any spoilers, but better safe than sorry.<br/><br/>Anyway, here is my review: I have to admit I hired this mainly because of the porn thing (I know. Pretty shallow and stuff, and why would I when there is free 'real' porn everywhere?).<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked it very much. It was intelligent and funny (and didn't really contain any porn, but I never missed it).<br/><br/>Great job as a first time director (not counting the shorts) for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, great acting and casting etc. Overall a very good movie, deserving of the 81% score on ""Rotten Tomatoes"" (which is a very high score by their standards), in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/don_jon/ <br/><br/>Fantastic Julianne Moore is such a versatile actress, and I think she is still hot even though she is 53 (loved her in ""Boogie Nights"" :D I'm 43 and I've had great sex with several females over 50. In my opinion they are better than the young ones, since they are so experienced and passionate lol). <br/><br/>And Scarlett Johansson is great as usual. A very talented actress for her young age, and she is simply stunning (never noticed her great body until this movie!).<br/><br/>Overall a very entertaining film with few flaws that I enjoyed very much, and it also tickled my 'gray matter', making me think about my own situation.<br/><br/>I was a singer for most of my younger life (age 18 to 35 or so), having lots of casual sex/one-night stands (mostly with equally shallow sex bombs that only wanted one-night stands with the front-person of the band), but never met the 'woman of my life' (longest lasting relationship with a woman lasted about 2 years), and I feel something is definitely missing from my life now that I have a 'regular job' and have settled down. This movie has inspired me to try to do something about that sooner than later.<br/><br/>My father was 50 years old when I was born (while my mother was 27! He was a captain of a large ship while she was a maid on that ship), so I realize I still have time to form a family, but that time is running out... Time to do something about it! Anyway, again I thought it was a great and eye-opening film for me, so thank you for that, Joe.<br/><br/>Can't wait for your next film! :)"
"drewskee06","9","10","16","19 October 2013"," This is a movie that most every guy can relate to
","Even though it seemed a bit like a chick flick from the previews, this movie was made for bachelors across America. Practically every guy I know (including myself) can relate to what Levitt presented here; and as proof of the potency of this film, I am on IMDb instead of going to a porn site, even after witnessing so many fine ladies on the big screen.<br/><br/>Not only does Levitt provide a lot of insight that most of us already know (and usually ignore), his ability to capture the modern male's dilemma in American culture throughout the movie is therapeutic and reminds all us guys who go bar hopping that what matters most is between the ears. Now, as for Don Jon's incredible success ratio, that seems a bit far-fetched...but then again, since this seems like Levitt just getting a portion of his life off his chest and onto the big screen, I can see why he's successful with one-night-stands 95% of the time--being a celebrity and all. <br/><br/>If you are a single guy between 20 and 40, you should strongly consider watching this film. It will reaffirm that you are not alone, that it is not a healthy lifestyle, and that it takes some risk and real courage to change."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a wonderful actor and his performance has always been par excellence for me. With Don Jon, he not only has considered himself as an all-rounder but also made himself a talented stalwart in the cinema industry.<br/><br/>Don't get my appraisals so hyperbole, because: The film starts with a bang (pun unintended)! The beat music, the visual effects and the prologue as to what to expect from the guy in front of us is simply one good opening. Then, the story kicks in and the screenplay reminded me of Edgar Wright and his Cornetto trilogy. It was lovely to see the frames actually change so swiftly giving out the impression on a wider scale. The idea reaches the audience successfully. The boldness & honesty in the first part of the film makes it realistic & teenagers/adults can so highly relate to the ""masturbation factor."" You bet! Dialogs are very good. Pure work by the art, light & sound department.<br/><br/>Then we have the performances. JGL is terrific, no doubt and his peculiar air in this would definitely make the girls drool. Then we have Scarlett Johansson who is sexy as always and acts well, too. Jullianne Moore is fine. I loved JGL's on-screen family. All of them were funny & lively & looked so real. The story is written with emotions and they kick in the second half as it gradually maneuvers into a rigid conclusion. Many reality bites have been spoken loudly in this comic romance where attention to details is one thing why direction looks good. Cinematography is good, so is the soundtrack & music. Editing could've been better.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! It speaks volumes about sex, masturbation & love. Let the boldness not affect you.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

","I never thought in my life I would hear that the sound of a computer turning on gives a man a hard on, but for Jon Martello Jr. (Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) it does. Don Jon is the story of a modern day Don Juan, who enjoys sex, but finds porn to be more of a sexual desire than an actual women. What is this guy? Crazy? <br/><br/>When Jon meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), Jon feels as if he has met the perfect women, and Barbara feels as if she has meet the perfect man. That is until she catches Jon watching porn, which Barbara despises. I have never seen Joseph Gordon-Levitt so comfortable in a role. His natural on screen presence as Jon is remarkably captivating, touching and hilarious. Scarlett Johansson scores multiple laughs as the gum chewing jersey girl that only cares about herself. Johansson is pitch perfect, this is one of her best role since Woody Allen's Match Point. Now granted that Match Point is a drama and Don Jon is a comedy, they are both extremely well acted on her part.<br/><br/>Im pretty sure its been awhile since a supporting character, who doesn't say anything for 95% of the film, made an audience crack up as much as Brie Larson has as Jon's cellphone obsessed sister, Monica. Larson's Monica seems constantly annoyed at her family members. Whether it's her mother Angela (Glenne Headly) arguing with Jon to find a girl and settle down. Or her dad Jon Martello Sr. (Tony Danza) hollering at the football game on the television. Danza is insanely terrific as the overly aggressive father, whose veins seem to burst out of all area of his body, when he's in a heated moment.<br/><br/>In Don Jon Julianne Moore plays Esther a grieving women who Jon meets while attending night classes. Moore has never once disappointed in any of her roles, she is one of the strongest actresses around. Julianne Moore knows how to find the inner soul of all her characters, and releases it to roam around all over the screen.<br/><br/>Taking on the multiple roles of acting, writing, and directing, Joseph Gordon-Levitt has challenged himself in many ways that that other actors are not doing, and he fully succeeded. Gordon-Levitt stated, and Im paraphrasing, that he directed a bunch of shorts for his website hitrecord.org, (which is a site that collaborates with inspiring filmmakers, writers, musicians, etc) to prepare for making this feature. Don Jon solidifies Joseph Gordon-Levitt as one of the top up and coming directors in the industry. I give Don Jon a 9 out 10."

","I know I am a minority on here. I REALLY went into this movie wanting to laugh. Not 1 chuckle out of me. It was a 1.5 hour snooze fest. Thankfully, Scarlett Johansson is SMOKING hot and at least gave me something to look at. I was not offended by any of the graphic content, the movie simply sucked. I am actually shocked that Scarlett and Julianne Moore signed on for this trash of a script. I have been a fan of Julianne Moore since I saw her on Boogie Nights and she still looks great. The tag team of Johansson and Moore couldn't save it. This is the worst movie I have seen in the past 5 years. I believe the people giving it high reviews are high. Whew, 10 lines finally. I could have done it in 1 line!"
"sohansurag","7","4","5","24 December 2013"," JGL's debut feature is one to remember!
","Don Jon was one of the movies I'd been looking forward to this year. The reasons, obvious: Its written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the previews were good and Scarlett Johansson looked insanely hot in it. Don Jon deals with porn addiction and in essence, I felt, it largely a movie for the masculine crowd. Take it or leave it. But that's not to say the feminine mass can't enjoy it, for starters it stars JGL.<br/><br/>Jon Martello, played by JGL himself, is a pornography addict and its his quirks, awkward moments and the addiction that makes the movie. Don Jon has a lot of little things that adheres to your viewing pleasure. And no it's not the titillating scenes that I'm taking about. It's the little things that makes a good movie, scenes that bring a smile on your face, a chuckle every now and then. The subject matter of porn could have easily slid into being crude but thanks to JGL's skilled direction, its never crossed the offensive line and instead it took a lighter and a more stylish path. JGL's direction instills comedy and immense awkwardness in Don Jon. And unlike Steve McQueen's Shame it steers clear of drama and serious notes up until its final act.<br/><br/>JGL packs an infinite charm and confidence here. It felt like he's finally broken out of his boyish molds. Well we did get a sample in Killshot's Richie Nix but here he just puts it all upfront with his convincing Italian accent and all. Scarlett Johansson was just as brilliant and again not coz she's hot. Well she is, but the way she talked, the way she delivered her lines, its impeccable acting prowess. Her accent, which initially put me off, came with her character and she did a grand job. Its one of her finest roles ever, outside Woody Allen movies.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was splendid as well. I wondered what Brie Larson had been doing playing Jon's texting-obsessed sister who barely had anything to do or say and there were times when I felt her character was just there for the sake of it, under developedbut towards the final act it changed, in an instant! Tony Danza, despite his limited screen time, shared an immaculate chemistry with JGL.<br/><br/>The movie is what I'd call slick, at least the first two acts. The visuals had a lot of editing done to, that added to the visual flair. And add to that an awesome soundtrack, Don Jon becomes a stellar treat. Who wouldn't shake their heads to Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch's Good Vibrations?<br/><br/>Don Jon ain't without its flaws though. I couldn't buy into the events that redeems him towards the end. The scope of the story could have much more but I guess keeping it short worked best. Julianne Moore's character could have had a bit more back story. I just didn't get what her catch was. Now lets talk about the steamy scenes, yes there are plenty but nothing to be delirious or appalled about; it just blends well with narrative.<br/><br/>Ultimately Don Jon is a refreshing movie owing everything to its sumptuous performances, stellar cast, stunning visuals, music and was terrific for a directorial debut. It makes me wanna see more of JGL's film-making skills"

","There is no doubt that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. He has impressed me in his past roles in Brick and Inception. In this movie he portrays a twenty-something from New Jersey who grows as a person from an immature kid into a man. The movie started off very strong for the first 25-30 minutes, with Scarlett Johansson doing an admirable job as his New Jersey girlfriend. I particularly liked how the pervasiveness of sexuality in the media was shown. From the Hardy's commercial to various music videos and models on TV. The rest of Don Jon's family were also great, and I wish we could have spent more time at the dinner table with them. Julianne Moore played a much larger role than I had originally expected, and did a great job helping Jon grow as a person.<br/><br/>I thought the sister character constantly being on her phone aside from one line seemed a bit out of place. That kind of character is more apt to pop up in a quirky comedy. Also clocking in at an hour and 23 minutes, it was fairly short. This is positive in that I think the movie was losing steam. The negative aspect is that we don't really get to see what happens with the Jon and his new love interest. However, I could understand why that was left open-ended since Jon's addiction to pornography was the focus rather than the actual girl he ends up with. One tiny part that showed Jon's growth was when he chooses to go to the basketball courts and change his routine from just weight training. I thought that was a nice subtle way of showing how he had grown as a person that wasn't only focused on his old ways."

","Don Jon surprised me, certainly. I'm a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but I doubted his directing abilities. He knows how to carry a film as an actor, for sure, but it was really down to whether he could pace this film well, and make this almost bizarre concept work. I can say for certainty, he almost nails it on the chest!<br/><br/>Don Jon(JGL) is a man who develops unrealistic expectations for both relationships and sex, having watched an abundance of porn for most of his life. When he meets ""the one"", Barbara Sugarman(Scarlett Johansson), he is surprised to find that both have expectations that surely can't be met, and they embark on a relationship which opens his eyes to what being with someone really means.<br/><br/>Don Jon is superbly acted. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as expected, is wonderful. He brings personality and energy to his character, and makes him into a relatable, likable guy. Johansson is fantastic as well. Her New Jersey accent is perfect, and she knows how to really grind an audience's gears. The rest of the ensemble is fantastic. Julianne Moore and Tony Danza both give wonderful performances in their roles, which adds to the film. <br/><br/>I have a problem with JGL's directing abilities, unfortunately. He knows how to make a shot work, get his actors to perform, and set a scene up well, but I think he tries to make everything look a little too stylistic. It's like he had the perfect picture, with all the right colours, but he just added a little too much, to make it feel somewhat cluttered. His direction is certainly not bad, it's just a little misled. <br/><br/>The writing here is quite brilliant. Every character has a purpose, a certain personality to them. Most of the characters feel real, with the exception of Scarlett Johansson's character. I felt she was almost comical, a little too over the top. Apart from her character, the writing really succeeds here. You support Don Jon in his endeavors, you understand his motivations for the things he does. All in all, it's a great screenplay JGL has developed, and for the most part, it translates to the big screen damn well!<br/><br/>Don Jon is certainly energetic, fun and full of heart. In my opinion, it's partially a social commentary, showing the expectations that both men and women both have nowadays, which only adds to my love of the film. It certainly has it's faults, but for a first time director like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, it can only get better! I can't wait for his next project, because I'm sure this experience has given him a lot of pointers for next time. This is an easy watch, and one I'd certainly recommend. <br/><br/>7/10"
"AdamBowl23","9","19","36","18 September 2013"," One of the Best of the Year
","I attended a screening last night of Don Jon, starring, written, and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and was very glad I got the chance to. I was curious about 2 things going into the movie. One, was to see how Gordon-Levitt would do as both a director and writer. Acting I wasn't concerned with because he's one of the best out there today. Well, for his first time out, he nailed it. The story was great and one of the most original I've seen in a long time. Could possibly be the best movie I've seen all year. Number two, I was curious how Tony Danza would be, as it was odd picturing him being in a rated R movie, and trust me, he didn't disappoint. You'll hear him say many things you never heard on Who's the Boss. But he was great all around. There were moments when he reminded me of my dad.<br/><br/>But I was kind of blown away by the movie. I was hoping to laugh and I really didn't see it being a typical romantic comedy by any means, and believe me, anyone expecting that will be highly disappointed, sorry ladies. This movie is definitely from a guy's prospective and JGL isn't the sweet, golden boy type character by any means. His character has a lot of layers and that's one of the reasons the movie is as good as it is. Its not your typical R rated comedy either. It falls in between comedy and drama, but mostly, it is just a character study of a man with addiction issues, which lead to relationship issues, and so on and so forth. Its just done in a way where the movie doesn't come off as heavy or preachy and is fun to watch. It just tells the character of Jon's story and I think there are parts that almost every guy can relate to in one way or another, which provides a lot of the laughs. I'm sure some of the websites Jon uses will be familiar to some as well, wink, wink.<br/><br/>And aside from JGL and Danza, the rest of the cast is great too. Scarlett was looking as good as ever and was spot on in her role. Julianne Moore was used wisely and gave another solid performance, almost reminiscent of her role in Boogie Nights. One of my favorites was Brie Larson. She doesn't get much screen time but pay attention to her because it pays off in the end.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of this film and can't wait to see what Gordon-Levitt can do in the future.

","I do not know much about the technicalities of film making, but I know a lot about what makes humans become what they are and I am often amazed about the insight writers and film makers display through excellent films like Don Jon. The lack of physical bonding between parents and their children younger than twelve, have tragic consequences for those children as adults. Don Jon exposes an example of such consequences: a deep feeling of isolation and an inability to belong to someone.<br/><br/>It poses the question: What is a home? A place where people eat and watch a game?; or a place where people have sex?; or a place where people can safely be themselves?<br/><br/>Then it also asks: What is a church?<br/><br/>Turning away from the problem of failing families,the film presents answers that are real and achievable. One answer is that trying to get real help from professional therapists will not change one into the person one should be. The real answer lies in friendship, in touch, in trusting the other, in accepting another person completely - shortcomings and all. No therapy, just accepting life and the people close to you."

","First of all, I'm a female and I'm not really into sexual things, porn, etc., but I understood the movie. John(played by the handsome Joseph- Gordon Levitt) is a typical New Jersey guy, who is obsessed with sex in general.He's addicted to watching porn to that point where he prefers it rather than real human interaction. He has his regular routine that you can see him doing over and over again. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) and at first she's playing hard to get and you can clearly see that she's mocking him. I didn't quite understand why she got so mad about the fact that John watches porn. Esther (Julian Moore)takes a very important part in the movie. At first she seems nothing more than a crazy old lady, but then she completely changes John's point of view. She teaches him the difference between love and sex. Overall I think this movie is genius and really carries a message.The acting is brilliant as well."

It finally takes an older woman, Julianne Moore, to teach him the meaning of life.<br/><br/>This is a good film...it entertains, enlightens and in the end warms the spirit, much like 500 Days of Summer.

"toddjnsn","7","5","7","20 December 2013"," Original, Outright, Worth Watching
","***SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>The movie is original and unique in a lot of ways that unfold later on that takes it from going mediocre in the middle of the movie, to Good in the end. It opens up grabbing your attention, realizing this guy just doesn't like porn like the next dude and merely holds consistently to it... but he takes it more seriously than any other facet of life. It's not just an addiction, but a lifestyle. Despite his fantasy-level accomplishments as a single guy, having sex with bombshells every week that an Average Joe has only had once, maybe twice in his life in college, his seriously-taken experience with porn is still the most satisfying prize in life.<br/><br/>He explains and justifies This in the movie well, but in another very important element, he does not. Which may have been done on purpose to leave it up to the viewer, thinking about it afterward.<br/><br/>It doesn't fully quench your thirst at the end, but it does bring a surprising wake-up call that may be more hidden to others: Barbara Sugarman, the bombshell that any guy would be lucky to have, has her own problem. In fact, her problem, though not an addiction, causes pain/issues on others directly. Her issue is that she wants a guy to follow her and what she does, not by taste, but by Expectation.<br/><br/>Barbara's fantasy world is wrapped up in Romcoms, which is just as unrealistic (if not more-so) than an enthralling porn clip... but also followed through in expectations that things Are supposed to be one-sided between guy and girl, where the guy should be lucky to have the woman and conform to what she wants and where things go. Again, not as a taste, but a ""Uhh, yeah, duh,"" much like a guy's position on merely watching porn now and again. But her problem is worse than a person (guy or girl) merely watching porn, although it's on the same level as someone with Jon's massive lifestyle addiction to it.<br/><br/>But in the end, Jon grows up, and she doesn't, in their last 5 minute talk. I think the writing could have been better with the older woman Esther he engages with. The movie didn't get in-depth with his character bonding with her... it just seemed rushed and an ""Oh, by the way, with Esther, yeah, I found myself even though it's not a Relationship-relationship..."". That's what leaves the thirst unquenched, but at the same time, you're still left reasonably satisfied due to it being a thought-provoking movie about controversial things outside the ""norm""."

","Jersey boy Jon is a jack-the-lad who, despite regular sexual success with woman he picks up, still prefers to get sexual satisfaction care of on-line porn. When he enters a serious, adult, monogamous relationship with Barbara, he discovers that she regards his continuing relationship with porn as a breach of trust.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who writes and directs as well as stars, shows that he is a film maker of considerable ability and maturity. This story is consistently entertaining, it balances humour with serious consideration of the issues involved (the reasons behind Jon's preference for porn are called into question, as are Barbara's motives), and it is well structured (particularly in its use of repetition) and well directed. Both Gordon-Levitt and Scarlet Johansen do well, Tony Danza is most enjoyable as Jon's Dad, and Julianne Moore - not an actress I care for - gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the apparently free-spirited Esther. I hope it is recognised at awards time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this quirky indie movie quite a lot, but it is not for those who object to sex and bad language in movies."
"hkauteur","8","8","13","9 October 2013"," HK Auteur Review - Don Jon
","Don Jon marks as the debut film of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is the writer, director and star of the film. What's most praiseworthy about JGL's direction is how he puts the audience into the world view of his lead character Don Jon. It makes a good cinematic explanation of how Don Jon prefers pornography over bedding real women, a character trait that can easily be viewed as unlikeable or disgusting if mishandled. We never really venture outside his world, but yet Don Jon's views seem logical enough to keep the audience invested in what happens to him.<br/><br/>Directing duties aside, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's ability to transform himself amazes me. Having seen him in Inception, (500) Days of Summer and The Dark Knight Rises have familiarized me with the sound of his real voice, but I was still astounded by Don Jon's macho New Jersey-accented voice. I was carefully listening to Don Jon's dialogue and couldn't detect any hints of Gordon-Levitt's real voice underneath. It is artfully consistent and was the core element that sold me on the Don Jon character.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson has been said to be a wooden actress in the past. I think this was probably one of her better performances. This character felt like a real person to me. I have met and dated girls like Barbara. Furthermore, the allure of Scarlett Johansson is cinematically ramped up to eleven. She hasn't been filmed to this level of sexiness since Match Point. For fans of the Black Widow, I'd even argue that this tops that. This is probably more to the credit of the direction. We feel Don Jon's hunger for her. And like Don Jon, she too mesmerized me. And not just cause of her looks. She seemed like the ideal girlfriend at first and couldn't really see her character flaws till late in the film. When I realized her character flaws, I was surprised I didn't see them before. That was a very compelling moment for me in the theater. Honestly, Johansson's character distracted me so much, I would need a second viewing to tell you anything about the Julianne Moore character.<br/><br/>Seeing Tony Danza as Don Jon's father Jon Sr. takes me back to my childhood. He was the only man on TV who can make my dad cackle like a fiend in the English language. Danza's presence adds warmth and makes for a convincing father. Brie Larson gets to do a Silent Bob type gag that is quite amusing.<br/><br/>The film's brutally truthful display about the realities of men and women as a source for comedy, while handled tastefully with charm by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, hits a little too close to home. I have had discussions like this with a girlfriend similar to the Scarlett Johansson character. It accurately captures why it's hard for men to explain the joys of pornography to the opposite sex. As Louis C.K. once put it, men just need to release so they don't go out and murder somebody. That's really it, but it's not a pleasing satisfying statement to convince a girlfriend with. I'd argue that any girl that needs an explanation wouldn't be convinced anyways because they probably have double standards. The film seems to take the same stance. All that said, the film managed to end on a poignant tender note.<br/><br/>In the end, Don Jon is somewhat of an odd animal. I wouldn't personally recommend it as a date movie with your girlfriend, for the very fact that it might just open the awkward discussion of ""How much pornography do you watch?"" with your girlfriend. I still think people should see it as it is a competent debut film.<br/><br/>So on a more politically neutral note, I'd say guys would have more fun with it watching it with their guy friends and likewise with girls and their girlfriends. It's probably better to be charmed by it separately than leaving the theater together primed for an awkward argument.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"

","I actually give this movie a 7.5. This was a good movie. I am one of JGL's fan girls and think he is the cutest dumpling ever so I see most movies with him in it. I hoped to love this movie but ended up just solidly liking it. The acting is excellent, the story is good and it was funny. The ending was a little bit of a surprise to me but I liked it. <br/><br/>Reading some reviews I can see some people are confused and didn't get it. The movie doesn't condone watching porn all the time, on the contrary it is a lesson about how porn and romantic comedies and the media in general give girls and guys certain ideas about relationships that are untrue. If you think the movie trumpets sleaze then you didn't understand the movie. It was original, charming and I was pleased with it. I certainly hope that JGL continues to write and direct and of course show that cute face of his in many more movies to come."

","The standards are too low nowadays to properly rate a movie, any movie. I give it a 6 but its real rating should be a 4, at best.<br/><br/>It is watchable. The script takes off well. The acting has sufficient charisma. It is engaging enough overall.<br/><br/>But the story becomes deranged as the development of the main characters turns them into caricatures. It should be the other way around. Instead of depth, we get flatness. The secondary characters, however, are written rather well comparatively speaking.<br/><br/>The red flag is that the premise of the story is eventually shown to be irrelevant. The resolution takes the film on a tangent. This makes no sense. We are forced to believe that the concerns of the main character, the problems that drive him all along and entirely determine his life up to that point, disappear rather than are resolved. This is a cheat that torpedoes the true potential of the plot."

And that's so sweet. It's me make learned that relationship is a huge thing of our life, we receive and we shall give, that's exactly meaning that if you want your partner to love you then you should love him back, and love itself is not just about sex, it's more than that, it's about understanding each other. Understand that, that's what he or she needs, if you want to stop his bad attitude than you should tell them easily, tell them slowly, and show to them that this is the way to change, so if they change, they will really feel comfortable with change they made. When they feel that, they will be so thankful for you. and this movie deliver this message. And it's about pure love. You're so good Levitt."
"JPfanatic93","7","6","9","13 October 2013"," Porn is no worse than romcoms, says Joseph Gordon-Levitt
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in and wrote this film, his directorial debut, which in a comedic tone explores the life of a porn-addict. Jon (G-L) apparently has it all: he's good looking, has a nice car, some close friends to bro down with, he loves his family and his church and he can all too easily score with girls. But what interests him the most is porn, the only thing he can totally loose himself in. Real girls just don't cut it compared to the wild excess he witnesses in porn. And that's not likely to change, until he meets 'perfect dime' Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) and starts actively pursuing her, as she's the closest he has ever come to falling in love with anyone. Unfortunately for him, Barbara doesn't make it easy and has a long list of changes in store, not so much for him as to satiate her own view of what a prospective partner ought to be. Porn is off the table, as is lying, after which Jon soon discovers how much of an addict he really is, as he can't stop watching the former and consequently doing the latter. Set in an outrageous stereotypical 'Joysee' milieu (if you can't stand those awfully annoying accents you would do well to stay away from this film), Don Jon proves a quirky, at times witty comedy that makes no illusions it doesn't have grand notions to share with its audience when it comes to addictions, porn or otherwise. Its ultimate message appears to be 'if you want to find real love, be yourself and don't let it change you into someone you're not'. It doesn't take the audience long to learn that lesson – unlike the fairly thick-headed Jon himself, who concurrently, much to his dismay, learns too late there's an option to erase his online browsing history – as we swiftly see Barbara for what she is: a vain and overly demanding broad who insists Jon must give up his idiosyncrasies and aspirations to satisfy her take on a good match, all brainwashed by the absurd simplistic fairy tales she takes for real life that she has seen in too many romantic comedies, which Don Jon convincingly equates with pornography, except the female counterpart. The stuff seen in typical Hollywood dreck about romance and marriage – exemplified by a short sample of such fare featuring funny cameos by Anne Hathaway and Channing Tatum – is just as much a work of fantasy as the carnal possibilities porn generally delivers, and a successful match that triggers genuine love both compromises and balances these two paradigms. It takes Jon a lot longer to realize this than us, the audience, though we are surprised at the outcome as he eventually runs off with someone we wouldn't have expected (thanks to cinematic standards). Meanwhile, we are treated to a gutsy comedy that only narrowly escaped an NC-17 rating thanks to all the talk about hardcore sexual intercourse. Admittedly, it does come off as preachy a bit towards its climax, at which point the number of laughs also drops, but until that time we witness a strong cast deliver terrifically funny performances with a good sense of timing. Gordon-Levitt and Johansson are particularly hilarious as the would-be star couple, evenly matched towards one another and fortunately sharing a good deal of chemistry. Also of note is Julianne Moore as an oddball older woman in a semi-mentor role that ends up differently than we might have foreseen. As a director and writer, G-L is off to a decent start as he clearly inspires enthusiasm in his fellow actors and successfully balances both directorial duties and a star performance, while tackling a fairly heavy topic with surprising ease, albeit for laughs more than for contemplation."
"kubricklackey","9","6","9","3 October 2013"," Fantastic first outing as a directorial powerhouse
","Don Jon Martello, the epitome of a modern day Don Juan, is the marvelous brainchild of one of America's up and coming great actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Given this is his first venture into the field of directing this should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. There is more heart and emotion in this movie than any big budget Hollywood gush fest could bring forth in a 100 million dollar budget. The realism and examination of human emotion and interaction in relationships is effortlessly presented by JGL. He critiques the expectations of beauty and love brought forth by two generations of individuals veiled with an air of coarse and hilarious dialogue. This movie seeks to do what Shame did for sex addiction 2 years before and unlike Shame, Don Jon wishes to deal with the subject in a more accessible and less depressing manner. In doing so we as viewers are given a delicious and entertaining introduction of the stigma that is porn addiction. But to focus on the actual acting the actors appear to be very comfortable and genuine with the portrayal of their characters. JGL effortlessly evinces the meathead and sex obsessed persona of Jon Martello. Scarlett Johansson just exudes sexuality and her spot on Jersey accent actually had me cringing from laughter during the movie. The helpless romantic mother (Glenne Headly), the detached and sexually obsessed father (Tony Danza), and the almost Greek tragedian and taciturn character of Monica Martello (Brie Larson) helps to round out this extremely idiosyncratic American family.Finally with the woman who teaches the meaning to Jon of what making love is all about, the sexy, sassy Esther (Julianne Moore). This movie had me entertained from beginning to slightly too cheesy end but nonetheless I recommend this movie to all modern film lovers."
"tavm","7","6","9","29 September 2013"," Don Jon was an interesting movie for me concerning the way some men and women look at sex and relationships
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his grown nephew. Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed, and stars as the title character, someone who gets any woman he wants when going to clubs with friends but gets unsatisfied compared to the porn images he looks up on his computer while getting off. Since he's Catholic, he also confesses to a priest every week for these transgressions and does his penance while lifting weights. When he meets Scarlett Johansson, she doesn't take to him right away so he tries harder with her. She seems to want to change him or at least wants him a certain way based on the romantic movies they go to which he doesn't like but holds his tongue concerning those. It's at night school, which the Scarlett character suggested to him, that he meets another woman played by Julianne Moore who might also change him, perhaps for the better. I'll stop there and just say that while I was fascinated by the repetition of certain scenes in order to get the gradual humor that results when those scenes start changing routines-like especially during the climatic family dinner table scene involving dad Tony Danza, mom Glenne Headley, and sis Brie Larson-it's when things take a more dramatic turn that things get really interesting. Like those concerning the Moore character. So on that note, Don Jon is worth a look if you're interested in the mature subject matter."

Great cast and editing; though I wasn't not into the whole jersey shore feel of it, but overall it's good and when you really get into the movie u can overlook that. Of course Scarlett Johansson was absolute gorgeous and fantastic in the film. A little annoy with the accent but then again it's Scarlett Johansson, and she can get away with it.

","I saw this last night, and learned sadly that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not a writer. The trailers more than suggest that this will be an in-your-face movie about a guy with a porn addiction, and in that sense it does not disappoint. But if JGL bothered to go a little deeper (no pun) and tried to actually flesh out his characters instead of making them little more than cardboard cutouts and eye candy, this might've been watchable. It wasn't. I stayed in my seat because I had already paid the full price, but there were so many cringe-worthy moments that I was embarrassed for JGL and everyone who said yes to this movie. The dialogue was so trite and unbelievable--NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT! Scarlett Johansson's character doesn't seem to have any dignity, as she just goes along with ""Don"" in whatever he wants to do. Julianne Moore was great, but she seems to have just been tacked on as a device to make Don seem like less of a jerk. Anyway, this just goes to show how far money will get you, because there is no way this would have been green-lit without JGL. It seems he needed an excuse to make out with Scar-Jo and Moore, and hey, who can blame him? But please, for our sake, make something with substance before releasing it to the world. I do hope he gets better if he chooses to keep writing/directing, because I'm a big fan of his acting."

I don't know why but it annoyed the hell out of me every time Don Jon tossed that balled up tissue in the trash. The clanking sound was all WRONG! Who did the sound effects? Tissue makes a soft swishy sound - not a loud clunky sound. So, that bothered me. And then the extreme Jersey accents were a bit of a pain too, but then I realized these were the stereotypical Jersey characters - oversexed, loud, self-absorbed young adults. *SPOILER ALERT* Jon thinks he's the typical guy who just happens to self-pleasure to Internet porn every day, multiple times during the day. Yo, you're addicted dude! It's not until he meets a pained older woman who teaches him that reality can be way better than the unreal digital fantasy. I liked the juxtaposition of religion too - no matter how much you've sinned recite a few holy phrases a few times and you're good to go. The acting was stellar, the script well-conceived and nicely paced and overall a really good movie. And, Rob Brown was terrific - his character was a solid friend to Don Jon.

"burlesonjesse5","7","2","2","9 June 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Don Jon
","As I recall, the last Joseph Gordon-Hewitt movie I saw was Looper. With a little prosthetic make up and a slight voice alteration, he willfully imitates Bruce Willis. Now, in his directorial debut (not the first film he's directed but this is the first that's not a short), he looks and acts slightly more like a young Robert De Niro (sans make up, its gotta be the smirk and the mannerisms I'm thinking). Don Jon (the flick I'm reviewing) is a quirky little movie that is interesting and amusing (not to mention foul-mouthed, crass, and overly sexual). To Gordon-Hewitt's credit, it works because of him. His direction is swift, sassy, and for the first half, unique in the way it dictates the rhythms of the actors/cuts through music and narration. Along with the solid directorial effort he shows here, he's also become a fully accomplished actor that specializes in creating different and interesting (multilayered) characters.<br/><br/>Muscle-chested, full of road rage tendencies and a cleanliness freak, his Jon Martello, Jr. is a study of one man's inability to formulate a relationship (with a woman) because he would rather watch pornographic material on the Internet. He's an unwealthy playboy (that's why his two best friends call him quote unquote, ""Don Jon""), a ladies man, and a churchgoing type all rolled up into one. He's proud of his clean apartment and I guess, doesn't cook (that explains why he mostly eats at his parent's house). As I said earlier, Martello, Jr. has a bit of a temper from time to time and probably gets it from his dad (Jon Sr. played by Tony Danza who sheds his Who's The Boss character's image by spewing a ton of profanity). His sister doesn't talk and basically is on her phone all the time. Then there's Jon Jr.'s mother who wants so bad for him to be in a relationship, get married, and have kids. Basically for most of the proceedings, Don Jon details three things: Gordon- Levitt's (Martello, Jr.) unusual relationship with his family (he and his dad love to rock the wife beaters at the dinner table), his obsession with watching pornographic movies, and his pursuit of a ""dime"" of a girl that he meets at a dance club (Scarlett Johansson giving a solid performance as Barbara Sugarman (she gets the Jersey accent down pat)). And if you've only seen the trailer, this movie as a whole can be a little misleading as it gets closer to its conclusion. Don Jon ventured down a different path than I initially thought it would. The reason: a supporting role played by Julianne Moore (Esther) kinda changes things up a bit. She plays a sulking widow who befriends Gordon- Levitt's character giving him insight into his admitted condition. <br/><br/>All and all, Don Jon is fun for most of the way. It is the type of film that will cause you to laugh nervously because you feel guilty for enjoying it. Its only fault may be the way it ends things so abruptly and without enough of a satisfying conclusion (the flick went from music video mayhem to a rom com indie look). I will recommend it though for Joseph Gordon-Levitt alone. He is able to nail down any character he plays and with a slight nudge from outside forces (any male cast member from Jersey Shore comes to mind), he creates Martello, Jr. completely out of thin air. He's a darn good actor and his future A-list status is fully assured. As for Don Jon the vehicle, it may turn off certain types of moviegoers. If you are one of the easily offended, I would advise against seeing it (the innuendo is off the charts). If you don't mind your jaw dropping from time to time with the occasional guilty chuckle or snort, Don Jon might just be the ""Don"" Perignon of sex comedies."
"AmandaSage","8","2","2","14 April 2014"," Sharp, focused and not at all blurred: Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a clear take on gender roles
","Don Jon is the feature film debut from writer/director Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In it, he plays a New Jersey guy named Jon who's addicted to porn, not to mention church, cleaning, road rage and bedding women—the rituals that get him through the week (or day, as the case may be).<br/><br/>Jon is sexist, shallow and one-dimensional. So, not surprisingly, he winds up with sexist, shallow and one-dimensional Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), whose addiction to romantic movies feeds her unrealistic expectations of the opposite sex just as much as Jon's addiction to porn feeds his.<br/><br/>The relationship plays out as you might expect. And then Jon gets to know Esther (Julianne Moore), who's older and far more self-aware than either Jon or Barbara. She has rituals of her own to get her through the day (to lose herself, as Jon might say). But they don't stop her from trying to make a connection to Jon.<br/><br/>There are two reasons I'm writing about Don Jon: First, because it's part of a long line of exceptional work from Gordon-Levitt, and an early indication of what he might become as a director. Second, because, in spite of its focus on porn and countless close-ups of women's bodies, the film offers a welcome counterpart to some of the other pop media out there today—the kind that doesn't bother to show a different angle.<br/><br/>I have a particular piece of pop in mind, but I'll get to that a little later. For now, it's first things first.<br/><br/>In case it needs to be stated, Gordon-Levitt is a highly prolific and unusually gifted actor. He's been in tons of first-rate films, including Brick, Looper, Inception, 50/50, The Dark Knight Rises and Lincoln.<br/><br/>He's also founder of a really cool open-collaborative production company called HITRECORD. They're putting out a slew of fascinating, high quality pieces, including books and even a forthcoming TV show. (Check out this call for artists for a documentary segment on unity.) As a fan of Gordon-Levitt's work, I was eager to see Don Jon. And I wasn't disappointed. Already, with his first feature film, he comes across as an assured director with a strong grasp of visuals and editing. It's not like he's a rookie; he's been on sets for nearly three decades and has already directed several short films. Still, Don Jon is an impressive first feature.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing Gordon-Levitt go further into creating mood through cinematography, and develop more complex story lines. But as it stands, Don Jon presents a lovely character arc, as Jon stumbles through romantic entanglements, and offers poignant observations on how we treat one another and the dangers of falling prey to the influence of popular media.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my secondary point. Because Robin Thicke's idiotic song Blurred Lines certainly doesn't deserve to be front and centre. It's the kind of thing I hate so much that I wouldn't normally give it any space on this blog. But it came to mind while I was watching Don Jon, so here it is.<br/><br/>I'd heard bits of Blurred Lines on the radio, and let it play because it's catchy. But when the lyrics sank it, even just those approved for the radio stations I listen to, I tuned out; something about wanting a ""good girl"" who still likes to ""get nasty"" was a little off-putting.<br/><br/>Then, when the damn thing got stuck in my head again (""'Catchy' is not a redeeming quality,"" says my wise buddy ACR), I looked the lyrics up and was totally appalled. The original version is beyond sexist; it's misogynist and threatening. I'm thinking of one line in particular, but the whole thing is just grotesque. Now when it comes on the radio, I always change the station, never mind how addictive the beat.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was really appalled and wanted to see what kind of reaction others were having to Blurred Lines. So I went online and found an interview in which Thicke acknowledges that his song is degrading to women, but says that it's okay because he's married and has respected women all his life. How big of him.<br/><br/>If that kind of ""context"" is going to carry any weight, it has to be established within the song. Take Eminem's Love the Way You Lie, a far superior listen; yes, it's got references to violence against women, but its lyrics have a clearly ironic tone. And by including the woman's voice (Rihanna's, no less, a woman who has borne evidence that abuse is no joke), he brings her perspective into it, redefining the lyrics and underscoring the irony.<br/><br/>Coming back to Don Jon, I'm not sure exactly at what point in the film I was reminded of Blurred Lines. But when Gordon-Levitt took care to show that people—of both sexes—are more than just their appearance, it made me very grateful that we also have men like him contributing to popular culture. And that he understands the importance of losing yourself with a real-life human being, one you can look at, but also one who is able to really see you.<br/><br/>Here's to more insights like these, from Gordon-Levitt and all artists who want to create works that will bring people together, rather than further divide, isolate and objectify.<br/><br/>* * * ""You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You better never let it go."" – Eminem, Lose Yourself"

","Back in early fall 2012 Don Jon released what was probably the best trailer ever made. Unfortunately, the actual film falls short of the perfection of the trailer but its unique, fun and endearing enough to still be a must watch for film-lovers and casual fans alike.<br/><br/>Don Jon is funny, truly unique and visually and narratively interesting. Joseph goes above and beyond the typical directing duties and chooses surprisingly insightful camera shots and unique editing that elevates the narrative. In addition the script's midpoint-curveball turns the classic movie love story upside down and gives a fresh take on the genre that takes maximum advantage of the porn vs. romance movies premise.<br/><br/>But, on the other, the movie is far from perfect, in fact, it's a bit messy. The writing ranges from absolute brilliance to ""what is going on?"", the editing similarly ranges from dramatically powerful to downright jarring. And worst of all, there are shots in this film that are literally out of focus...<br/><br/>So yes, unfortunately the film is plagued with a sense of sloppy amateurism but it is also blessed with moments of brilliant auteurism. And the one thing Don Jon does execute perfectly is showing the world that Joseph Gordon Levitt is an auteur to watch out for in the years to come."

I love the line his sister gives in the movie, the only line she has but you cheer when she says it. How many of us would love someone as aware as his sister. Although she's detached, or might I say attached at the hip to her cell phone, however one can't blame her with the kind of non sense family she has to deal with.<br/><br/>The ending is sublime, as we all just see where it goes, enjoy the moment with ourselves and each other, and just see where the now takes us in our humanity, not our detachment."

Cleverly marketed, immensely unpredictable, and never ever dull.

She is used to guys bending over backwards to her wishes and she expects it. She throws tantrums and threatens to break up whenever there is a significant disagreements, which leads the boyfriend to not be honest. Most importantly, she avoids any depth of discussion to understand where the conflict comes from.

Yet, it manages to keep the story interesting with Jon how he is facing his problem with his porn addiction and having to face girl problems. The editing is pretty well done capturing real porn clips into the movie which was bizarre cause I have never seen that before on the big screen.

"jackeugenebarry","9","11","21","22 September 2013"," A Great First-Person Comedy and Character-Piece; A Fun and Funny Movie with Unexpected Depth
","I so enjoyed this movie, laughing my keester off through much of it (as did most of the audience), and found myself marveling at how well its story was told and what it actually had to say. Really Good Stuff.<br/><br/>As you may know, this is the first feature written and directed by the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays the main character. <br/><br/>Like many of those on-screen who've made the directorial leap, he proves to be a real ""actor's director"". He gets really good human performances from all of his players (including himself), in roles big and small. <br/><br/>This shouldn't be that surprising, I guess, when you look at the amazing list of great directors and actors he's worked with. He's obviously been absorbing the craft(s) of great filmmaking along the way.<br/><br/>What we get here is this New Jersey guido-macho fella telling us his whole take on things in first-person narration while we watch how he rolls. The list of things he cares about, ending with his Porn. <br/><br/>Though voice-over can often be done BADLY, here it's used just right. The tempo and tone of the images, cutting, music, etc. perfectly match this guy's whole vibe and world-view. In the way it just takes you right into Jon's head, it reminded me of different yet also awesome main-character voice-overs in ""Taxi Driver"", ""Trainspotting"", the original ""Alfie"", ""I Love You Philip Morris"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""Goodfellas"", or some of the classic '70's, '80's Woody Allen flicks. <br/><br/>And actually, a (non-comedy) movie that ""Don Jon"" really reminded me of on the whole - maybe its spiritual forefather - is ""Saturday Night Fever"". Just like in that movie, you've got a young slicked-up cock-sure guido-macho with limited priorities and ambitions, a hum-drum home-life, a couple real friends who he hangs with, and a way with the ladies. Both ""Don Juans"" are contrasted between their time at the kitchen table and in the clubs doing what they do best. Both have experiences with a girl their age, and also with a bit older woman, both relationships teaching them different things. And both movies (and their main-characters) would seem to be just a look at a certain shallow frivolous existence, but actually turn out to be a whole lot more. And just like young Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever"", JGL in ""Don Jon"" goes all the way into his character, fully committing to portraying the guy for who he really is, funny and serious, attractive and ugly, all at once. <br/><br/>It's not just that JGL ""beefed up"" for this role, or speaks with a bass-voice and Jersey accent. It's the way he subtly reveals the guy's mix of confidence and insecurity, cluelessness and knowingness, and eventual ""self-discovery"". He makes us both laugh at him and feel for him. It's a Really Great Performance.<br/><br/>And it's not the only one. Scarlett Johannsen beautifully embodies her role as the Jersey Trophy-Girl, not just with hottie-ness and shallowness, but hints of a truly lost and unsatisfied person living in her situation. In the scenes of her coming out of the movie with Jon, or forbidding him to buy cleaning supplies while she buys curtain-rods, she really says a lot with a little. Julianne Moore does a great job here helping illuminate for Jon what he's missing, and heartbreakingly revealing what she's missing along the way. Jon's parents, played so righteously by Glenne Headly and (Holy Shmacks!) Tony Danza, are a hoot to watch, and go a long way toward helping us understand Jon. And Brie Larson plays Jon's texting-obsessed little sister with subtle mastery of facial expression, not saying a thing until it's really time to. <br/><br/>And the performances are allowed to flow, in a funny fast-moving world nevertheless defined by routine that's expertly created by the filmmakers. The bright colors and no-waste pace. The way the camera holds the same profile-shot of Jon whenever he's in his muscle-car road-raging. Or the identical head-on, in-your-face shots of Jon while he's lifting weights, making his confession to the priest, or flipping open his lap-top to get busy. Classic. Or the way the music is really loud and out-front sometimes like the soundtrack in Jon's head, the thundering electronic stuff for him picking up in the club, and the ""romantic"" full orchestra music for when he's with his one true love (porn, of course).<br/><br/>A great commentary's happening here... the fractured fairy-tale expectations we acquire (about love, sex, relationships, success) from all the media being constantly shoved down our throats (porn, movies, sports, advertisements, computers, phones).<br/><br/>Another related subject woven well through the whole movie is us being lost in our modern devices, which supposedly are meant to connect us, but do exactly the opposite. Consider the sister never looking up from her texting. Or the friend ""getting"" the girl's number, but entering ""pony-tail"" instead of her name into his phone. Or Jon's dad keeping his attention glued to whatever game's on TV, and their argument about the importance of TiVo. All these things go hand-in-hand with the dilemma of a guy who can get any girl he wants, but finds it's only the opening of his lap-top computer and the sound of it turning on that can get him ""really hard."" This Is Where We Find Ourselves Today. <br/><br/>So yeah, Watch This One...<br/><br/>Parting Thought: One of the best audience-reaction moments EVER... I went last night to see a screening of this at the ""Academy"" theater in Beverly Hills, with a filmmaker friend who's a member. Mind you, these are the big mucky-mucks who give out the Oscars every year. And Jon's girl confronts him angrily about his porn-watching. He compares his porn to her ""stupid movies"" she likes. You should've heard the laughter when she yells ""Movies and porno are different, Jon, they give AWARDS FOR MOVIES!"" and his reply? ""Yeah, they give awards for porn too!"""
"brutalgeisha","1","10","19","10 January 2014"," Very shallow script
","Just watched it. The idea of movie is OK, porn is not what to espect in real life etc. but the script and the characters are extremely shallow and stupid. Including the family of the main actor in the movie. The only character that shows some kind of a more in-depth is Julian Moores character but she is only present in 15min of the whole movie. The friends of a dude are idiots too. To sumarize, the author took more of a statement ""porn is not what to expect in real life"" than an idea and it could be shown in 10min. The main characters, friends and family have an IQ of 90, even if its trying to be caricatured it is bad. I know people in real life that resembles the stupidity of main character and his girlfriend, but everything in this movie is so shallow and superficial. I have seen movies with score lower than 6 that are better than this 7.2 crap, and I give it a 4, but acctualy I give it 1 to lower the far overrated 7.2 score.<br/><br/>On directing and camera I have absolutely no remarks, Levitt obviously learned a lot from directors of movies and series he was in before. But script and profiling of characters, total fail.<br/><br/>Also the movie characters reminded me on movie Idiocracy http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 which is kinda what the world is becoming more and more every day, just look at the scores of this movie..."
"billygoat1071","7","6","10","26 October 2013"," Modern Day Influences
","Don Jon is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, and it's quite interesting to see what kind of vision he could bring to cinema since he's always been a promising actor. The story he takes seems like something that may define to this generation by portraying how modern media distorts society's view to sex and love, and studies a somehow complex man who thinks he's living in a perfect life. The execution is noticeably crafty, the director has shown a snappy and energetic style that smartly comprehends to the story's themes. Don Jon is not revolutionary, but it is a witty tale that seems really sincere to its own message.<br/><br/>Jon's life mostly runs like a loop cycle. It's mainly about addiction, but what we actually observe is how difficult for him to get away from his comfort zone. Here's the trick: first off, Jon is not so much of a decent person, despite of his reputation. He's a typical playboy, he's a hypocrite, he uses religion as a tool for excuses, and doesn't quite respect a lot of people. When some of his routine breaks, that indicates that he somewhat changes as a different person. However, the real goal we should look forward is his overcome to his porn addiction. Though basically, Jon is not the only one who has a problem. Barbara may be into romance, but her interpretation to love is shallow, since she's only sees that in chick flicks. Beyond Jon's life is sort of a social satire about everyone's influences through modern media. Other than watching unreality videos, there are some people at the background who are also absorbed too much by technology. Example is Jon's sister who hardly interacts with her family because of her ridiculous text messaging addiction. These depictions are supposed to make them look terrible and the film is aware of that, but the ironies of these people are treated as a joke. In the end, it's acceptable to be amused with it.<br/><br/>Honestly (skip to the next paragraph if you're not from my country), the version I saw is not the same one that most have seen. The significant part of the film is to explore Jon's relationship to pornography, but the local distributor wants to release the movie widely and many theaters here can't tolerate the R-18 rating, so they frustratingly removed most of the scenes that involve porno clips and deemed into a smaller rating, thus the porn addiction side becomes a fill in the blanks subplot. This is quite of a stupid decision from the distributor, it's not that its eroticism is really that important, but everyone needs to see how weird the character's obsession to these adult videos to get into the film's big picture. So my current (7/10) rating is probably just an assumption for a while that may change soon as I see the regular US version of the film. End of local censorship complains.<br/><br/>As a director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a brisk pace through his storytelling. His style mostly relies on editing and it brings a unique flavor to the film. It's not hard to see that he also have learned something from Rian Johnson's Looper, especially the parts when it explores the main character's personal life. Overall, it's all impressive. And as an actor, the role is not supposed to be too likable, but his natural charms are inevitable. He displays them which makes the character even more worth rooting for. The rest of the cast also have the same charms that Gordon-Levitt brings.<br/><br/>Don Jon doesn't go too subtle in the end, but seriously I don't really know. Just like what I said, the movie I saw was a cynically sanitized version of Don Jon, thus I definitely missed plenty of parts beneath its subtext. But what I can presume is the film might have contrasted between gratuitous pleasures and genuine relationships, and probably showed which of their benefits is better. If there's anything else that I can see in this film, then that is its cleverly told satire towards mainstream influences from the internet, romantic film clichés, or any forms of media, which made the majority of current relationships vapid. The film can be strangely engaging, though still not groundbreaking, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt proves that he is competent to the job and it would be nice for him to tell more stories as fascinating as this one."
"din-nova","2","9","17","23 November 2013"," Not so convincing
","When I saw this movie I had not read anything about it before. Normally I read and watch the trailer before, I would let this movie be a surprise to me. But as soon as it started to play in the cinema the audience started to shout out with their joy at the women showing skin. Obviously this movie in it self wants to say something about society but its totally failing with it (media is toxic to the way we view sex etc.). But honestly that is just what has made the people to go and see this movie, because there is a lot of sex and stereotypes in it (and because there are famous actors in it). To not talk about the punch out lines in the movie that where as far away from clever and quite obvious, I wanted to leave the cinema... Unfortunately I saw it with friends so if I had left it would had been weird I suppose (so if I hypothetically would have seen it alone I would have left the cinema). People are laughing with the movie because they do the same thing as the roles: jerk off to porn, give scales on hotness, look at their smart phones a lot etc. This was to me very obvious as I sat in the cinema. As I said; it is sad that Joseph Gordon-Levitt had tried to point how we objectify sex and gender but that is totally what the movie is doing in it self, its contradicting! <br/><br/>To me this is a movie you see if you are not interested in movies and and if you don't want to see if anything with a deep context, to see some babes that you can objectify and if you feel like you like to judge people fast. I am my self very found of things in movies such as the camera angels, scripts, casting and the directing but in this movie it all where really bad. And because of the the bad camera angels, the bad script and the bad casting the acting failed as well. This is not because the acting in it self was bad but because it was not convincing to me in any way.<br/><br/>The good effect that it had on me was though that it made me feel really sick about the adds that I saw in the shopping windows after that I had left the cinema. Because of the way that people react to the media in this mimetic way. The unfortunate thing is that the movie just is repeating something that we hear at lot nowadays... but that the movie doesn't leave any refreshing depth and neither does it in anyway challenge the viewer. <br/><br/>/Unsatisfied customer a the cinema"

This movie lacks a plot until the last 20 minutes. Until that point it's just smut, swearing and womanizing. I gave it a 3 rather a zero simply because I have seen Drowning Mona and that is what I base a 0 upon. I did giggle a few times but mainly to break the awkward tension in the theater. If this is what New Jersey is about, I am thrilled to live nowhere the coast. I hope Joseph Gordon Levitt rethinks his approach at comedy in his future endeavors. Do not waste your time with this flop."
"l_rawjalaurence","8","5","8","28 November 2013"," Surprisingly Good First Directorial Effort
","DON JON is a really good film from writer-director-star Joseph Gordon- Levitt. He plays Jon, a young New Jersey Catholic with a penchant for porn. Although perfectly able to attract several girlfriends, he prefers to watch simulated sex on his computer, something that ensuring the eventual breakup of his relationship with Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). It is only when he encounters middle-aged widow Esther (Julianne Moore) on his university course that he learns to reform. The film makes great comic play out of the contrast between Jon's sexual appetites and the respectability of his life; he regularly confesses his sins in church and visits his family every week for dinner. But then Jon himself seems unaware of this disparity, which is perhaps inevitable, given his inability to understand what other people around him are thinking. Scarlett Johansson turns in a nice performances as the gum-chewing, eminently respectable Barbara, contrasted with the more worldly-wide Esther. But the film belongs to Gordon-Lewitt (as actor), whose gradual change of character is signaled through minimalist gestures and/or changes of expression. Very well worth watching."

In a situation like this, people need not rejection but support and our main character receives it from a most unlikely source."
"Amari-Sali","7","5","8","7 October 2013"," Though marketed as a comedy, it does better when it puts the comedy aside and tries to really analyze things.
","If you are one of the few who haven't been force fed a Don Jon commercial, advertisement or trailer in recent months, I'm pretty sure the NSA probably doesn't know where you are. With that said though, it is hard to not be interested with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson and even Tony Danza, who hasn't really been in much as of late, in the movie. Also, considering this is Gordon-Levitt's first go at writing and directing a feature film, there is also that added bit of intrigue.<br/><br/>Now, something you'll notice about Don Jon is that most characters feel like a slight stereotype, especially those in Jon's family. Jon (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has the makings of a stereotypical Jersey Italian who easily could have been part of the Jersey Shore show. He is aggressive, likes keeping things prim and proper, sees himself as a ladies man, and yet seems like the life he lives isn't the most satisfying. I mean, perhaps it is his porn addiction doing him in or maybe the fact he hasn't found the right one, supposedly? <br/><br/>So, enter Barbara (played by Scarlett Johansson), who unfortunately is sporting a ridiculous Italian-like accent as Gordon-Levitt. With her, we begin to really see past what the trailer has us focus on in terms of Jon being into his pad, his body, his ride, his church, his family, his girls, and his porn. With her entering in the film, we begin to realize that the porn probably is the most important thing to him to the point where it has basically shaped his view of women. He isn't alone though, Barbara also has an issue, but rather than it be porn, it is with romance movies. So, while Jon has a unrealistic, and as Esther (played by Julianne Moore) says, a one sided view of sex and relationships, Barbara has the same issue. But, what got her is the way romance films, and probably Disney films when she was a kid, have affected how she views sex and relationships. <br/><br/>The film as a whole though doesn't really try to analyze male culture in terms of how pornography has a psychological affect on men's mind, nor how romance movies create an unrealistic expectation of women's minds, if anything it is just a comedy which sort of evolves. The beginning of the movie is very comical, though not in a way where the jokes are setup to hit you hard like The Heat or This Is The End. The film instead has the type of comedy which won't get the whole theater roaring with laughter, but will make a handful laugh. Which isn't a big problem for the story stays pretty consistent, in terms of entertaining you and though Gordon-Levitt hasn't always had the best track record when playing a lead character, you can see he is really starting to gain a confidence and charm which could easily put him in the position of being a go-to for film directors.<br/><br/>I have to say though, the transition in this film from it being a light comedy to it beginning to analyze Jon as a character was a little rough at first, if just because Esther was the catalyst for this and she didn't smoothly come in, but sort of barged her way in. Once you get used to her though, she is alright, even though she had something really dramatic happen to her which doesn't necessarily make you feel sorry for her, but some sort of awkward. Also, I wasn't fond of how many times the movie decided to do these flashing scenes, not of bodies, where it would literally blind you for a good few seconds and I'm sure staring at the screen could give some people a seizure. And lastly, I must note, I am not sure why they gave Brie Larson such a small and strange role in this film. She for nearly the entire film is on her phone, delivers one line which presents the whole idea that Barbara has the whole princess in a fairy tale issue, and that is it. I mean, perhaps her being on the phone all the time was supposed to be a running gag, but it wasn't that funny.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>I would not say to run out and see the film immediately. Truth be told, I only counted about 13 laughs through the movie, and none of them were the type I couldn't hold back. They were just little chuckles. But, set aside the expectation for a comedy and you really have an interesting film. Though it presents itself like every other romantic comedy in terms of the guy meeting the girl, falling in love, breakup at climax and reconciliation, it diverts from this and even pokes fun at it a bit. And what I like the most is it approaches the idea of trying to understand how and why a person goes monogamous, without looking at it from the ""It is time for me to settle down"" route. Instead, it focuses on how porn and romance movies shape our expectations and how those expectations have influence on what we seek out. Jon is looking for a girl who wants to have sex like a porn star and Barbara is looking for the guy marketed to girls in romance movies. Both are sort of in lala land and Esther helps save Jon from keeping up his routine by helping him understand the difference from the difference between how they have sex in porn to what it is to make love to a woman. It all is fascinating stuff and that is why I think the film is worth seeing."

","I came across Don Jon while searching for something to watch and the preview looked funny. Previews lie. All the pieces in this film work, but only as pieces. The story is simplistic, the New Jersey tough man act is fake, and the only redeeming quality to the film is Brie Larson staring at her phone the whole movie. The movie doesn't do an adequate job of resolving the conflict nor are the majority of characters, including Don Jon himself, fully fleshed out. What you get is a movie that is about sex, lots and lots of sex but lacks substance. Other low budget movies that focus on characters do a much better job,including Before Sunrise and Clerks, at developing a compelling storyline and dialogue."

"GregForstner","8","3","4","31 March 2016"," Bold comedy with a deep message underneath its satirical surface
","WoW! I am writing this review as a way of crediting Joseph Gordon-Levitt (JGL) for his ambition as a director. We all know him for his stellar performances as an actor in movies such as Mysterious Skin and Looper as well as the Nolan masterpieces Inception and The Dark Knight Rises. he has a great career going on there as he has repeatedly proved to be one of Hollywood's most versatile performers – he can play the villain, he can play the mastermind, he can play the sweetheart here he has chosen to mime a dumb, incredibly superficial Don Juan of the 21st century. The main character Jon is certainly not on the bright side. he keeps his life restricted to the same patterns and the same schedule as ever: working as a bartender, hitting on attractive women and getting them to bed, working out at the gym, going to church and confessing his sins and watching a lot of internet porn. It is the last-mentioned occupation that this movie revolves around, which is kind of revolutionary in itself. How do you make a movie about a topic as sordid and yet ordinary as internet porn? You have to give it to JGL – he had had an idea there and explored it thoroughly to come up with a film that investigates the consequences of excessive porn consumption. For Jon, it has become unquestioned everyday routine to raid the internet for porn whenever he feels the need. Thus, he jerks off multiple times every day and even does it after he banged a hot girl. When he gets emotionally involved with particularly attractive Barbara, played by Scarlet Johansson, he is – for the first time – confronted with the idea that his porn addiction might be something bad. But not only Jon clings to stereotypical images- his girlfriend has a hard time challenging her own romantic ideals, which are basically epitomized by corny Hollywood tearjerkers. This is a clever arrangement by JGL which endows the movie with a depth and reflectiveness you would not expect from a comedy with this plot line. The logical synthesis that transforms Jon into a decent human is represented by Esther, fabulously played by Juliane Moore. Jon comes across her during his evening courses at university and is clearly not interested at first, because she is much older and probably not attractive enough for him. However, the lady does not let go of him and tells him truths he cannot stand to hear . at first.<br/><br/>After the first viewing, one may not really appreciate the complexity that is underneath the surface. Initially the main characters Barbara and Jon embody clichés – he is the testosterone-filled alpha male who cannot bear criticism and she is the little princess who expects her boyfriend to do everything she wants. While Jon is gradually made to question his ideals, Barbara is not. As a consequence, Jon has changed at the end of the movie while Barbara hasn't. Another compliment to JGL for his unforced handling of a delicate topic. This is an actor who clearly does not shy away from sexual performances. He treats the topic in such an honest and relaxed way that the movie transports its message to all viewers. highly recommended."
"SnoopyStyle","7","3","4","5 May 2014"," Good first big filmmaking effort from JGL
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt is bringing his best Jersey Shore impersonation. He's writing, directing, and staring in his first big filmmaking effort. Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) loves only a few things. He cares about his workouts, his cleaning, his car, his family, his church, his boys, chicks, and his porn. Then he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) at the club. On a scale from 1 to 10, she's a dime. She loves rom-coms, and she wants to completely change him. She hates him watching porn and gets him to go to night school. At school, nosy Esther (Julianne Moore) keeps bothering him.<br/><br/>There is a lot to commend on JGL's first big effort. He allows his actors to do their thing. Scarlett Johansson does a good Jersey princess. Tony Danza is amazing as the big macho father. JGL really never lets his mask slip. Julianne Moore brings the deepest character in the whole movie. The movie has its dark moments. Its subject matter is edgy. The funny moments are slightly humorous. It's a dark comedy but just not that funny. If there is an emotional truth, it hits it with a hammer. The movie really gets interesting with the Esther character. JGL did some good work here. The style looks sharp. The script probably needs a few more well written jokes. I look forward to his next directing project."

","Who else than Joseph Gordon-Levitt -one of the most versatile actors of our time- could make his directional debut about a such a controversial subject as a porn addict and make it totally work. Besides directing it he also plays Don Jon, a very macho womanizer who falls in love with Scarlett Johansson. He plays his character in a very funny and tongue in cheek way, but still believable. There are people like that out there and the recognizability of that makes it such fun to watch. I won't give away much more of the plot but I liked Levitt's first authored film a lot. Be warned though that because of the nature of the subject there might be some occasional nudity."

","Before I start reviewing this film I have to mention that in the film they mentioned pornhub.com as a master porn web page. I choose xhamster.com over it. You porn lovers will love it. It is a king of porn web pages.<br/><br/>As far as the film goes this is it! This film goes right into the middle of the issue. THE ISSUE! Men watch porn! That is right in the middle of the men minds. They are fatally attracted to it! And a lot of women for that matter! I really think there is nothing to it. It just happens, and does not affect society for that matter. A lots of people think it matters a lot, but actually it does not. <br/><br/>When Holland legalized prostitution in 1960s everyone thought that Dutch society would fall apart. But it did not. Opposite happened! Holland started attracting a lot of tourists. Legal prostitution spread like a wild fire to many nations on Earth, and porn is helping that. In effect I think it has a positive impact on the World. People get together, have sex and are less violent, For example in Holland there is almost no domestic violence. There is significantly less of it then in the societies where prostitution is not legal.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, this film is fantastic and answers many questions about porn, sex, and love. It answers questions on societies in general too. It is a MUST see! Please take time to watch it."

","Been looking forward to this one. I couldn't put it in any genre other than 'romantic comedy', but its the first movie of that genre I have enjoyed. The subtle commentary on the insanity of 'princess'-type women I thought was hilarious (at one point she tells him to stop talking about cleaning products in the shop, as it isn't 'sexy') and the obsessive nature of the main character (mainly porn) is already amusing which in turn creates many amusing situations that aren't the norm for this sort of movie.<br/><br/>It doesn't travel how you think it will, it doesn't end like any other typical romcom, it is intelligent, well-written and acted... plus it is hilarious! This is a very well-rounded movie.<br/><br/>On the other side of the pool, I thought there was way too much sex. I get that the movie was largely a commentary on modern women and relationships in modern society, so this was the focus, but c'mon! Considering the main characters attitude to these types of films and his affection for porn, all this suggestive sex seems a tad hypocritical. It is like a concession to the box-office - something for the women? Couples..? <br/><br/>Regardless, considering the tone and the ideals of this film are so clear-cut, I can't imagine couples seeing this film and coming out agreeing on all points!! I'd love to hear some of those conversations!!<br/><br/>As a single 27-year-old though I found most of this flick hysterical and most of John's comments/interactions throughout are a spot-on depiction of what relationships are really like in this modern society."

","Most people who know me know that I am a movie lover...a real, genuine, lover of the medium of movies. And they don't even have to be very good for me to like them...I just like movies. Add to that that I think that Scarlett Johansen is one of the most talented, classy, beautiful, and charismatic young actresses in movies today. Now try to imagine how horrible a movie has to be that she stars in, that has a supporting cast that includes Glenne Headly, for me to say that that movie DOES NOT HAVE EVEN ONE REDEEMING QUALITY !!! Several years ago a movie came out that had in the leading roles two absolute ""A"" list stars; it was a WW II spy thriller that was getting rave revues. Because of my finances at the time, I didn't go to see it when it first came out...I waited until it came to the one dollar theater around the corner from where I lived. It was SO bad that, not only did I walk out, but I demanded my dollar back, and the next day, wrote a letter to the production company telling them what an insult to humanity that piece of crap was. What's my point ? you ask...Well, I answer, that stinkburger was leaps and bounds better than the little gem that prompted me to write this...an absolute pile of trash entitled ""Don Jon"". AVOID THIS TRASH AT ALL COSTS. I consider myself to be a fairly articulate individual, but, I swear, I have no words to describe how awful this thing is. My fondest hope is that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who wrote, directed, and stars in this garbage pit is never allowed near a camera or a film set again...that would be doing the universe at large an ENORMOUS favor."
"Christian_Dimartino","9","7","14","27 September 2013"," A dirty-minded comedy from a very likable actor.
","When you picture Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his overly impressive resume, the last thing you picture is him as a porn addict. This fact is just part of what makes his latest movie, Don Jon, a total blast. Don Jon, in which Gordon-Levitt wrote and directed himself, places the actor out of his comfort zone, which is just one reason to see it. Another is because, well, it is a damn good movie.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt plays the title character. Jon is a muscular pervert, basically. he sleeps with plenty of women, but yet he doesn't get enough pleasure out of it. He actually gets far more pleasure from watching porn. So, watching porn is exactly what he does. When Jon meets his dream girl (Scarlett Johansson, looking as gorgeous as she always does), he even then can't move past the porn.<br/><br/>That is the movie, in summary form. But there is plenty more to it than that. JGL has written a hell of a script. Don Jon starts off as a dirty comedy, and slowly transforms into a film with a purpose. I like a movie like that. I like a movie where it ends in the complete opposite way it began.<br/><br/>Don Jon is the one unpredictable movie, and proud of it. JGL doesn't want to succumb to the Hollywood cliché. He has written a genuinely funny script here, and for the audience, it is hard to believe he had this kind of movie lined up. This is a movie with a dirt mind, but yet it has quite a bit of heart. That said, this is one of the stranger comedies in recent years.<br/><br/>Also, everyone nails their roles. JGL is excellent, but he isn't the only one who succeeds. Tony Danza, yes, Tony Danza, is terrific as Jon's dad. Also excellent is Julianne Moore (well, I think that went without saying) as a lonely woman who attends night school with Jon. Top notch acting all around.<br/><br/>I feel like I give a 9/10 a lot, but I just can't seem to find anything 10 or 8 worthy. I apologize. But Don Jon deserves it. Is it a great movie? Not quite. You feel as if the movie should go on and on, and whenever it is over, it just doesn't feel quite right. It is not like the ending is bad, but it is just a little abrupt. JGL has made a very good movie, and I am looking forward to whatever he brings out next.<br/><br/>A-"

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been acting ever since he was a child, but the 32 year-old actor really made his mark last year by starring in such hits as Looper, Lincoln, and The Dark Knight Rises. Now you can add writer and director to his credits which expand upon the many talents of this young man. He wrote, directed, and stars in the upcoming film Don Jon, and he's not afraid to take on risky topics either.<br/><br/>He stars as Jon, who's known among his friends as ""Don Jon"" due to his Don Juan lothario-like lifestyle. Jon routinely looks for the hottest ladies in the club to bring home with him. His friends urge him on and encourage his sexual accomplishments. What they don't know, however, is that he's even more addicted to watching porn than having actual sex. Jon narrates portions of the film explaining how you can find the perfect fantasy to indulge in just by turning your computer on, and that no real-life encounter could ever quite measure up to the experience. So no matter how many women he may be successful in bringing home with him, they never quite leave him feeling completely satisfied.<br/><br/>But then one night at the club, Jon spots the ultimate ""dime"" – a perfect 10. Her name is Barbara Sugarman and she's played with extra spunk and sass by Scarlett Johansson. They instantly hit it off. And though Jon might be the ultimate player, he realizes this girl is relationship material because other women he sees just don't compare. Soon enough, they become a serious couple. OK, so he might be able to brush off other ladies but what about that addiction to porn? This brings up a number of concerns such as if watching women online is the same as cheating. And if attaining the ultimate catch in real life isn't enough, than what is? Some people are just never satisfied.<br/><br/>The cast is great, and Tony Danza is especially hilarious playing Jon's tank top wearing guido dad. Julianne Moore also has an interesting supporting role as an off-kilter friend who offers Jon some insight into other ways of looking at things. I thought it would be a distraction having Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Scarlett Johansson play characters who seem like they could have been on MTV's Jersey Shore (accents and all); but it actually works since people like this do exist and they're portrayed pretty accurately. The movie is an outstanding directorial debut for Gordon-Levitt who mixes comedy and drama with ease. It also manages to make some profound points regarding such taboo topics as sex and pornography. So definitely go see it. It opens on September 27. Just leave the kids at home."
"rddj05","3","5","9","19 February 2014"," Would Have Worked Better As A 30-minute Film
","Don Jon is not a terrible film, it's just not a particularly good one. Similar to an SNL sketch that goes on too long, the story and the characters are far too thin and uninteresting to warrant a 90-minute treatment. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt (who wrote and directed) does a fine acting job and gives a solid impersonation of a shallow, ignorant, aggressive, sex-obsessed, porn-addicted 20-something Jersey boy. But he is sorely miscast. Anyone having spent any time with real-life Jersey boys of this type (or even watched them on TV), will have a very hard time accepting the cuddly and slight JGL in this role. <br/><br/>Straining credibility even further, we're forced to accept that JGL's slick character can pull any gorgeous girl from the local dance club, in minutes, and bring her home for sex (this apparently happens every weekend.) But real sex is not nearly as fulfilling to him as watching porn. He can't ""lose himself."" The premise of the film (and where it will go) is recognized about 15 minutes into the story, but there is nothing deep or interesting enough about any of the characters or plot to merit us wanting to invest in the journey any further. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore also give great performances, but again, they can't overcome the script's lack of depth.<br/><br/>In terms of tone and style, it's a bit like watching a well-done, if very unfocused, student film. It's not quite funny enough to work as a pure comedy, and not nearly weighty enough to work as a drama. Visually, it's not particularly attractive or consistent. Unmotivated camera movements occur during the few scenes that actually warrant it being still, giving us no help in connecting to the characters in those moments.<br/><br/>I respect JGL greatly for getting this film done, an it will be interesting to see how he develops, but for now, he is clearly a much more talented actor than a writer or director. <br/><br/>My advice. If you want to see a great film about a young, ignorant Italian-American's journey to evolve into a more substantive human being, put Saturday Night Fever in your queue. Not only is a great film, based on a superb script, shot during one of the best eras of American filmmaking, but you'll get to see some amazing dance sequences."

"FilmMuscle","9","6","12","29 September 2013"," Is It Better Than Porn?
","It seems like the most popular thing to do these days for actors is to make their own directorial debuts. It's never been such a trend until now (probably) when actors saw that Ben Affleck has garnered quite a bit of success as a filmmaker. Everyone from James Franco to Cate Blanchett to Ryan Gosling- I find it a little annoying, but hey, that's just my opinion. Anyways, atop numerous directorial debuts, this one belongs to a young man named Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Don Jon explores the issue that is porn addiction, and believe it or not, people, it actually exists just like sex addiction. We follow a guido-like character named (Don) Jon (played by JGL) who usually has his way of women. He lives through a strict work-out schedule, balancing it with his daily porn and a night out at the club to pick out the next skank. This casually patterns his life until he unexpectedly meets a ""dime"" (perfect/""10"" woman), Barbara who's played by none other than Scarlett Johansson. <br/><br/>Now, right from the get-go, a film with as edgy of a plot is bound to stir controversy, and so, it's no surprise that there's been a noticeable backlash against the film by- most likely- conservative critics. I'm assuming not everyone's comfortable with viewing a man enjoying masturbation or countless clips of pornography, but I guess it's not that easy to keep an open mind either. Contrary to what those shallow individuals claim, I loved the film, especially since it satirizes romantic comedies and incredibly narrow-minded gals and men, which overtly inhabit our society in its present state. The film essentially and cleverly points out how closed-minded people really act these days. Frankly, I consider women with impossibly high standards in the looks department much sluttier and repulsive than the ones who ""do it"" with a wide range of folk. The film explores such truly meaningful and relevant themes; people simply possess too high of standards nowadays, and it's this desire for what we perceive as pure perfection in a significant other. <br/><br/>A considerable amount of females habitually watch romantic comedies, and thus, leave the movie theater with this dreamy hope that someday they'll find a Channing Tatum. On the opposite side of the spectrum, lots of males consistently view porn because they lack that kind of excitement in their sex lives. After enjoying aggressive penetration (please don't mind the graphic language) in their pornographic material, they wholly expect a similar outcome for their upcoming night, but they're constantly disappointed. So, both genders ridiculously grab onto these unrealistic expectations in the end. Just dial it back on the over-reliance on physical looks (that's what I call a real slut/whore in my dictionary) and just get to know a human being- talk to them and balance out your preferences for god's sake. These similar issues can be witnessed in Jon's and Barbara's relationship as both cling on to their own expectations for one another and proceed through a bumpy road. <br/><br/>Moving on from a major element of the film, the feature also benefits from terrific editing as it rhythmically cuts through an abundance of porn clips which coincide with Jon's daily schedule and progressing story, and it's this bouncing back between various activities and material at a fast pace that makes Don Jon that much more appealing. In addition, the film certainly has its fair share of exceptional performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt (his character, himself, is fascinatingly complex and something different), Tony Danza (playing his father whom I believe gives one of the best supporting performances of the year in its sheer authenticity), Scarlett Johansson (sporting a convincing New Jersey accent), and Julianne Moore (who contributes a dramatic tone to the film's later half). On top of that, the script/dialogue feels utterly genuine where you're strongly entertained and immersed in these realistic conversations that Woody Allen's films became popular for. <br/><br/>And with that, here I'll have to digress with this strange issue critics develop towards films with occasional tonal shifts. How, in any way, does a shift in tone conflict with quality? Yes, I understand if a silly, over-the-top comedy becomes a grim and touching drama, but if a satirical comedy (in case you didn't know, it's not really as funny as a dumb, simple comedy because of the underlying- usually unfortunate- reality behind it) becomes a heart-felt drama and finally forms a sense of seriousness and misfortune, it's not that big of a deal! Every (good) comedy eventually reaches that point in its plot where the themes begin to pour out more clearly, and that's what happens in Don Jon's last half. Don't get me wrong; the film is uproariously hilarious, but it gets serious and matter-of-fact right when it needs to. Life's not all fun and games- believe it or not- and intelligent films usually carry more depth than elementary sexual and crude humor (not referring to Don Jon's style of humor). <br/><br/>Albeit a slightly abrupt and inconclusive ending, you suddenly start to realize perhaps that's the whole point. Life doesn't have a definitive climax to it unless you call death a climax. It's great for a moviegoer to have the kind of standpoint where you believe you're entering a specific period of an individual's life- it's only that part and nothing else. It's like the camera just decided that this was the most interesting segment of their life and decided to peak in during that span and then called it quits at the right moment. Furthermore, I absolutely recommend Don Jon to those who take film seriously as an art form, not as a basic medium to only lie back and experience some dumb fun with. So far, we're off to an amazing start for this fall."
"ThousandsOfFilms","1","4","7","9 March 2017"," Problematic – 3 Types of Reviews
","I put the reviews of Don Jon into 3 categories which, paraphrased are 1) ""The film is shallow and sleazy and I hate it""; 2) ""The film is shallow and sleazy and that's great because it's telling it like it is – it's an accurate ""slice of life"" story and I love it""; 3) ""The first 95% of the film is shallow and sleazy, but at the very end, it rejects the sleaze for something better and I like it.""<br/><br/>#3 is what Gordon-Levitt (writer & director) was aiming for. However, that approach has been the standard out of Hollywood for decades and it fails. For the reviewers in categories in 1 & 3 above, they already recognize the shallowness and sleaze of that lifestyle. For reviewers in 2 above, by far the largest group, they view the 95% about shallowness and sleaze and that just reinforces their view that that's the way life is. <br/><br/>What's needed is a romance movie that has heart and soul and beauty throughout – before the 1960s that was common especially in the '30s & '40s. But beginning in the '60s a downward spiral for ""romance"" movies started with each year being worse – each year the difference between Hollywood romance and porn shrunk with many describing most such fare as soft porn and many producers admitting they were aiming to produce soft porn as the best way to make money. Maybe that's why LaLaLand, which was a throwback to an earlier era, was so well received, but even it seemed like a pale shadow of Demy's films which in turn were a pale shadow of the romance films (and life) of the '30s & '40s. <br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt is a very good actor. Regarding technique, he can write and is a good director. However, he doesn't seem to have anything to write about. Maybe shallowness and sleaze is all he's experienced, first or even second hand. His efforts have no heart or soul or depth. Modern action adventure movies are well done, but modern movies about the relationship between a man and a woman too often are just soft porn.<br/><br/>The formula was wrong but to make it work, the audience should at the very least have been rooting for Jon to go with Esther (Julianne Moore) because of her inner beauty and heart, etc. – I knew in advance that's how it should go, but felt nothing except that she was annoying – not Julianne's fault – it was 100% the fault of the empty script. Jon only rises a few levels, out of about 50, from the shallowness and sleaze at the end as that's as high as Gordon-Levitt's vision can see. I don't think the new movie writer generation is capable of improving so the only solution seems to be to watch films from a different era."

","We've known for a long time that Joseph Gordon-Levitt can act. But now, with his debut on the other side of the camera in the film Don Jon, he proves he has some serious chops as a director and writer as well.<br/><br/>In today's cinematic world, when you hear a movie is about porn addiction, it's easy to assume it will involve a lot of gratuitous sex scenes strung together with a flimsy plot line. And although some porn does — understandably — make it into the movie, it's accompanied by dynamic writing, clever societal observations, and intriguing characters. At its base, Don Jon is about a man, played by Gordon- Levitt, who has created unrealistic expectations of how sex and relationships ""should"" be due to his addiction to porn. But instead of just stopping there, the film introduces Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who, unbeknownst to her, is dealing with her own unrealistic expectations that have been imposed on her from a lifetime of watching romantic movies. She wants her partner to be a ""real man"" — a guy who will be the epitome of a manly man and do everything for the woman in his life. Ultimately, as we all recognize on some level, life isn't like the movies — pornographic or otherwise — so what happens to people when they want their lives and their relationships to be so much different than reality has to offer? This is the intriguing question Gordon- Levitt's film poses in a thought-provoking but not hit-you-over-the- head-with-it kind of way.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that although this movie deals with important issues in an insightful way, it's still a movie about porn addiction. So although you won't see any full frontal shots, there are a fair amount of pornographic clips and sex scenes in the mix. Given the amount of nudity and sexuality in everything from billboard ads to HBO shows these days, the clips in Don Jon probably won't shock the average adult viewer. But if you're planning a movie date with your sweet, traditional grandmother, maybe catch another flick and check out Don Jon with friends.<br/><br/>Between sex scenes in what seems likes every movie or TV show and the romanticized ways people seem to be selling everything — from cars to perfume — it's no wonder we can get caught in a loop of thinking about nothing but sex and romance. And more importantly, thinking about it in unrealistic ways. If you're looking for a film that's clever and funny but offers a little something extra in terms of worldly observations, Don Jon is definitely worth checking out.<br/><br/>http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/don-jon"
"Nothinggrandproductions","8","4","7","5 October 2013"," A film exploring themes that are rarely explored even if it isn't overly in depth
","Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a modern day Don Juan who only cares about a few things in his life, his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls, and his porn-especially his porn. One night as he and his friends are scoping out women at the bar, he sees Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johanson), he instantly falls in ""love"" with her and eventually he begins to date her. Barbara is addicted to romantic movies, the ones with unrealistic expectations and just completely distorted related, it is used as a parallel to Jon's porn addiction and works fairly well. Jon continues to be obsessed with his porn as he dates Barbara and she expects too much of him due to the movies she watches. A set-up for failure. <br/><br/>Another character Jon meets is Esther (Julianne Moore), he meets her at a weekly night class that Barbara asked him to sign up for. She becomes more prominent and important as the film goes on but to avoid spoilers, I won't go on. The themes of the movie are certainly important and I can't think of many films that have gotten into the depths of pornography addiction or the problem with unrealistic romantic Hollywood movies, so its nice to see. Could the movie have gone a bit more in depth? Yeah probably. But, it still manages to do a nice job of displaying problems that should be displayed.<br/><br/>It's entertaining and filled with plenty of comedic moments especially with Jon's narration, which I'm still not a fan of voice-over narration but sometimes there really isn't much of a way to get into the head of this character, so it's a necessary I suppose. In general, I found the movie to be very tasteful and almost pure in a sense. Its one of the few movies were the aspect of love seemed to feel real and genuine, rather than the typical fakeness displayed in plenty of movies which was obviously the point of this film amongst its themes of pornography addiction. Again, it's very much on the lighter side of its themes, it doesn't try to get overly complex but still manages to explore what it needed to well. Overall, it's a good time and I'm a big fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor and now as a director as well, I hope to see his career flourish even more."
"TheSquiss","4","7","15","6 November 2013"," 'Filth' for those who read join-the-dots books. Porn without pleasure.
","Don Jon is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as writer/director/star, and it's a bold endeavour. Technically speaking, it's a success; his vision is clear, the editing works, the style is engaging and there's something of a story in there. The trouble is, Don Jon is billed as a comedy/drama/romance but, whilst there is certainly plenty of drama across the 90 minutes, there was little in the way of laughter generated in the screening I attended and the romance is scant enough to be overlooked, particularly as boredom sets in long before anything genuinely romantic occurs.<br/><br/>There's sex, there's porn and there's plenty of aggression in Don Jon, because Gordon-Levitt's film is about Jon (Gordon-Levitt) who, after his family, his home, his car, his church, his boys and his girls, cares about pornography more than anything.<br/><br/>Scratch that, Jon is obsessed with porn. He needs it like Lindsay Lohan needs coke (allegedly). The way Jon sees it, no matter how good the sex with a real, fleshy girl, it's not as good as losing himself in his porn. Every day. Multiple times every day. And then, across a nightclub floor, Jon spies Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), the most beautiful 'thing' he's ever seen, and it's love at first sight.<br/><br/>Except it isn't love. It's the possession of one unpleasant person by another unpleasant person; though who owns whom is open to question.<br/><br/>It's difficult to like Don Jon as a film because there is precious little to like within the film. The characters are largely unlikeable caricatures, chief amongst them both Jon and Barbara. They prompt mild amusement in a don't-let-them-anywhere-near-me kind of way but, when you get down to it, they're just not nice. They are hypocritical, grotesque, aggressive creatures that we gawp at rather than identify with. Put it this way, if you can identify with them, it's time to take a long hard look in the mirror.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand; both Gordon-Levitt and Johansson play their parts well. They are as entirely believable as they are disagreeable and one has to resist the urge to reach into the screen to be equally unpleasant to them. I just want more from a film than good performances.<br/><br/>There is humour in Don Jon, though it is mild and subtle to the point of translucence. Brie Larson as Jon's sister, Monica, is amusing as the largely mute sibling who is permanently attached to her cell phone, and her moment in the spotlight, though spotted a mile off, allows one's facial muscles to move at last.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore is on good form here as slightly damaged, partly cuckoo Esther, a fellow student in Jon's night class who might modify his behavior. Tony Danza also mildly entertains as Jon Senior, the father who berates his carbon copy son, while Glenne Headly merely annoys as the hysterical, wailing, nagging mother, Angela.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt has understandably placed himself firmly at the centre of Don Jon and presumably enjoyed the process of creating for himself a persona that thinks with his cock, revolves his life around his cock and behaves constantly like an almighty cock. Top marks for playing it well, but perhaps next time give us something to actually enjoy. It doesn't have to be 'nice'; god knows, I wouldn't want to meet Hannibal Lecter, but both Brian Cox (as Lecktor) and Anthony Hopkins gave us a monster we could enjoy.<br/><br/>And, mild spoiler alert, when 'redemption' does arrive, it just isn't believable. Really? That sex-driven, angry, fountain of testosterone would change so comprehensively and fall in love with? What? I'm not buying it.<br/><br/>There's a fun touch to the editing, cutting between the mania of Jon's porn addiction existence, his religious hypocrisy and his personal life beyond porn sites, and the repetition creates an enjoyable predictability in a Reggie Perrin way, though without the anticipation or humour.<br/><br/>Don Jon is an adult film that presumably wants to shock and offend Daily Mail readers wherever they may be barricaded, but it falls short of the skill, panache and artistry of last month's Filth. It's like comparing a pimped-up Ferrari with a graffiti-splattered ghetto wreck.<br/><br/>And, on a final annoyance, the foley artist needs to spend more time on research. Tissue does not make that sound when it lands in a metal bin. Trust me, I've tried eight times today and I'm working up to my ninth!<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"neilver","4","7","15","1 October 2013"," An attempt at an ""Edgy Romcom"" for men is only slightly less formulaic
","The subject is a ""Jersey Shore"" guido. The stakes are a happy love life. The problem is porn addiction. <br/><br/>Fine. I love the topic of addiction in general because it can present a host of emotional subplots and little machinations on film. The topic immediately reminds me of McQueen's ""Shame"" - an excellent serious drama on sex addiction in modern life (i.e. webcam porn). But when you position addiction into romcom (""romantic comedy"") the end ressult is simplification and belittling of the subject matter to point where it's just annoying. (The film is a bumbling romcom formula and then the solution to a serious problem comes in the last tenth of the film where Levitt's character suddenly realizes that abstaining from porn leaves him insatiable for real life sex.)<br/><br/>The next selling point is the edginess of this romcom. (It's the porn, stupid.) If this came out just 5 years ago I might praise the frank portrayal of porn's appeal to young men, including an internal dialogue of all the benefits of porn vs. real sex. But the topic matter just doesn't seem edgy in 2013. Oh they try though. There are cutscenes of Levitt's porn with booming music at least 30 db higher then the rest of the film's audio.<br/><br/>The third leg of the attempted hat trick doesn't fail completely - but it's definitely not a shining star. We realize how romcoms work. And so does Levitt (who also wrote and directed the film) as evidenced by an ACTUAl sequence where Levitt's character makes fun of his initial love interest's fascination with predictable romantic movies. Womanizing man? Check. Goofy friends? Gudios picking up girls and bragging about said pickups. Check. Meets girl but she doesn't like him at first? Check. He wins her over and changes his A+ womanizing to his friend's chagrin? Check. Relationship problem occurs (porn) and they break up? Check. By then the movie is almost over and Levitt, conscious of his conventionalism suddenly throws away the blueprints. The second love interest shows up (Moore) but we don't have time to learn much about her other than she likes weed and takes a night class. She suggests he try to stop porn. He does. Works. The End. Not exactly satisfying for even romantic movie fans.<br/><br/>I think a goal for this film would be Figgis' ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with more comedy. In that case it fails. But to be fair that's a very tall order.<br/><br/>Reasons you might still enjoy it: You find porn discussion funny, you loved Jersey Shore culture or you enjoy Levitt's acting skills (which are very good)."
"ferguson-6","6","8","18","25 September 2013"," a Jersey dime
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's been a few months since I saw a screening, and I'm a bit surprised it's getting a wide release. On one hand, it's the directorial debut of the very talented and popular Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On the other hand, the subject matter is not exactly mainstream ... he plays a compulsive type who is addicted to online porn.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like here. It's a front line observation of some things going on in society right now. Technology has quickly sucked away much of our face to face social interaction. Jon (JGL) has a compulsive personality. He is obsessed with cleaning his apartment, showing off his muscle car, perfecting his body at the gym, continuing his string of one-night stands with hot girls, and last but not least ... online porn. He sees nothing wrong with his addiction but readily admits his real life conquests don't meet his standards - no matter how pretty or personable they might be. Still, he goes through the motions of dance club pursuits to keep up his image with his buddies.<br/><br/>Even when he heads home for dinner with his family, communication is a mess. His sister (the great Brie Larson) never puts down her phone. His parents (Glenne Hedley and Tony Danza) are bombastic and emotional. When Jon meets a ""dime"" (translated to a perfect 10 ... why didn't Blake Edwards think of that?), his mother talks only of grandkids and his dad congratulates him on ""a nice piece of ___"" (you get the point).<br/><br/>See, this ""dime"" is Barbara, played by Scarlett Johansson. She has the look Jon so values and since he has no concept of how a relationship works, she easily manipulates him to transition into her ideal man (rom-com movies, college courses, etc). In a very telling scene, Barbara and Jon take in a Rom-Com spoof ""based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks"" and starring Anne Hathaway and Channing Tatum. Barbara's perfect man is a fictionalized knight in shining armor, while Jon's perfect woman is the latest porn star. Though the issues are identical, neither sees their own flaws ... only that of the other.<br/><br/>The story takes a dramatic turn when Jon meets Esther (Julianne Moore) in a somewhat embarrassing incident (for him). The budding relationship between the older mentor and her student of life could have made a much more interesting movie and she guides him down a path of self-discovery.<br/><br/>JGL, Scarlett and Ms. Moore are all very good in their roles, as is the entire supporting cast (Danza especially humorous as the perfectly cast dad). Although there are some very humorous scenes and lines in the film, I found it somewhat dis-spiriting due to the observations it makes on the young adult generation. The final act seemed a bit too clean for real life, but that doesn't take away from what is really a nice first outing for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a filmmaker. Stay tuned as I expect even better from him in the future."
"JvH48","6","15","40","24 February 2013"," Many viewers around me enjoyed this film more than I did. The last half hour took an interesting turn and offered some compensation
","Main character Jon is used to round up women from the disco. He always succeeds in getting the one who received the highest marks from his friends. He has sex with his prey, seemingly enjoyed by both, but the real satisfaction comes afterwards when watching porn on his laptop. History repeats itself every week, each time with a new woman appointed by his friends as an attractive target. He knows this is not the proper thing to do, and he makes a habit of dutifully confessing in church how many times he had ""intercourse out of wedlock"". Each time his sins are forgiven after a standard penance of 10 Holy Mary's and 10 Our Father's.<br/><br/>A break through this routine seems imminent when he meets a very attractive women, who is determined to turn him into a house trained husband. She even gets him to present her to his parents as his fiancée. The parents applaud his choice. Only his sister sees that this relationship is heading nowhere, but no one listens (as seems standard operating procedure in this household).<br/><br/>Only the last half hour was interesting and worth seeing. I suspect that it must be my fault, because of the apparent fact that people around me looked like enjoying themselves, with several laughs where I failed to see the humor in the scene at hand. I appreciate that this first hour of the film is needed as context, but while waiting for something relevant to happen, the overload of (bleep) F-words and stereotypes did not help to pass the time. The latter was most apparent in his parent's house, where no one seems to listen (really listen) to the other, where the father continuously watches sport on TV, and more such things we also see in the daily soap opera.<br/><br/>The interesting part starts at the moment his self-appointed fiancée wants him to stop cleaning his house by himself, though he enjoys it and knows he is competent in this. But she insists, and considers this a simple sacrifice, something that a man needs to do for a woman he loves as a matter of course. We observe some hesitation but he gives in, unknowingly that she has more such sacrifices on her sleeve. Though each seems trivial when considered separately, we gradually see these ""sacrifices"" sowing a few extra bits of doubt.<br/><br/>Near the end of the film she explains her philosophy that bringing sacrifices to a woman, is a natural thing to do for a man. She considers this a love test, so it seems, for her a matter of principle. When he objects that this is a bit one sided, she reacts baffled as if she does not understand what he is saying.<br/><br/>(***warning***spoiler ahead***) In the meantime he met a totally different woman by accident, this time not harvested from an evening in the disco, the latter being the place where he used to pick up women and take them home to have sex, following by a wanking session before the laptop. Conversely, he has no sex with her initially. It is made very clear that they come to a mutual understanding on other grounds. He confesses his porn addiction to her, and she helps him finding out why his wanking before a laptop screen is more satisfying than real sex. Eventually, the expected happy end comes about.<br/><br/>As said before, the first hour was a bit of a drag to me, though the rest of the audience seemed to enjoy it and had several laughs where I failed to see the humor of the scene at hand. Yet, the story takes an interesting turn in the last half hour. A second compensation may lie in the casting and acting, both adding much to making this film enjoyable to watch. Let me conclude with assuming that my problems with the first hour are my fault, and won't probably apply to you as a candidate viewer of this film expecting entertainment. Given that this film was part of the Panaroma Special section of the Berlinale 2013, I can only assume that the festival programmers saw some quality in it, something that I cannot confirm after the fact."
"onsetbeachbum","3","5","10","6 February 2014"," Really Bad
","The only thing saving grace for this movie was the cast. Other than that, A movie about someone with a porn addiction just doesn't cut it for me. Half the movie was about a man ""keeping in touch with himself"" if you know what I mean. They should have focused more on the relationship with the older woman and how much it changed him rather than the younger one. I think I would have enjoyed that much more. The acting was fine, the plot fell flat. You still didn't feel sorry for him at the end which was very disappointing. The stereotypical Jersey/Staten Island family was a bit too much, also didn't get the sister on her cell phone the whole movie and only spoke once, kind of a useless role, but I guess she made her money. I was expecting a lot more for this movie."
"wilemon2000","4","9","22","1 October 2013"," Miscast
","The topic of porn addiction might be worth exploring in a movie. And certainly writers should be able to generate a few laughs out of it .Oddly the laughs are very few here except those lame ones at the expense of Catholics and Italians (undershirts at dinner really ?). The real problem here is casting .Bluntly Gordon-Levitt is an excellent actor but really doesn't have the drop dead ""look"" to play the super babe magnet of the movie lead. His exchanging glances with the best looking women in the bar and then running to bed with them is pretty much a fairy tale. This is easily explained of course by the director - writer choosing himself for the lead. Then it gets a little worse when about half the movie seems dedicated to loving closeups of the directors favorite actor. A self indulgent waste. Gets as much as a 4 only because every other actor is great."

I suppose if hand held cam movies have a fan base, and movies about the freakishly stupid can find a place then a movie about a self-important barely sentient narcissist would have a following as well.I found nothing funny about this...unless clueless is funny and the entire premise is based on a guy you can't seem to admire and his conquests of a number of women of which only two were interesting - one determined that he should live for her....and the other unable to get past tragedy and live for herself. It was as if the ONLY two women in the world worth being with consisted of a manipulative, dominant egotist and an emotionally fragile woman that, though she wasn't without reason, cried all the time. Bleh!"
"Robert_duder","3","7","16","31 December 2013"," Gorden-Levitt should hang up his directing hat...an atrocious excuse for an ""art-house"" film.
","I was sceptical from the moment I saw the trailer for this. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a very talented actor but something about the trailer said to me it could be a bizarre attempt to be ""unique"" and ""artsy."" It was exactly that. To classify this as a comedy would seem wrong because it isn't even a little bit funny and is actually more disturbing and uncomfortable than anything. This was an excuse to be raunchy and disgusting and worst of all it barely made sense. The ending was excruciating, there wasn't a single good character in the entire film and the only reason I am scoring it a 3 instead of a 0 is because I actually did laugh for some reason a couple of times and I hung in there hoping that at some point this character would redeem himself or discover the error of his ways but none of that happens. This is a ridiculous, over the top, sex fuelled joke and not a good joke. It shouldn't surprise me that critics have raved about this and try as I might I can't find anything that they would find remotely impressive about this. Gordon-Levitt is a great talent and I can't figure out what about this made him think it was a good idea.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays triple duty as writer, director and star. His pompous, disgusting, sex addicted character is simply deplorable. I haven't seen a character I disliked this much since Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher. There is nothing redeemable about him. His New York accent is good but he is completely sleazy and this is by far his worst performance. Not to be outdone his romantic lead (one of them anyways) is played by Scarlett Johansson. She is trash and straight out of a bad SNL skit about New Jersey housewives. Her accent is so over the top and she is ridiculous. She is a satire of a New York woman and I don't think she's supposed to be. Their chemistry is actually decent (another reason this film doesn't get a huge zero) but it doesn't matter because the story is so bad. I adore Tony Danza, he's such a talented and charismatic guy but he throws all that out the window to play the foul mouthed and equally disgusting father to Gordon-Levitt. I was literally disturbed watching nice guy Tony belt out ""F"" words like a sailor. He did reflect the family tree of Gordon-Levitt well because both were horrible people and characters. Julianne Moore already has strikes against her because I have never liked her. This movie proves why as she pointless plays an older woman trying to subtly seduce Gordon-Levitt and teach him the true meaning of intimacy. They are bizarre together and gross to be honest. Their story line makes no sense and ends on such a stupid note. Fortunately for the rest of the supporting cast they have such small roles that they are actually tolerable because they aren't given enough time to become irritating.<br/><br/>I wish everyone saw this film in the same light because it would ensure that Gordon-Levitt would know he's a terrible director and an even worse writer and stick with what he's good at. If only there was just something redeemable in this story but I can't express enough how little there is here for anyone to enjoy. It isn't entertaining in the least, its depressing and disgusting. Now of course immediately people who want to argue with me will call me a prude and I'm not at all. I can handle just about anything screen IF its a good film or at least a film with purpose and this is neither. I pray I never have to sit through a portion of this again because it was simply awful. In my books this will easily sit in the top three worse movies of 2013. Take my word and skip it no matter how much you like anyone in it. 3/10"
"spikeypoet","9","3","5","7 December 2019"," Fantastic film!
","This film has a special place in my heart because around the time of this film's release, I was battling a horrific porn addiction. One that had deteriorated my will, drive, decision making and replaced them with extreme depression, anxiety, social isolation, insomnia and erectile dysfunction; to be frank, I was a MESS!! that mess was affecting my relationships with the people I'd meet -- I really had no desire to go out and meet people. And if I did meet girls, I was only interested in getting them into bed.
My mental health was in the toilet because of this fake thing called internet porn, which I was consuming for 8 hours each day, that had been robbing me of my best character traits, without me even realising it.
I realised that I needed help when I'd met a very attractive woman at a nightclub and we hit it off... we'd went back to my place to have sex, and I couldn't perform; I ended up going down on her and pleasuring her with my hands instead. I was gutted because she was absolutely stunning.
That relationship fell apart because I had this problem eating away at me and it was killing me. My orientation had become PORN. I was so disgusted with myself -- this illness had been building up inside of me ever since I started watching porn at age 12, and I hadn't even realised it. Back then it was VHS tapes. Fast forward to high speed internet and an endless void of clips; the human mind is not equipped to handle all of that, which I soon learned.<br/><br/>I decided that I was going to quit, so I deleted all of my porn downloads and the bookmarks to the free sites, as well as the porn I had saved on my mobile phone. I was taking on the most terrifying fight of my life, but it was something that had to happen. I was waking up drenched in cold sweat, I was an emotional wreck.
I stayed away for 1 day. Then, 1 day became 1 week. 1 week became 1 month, and so on...
After 2 years, I was free -- I cemented my victory by reminding myself how much porn had taken from me. I'm 8 years clean, at the time of writing this review.
I've been trying to coach my friend into quitting watching porn, but he can't do it because it has too much control over him, so he keeps on relapsing.
Since quitting porn, I have dedicated that time that I'd previously wasted, alone, watching porn, to self discovery, meditation, weightlifting, boxing, cycling, yoga... I have even started a fitness business. Also, coincidentally enough, I met an older lady, who is the most beautiful person I have ever met -- her heart is so pure, and I'm so in love with her. She means the world to me.<br/><br/>When I beat the juggernaut of an addiction that was porn, i upgraded, I became the person who I had always wanted to be -- I became my own champion, someone who I could always count on, someone highly motivated, strong, assertive, driven and incredibly resourceful.<br/><br/>I love this movie for mirroring my journey. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a great man for putting this film out there. It's a light approach to an EXTREMELY serious problem. I would recommend that all straight men watch this film."

","While not a masterpiece, Don Jon does offer funny moments and cleverly crafted scenes. It is also, for the most part, well-acted and directed. Most importantly, it is relevant. It takes us into the life of a young man whose perception of sex and relationships is tainted by all-too-accessible internet porn. While some of the philosophy of the film is a bit flawed, Don Jon offers interesting food for thought and is an entertaining watch. The way Jon ""keeps score"" with penances he receives during confession is kind of brilliant.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays his part perfectly. Tony Danza's performance is decent but vastly overrated. Scarlett Johanssen turns in another solid performance, but she does definitely overact in this one. Julianne Moore excels in bigger-than-life roles (maybe her brilliant performance in The End of the Affair has spoiled me forever), but her acting doesn't have the same sparkle when she plays everyday Jane roles like Esther in Don Jon. The truth is, the role of Esther is more of a convenient plot device, so it's not totally Moore's fault.<br/><br/>Brie Larson, who plays Jon's sister Monica, is probably my favorite up-and-coming actor. Though she has hardly lines in this film, the ones she does have count for a lot. Monica's face is buried in a cell phone throughout most of the movie, but she doesn't miss a thing. What she tells Jon is surprisingly insightful. Overall, I would give Don Jon a 7.5, but since I can't, I give it a 7."

","SPOILERS I really wanted to like this movie, I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor, but before he writes anymore movies, he's got to read some literature and stop watching reality TV shows. Here's a hint--reality shows are not about reality, they're meant to shock you and make you laugh. Or just shock.<br/><br/>Where to begin? The ""jersey shore"" stereotype of of an Italian guy who likes to party and go to church? Confession every week and the only thing he confesses to is self gratification and sleeping out of wedlock, for which he receives ""penance"" of 10 Our Fathers and Hail Marys? REALLY? What time period is this set in? There are no more ""confession booths""! Penance stopped being like that for over twenty or thirty years that I am aware of. It's more like ""do something kind for someone"" or volunteer. More practical if you know what I mean. Even if I was OK with the stereotype, it's a stereotype of Essex County, NJ (think Sopranos). And, Gandolfini needed an accent coach because he's from Bergen County and, we just don't speak that way. And none of them had that even remotely right, none of them. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But the stereotypes are just so over the top. A religious Italian guy who has sex indiscriminately, rates girls on looks with his friends, watches porn after he has sex with a random girl, a loud father who constantly watches football (uh, no...not in MY family) the Italian mother who only wants the best for her son and grandchildren (yeah, OK), and the sister constantly on her cell phone, even at the dinner table (not in any Italian family I know, at least in NJ). The stereotype older woman (and I mean OLD, over 20 years older) who somehow understands him and teaches him what TRUE love is. I can allow the beautiful manipulative girlfriend who wants a ""real man"" whatever that's supposed to mean, but you just can't take ONE college course in any school in NJ. There is a minimum number of credits for being a part time student, and there are all the many fees involved that would not make it practical to take one course even if you could.<br/><br/>Mr. Gordon-Levitt would have better served himself if he wrote about a stereotype he did actually know, maybe a California type is so wrapped up in himself. I guess the think is, this stereotype could have been ""living in LA"" instead of NJ.<br/><br/>So, I guess the only people who enjoyed this movie were guys who masturbate to porn on their computers and think it is normal. And they enjoyed the ti-tty shots."

","In the life of Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), there are only a few things that matter in life to him: his body, his pad, his ride, his family, church, his boys, his girls....and his porn. He believes that his loses himself a lot more watching porn than having sex. However, when Jon meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), Jon soon finds his world turned upside down. Barbara finds out about Jon's obsession and makes him stop, as well as go to school, and change his lifestyle. Jon willingly obliges because he truly feels he loves Barbara. Now Jon has to decide whether this will all be worth it in the end.<br/><br/>Don Jon not only stars, but is also written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. For his directorial debut, Levitt does a fairly decent job. He had a vision of where he wanted the film to go. It got there, but unfortunately, the ride came off as a long one. The film has solid acting by its cast; Levitt and Johansson have some decent chemistry together and you can tell they had fun with their scenes together. We are also given some comical moments between these two as well as some even funnier moments with Levitt's parents in the film played by Tony Danza and Glenne Headly. Brie Larson is also present in the almost silent (and always texting) role of Jon's sister. Also, highly noted is Julianne Moore as Esther, a woman in Jon's night class that soon becomes his confidant. While Johansson and Levitt have some good scenes together, it's the moments between Levitt and Moore that stand out the most. However, with that said, there are aspects of the film that really drag it down in the long run. With a running time of only 90 minutes, the first half of Don Jon becomes so repetitive and boring that it makes the film drag on making it seems longer than it actually is. Yes, some of these aspects are supposed to show just how much of a junkie Jon is, but it definitely should have cut back a lot. After the first half of the movie, and when the turning point of the film occurs, that's when things begin to get better, it finally gets to the heart of the story and where we finally get to see the characters and their true colors. The payoff in the end is a pleasant one and was the best way to end the film.<br/><br/>For his first film, I give Levitt quite a bit of credit for the vision he had, but as stated, it just seemed like it took too long for it to get there. But the last half of the film as well as the comical moments and the film's cast lift it up quite a bit, preventing it from falling flat.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10"

","While the plot summary of this movie warned me that it was about a guy addicted to porn, I didn't realize the movie would be porn.<br/><br/>My review could be taken with a grain of salt, because I left after about 10 minutes. There were only a handful of people in the theater with me, and one woman left after about 5 minutes. I was offended right from the start, but hoped that was for ""shock"" value and waited to see if it would go in a different direction, and maybe it eventually does, but the constant vulgar language, together with the near-porn filming makes this a most degrading movie for women, and for men who value women for anything other than their sexual indulgences.<br/><br/>I suppose there are people out there who talk and behave like this, but really, do we need to promote such language and behavior as entertainment?"

Anyone who says this movie is about porn addiction is mistaken because it goes deeper than just that. I also really liked how JGL gets you to really like Sugarman in the beginning like Don Jon until you slowly realize the relationship was never good in the first place.

I have to say I am not a fan of Scarlett Johansson. I just don't find her appealing but I could look past her for the most part because the role seemed more like her natural state LOL.

Maybe his problem is that he has no expectations of his own and he doesn't attempt to force his ""rules of the correct way to live"" on anyone else (other than when he's driving). I saw him as being generally feckless and extremely pliant; if this is correct, an examination of how the central theme of this movie got so conflated should ensue. <br/><br/>""Under a torrent of unrealistic expectations from everyone but his priest, his sister, his classmate, and a friend, Don Jon attempts to find happiness on his own terms without pretext or presumption but is unable to escape his predicament because he puts his own happiness above the things that society defines as happiness."" <br/><br/>Society has many ""relationship rules"" (human interaction generally and romantically specifically) and many are just wrong. <br/><br/>Another good list to make, or drinking game to play, would be to identify each of these rules and if they really need to be followed without exception; and why. <br/><br/>It was Einstein who said that insanity is unexamined repetition and here we have a case where not only are the ""games that people play"" left unexamined, but the context itself is wrong-headed! <br/><br/>I'd love to list the rules that I Spotted but that's definitely a Spoiler now that I've given the milk and the context away for free but it's nothing a swiffer sweeper couldn't Clean-up."

"emilywes56","8","1","1","3 January 2019"," Cliche for a good reason
","Directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in brief this film is about a guy who's addicted to porn.
I watched this film and, even if I was prepared for an American-usual cliche love story, I was enthusiastic with how Levitt used all the cliche elements to build a solid, funny, ironic, story about true-life events and situations.
This film does not only speaks about relationship matters and male/female expectations in their sex lives, but also about family structure and bonds, that plays crucial role in the understanding of one's sexuality, and that create the role model of the young people (Jon and his sister in this case). Another thing this film critisize is how 21st century people, work out strictly to be perfect, or dress up sexy, searching for perfection they deserve in the other sex. All in all, these relationships are superficial, showy and false.
(Near the end, Jon goes on the gym and when he watches some basketball players playing basket, decides to stop being a perfectionist with his body image, and goes freely to enjoy a team game.)
Also, what Joseph Gordon-Levitt wanted to show, I think, was that the powerful and obsessive sensation of porn is being destorted AFTER the most important acquaintance, the one with Julian Moore, a not so role model female figure.
The scene where Jon and Esther have sex, in her house, is the moment where he truly accept something different and FEELS something different. Esther and Jon are the two opposites, but in some way, one can complete the other, and most of all help him be, not on the one sided place."

","This is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's baby. Directed, written, produced and starring the man himself. Technically he shows flair and promise, but the film itself lacks quite a few essentials. A promiscuous young man loves his life, where he follows the same routine every day: sleep, workout, party and have sex. In between these pivotal aspects, he finds time to watch pornography...to a point where he becomes addicted to it. Unusual subject to portray, especially for a directorial debut. It certainly is a statement! Combining pornography with relationships in order to create a comedy kind of works actually. There are moments where I did laugh, particularly as Jon repeats church confessions every week (where his sins progressively get worse). Gordon-Levitt's direction was extremely competent, I especially loved his quirky traits. Quick cuts of pornography to show his character's constant thinking of it, the repetition of certain scenes to highlight his routine and focussing on certain body parts of women to portray his infatuation with sex. The latter however, I do find incredibly distasteful. Objectifying women for the majority of the runtime was superficial. It was constant. I just didn't warm to it at all. Although, showcasing Johansson was a wise choice, both their acting and chemistry was well demonstrated. For a film that was over 90 minutes long, it really didn't go anywhere. The pace was incredibly slow. So whilst I find Don Jon to be a competent comedy with technical panache, it wasn't a subject that I was particularly fond of and found certain elements to be distasteful."

I watched it was I thought this movie was made for someone like me. I wasn't disappointed, but what shocked me was that how good this movie turned out to be.<br/><br/>I was aware of the fact that porn gives a very unrealistic portrayal of sex, but I didn't know that it could be so overwhelming that you could actually like porn more than real sex. I loved the character, Jon. His daily life may not be exactly relatable to me, but his problems feel real. The struggles he went through and the lessons he learnt at the end of the movie would provide a great help to me the rest of my life. And that's why this movie is so amazing- it sticks to its subject and doesn't leave you in a cliffhanger. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson looks stunning as Barbara, and you might actually start to like her, but that's a trap our man falls into. She shines in her role. Joseph Gordon Levitt has done a stupendous job both as the actor and the director. The film holds my interest throughout its entire run, but maybe that's just me.

"fullmoonpaddle","6","1","1","22 March 2015"," A man's journey from 2-dimensional pornography toward 3-dimensional emotion.
","= CONTAINS SPOILERS = In Don Jon, the main character, Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an aggressive man obsessed with pornography and one night stands who meets Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), who Jon describes as a perfect 10. Barbara wants Jon to change, so she urges him to start going to night school to get a degree and never watch pornography again. Jon prefers porn to his relationships with real women because the imagery in the pornography that that Jon watches is more fulfilling than his very short, sexual relationships with the women he takes home and to bed. <br/><br/>When Jon confesses his sins each week, (which revolve around masturbation and pre-marital sex) the Hail Mary's that his priest assigns are said by Jon, in the gym as a way for him to count his reps while lifting. This method of channeling his penance builds his body, which in turn, helps him in his conquests and the club and bring home more women for more unfulfilling sexual relationships; an vicious circle of self-deceptive behavior. This circle of behavior is reinforced by the editing and the sequence of shots – very short camera shots are stitched together so that cuts occur every few seconds, and the pattern of Jon's life is relentlessly clear – dinner with the family, club life, sex, church, gym – over and over again. <br/><br/>The theme of Don Jon is a man's need to connect with someone other than himself. Perhaps it that frustration that causes Jon to be so angry and aggressive while driving and relating to his father, played by Tony Danza. The music in Don Jon is used as a wonderful device to share both the turmoil and serenity in Jon's life. In the club, the hip hop is so loud, it drives the people to a frenzy and into each other's arms and beds. Outside the club, the music is soft and swells perfectly whenever he has a real moment with Barbara. <br/><br/>Barbara's urging Jon to go to school does change him, but not in the way she had hoped. After Barbara and Jon do not work as a couple, Jon meets a classmate, Ester, beautifully portrayed by Julianne Moore, who is also searching for a connection after the loss of her husband and son. Although the relationship starts like many others in Jon's life with a one night stand, several weeks later, they begin to open up and relate to each other. After sharing that she has lost her husband and son in a car crash, Jon shares that he enjoys porn more than his relationships with real women because he is able to lose himself, which does not happen when he is having sex with the women he brings home. Ester lightly confronts Jon with the concept that 'porn has nothing to do with real women [-] they're just pretending."" After this conversation with Ester, he is able to discover that his view of sex through porn is two-dimensional. <br/><br/>Ester helps Jon understand this by saying she wants to lose herself too, but not in a dissociative way, but in a wave of emotion in a secure space created by having a real connection with the person that you are having sex with. After opening up for the first time about his relationship with porn, Jon is now open to this experience when he has sex with Ester the second time. This time, no music, just the silent connection between two people totally relating to each other in an honest way and by being able to experience the person he is with instead of simply focusing on the sex, Jon discovers a third dimension of sex, the feeling of love for a woman. <br/><br/>Once Jon is able to truly care for a woman as a person with complex feelings, desires and conflicts that are similar to his own, the character of Jon changes in nearly every way; he dresses in a more mature and secure style, changes his hair, and as his anger subsides, he changes is outlook on life. <br/><br/>In the past, I had avoided watching Don Jon because I had heard that the plot revolved around pornography and did not think that would make for an interesting movie. Now, after seeing the movie that I was resistant to, Don Jon brought to me a new view of intimate relationships among men and women and the pornography that can confuse everyone who searches for and talks about love."

Also Written by the man himself, this comedy-drama finds the right-tone & hits the correct notes. <br/><br/>'Don Jon' Synopsis: A New Jersey guy dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love.<br/><br/>'Don Jon' is sexually explicit, verbose & even predictable after a point, but what keeps the wheels moving is the smartly Written Screenplay by JGL. He narrates a story of emotions, sex & love, aggressively & effectively. His confident Direction deserves brownie points, too. Cinematography & Editing earn a special mention.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: JGL enacts Don Jon, superbly. Scarlett Johansson is irresistible. Julianne Moore, as always, is terrific. Others lend very good support. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Don Jon' is a true winner from JGL."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","1","25 May 2014"," A carefully planned tale of expectations vs reality in terms of sex and relationships
","""Don Jon"" has something to say. Joseph Gordon-Levitt very clearly saw something troubling in the way that pornography and sex in the media has impacted how people think about sex and relationships, and so he decided to write and direct a movie about it.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt also stars as Jon, the epitome of a New Jersey stereotype, who cares about little else except family, friends, working out, his car and women —women both real and on his computer screen. Jon can land just about any girl he wants, but in his mind, nothing can take the place of Internet pornography. He finally comes face to face with the notion that he has an addiction when he can't shake his need to watch porn despite it being his new girlfriend Barbra's (Scarlett Johansson) number one request.<br/><br/>For those curious how what kind of approach the charming leading actor takes behind the camera, Gordon-Levitt loves playing with sequencing in this movie. Jon is a routine guy: go to the club with his guys, make eye contact with a girl, dance with her, take her home, go to church, confess, get road rage, eat with his family, go to the gym, etc. (with porn of course interspersed). Gordon-Levitt ropes us into that routine to best understand Jon and how his lifestyle feeds his addiction subconsciously.<br/><br/>The curveball of the film is Julianne Moore's character, Esther. After Barbra coerces Jon into taking night classes, he meets Esther, who catches him watching porn on his phone and proceeds to engage him about it. Her role is meant to break Jon's routine, to challenge his thinking about love and sex. She's not merely a tool to these means — she has her own complexities — but she has a distinct purpose, as with all the characters. <br/><br/>Take Brie Larson as Jon's sister, Monica. Every time we see Monica she's staring at her phone and completely unengaged. But an actress like Larson doesn't get cast a screen filler simply meant to show another form of addiction (phone attachment) that's a bit more rampant in society. She's a sleeper character, ready to make a meaningful contribution to the film when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Everything is very planned in this movie. You can see the characters and scenes as pieces working together to teach us about the danger of having certain expectations about love and sex based on how it's portrayed in pornography, in romantic movies, the media, etc. You can clearly tell Gordon-Levitt's an intelligent guy and there's something satisfying in the way he so transparently makes a statement with his film.<br/><br/>In doing this, however, the film loses its organic energy. The characters feel just a bit less real, the situations a bit contrived and the drama doesn't elicit a lot of emotion. The performances are excellent — good actors are needed to breathe life into characters who were created around ideas — but ""Don Jon"" doesn't hit you anywhere. It's the kind of film that will provoke discussion and appeal to those who enjoy analyzing film, but not necessarily win over folks looking for emotional escapism in their movies.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt definitely has more directing in his future. He's learned a thing or two from folks like Rian Johnson (""Brick,"" ""Looper"") and Marc Webb (""500 Days of Summer"") about edgy, contemporary filmmaking. He might be better off working from someone else's script, but there's nothing seriously wrong with this debut effort.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","This is a great movie IMO. I almost never review a film online, but I will make an exception and pad my review to meet the criteria of a minimum of ten lines. It is without reservation that I must say Joseph Gordon-Levitt has created a great character and a memorable, great script. Tony Danza is superb as the dad. It's very nice to see Glenne Headly playing the mom. She is an under appreciated actress. I don't think it's a spoiler to comment that Jon's character transition from muscle bound, superficial porn-obsessed Jersey ass bandit to Ester's (Julianne Moore's) intimate is really well done. Really an impressive movie, and very topical, very today... This is now one of my favorite films and that is a pretty short list..."
"cornwall_7","8","1","1","28 April 2014"," The Movie that Gets Love Right
","I gave this interesting and funny satire an 8 rather than a 10 because it was a little too repetitious and dragged out a single theme a little too long. I'm not quite sure if those are even the real reasons that the movie did not feel like it had enough dramatic excitement to it.<br/><br/>However, perhaps, this movie did not need any false dramatic excitement added to it. Love and sex relationships are not really very dramatic. They're just pretty basic calculations. Either you and your partners personal desires to maintain your personal habits (e.g. Don Jon's desire to continue to clean his own house conflicting with Barbara Sugarman's demand that a housecleaner do it; Don Jon's continued desire for porn versus Sugarman's demand that he be abstinent of porn) exceed your mutual desire for sex, or they don't.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie: it did NOT make porn addiction seem like the most evil habit in the world. Yes, it shows how it could inhibit one's life, somewhat. But this movie was anything but preachy. It did NOT preach that those who watch a lot of porn have completely shallow relationships - sexual or otherwise - with other people.<br/><br/>The movie also got it right, showing the insanity of the cult of catholicism with its meaningless rituals designed only to rob stupid people of their money and make churches rich.<br/><br/>JGL's acting was deceptively subtle: designed to appear over-the-top 1- dimensional: a man concerned only about scoring with women. But the dialog was witty and detailed."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","5 April 2014"," Sometimes crude and vulgar, but always for a reason
","Don Jon is not what I would have expected Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut to be like. It tells the tale of a man deeply addicted to pornographic movies. So much so that even a million dollar babe like Scarlett Johansson can't fully satisfy his needs for sexual release. Sound vulgar and abrasive? It is, from time to time, but it's also a cutting social satire, a really good character study and a funny comedy, all wrapped into a delightful package of uncomfortableness.<br/><br/>The best part of Don Jon are its main actors. Gordon-Levitt absolutely shines in the leading role. He captures it all. The cockiness, the charm, the uncertainty, the naiveness, the lust, the strength of character, the ideals, the idiocy. Jon feels like a real human. A strange one to be sure, but he has so many layers that you cannot help but feel like he's real. Like you could meet a dude like this at the gym or outside a nightclub.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore also do credible job in portraying the two women in his life. They're polar opposites in many respects, but you can see what pulls him to them. And once again, they're both larger than life as well as real enough to please the human in us.<br/><br/>Don Jon is not for those overly sensitive about social sensibilities. Its main themes are sex, porn, addictions, falseness of outward appearances and the masks we put on to fool both others as well as ourselves. It doesn't apologize for what it is, it doesn't shy away from anything. But if you can manage it, it's one of the funniest and most poignant social commentaries you've likely seen in a long time."
"tmf084","9","1","1","8 March 2014"," objectification runs both ways ...
","JGL is a good actor but apparently he is also a good director. For his first feature length movie he did a very fine job. Granted, the movie feels a bit derivative when it comes to its screenplay and editing, but it actually helps to draw the attention to the story line. Which was a clever way of reflecting on our societies obsession with unattainable ideals and the objectification of women and to some extend the objectification of men. What I really liked about the movie is that it wasn't just a redemption story, where the viewer is let to believe that change is simply a matter of finding a way to measure up to generally accepted standards. Instead, it shows how change is way more subtle and that the main source of motivation for it has to come from yourself. As mentioned, it also explores the idea that women objectify men in a similar way with Scarlett Johanson's character trying to push Don Jon into becoming someone he isn't. The overall message I took away is that you have to learn to see people for who they are and not for what they should or could be."
"cekadah","9","1","1","26 January 2014"," His only escape
","This story is a very oblique approach to reacting to what is expected from people in their lives!<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that Don lives in a world of 'expectations'. His father expects him to be 'the ladies man'. His mother expects him to marry & settle down to have children because she wants to be a grandmother. His girlfriend expects him to do what she considers 'male' things which does not include domestic duties. His buddies expect him to be 'the big man' and bag a chick every night. And to top it off Don himself expects just going to church and confession makes him OK!<br/><br/>His porn is his only time when there are no expectations pulling him in different directions. It's just him being himself with no 'judgement by others' to deal with.<br/><br/>Then he meets Esther - and a whole new door to himself opens for him to discover.<br/><br/>This is a fine movie with many hidden messages!"
"BeneCumb","7","1","1","22 January 2014"," Distinct idea, pleasant performances, realistic ending
","Movies dealing with lust, masturbation, casual sex, etc. are not for everyone, and they must be candid or with twisted approach, otherwise they are just rude and embarrassing. In my opinion, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (director + screenwriter + leading male) has found this angle, and the result is a realistic movie depicting modern comprehension of sex and love among the younger generation, boosted by Internet and club atmosphere. Even family ties or church are often unable to hinder this...<br/><br/>All the three leading performances are sophisticated: apart from Gordon-Levitt as Jon ""Don Jon"" Martello, Jr., Scarlett Johansson as Barbara Sugarman and especially Julianne Moore as Esther provide brave but still nice performances. The other are also okay, however, most uninviting Don Jon's pals, apparently brought along for diversification of ethnicities.<br/><br/>""Only"" 7 points from me as I find some other recent movies with the presence of Gordon-Levitt more interesting (e.g. 50/50, Hesher, 500 Days of Summer). But anyways a strong feature directorial debut."

","don jon sure has a penchant for porn and yet he isn't as wild with women as you'd expect. after watching ""shame"", the topic sure isn't original, but this is a more comedic look at it. tony danza's performance was also a surprise hit for me (didn't know he was still acting)<br/><br/>the effect on the relationship isn't fully examined and just feels a bit superficial. scarlett johansson delivers a somewhat different performance to what i'm used to and it feels as if she doesn't fully delve into her character. On the other side, gordon-levitt delivers a strong performance and although the movie deals with the subject of porn, it seems a little PG at times.<br/><br/>like the way it ended, as it's not so much a an ending, but a conclusion."

"Misty_Autery","1","4","9","6 February 2014"," Not impressed
","Despite its subject matter, Don Jon has surprisingly little nudity (Jon and Barbara are fully clothed the first time they have sex). The movie only shows us snippets of the online videos and images that have consumed Jon's life and have made him keep track of the number of times he can erupt in one day (his personal best is 10). Don Jon is nominally a love triangle between a woman, a man and his laptop, but the movie is much more thoughtful and substantial than that, and it takes a compassionate and humane approach to all of its characters, even when they're at their most despicable. Don Jon implores us to look past the surfaces of our increasingly fetishized, artificial, social media-driven culture. Like Jon gradually learns, real people are always more interesting, messy flaws and all."
"jackbanister16","4","4","9","4 February 2014"," Don't feel bad for skipping ""Don Jon.""
","I feel terrible for rating a Gordon-Levitt production so low, especially one he wrote and directed, but this is just a bad movie. This movie boils down to...Shallow guy dates shallow girl then eventually becomes less shallow by having sex with an older red head lady. No other way to describe it, just BAD. Here's why I think it belongs in the depths of the Walmart's $5 bargain DVD bin:<br/><br/><ul><li>This really isn't an interesting or even entertaining film. Boring premise, wooden characters, terrible dialogue (unless you like Jersey Shore), and just a flat out bad script. Was it supposed to be a satire? Even if so...it still missed its mark. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting is atrocious. JGL did the best he could with his own terrible script and he had his funny moments, but overall it was a forgettable performance. Tony Danza, Scarlett Johannson, and Jeremy Luke should be up for razzies for their performances. Didn't even know who Luke was until I looked up his IMDb page and saw he was in such cinematic treasures as ""Jersey Shore Shark Attack."" Nuff said. Johannson's accent was like listening to Fran Drescher's voice combined with a fork grinding on a chalkboard; awful. As for Tony Danza...that guy should never be allowed near a film set...ever.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Julianne Moore looks like a man in certain scenes. She really does. I don't get this movie honestly...He goes from ""smashing"" Scarlett to sweatin' with the oldies. Ewwwww. If you tilt the screen and squint a little bit, she looks like an older version of Carrot Top. I won't even delve into the fact that her character is incredibly unrealistic and FORCED into the plot by a cheap plot device...but yeah. I digress.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The porn. I'm not a prude by any means, but this premise was just dumb. Sure, It got a few obligatory laughs from me in the beginning, but after a while, hearing the sound effect of the computer turning on became tiresome and tedious. I realize that the movie is based on Jon finding passion and romance in REAL sex instead of porn, but it just got tiresome and by the end of the movie you didn't even care. </li></ul><br/><br/>This film feels fresh for about 10 minutes until the terrible acting, robotic characters, and horrid dialogue begin to close in all around you like the killer garbage chute in Star Wars New Hope. Hoping it would get better, I watched the whole film but it really did not. Sorry Mr. Gordon Levitt."
"kentashcraft","2","4","9","3 February 2014"," Revolting
","I'm going to start with the aspect of this movie we all recognize but never talk about - the stereotype of the ""Jewish-American princess"" (JAP). Scarlett's character of Barbara Sugarman is the personification of every JAP joke, from her conservative sexual preferences to her controlling nature to her upwardly mobile ambitions. Yet despite that and having been given a Jewish- sounding name, which Jon's father even comments on, she is never specifically acknowledged as Jewish in the script. I don't have a problem with portraying stereotypes as long as it's done honestly, but here I think it was a case of doing it while stopping short of admitting it. Sorry, screenwriters, you can't have your PC and eat it too.<br/><br/>Having said that, my assessment of this movie is simply ""revolting."" How can we like a movie centered on a shallow man's overtly portrayed masturbation addiction? Its one saving grace is the always brilliant Julianne Moore's role as the breath of fresh air in this polluted story. I'm really amazed that Scarlett, who has always chosen her roles wisely in the past and now has her pick of them, would have agreed to do this one. It isn't as if she needed yet another Hot Chick role in her resume.<br/><br/>And the Catholic Church connection did nothing but make Jon's character more disgusting. As a movie, it's a well done realization of a story that I'd just as soon not see."

But this movie could have been a short film, 20-30 minutes would have been more than enough. You saw the same things over and over and over and over again...i really like Joseph Lewitt and Scarlett Johanssen but i hated their characters in this movie, i don't even think it was good acting...it was to over the top and they tried to hard that it felt more like a caricature.

"corner_cut","3","4","9","1 January 2014"," Porn is bad mkay?
","Everything about this movie seems like it has been designed to induce the general population in a deeper judgmental coma about sex and porn than it already is.<br/><br/>I can already picture bros high-fiving each other after lasting three days on a no-porn binge, like an unlikely leap of faith brought upon them by watching one of their peers stumble through a rough patch before finally hooking up with an eye-opening cougar that heals all wounds.<br/><br/>Point I'm making ==> As if porn itself was the wound in this case.<br/><br/>Porn in this movie was merely a byproduct of societal culture, as evidenced by the background shots of opening credits. Sadly, no other reference to this was made later in the movie. It's almost like JGL thought about making a movie about the state of modern sexual culture, but midway through the script just went ""F*ck it, I'll just blame it on the porn"" and wrapped up his movie...<br/><br/>This is not a movie about porn addiction, it's a movie about Jersey trash doing what they do best. Porn is just the scapegoat of the movie used to drive a skewed and lazy life lesson home in the last 5 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Scarlett's character's reaction to her boyfriend watching porn is the true problem of this movie because it is a wasted opportunity to engage two love interests into a meaningful conversation about their desires. It points yet again another accusing finger on porn when the true problem is the girl's insecurity and the guy's lack of communication skills.<br/><br/>How can so many talented actors come up is such an underdeveloped plot? If you want a good movie about porn addiction, watch the movie SHAME."

Although it is funny, the subject matter might be a little touchy to some people-I know my wife would not like it. Joseph has the nickname of Don Jon because of his womanizing skills; he and his buddies rate women on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, and Joseph never goes home with less than an 8. But, Joseph also likes to look at porn. And when he looks at porn, he likes to.... pleasure himself. Even with all these one night stands, he still masturbates-that's the touchy subject that I mentioned earlier. When Scarlett shows up on the club scene, Joseph thinks that he has found the one girl that he can be faithful to, and decides to make a commitment. Unfortunately, he gets caught visiting porn sites and the troubles begin. Tony plays Joseph's father and Julianne is a fellow student that Joseph meets. I thought it was pretty good for Joseph's directorial & writing debut. It's rated ""R"" for sexual content-including nudity-language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I thought it was pretty funny and I would buy it on DVD."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt keeps testing his boundaries as an artist and that is to be applauded. The strength of his performances in the past few films grows steadily and now he branches out in to writing, directing, and starring in a film that is truly his own. Is it a great film? No, but it is an inventive one - and that is a breath of fresh air in the current Marvel Comics shoot-'em-bang-bang-explode obsession. The fact that it deals with the current focus on sex-rated themes may be off putting to many, but that the theme is solely that speaks loudly for a young writer/director to register a parody of our current shaky quasi-relationship fad.<br/><br/>There is not a lot of story so the more brief the synopsis the better: A New Jersey guy, Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love. Though he has many sexual liaisons those episodes do not fully satisfy him the way onanism in front of a porn video does. He hits on a tacky, gum-chewing, perfect 10 Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) but that continued dance has its problems. Finally he meets a very strange older woman Esther (Julianne Moore) who puts a bit of meaning into sexual expression and Jon's life changes - maybe.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt manages to pull together a fine cast (Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents, Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke as his buddies, et al) and keeps the flavor of the accents and the characters very New Jersey. His writing for Jon's weekly confessions in church is hilarious and in general the dialogue is snappy. Gordon-Levitt spent as much time at the gym as he did creating this film and his very buff body is a showpiece! Everyone who sees this film should realize it deserves an R leaning toward X rating, but then most programs on television do these days, so everyone is used to the porn glut. Nice to see an actor take risks like this.<br/><br/>Grady Harp"

Scarlett's hand movements and gum chewing were a little over the top but I will give it a pass based on the genre of the film, I mean hey, comedy is in exaggeration of the truth right? <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt also pulled a nasty trick on me by including Tony Danza. I have a soft spot for Danza and found his character in this film to be a perfect looking glass into Don Jon's future if he followed his current path. <br/><br/>Julianne Moore's character was funny and added depth, during the film her character reveals some dark events in her history without providing much detail. The story of her past became an interesting point that was never explored or fleshed out, and leads to my one dislike in the film: the ending. <br/><br/>This is one of those endings where you can picture people sitting in a room scratching their heads, not sure what to do, so they just stop the film and show the title.

There is not even one surprise in this movie. I would have stopped watching it almost from the start, but I was really hoping that there would be something interesting in the end (given that I really like Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore), so I watched it until the end.

Unfortunately it suddenly and disappointingly spiraled into an unrealistic and pointless ""see...men really ARE sensitive!"" 'chick flick'. Men only care about their egos and how things effect their egos. Sex impacts their egos and so they care about sex. How to get it, get more of it, and how other men will perceive them for how much they are getting and with who. Everything else is pointless.

","In the same month (September 2013), American movie fans may have noticed the release of two movies about sex addiction. Although it's good to call attention to this very real problem, one of those two movies did it much better than the other. ""Thanks for Sharing"" takes the subject seriously and has a good story with appealing characters. And then there's ""Don Jon"" (R, 1:30).<br/><br/>This film is written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also stars. Jon is a man who cannot get enough sex. He has issues and, as the kids say, he needs tissues for his issues (literally). He brings to bed an endless parade of beautiful women, but still looks at pornography - constantly - even when his latest conquest is sleeping in his bed. He doesn't see a problem with this. He further shows his character's contradictions both as he swears at other drivers while he's rushing to church and as he makes completely insincere confessions in said building.<br/><br/>Jon continues unapologetically on this path until he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who he's convinced is a ""10"", but who refuses to be his latest one night stand. Jon and Barbara are adorable together, but their constant sexual play and public displays of affection eventually make us feel like voyeurs and border on the disgusting - a word that describes many aspects of this movie. Barbara begins to change Jon's behavior and just might be the one to change his priorities. Or maybe it'll be Esther (Julianne Moore), Jon's college classmate. Or maybe Jon won't change at all.<br/><br/>As we wait to see whether Jon accepts that he has a problem and remedy his approach to life and love, we're subjected to Jon and his friends' gross disrespect of women, Jon's obnoxious and dysfunctional family (headed by a very loud, foul-mouthed Tony Danza) along with characters' actions and reactions that don't make sense and are just plain dumb. Helping the audience (especially sex addicts in the audience) see that pornography can never substitute for true intimacy (and can even inhibit it) is a worthy goal, but, in this case, the destination does not justify the journey.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, we have a dumb script, disgusting displays, dysfunction and disrespect. Hmm. That's a lot of Ds in my review of ""Don Jon"". I guess one more won't hurt. This movie's grade also starts with a ""D""."
"KM_391","1","3","7","4 July 2014"," Ever Been to New Jersey?
","I just watched the first 40 minutes of this movie, and I had to shut it off. The acting is good. In fact, I especially like all of the leads - always have. But the story is stupid and obnoxious. And there are issues. Serious issues. For one, it's extremely crass. There's almost enough porn to qualify as a porn movie. But that's not what bothered me. What I HATED about this movie was its complete detachment from reality when it comes to New Jersey, where the film is set. Joseph-Gordon Levitt's character Johnny is a self-obsessed guido jackass, and his friends are all the same. Everyone in the movie uses the same fake Brooklyn accent that ignorant Hollywood types think is the way New Jerseyans sound. Maybe they should listen to Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, Ray Liotta, Peter Dinklage, Kevin Spacey, Jason Biggs or Zach Braff. These are all well-known people who live in Hollywood and speak with an ACTUAL New Jersey accent. I don't think anyone involved with this movie has ever been to New Jersey. It seems as though the entire research effort for this film involved watching a few episodes of ""Jersey Shore."" For those who think reality shows are real, please note that Snookie and her friends are NOT from New Jersey, and that show is by far the least popular program at the real Jersey Shore. And one more thing, Mr Levitt: if you're going to do the Catholic confession scene in a movie (especially if you're going to do it over and over again) it might be a good idea to find out how it really works and looks. Among other things, you missed the fact that Catholics do not call it ""The Lord's Prayer."" For your penance, please say 20 ""Our Father's"" and stay the hell out of New Jersey! P.S. It wasn't funny, either - not even a little."

","""Don Jon"" is a dim, irritating procession of clichés marshaled in service of middlebrow assertions and self-serving conclusions. This is a film that states the obvious, ad infinitum, and is quite satisfied with itself for doing so. Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore are lovely, in fine form, and play their parts well. But what maddens here is the script, which never once succeeds in keeping itself from relishing in stating worn-out thoughts everyone has had, and then gloating on how it has whelped what to any sentient, thinking viewer is mere stultification. For some people, the world makes more sense when rendered in cliché, but for a film where masturbation instead of intercourse is a theme, the main masturbators in question are the filmmakers, who never have any sentient, cognitive, contemplative intercourse with viewers."

","A movie for teenage boys who think with their hands. No plot, no sense. One of the worst things I've ever seen. Awful is little. The movie has no beginning, middle or end, Nothing but a heap of rubbish and pornography, simply a bullshit! Looks like one of those fantastic stories, aliens, monsters and ghosts to see how sex is still a huge taboo that generation. But one of the biggest taboo of our society. And what is most frightening is to see that this taboo is not decreasing, but increasing increasingly. I can only believe that actors have taken part in this film for friendship, because the story is bad it hurts, and it's a waste of talent on the scene.

"tonyblass","4","5","15","2 October 2013"," I loved this movie until I saw it
","I've been a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt since his first recurring role on a series, as David Collins in the prime time revival of Dark Shadows. Although I kind of lost interest in 3rd Rock after the first few years, I was blown away by his fearless, aggressive turn in the 2001 indie Manic. From then on I have avidly anticipated his films and virtually never been disappointed. He seems to be one of the few actors who can slip easily between edgy, quirky character studies and big budget popcorn fare without sacrificing his own unique charm, style and vulnerability.<br/><br/>So much so that I almost resisted seeing ""Thanks For Sharing"" last week out of fear that it would compare so unfavorably to this similarly- themed investigation into the thrills and perils of sex addiction. I could not have been more wrong. Whereas Mark Ruffalo delivered a nuanced, engaging and very believable portrayal of a man struggling with his objectification of women and it attendant intimacy issues in that film, JG-L seems here to be engaged in some sort of Funny or Die YouTube parody of Jersey Shore. I'm still reeling a full 24 hours later at not only his lack of understanding or remotest sensitivity for the material, but his complete lack of credibility in the role. He was everything he never is: mannered, stiff (not in a good way) and really kind of vague in his choices. I'll let others complain about the holes in the storytelling, clunky dialog, laughably obtuse attempts at sexual satire and the cartoonish supporting cast (apart from the always ethereal but mostly wasted presence of Julianne Moore).<br/><br/>The main takeaway, the one that I find truly mystifying if not downright disturbing is the work of the auteur himself. All I can suggest is that he get himself to the filmic equivalent of a nunnery and stay there in penitent seclusion until he has thoroughly paid for this sin, as well as seriously confronting not only his strengths but also his limitations as an artist. At 10 he was a protégé but at 32 he should be much more prepared before attempting such lofty creative feats lest he end up an overnight cessation."

The story is a shallow look at a guy who is addicted to porn and his revelation when he meets someone he connects with to form a more sensual aspect to his porn. It is about a junior high school level. I almost stopped watching 20 min in because of how crude it was. Do we really need to see snippets of porn to express this guys problem? Did we need such a tragic female to somehow pull hi out of his addiction? No subtlety here. I'm sorry but there is simply no way you could give this 10 stars unless you are a 15 year old boy."

","I never have enough energy about movies to actually end up writing big reviews of them - but I'm willing to make an exception for Don Jon, because it is absolutely the best movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It is obvious from the beginning and the particularly awkward nature of it that this is a movie that's not for everyone to enjoy - and while it will most certainly become the subject of a very generalized appreciation, it is really aimed towards a particular niche market that will really appreciate this movie the most.<br/><br/>Don Jon is unique among movies I have seen, in that the protagonist is not necessarily someone you will like. In fact, throughout this entire movie, I hated Don Jon - and I was expecting to most absolutely love him throughout this movie. I would never approve of a guy like this getting out there and even being able to be happy. If you know me well enough (okay, none of you IMDb readers probably do, sorry - so in case you don't know me, I'm not a particularly big fan of people who submit to the Christian doctrine, use Apple products, have a genuine ""idgaf"" attitude, and make so much money to be who they are behind closed doors - as in, we never find out what Don Jon's job is - and I would loathe him more so if he was one of those people who got paid so much to just actually sit around and not contribute.<br/><br/>And yet, director Gordon-Levitt makes it clear that while the movie is centered on the character ""Don Jon"" and is even titled after him, Don Jon is just a character in what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>Not once in this movie, at any point, are you convinced that it is everything that you thought it would be based on what you saw in the trailer, or perhaps even what you have read about it - which exemplifies the genius in Gordon-Levitt's execution. This is better than you expect. All the best movies we have ever made were better than we expected in some sort of way.<br/><br/>I think that this is genius - because it's going to get a wider attention that it otherwise wouldn't get if the trailer was an actual summary of the point. It's evidence that Gordon-Levitt knows how to market movies: with a conservative trailer, a one-sided hype and a large following of media saying that this movie is absolutely awesome, he is essentially fooling people into this movie by making people think that it's not what it actually is - that it's just another broken-guy-meets-beautiful-girl-and-changes-forever flick that it is actually making fun of in some parts.<br/><br/>I mean, think about the trailer. The trailer misses out on several important details that make this movie what it is - and, on top of that, it's not saucy in any way, making the first 30 minutes seem completely out of proportion to the point where you will want to get up and leave the theatre and not see the rest of the movie. And, in fact, the two girls sitting beside me decided to get up and just do that - they walked right out. They completely missed what really made this movie beautiful.<br/><br/>And, you know what, I don't blame them. The story of Don Jon is really not for them. As I was saying.... while Don Jon is certainly to become a subject of a very generalized appreciation (by those who actually get through the WHOLE movie and pay attention in spite of the way the movie makes you want to turn away some times), it's really unique in that it's aimed towards a particularly niche market who will really appreciate this movie the most, because... well... you'll have to watch the movie and decide this for yourself. The only way to explain this would be to spoil everything to you and ruin your experience."

"Hey_Sweden","8","2","4","25 November 2015"," Interesting examination of dating in the modern age.
","The talented actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a creditable writing & directing debut with this stylish, amusing, and sexually frank character study. Gordon-Levitt himself plays the character in question, a young New Jersey man ""in the service industry"" with a fairly short list of what matters to him in life. He has a real knack for being able to score with any hot woman he desires, but at the same time he has a hopeless addiction to Internet pornography. He can't go a day without checking out numerous sites. Then he meets a beauty, Barbara Sugarman (the delectable Scarlett Johansson), with whom he might be able to maintain an actual relationship. But he just can't give up his daily habit.<br/><br/>This extremely well shot film attempts to take a hard look at how todays' people have hangups that prevent them from having fulfilling relationships. As we are shown, both Jon and Barbara have idealized notions: he finds Internet porn preferable to real life sex, and she's been raised on scores of romantic movies, so they've been conditioned to concentrate on fantasy rather than reality. Gordon-Levitt cannily makes references to the way that sex is sold in order to appeal to consumers, which is all part of the problem. What doesn't help is when people get too wrapped up in themselves, and cannot make connections to other flesh & blood human beings.<br/><br/>There's of course lots of raunchy imagery, and quite a bit of colourful language, so this won't be for all tastes, but Gordon-Levitt is using it all in service of the plot.<br/><br/>He's charming and engaging in the lead, and Johansson is similarly appealing. Julianne Moore has a delightful presence as the older woman Jon encounters in night school; it's with her that he's finally able to display some real candor. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly are fine as Jons' parents, and Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke have their moments as his friends.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the script refrains from ever becoming TOO predictable.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"utgard14","5","2","4","1 February 2014"," Not a bad movie but not for me
","For starters, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fine as you might expect but I was most surprised by Scarlett Johansson. She's not an actress I've ever been overly-impressed with but here she shows some range and is pretty good. I also enjoyed Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents. The film starts out like a sort of romantic comedy but turns into something less pleasant and more artsy. Once Julianne Moore enters the picture, things go downhill. I quickly realized what was about to happen with the story and, not being a big fan of Moore's, my interest level dropped significantly. I liked the chemistry and banter between Levitt and Johansson early on. I didn't like the Levitt/Moore chemistry. She looks like his grandmother so that was off-putting to me. Yes, I realize that's shallow and will upset some people but that's how I feel. I didn't find their scenes romantic or sexy at all. The funny bits are sparse and what it's trying to say is not as profound as it seems to believe. I appreciate Joseph Gordon-Levitt's talent. He's a very likable actor and he directs this very well. He could have a big future ahead of him as a director. My criticisms of the movie are solely from an entertainment perspective, which is subjective obviously. I'm not a pompous indie film fan. Maybe if I was I would love it more. It's just not my cup of tea."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has turned into one of the best and most interesting of Hollywood's young talents. He has a knack for picking good projects, and consistently takes on interesting roles, not content to glide by on his looks and charm like so many pretty boy actors.<br/><br/>So it did not surprise me that ""Don Jon,"" his debut as director (he also wrote and stars), is not a typical romantic comedy. Though billed as a movie about a sex addict, the film isn't about addiction so much as it's about the inability of people to form meaningful relationships with others because of preconceived notions (most of them completely unrealistic) about what those relationships should be. One would think based on previews that Gordon-Levitt's character, a guido with slicked back hair and an Internet porn obsession, meets his match when he falls for a hot dame (played by Scarlett Johansson) and must become a better man in order to earn the right to be loved by her. But that's not what happens, and one of the things I liked best about the movie is that Johansson proves to be the film's villain (as much as a movie like this has a villain), and that her expectations about relationships are just as distorted as his, just in different ways.<br/><br/>""Don Jon"" isn't a terrific movie. It feels more like an early draft than a fully fleshed out final product, with conflicts being resolved too quickly and patly, characters coming to realizations too easily. It was too hard for me to lose myself in the movie and forget that I was watching actors play parts, a sure sign for me that something about the film I'm watching isn't totally working. I felt this the most when watching the scenes between Gordon-Levitt and Julianne Moore, who plays an older and wiser woman who becomes Don's mentor in sex and love. Moore is a lovely actress and I always want to like her, but something about her character in this just didn't ring true for me, though a revelation about her character late in the movie gives it one of its nicest and most touching moments.<br/><br/>So not a great film, but certainly one worth checking out as a rental, and good enough to make me look forward to what Joseph Gordon-Levitt the filmmaker is going to do next.<br/><br/>The film also stars Tony Danza as Don's foul-mouthed father, and Alison Brie as his sister, who has exactly one line of dialogue but somehow manages to be one of the most memorable things about the movie.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

So I came across this movie one day and check a few rewiews and they were quite good. So I decided to give it a try. But I really wasn't impressed. What can I say. This movie is basically a guy getting angry in the car, going to confession, looking at a girls in the bar and having lunch with his familly. And btw I didn't grinned even once through whole movie. This guy saying ""f*** this bi***"" all the time reminds me of Tommy Wiseau's ""I don't wanna talk about it"" in The Room. And why is his father pi**ed off all the time? And which normal girl would left a guy because he watches porn even though they have normal regular sex? And his sister who is always quiet and on her phone...why??? The dialogues are so basic as I was writting them and I am no native speaker. But at least one thing is good in this movie and that is Julianne Moore. I like her very much. She gives us one great moral of the story guys. And that is - go for the mature woman when you are young. Don't waste your time with young spoiled girls. They will just complicate your life. The same goes with this movie - don't waste your time with it."

","Generally speaking, Sundance is not my gig.<br/><br/>Call me shallow, but I incline toward major motion pictures, or feature films.<br/><br/>I rarely watch documentaries or independents.<br/><br/>And I thought a movie about a guy addicted to pornography sounded gross and off-putting. But I should have known; Jo-Go would never let me down.<br/><br/>Don Jon's a winner.<br/><br/>The narrative is timely, stylish and thought-provoking. It moves along at a brisk, enjoyable pace with a cast of relatable and compelling characters. Starring, written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who's been one of my favorites for years) this movie depicts a regular guy, dealing with regular issues. And it's great!<br/><br/>This is not the type of movie you watch with your girlfriend, your parents or your grandparents. Or your grandkids, for that matter.<br/><br/>It's almost cheating with the casting choices made for this film. Scarlett Johansson's one of the top actresses working today, Tony Danza was such a radical (but perfect) choice to play his father, and Julianne Moore is great as always.<br/><br/>First of all, Scarlett's role as Barbara Sugarman, is nothing short of fantastic. It really explores the mindset of a certain type of woman. She's so aware of her sexiness that she truly believes she inhabits a higher class of humanity.<br/><br/>It's been a helluva year for Scarlett. Let's hope she keeps it up!<br/><br/>The stylistic touches are probably what make the movie soar. Each shot adds to the story, and it keeps the pacing crisp as well.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Don Jon, it's worth the watch. It explores a lot of truths that some may interpret as a misogynistic tone. I applaud Joseph Gordon-Levitt for writing such an honest, cutting edge screenplay.<br/><br/>Now, watch out for spoilers below.<br/><br/>There is one point in the movie that he's watching porn and is narrating his actions through voice-over. What's fascinating is it breaks the fourth wall in a subtle way, because Scarlett catches him at that moment. She interrupts the voice-over narration of himself!<br/><br/>It's a bit of a time paradox if you think about it.<br/><br/>There are bursts of joy at times, when certain events occur in the manner you hope they will. When the stylistic fireworks go off, and pieces start to fall into the right places, you feel a swelling of happiness. And I think that's noteworthy, given the limited storytelling that's going on in Don Jon.<br/><br/>I love Acts I and II but didn't adore the ending.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why. The whole movie skips along at such a brisk pace, but I never really enjoy the time he spends with Julianne Moore. It's all just so sad and pathetic. But it's not terrible!<br/><br/>I just found it underwhelming.<br/><br/>That being said, Don Jon's enormously insightful, brilliantly shot, masterfully edited, well-acted and just a good story all around.<br/><br/>Good on ya, Joseph Gordon!"

It was completely different to anything else he's starred in and would be a massive jump. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! He fit into character so well, it's easily one of the best films I have seen all year. Not just that, I've potentially fell in love with JGL's New York accent. Wow.<br/><br/>Bravo to Scarl-Jo also.

","The trailer promoted the concept of the film very well, and it seemed very funny - but at the same time I was somewhat afraid that the film would end up in the consensus that ""men are pigs"" or something of that sort. After watching it, all I have to say is this:<br/><br/>Absolutely fantastic film that discusses the unrealistic expectations of love and sex promoted to young people by the media. This film should be used for educational purposes for young people! I've seen testimonials from a number of parents watching this together with their children, helping to form a healthy view of sex and love.<br/><br/>When regarding the more cinematic/acting aspects, I do agree that it is not the best film of recent years, but the plot, characters and message that it sends makes it a well spent hour and a half."

Something new this time from a young director not all that sci-fi or Action thriller, its just a story of a normal guy. so i will give him 9/10 for direction and story writing. Now about the movie this guy Don loves his family ,friends and church. he likes his physique and workout hard every day, He s not educated enough so he s doing bartender job. He pick random gals everyday and make out with them but he never liked any of them then one day he met Barbara(Scarlet )oh god she s hot and she looks dam beautiful. He fall n love with her and try to b honest to her but he fails on some aspects (porn). In start as every single love story things went cool and nice and later on when they spent time with each other things went worse ,and they screwed. Scarlet was dam sexy but yes she did a good job and she starts acting and no doubt Joseph Gordon-Levitt becomes a young American actor he s dam good with acting skills and fully dedicated to his character in this film . Juliana Moore as Esther dam she become even better with her age,nice acting and she to rocks ...simply great acting Well every guy must watch it because i don't agree with this every guy watch porn daily in his life.

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut in a feature ""Don Jon"" definitely takes the cake as one of the years best romantic comedies. Funny and definitely original, ""Don Jon"" had more to it than just its suggested theme about a porn-addicted gym head and stood out with its premise that Jon had found his ""perfect"" girl but was still unfulfilled. The film really illustrated the other side of sex and love and proved that unrealistic expectations about the two can prove to be detrimental to a relationship built on superficial standards. Although there were some parts that were overly stereotypical in regards to people in New Jersey and female foreplay, for the most part it was a good film. Gordon-Levitt's film was well received and with good reason; the modern take on relationships was a breath of fresh air amongst the typical sappy romantic movies."

I think it's a movie about how people perceive porn and people who watch porn. It also shows the real way of dealing about it. <br/><br/>I feel great watching this movie.

","Review: When this movie starts off, I thought that it was going to be about a guy who is addicted to online porn and falls in love with a girl in a club, but it's very cleverly written by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and you can't help but get caught up in his weird lifestyle. It's a deep drama which has some interesting characters and a original script. For a young person, he has directed a very adult movie which deals with things that people are obsessed with in this day and age and how they can warp your mind. There is a lot of porn throughout the movie so if your not into that type of thing, this movie is definitely not for you, but there is a hidden message behind the whole story of Don Jon which a lot of people can relate to. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I really didn't know what to expect from this film because I haven't really heard that much about it, but after watching it, I can honestly say that I did end up getting caught up with all of the characters personals issues. I'm glad that the film made a profit because it was a great achievement by the first time director, and he had a original style of directing which was refreshing. In all, it's definitely worth a watch and I hope that Joseph Gordon-Levitt directs another movie.<br/><br/>Budget: $6million Worldwide Gross: $30.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there comedy/dramas about a guy whose addicted to online porn and struggles to find love. 6/10"

","""Don Jon"" is one of the most down to earth films I have ever seen. It always avoids being around the bush and usually describes the mind of men in certain situations, Joseph Gordon-Levvit is excellent at portraying the role of just an average Jo, and he excellent at making the dialogue extremely realistic, some may not like this though. A positive is it has great pacing but loses it towards the end and kinda gets weird in a way.Another thing to mention is the film is quite repetitive, but this is OK because it is done in a really funny way, which shows a lot of promise.This is a brilliant debut for Joseph and he'll only get better."
"Sherazade","7","0","0","25 March 2014"," Like a mirror on what society shamelessly calls normal...
","The best part of this film (which was brilliantly written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt who stars as the titular character) is that it doesn't propose to solve any of the issues presented here it just highlights some particularly shameless norms of society. For example, a guy meets a girl at a club, buys her a drink and dances with her and by the end of the night it's customary that he gets to sleep with her. It is also customary to refer to women as bitches or whores and use foul language to compensate for little to non-existent vocabulary. All these are part of our social norms. Another example is; a guy who is addicted to watching pornography naturally would expect the women he encounters in real life to live up to that dolled up scripted reality as would a girl who is addicted to watching Hollywood romances where the leading actor does everything for the woman he loves, would expect the same from the real life men she encounters. Or perhaps the most daunting of examples could be seen in Jon's incessant worldly ways yet he goes to Church every Sunday to confess his sins only to go out into the world and do it all over again and the cycle continues. Except for a few editing issues, it's a very good commentary society's social cesspool with shining performances by Scarlett Johansson, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Julianne Moore."

Anyway, the characters are magnificent. Thumbs up to the three lead actors. Overall i give Don Jon a 7/10, despite the 'non educating' story, it actually have a good moral everyone can learn from.

"estebangonzalez10","7","0","0","15 February 2014"," JGL can also direct!
","""For these, and all the sins in my life, I am sorry.""<br/><br/>I found Don Jon to be a solid feature debut from Joseph Gordon Levitt as a director who also starred in and wrote the original screenplay for this raunchy romantic comedy. He's a very talented actor, but here he gets to prove his skills as a director and a writer as well. This isn't your typical rom-com and it will probably make you feel uncomfortable from the start because it is not a family film. The writing may have some flaws and at times you may feel like JGL is hammering his message way too much, but I thought he was going for a similar style that Scorsese went for in The Wolf of Wall Street in which several excesses were repeated over and over again to make a point. I found it rather funny that despite how much the message was hammered many people still didn't get the point of the film which was much more than pointing out that pornography is a dangerous addiction that affects relationships. Yes, that is one of the messages behind this film which shows hoy pornography can affect intimacy in a relationship by turning sex into something unilateral. It's about what I can receive from a relationship instead of losing oneself in the other and actually experimenting what love really means. But the film explores much more than pointing out the dangers of pornography addiction. It also is about how disconnected we've become as a society. JGL's character is disconnected due to his addiction, his girlfriend believes love is all about the other person giving up everything for her (which is something she's learned from the rom-coms she eats up almost on a daily basis), which also turns her into someone who is looking for love in a unilateral form, his father is obsessed with sports and if his son isn't interested he doesn't consider him to be a real man, his mother is desperate for him to find a girl so she can be a grandmother, and his sister is completely disconnected and spends almost the entire film speechless on her cellphone. But despite how dysfunctional everyone is in this family, somehow the only person that really sees that Jon's relationship isn't a solid one is his sister who notices what everyone else doesn't see about Jon's girlfriends. By doing this I felt that JGL was pointing out that even that person that seems more disconnected than the rest of society might surprise us. We tend to see the problems in others, but we rarely look at our own defects. Don Jon may hammer its message, but it is not just about Jon's addiction with pornography, there is much more to it.<br/><br/>The story centers on - and is narrated by - Jon (Joseph Gordon Levitt), better known to his friends as Don Jon for his ability to conquer women. In his voice over narration he tells us that the only things he cares about in life are his body, his pad, his ride, his car, his family which includes his father Jon Sr. (Tony Danza), his mother Angela (Glenne Neadly) and his sister Monica (Brie Larson), his church, his boys Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke), his girls, and his porn. He spends a great deal of his time on these things, he visits his family frequently, he works out in the gym daily, he spends time at the club with his boys looking for women and rating them on the 10 point scale, he goes to church every week and confesses his sins to the priest, and most of all he watches porn and loses himself in it. He confesses that he enjoys it even more than actual sex, but he has evidently developed unrealistic expectations from it. One night at the club, he meets Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) and completely falls in love with her, but he continues to struggle finding true intimacy with her and building a strong relationship. Along the way he meets a fellow student named Esther (Julianne Moore) who sort of opens his eyes about love and relationships.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that Shame explored a similar theme recently, it's a subject we rarely see in films. Don Jon is a real exploration of modern relationships and how they've been affected from the way media and films sell sex everywhere. We are bombarded with sexual images in the media all the time creating one sided expectations about love and sex and the film opens by presenting several of these images sort of setting the tone for the rest of the movie. JGL plays a very different role from what we are used to seeing him in and he also worked out a lot for it. HIs character follows a certain routine in life, and the film makes sure it repeats this to get the point across. There are a lot of interesting points this film raises and it really is a comedy with a strong message about how disconnected we've become. The performances in this film were all solid."

","I'm a woman and I think this movie deserves more stars than it got on here. I gave it an 8. It takes an objective look at the relationship between a person and porn. Porn can indeed be an addiction. It's just like smoking when you want to feel good- once you're used to it, you can't give it up even if it affects your relationships.<br/><br/>I don't think porn is ultimately bad, neither does this movie probably. The movie does make a point that good sex brought by a good relationship can be much better than porn and can replace porn...It depends on how you think about it: The main character likes porn more than real sex. Is that a problem, a bad thing? This movie takes a side slightly saying yes, but it doesn't push it down your throat. You can explore.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie. It made me think about this whole porn thing and expectations from sex in general. Joseph Gordon-Lewitt did a nice job, so did Scarlett Johansson. You can watch Scarlett here acting as a slightly vicious character and that's a change. Julianne Moore did great as the older woman who is troubled but charming. A good watch."

Sure, the ending is a bit predictable and the dialogues can sound a bit off sometimes, but I was impressed by the photography and direction of the movie. Some shots were beautiful. Plus he really has the whole New Jersey kinda-macho character down! The supporting actors were great too, some of them deliciously annoying (I'm looking at you, Scarlett Johansson! Quality acting on her part), and some of them quite attaching.

This guy has just been knocking it out of the park with his transition from child star to adult actor and now director, and isn't it nice to see someone do that with such grace? Don Jon is not a perfect movie, but it certainly surprised me with its polish and seriousness. JGL could have gone for a much broader comedic performance and more ephemeral theme, but instead he delivers an interesting meditation on internet porn, dating, bro culture, addiction, religion, etc. This is not a throwaway romantic comedy, and for that I was very grateful. <br/><br/>I also don't agree with the sentiments of those who found the message and delivery heavy handed. I thought the style suited the subject matter and accurately reflected our modern internet culture. To dismiss it as gratuitous might say more about a reviewer's mindset than the movie itself. It's not a movie suitable for kids or the prudish, but everyone else should be able to appreciate it. There is no offense intended, nor should any be taken.

Very well written, the movie gets to the point and doesn't drag or bore with scenes that aren't necessary. The actors do a tremendous job in their respective roles, and the movie itself is more of a lifelike portrayal, rather than silly and ridiculous. It has just the right blend of comedic and dramatic moments. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did his research and did a great job.

Not sure how I'd classify it, it has some drama, romance, you can laugh at it but it's definitely not comedy. If you don't read reviews or don't care who's directed it like me, and you can see deeper meaning beside shallow, two dimensional thing that are so common now you'll find it refreshing and exceptional, just let movie take you and judge t by what you see.

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt's ""Don Jon"" is a bit self-absorbed, but it still delivers the goods as an enjoyable entertainment fare. Gordon-Levitt stars as Jon, a New Jersey Guido-like ladies' man who is addicted to pornography; but still manages to be devoted to his church & family. His friends and hooking up with the ladies also play instrumental to his life, but unfortunately Jon needs to be ""born again"" instead of ""porn again"". His pornography addiction does get out of hand; sort of speak. Jon does hook up with a sexbomb Guidoette in the voluptuous Barbara Sugarman. I guess his ""searching for Sugarman"" was a sweet find. Barbara is a chick-flick lover, but not the same type of ""chick flicks"" that Jon logs on to. Jon also befriends an older night school peer in the depressed Esther who plays vital in his development. ""Don Jon"" is Gordon-Levitt's baby, as he also wrote and directed the flick. His head- on direction and humorous screenplay did come with the goods, but the egoism behind most of his characters was a bit of a turn off. Gordon- Levitt's starring performance as Jon was solid but not spectacular. Scarlett Johansson was exquisite & debonair in her performance as Barbara, and Julianne Moore was great as always in her work as Esther. However, my favorite performance of ""Don Jon"" was of Tony Danza who was a scene-stealer as Jon's vociferous father Jon Sr. Tony showed that he was the boss in the film's family dinner scenes who Gordon-Levitt also presented them in homage to the similar themed scenes in ""Saturday Night Fever"". I will not reveal if ""Don Jon"" has a happy ending because that would be cinematically criminal. But I will reveal that you will feel most satisfied seeing this movie into its final climax. **** Good"

","Don Jon is a romantic comedy and as such there are a few things you more or less have to take with a grain of salt. At least to some degree it will be generic and formulaic.<br/><br/>In this case Don is a stereotypical alpha male, whose interests are going to the gym, his car, church and picking up girls for one night stands. And of course porn. He decides one night stands aren't equaling his porn induced fantasies and decides to get into a relationship with a girl. Instantly he becomes the polar opposite of who he was, he goes to romantic movies he hates because she likes them, he doesn't push her to have sex, goes back to school because she likes it etc. That all happens in the intro to the movie so ill leave the almost spoilers there.<br/><br/>Essentially he has one classic unhealthy lifestyle, trades it for what he thinks hes supposed to look for, but its disingenuous and just as unhealthy. <br/><br/>There's a significant amount of religious context, at first it makes sense because the character has never questioned his lifestyle. But as he metamorphosis's from alpha male jerk to sensitive boyfriend and then his ultimate personification, he starts to question the things in his life. He almost half questions his belief in Christianity, but doesn't really follow through. Maybe they ran out of time. Anyway as with all romantic comedies he eventually sees the error of his ways and finds happiness.<br/><br/>This film does 2 things differently. One it focuses on Pornography, which i like because its a huge part of adult life which often studios are too timid to want to tackle, and the other is it added in a sort of middle man between unhealthy lifestyle and healthy resolution. Im not entirely sure the added state of unhealthiness was necessary but who am i to judge. On the pornography note i was fairly happy throughout the majority of the film, even though factors in his personal life seek to annihilate his practice of watching pornography at various times he defends it as natural and a part of pretty much every adult males life, all of which are true. Then he goes and, as we more or less always knew he would, ditches watching it altogether which kind of sends the message that it was abhorrent. In that sense the film took a man abusing something in an unhealthy way and basically made it taboo, which is equally fallacious.<br/><br/>Not sure how the average viewer would watch this. The majority of romantic comedy watchers are likely to be women who might not like the frank portrayal of human sexuality and the contemporary reliance on porn for basically all men, but on the other hand i'm not too certain many men will appreciate the formulaic and ultimately obvious ending. <br/><br/>I will say on a positive note, it was extremely satisfying seeing Gordon-Levitt acting macho, protruding his chest constantly and flexing his arms superfluously. He reminded me, i'm sure intentionally, a great deal of Jersey Shores Mike ""the situation""."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt writes, directs and stars in the whimsical tale about a pornographic addiction. Eons away in style, tone and gravity as compared to the similarly themed ""Shame"", ""Don Jon"" is a comedy drama set in New Jersey about Jon, a narcissistic young man, whose life is focused on his bulging biceps, one night stands and his addiction to porn. Dedicated to a simple few things, Jon isn't the type who looks for long term relationships. Until he meets the blonde bombshell Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson in her most charismatic role in years), who captures Jon's undying attention and slowly wraps him around her finger - making him take up a business course, fighting his small idiosyncrasies and - worst of all - obliging him to resign from pornhub...<br/><br/>The star of the movie excels as the straight-forward Jersey Italian, unaware of his weakness, living in denial, yet too simplistic to remold himself. The denouement, when it comes, seems however largely out of character, as Jon gains depth, complexity and self-awareness far beyond anything suggested earlier in the movie. Such a revelatory change happens plot-wise, but seems overly forced, lacking a structural backbone which can not be explained by the impact of his affair with classmate Esther (Julianne Moore).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, ""Don Jon"" is an extremely enjoyable affair, especially for its target group - men at large - uncovering some unspoken truths about masculinity. At times Joseph Gordon-Levitt's script reveals some true wit and foresight, with the last scene of Jon in a confessional a true mantelpiece of the movie, delivering a wickedly accurate commentary on the institution of confession. Slightly uneven, ""Don Jon"" does also mostly capture the man's point of view on the subject matter, albeit (possibly purposefully) omitting the female perspective so widely approached in rom-coms. Thankfully the comedy does so, while omitting crude sexual humour in a porn-focused movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers an admirable debut, especially with some of the manly banter and in the construction of several scenes. With time and experience (and a more subtly developed script) he may yet become competition for Ben Affleck as the most talented next-generation actor-director in America."
"xdamaxxx","7","0","0","22 December 2013"," Don Jon (2013): A Film Review
","Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young guy who objectifies most of the things in his life, who has a bit of road rage, and spends way too much time watching porn. In other words; Jon Martello is your basic average guy in his 20's whose life is about to get a major lesson about relationships.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt continues to raise his movie star status here with some great work as the titular Jon. He's a stereotypical Guido bartender from New Jersey who is more satisfied from late night porn sessions with his laptop than he is with, as he and his buddies call it, ""a dime."" That all changes when he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), a dime if there ever was one. Johansson is off the walls brilliant, throwing on a Jersey Shore accent for good measure.<br/><br/>The relationship that Jon and Barbara have is anything but perfect. Jon, as we know, is addicted to porn. Barbara take on relationships has been shaped by romantic movies like Titanic or any movie based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. Barbara sees Jon not so much as a boyfriend, but as a project. As the film progresses, Barbara tries more and more to shape Jon into the man that he should, at least according to all the movies she watches. He knows she isn't going to be very pleased when she discovers his secret, so he does what any grown man would do in a situation like this: Wrestle the dragon during the day when she's not around.<br/><br/>The real scene stealer in this movie, though, is Jon's family, who check off all the boxes in the wacky family stereotype department. His dad (played hilariously by Tony Danza) is always watching the football game from the dinner table and has no idea what a TiVo is. His mom (Glenne Headly) is always asking him when he's going to be getting married, despite the fact he doesn't want to settle down just yet. And his sister (Brie Larson) is always staring at her phone and only says one thing the whole movie.<br/><br/>'At times, the movie can get a little choppy. There were times when I had no clue what kind of movie Gordon-Levitt was trying to make. Julianne Moore's character, Esther, a student in a night class Jon takes because Barbara told him to, seems a little too convenient. It's as if Gordon-Levitt felt like there needed to be a character that would teach Jon the true meaning of relationships. It seemed felt like she took the lead in the third act instead of Jon. There was also an issue I had with Jon's sister in that the one line she has just so happens to make the most sense of anything else in the entire movie if you think about it.<br/><br/>Despite not being fully aware of what I was watching at certain points in the movie, Don Jon is still an entertaining piece of film. It serves as a great debut for Gordon-Levitt behind the camera (in case you didn't know, he wrote and directed this as well), proving that he is much more than the kid from Angels in the Outfield. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen this year, and probably the most accurate portrayal of modern relationships in over a decade.<br/><br/>FILM GRADE: B"
"Red_Identity","Null","0","0","18 December 2013"," Pretty good
","I have to start off by saying that I'm not a Gordon-Levitt fan at all. He was decent in 500 Days of Summer, but in everything else I've seen him in since then I've just been so bored and unmoved by him. With that out of he way... this is easily his best performance, from what I've seen. He nails the accent, the character completely, shedding any previous notion I had that he didn't have much range. He's just fantastic in this, and I wish he was in more talks for an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is also really great, hilarious. Johansson I've also had problems with in the past, although with her it's more mixed. Here, she's fantastic, probably the best acting I've seen her do (and yes, I've seen Lost in Translation... I will never get the love for her and the film). I give props to Levitt for coming up with a pretty bold subject to base his film across, and although it gets formulaic in terms of narrative and structure, it still works very well."

He thought that he could really play a New Yorker and Italian plus Joseph, comedy is really hard. You are not a comedy actor. Why would you choose to write and direct and then you wanted to be a lead actor in it too. There was no real plot in the film and actors were just superficial and there was nothing natural about them. There was vulgar sex like every 10 minutes as if that was the way to keep audience engaged. Scarlett Johansson was struggling to produce New Yorker accent and I don't really care about her acting anyways. I don't know who wanted to put money into this film. Ryan Kavanaugh kept putting money into bad films that's why he is bankrupt."

"jaywensley2004","4","2","5","15 March 2014"," Nobody is likable
","Just finished watching ""Don Jon"" on video. Immediate response is: It's hard to like any of the characters in this movie. That may be because the subject matters. There are several major issues of humanity raised in this film that may be too big for one film. I may be wrong, but I think ""Don Jon"" was meant to compare and contrast the difference between sex and sexuality as perceived through the filters of males and females. Complicated stuff, even without including the differences created/presented by cultural and ethnic social systems (ie, Asian, African, etc.) or environmental (species survival) issues. So, to keep it manageable, I will address ""Don Jon"" only vis. sexual relationships in 21st Century Northern Hemisphere, so-called ""Western"" culture. And I will summarize with a baseball analogy: A quality at-bat, but no better than a sacrifice fly. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as writer, director and star, deserves kudos for pioneering new territory; Sexuality in the age of Internet Porn. All thinking people recognize that there has long been confusion between sex and romance; ""Don Jon"" is the only film I know of that has attempted to examine how the availability of on-line fantasy fulfillment will affect that confabulation. But it does so in what I regard as too shallow, too cursory, a manner. I also think ""Don Jon"" suffered from overly ambitious casting: I just never believed Scarlett Johansson as a manipulative, sex-as-a-tool Jersey Girl. I kept thinking she was channeling Eliza Dushku and wondering what ""Don Jon"" could have been... But back to (what I believe was) the point of ""Don Jon"": Men and Women value ""sex"" differently. At the risk of seeming simplistic, I think men are instinctively motivated to isolate sex from love while women instinctively understand that men don't recognize their inherent confusion. ""Don Jon,"" to its credit, tries to illustrate this. Unfortunately, it fails in this attempt. If I am allowed, I will quote a statement attributed to Germaine Greer: ""Men will swim across a river of snot if they believe there is friendly p***y on the opposite bank."" This aspect of male behavior, particularly in the age of internet porn, is what I think ""Don Jon"" wants to examine. <br/><br/>Oddly, throughout the movie I kept waiting for Brie Larson's character (Monica, Jon's sister) to have an effect on the plot. She did. Brie Larson continued to play the live-action version of Jiminy Cricket she established in ""The United States of Tara"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs....."" by being the character who ""revealed"" the truth the main character denied. Thank goodness she did it so effectively or ""Don Jon"" would have been a complete waste.<br/><br/>The future may regard ""Don Jon"" as prescient, insightful, visionary. It may deserve these descriptors. But that's for the future."
"ghost_dog86","8","2","5","3 October 2013"," Better than ""Shame""
","In what would make an excellent double feature with Steve McQueen's extremely depressing but unfortunately flawed (by way of Carey Mulligan) ""Shame"", ""Don Jon"", an at times equally graphic (just with no full frontal) film (written and directed by and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tells the story of a Don Juan-type Jersey boy, named Jon, who states that he only cares about a few things in life; his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls and most of all, his porn. But when he meets the girl of his dreams, played by Scarlett Johansson, who also just happens to absolutely detest pornography, Jon is forced to confront his porn addiction head on. <br/><br/>Side Note: While the subject matter of ""Don Jon"" isn't solely fixated on internet porn addiction (it brings up interesting criticisms on everything from sexual images in the media, to the unhealthy nature of the ""chick flick"", to a quite scathing look at how outdated the Catholic church (or any religious institution for that matter) seems to be when it comes to dealing with the young people of today) it mostly is about porn addiction, so viewer beware. This movie earns its R rating. <br/><br/>The fact that the trailers make it seem like this is going to be some kind of romantic comedy, is a bit of a misnomer. While ""Don Jon"" does deliver instances of ""funny"", as it moves forward and Levitt's character becomes more realized and less cartoonish, the movie fully abandons the comedic for the serious and quite dark (still, not as dark as ""Shame"", but more than likely darker than a majority of audiences will have expected). ""Don Jon"" is pretty much a movie of two halves. The first, I will refer to as the Scarlett Johansson half, and the second, the Julianne Moore half. The Johansson portion is quite funny and entertaining, as we watch Jon attempt to juggle a girlfriend alongside his ""personal activities"" (basically, everything you see in the trailers). The issue with this half is that it never feels authentic enough to be taken all that seriously. Now, once Moore's character enters the picture, ""Don Jon"" becomes not just a particularly poignant film, but nearly flawless. During this aforementioned ""darker"" (or more dramatic) section, we follow Jon as he discovers the effects of pornography on his intimacy and overall interactions with women. The greatest triumphs to come out of ""Don Jon"", other than a hilarious supporting performance from Tony Danza playing Jon's father, are the long stretches of back-and-forth's between characters. I must praise Levitt for constructing a script full of scary realistic and ultimately award worthy conversational dialogue. On the other hand, Levitt's direction is this films major (and only) flaw. While it's obvious that the abundance of flashy music video-esque editing ploys he uses serve a purpose, it all comes across as a bit too stylized; a kind of, style before substance. Also, many of the activities preformed by the characters are intentionally over-the-top, but are filmed in a very forced and ultimately contrived way, which gets in the way of a rather interesting story. And I won't even mention the rather abrupt ending (oops, I just did). <br/><br/>Final Thought: Overall, ""Don Jon"" is one that did surprise me by how much I liked it, in sort of the same way as last year's ""Magic Mike"" had; a movie that I was expecting only vapid-ness from, but got a film full of substance and subtext. No, ""Don Jon"" isn't as good as ""Magic Mike"", but it was better than ""Shame"" and that is saying something for a first time writer/director."

All the actors and actress were amazing! I especially loved Julianne Moore's character, her and Joe were the funniest. It is a very good start for his directorial debut, the movie was a bit repetitive at some points, but the story flooded well.

","My wife and I went to see Don Jon based on the fact that we both like him as an actor and the premise seemed interesting. I do believe this is a film where the premise failed to live up to expectations. At times I felt like I was watching the same movie about 10 times. Guy picks up girl at a club, sleeps with her, finishes himself off with porn numerous times per week, go to church, is absolved of his sins, and repeats. I suppose that was one of the main purposes of the film, so show a man who is unable to separate what he sees in pornography and what his expectations are of a real relationship. It was just poorly done, and giving this a 4/10 is based on my elation that Tony Danza found work as the title character's foul mouthed father and Scarlett Johansson looking like a knockout for the duration of the flick. I would not suggest checking this one out. Disappointment abound. Hopefully Joseph Gordon-Levitt's next project will be an improvement."

","'DON JON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his feature film directorial and writing debut with this romcom/drama film about a New Jersey womanizer who's addicted to porn and lets it get in the way of his relationships with women. Gordon-Levitt also stars in the film as the title character, who's nicknamed 'Don Jon' (after the legendary character Don Juan, from popular literature) due to his ability to 'score' with beautiful woman. Scarlett Johansson co-stars as a beauty he finally tries to settle down with. The film also co-stars Jualianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headley, Brie Larson and Rob Brown. The movie is a triumph for Gordon-Levitt on all fronts and one of the best romantic comedies this year.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt plays Jon Martello, a man in his thirties, who lives in Jersey and attends dinners and church weekly with his family. He goes to confession once a week and confesses his weekly sexual experiences every time, which is usually 15 to 25 times masturbating (although his record is ten times in one day) and a couple of times engaging in intercourse with a woman. He's addicted to porn and prefers it to the real thing. He also believes every guy watches and jacks-off to porn every day. This leads him to objectify every women he meets until he encounters Barbara (Johansson) at a bar one night. He believes she's a ten (he and his buddies are always rating women) and the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. He thinks he's in love with her so he pursues a relationship with her and is willing to put off sex (at her insistence), while he tries to win her over, but his porn issues become a problem. <br/><br/>There's so many things I liked and loved about this movie. Gordon-Levitt's performance is probably the best part of it (he totally lives and breathes his character in this movie) but his clever and thoughtful script and stylized and effective directing are almost equally as impressive. The rest of the cast is good as well but this movie is all about Gordon-Levitt and should make him a bigger star. The movie is equally funny as heartfelt and as creepy and disgusting as Gordon-Levitt's character is he's still a really likable and lovable guy. I didn't know it was possible to jack-off ten times in one day or an average of 20 times a week, weekly, for that matter (not at 32 years old). I also found it crazy that Gordon-Levitt's character actually prefers watching porn to having sex with real women. As outrageous as it all is it does seem believable in the world of the movie and as perverse as the title character is he does learn from his flaws and grow as a person (and maybe teaches the audience something in the process, even if your problems aren't nearly as extreme). A relationship that develops later in the film is truly beautiful and Johansson makes a great despicable bitch, who does seem true to life (I can think of a few people like her at least). I also really liked the commentary on catholicism and the guilt and relationships with God it brings up, that one has at church (the family stuff was also interesting and entertaining). A nearly great film and about as much as one could possible ask for from Gordon-Levitt as a debut filmmaker!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PeSUJEcyg"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","6","1 October 2013"," Triple-play by Joseph Gordon-Levitt
","Perhaps the best way to introduce the titular protagonist is by recounting his first confession the audience is privy to: he confesses to committing, since the last confession a week ago, 2 sexual inter-courses ""out of wedlock"" and 17 masturbation while watching porno. This is the first of many such repeated scenes, with the numbers varying each time, reflecting the progress of various events around him. While the name Don Jon is undoubtedly designed to remind you of an iconic licentious fictional personage, don't expect its owner to have the slightest resemblance of the near-namesake Signore Juan in ""Don Giovanni"" except for being libertine personified. Far from being a refined nobleman, the ""hero"" in the movie is a common bar tender whose most outstanding characteristic, as the movie spare to pain to highlight, is a negative EQ in driving.<br/><br/>This movie written, directed (debut of both, full-length feature) and acted by highly talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt is more than just ""X""-rated entertainment. The earlier title, as I've been brought to understand, was ""Don Jon's Addiction"". I might have used the word ""obsession"" as ""addiction"" implies physical substances but that will do. For whatever reasons, psychological possibly, Don Jon enjoys self-administered sex induced by pornos better than the real thing, although he is in no lack of either. That is until he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), an encounter which promises a fairy-tale ending despite that fact that she has her own, shall we say fetishism, for romance movies. In a light way which however is not devoid of seriousness, this movie examines the interaction of these two people, and one more.<br/><br/>It has generally been agreed that Gordon-Levitt is the most versatile actor in this young generation, with ultimate hall-of-fame caliber, many would even say. In his writing and directing debut, he has turned in this solid piece of work where he wisely avoids flashy, avant-garde stuff and uses the reliable style of VO-driven narration. Repeated scenes (aforementioned confessions, driving, as well as things like family dinner) are uses effectives to reinforce the themes, while the story and subject matter are allowed pretty well to speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Johansson in this movie demonstrates that she can be as versatile an actor as Gordon-Levitt, given the opportunities. As Barbara, she shows a Johansson that the audience has never seen before with a depth hidden by shallowness, or a shallowness hidden by depth, depending on the angle you take. Julianne Moore has a role that is initially somewhat baffling. As the story unfolds, however, her significance emerges contrasting the reality of Esther, a woman with real grieves and Barbara who looks for something in her illusions. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly provide good support, playing Jon's parents in a way brings back happy memories of the Bunkers. Brei Larson as Jon's sister accomplishes an exceptional scene-stealing feat with no dialogues, constantly hooked on to her i-phone and seemingly oblivious to people around her.until close to the end of the movie when, with two lines, she hit the nail in the head (and Jon too) pointing out what kind of a person Barbara really is, showing that she has all the while been observing while everybody is talking."

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels with his directorial debut and shows that he is equally as strong behind the cameras as he is in front of the cameras. Don Jon is a movie about a New jersey bartender called Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Leviit) who portrays a universal image for men as porn lovers. Also starring alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore who give performances just as strong as the main actor. <br/><br/>This movie stuck out to me in one major way, the power to portray how both men and women's perceptions of relationships are deceived by porn and romance movies. Men who watch porn expect women to be like the female porn stars they engage so much time into. In this respect, men automatically decide that all females in this world act like porn stars, which is not the case. When their hopes and dreams of a 'perfect' woman turn out to be false they are automatically let down and don't think that woman is for them. The same can be said for women, who expect a relationship with a man to be that from typical romance movies, romantic, perfect and unbreakable. When these standards are not met by the man and woman in a relationship, it breaks down due to the deception from these romance movies and pornography. <br/><br/>Overall Don Jon gives a realistic perspective on modern day relationships, with strong acting, directing and narrative on top. Don't be drawn away from this movie because it is cast under romance as it's nothing like the genre it claims to be. Any moviegoer should see this movie, especially with your other partner as it may say a lot about your relationship and provide ways in which you can improve upon it."

"bryank-04844","7","1","2","22 August 2015"," This is a good first film for Levitt, and he can only improve from here.
","In addition to starring, Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his debut as a writer/director with 'Don Jon'. At its core, the movie shows a simple man's transition from an unlikable sex-obsessed douche-bag into a somewhat friendlier human being capable of having meaningful relationships. The film is quite fun, but also often repetitive.<br/><br/>Jon (Levitt) is a young man in his early 30s who bar-tends at a trendy night club in New Jersey. When he isn't working, he and his greased-back hair work out at the gym, meticulously clean his apartment, watch football with his two friends, and try to have sex with a different girl (who must always rank above an 8 on his hotness scale of 1-10) every day. As he narrates throughout the course of the film, he's very successful at this.<br/><br/>Oh yes, there's one more thing. Jon is completely obsessed with watching porn, an activity he does more than once a day. He tells us that porn is and always will be better than the real thing. As he lists his many reasons for this, his speech is interspersed with actual porn footage. Jon has a bad temper too, and doesn't make friends other than his lifetime buds, who just want to see what hot girl he'll score with next.<br/><br/>Then, Barbara (Scarlett Johannson) walks into the club, and of course she's a dynamite knockout from top to bottom. But then she speaks, and an unbelievable Jersey accent comes out and ruins everything – except to Jon, of course.<br/><br/>Jon puts his best moves on Barbara, but she doesn't budge, at least for a while. She wants to be wined and dined over the course of a month or so first, and Jon is hell- bent on this conquest. However, he's never experienced love, and thinks that Barbara is the one, even though she manipulates him into doing things for her in return for sex. Everything comes to a head when she finds out about his porn obsession, which hasn't slowed down a bit since their exclusive dating. Barbara is so horrified by this that she screams, runs and never comes back.<br/><br/>Jon attends school to become something more than a bartender. There, he meets Esther (Julianne Moore), an older widow who's a free spirit and takes a liking to him. She even figures out a way to get through to him about his selfish ways. She gives him a vintage '70s porn to watch, so that he can see the error of his ways and maybe change his thoughts on women and himself.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes in the movie take place at Jon's parent's house, during the weekly family dinners. His dad (Tony Danza) is not above cursing at everyone at the dinner table, and must have the football game on at all times, even when people are talking. Danza shines in this role and garners quite a few laughs.<br/><br/>This is a good first film for Levitt, and he can only improve from here. He's brilliant as Jon shows his struggle between his two personalities. As a director, Levitt's camera-work won't win any awards. He tells the story straight, yet repeats himself often. On the other hand, the payoff is good enough in the end to make you glad that you watched the film."

He has recently proved himself worthy of serious roles. This movie is like the antithesis to your stereo-typically mushy female targeted rom com. It's original, it's got great performances and it addresses sex and dating from a male perspective in the 21st century. Beneath the humour there is a genuine message about sex in society in our time. Easily and readily available and dehuminising - the porn industry has changed perspectives about sex - but is it affecting people to the point where it can warp their reality - and indeed impact their real human relationships? Does it help lead to sex addiction? The movie certainly raises a few points to ponder on. This movie is also funny, confident and unapologetic. I thought Tony Danza was great - and the family home scenes were probably one of my favourite parts to watch and certainly among the most genuine of moments. Scarlett Johansson was mesmerising. I did feel that it dipped towards the end and lost something - but on the whole worthy of watching and enjoyable."
"blakiepeterson","7","1","2","20 July 2015"," An Agreeably Offbeat Directorial Debut
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has worked as one of Hollywood's most talented young actors for years now, so it's a relief that his writing-directing debut, ""Don Jon"", is not a vanity project but a tender, funny romantic comedy stimulatingly unconventional. Not playing himself like Woody Allen always did in his best movies, Gordon-Levitt swaps his public easygoing appeal with the greasiness of a New Joisey guido with an addiction to porn. Such a male lead would normally be reprehensible, but Gordon-Levitt, as it turns out, is a writer who pens with a great deal of heart, turning his titular Don John into an anti-Prince Charming sympathetic instead of crude.<br/><br/>In ""Don Jon"", he is Jon Martello, a 20-ish player who only cares about, as he puts it, his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls, and his porn. He sounds like the perfect candidate for a ""Jersey Shore"" reboot, but Jon is much more than some hulking no-brain ready to annoy the hell out of Snooki Polizzi — as a porn addict, he, despite having one-night-stands like it's his job, is unable to make an emotional, let alone physical, connection with a woman. He figures porn is better: he can lose himself in the distanced vulgarity.<br/><br/>When out with friends one night, he spots Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), a shapely blonde who instantaneously has him wrapped around her finger. She doesn't want to be another one of his single night flings — she wants to court, to put off sex in favor of dates, to meet each other's families, to get to know one another. Not because she's been burned before, but because she, like Jon, has an addiction: romantic comedies. She wants to be a real life Sandra Bullock, finding love in the most unexpected of places. Normally, Jon would be put off by such silliness — but Barbara is much too irresistible to let down. Problem is, his addiction is still riding strong, hindering any kind of growth in the relationship; and when he meets Esther (Julianne Moore), a damaged middle-aged woman who seems to understand him better than anyone else, things begin to get out of hand. <br/><br/>For being such a short movie (a mere 85 minutes), ""Don Jon"" feels vast, having a lot to say and packing in quite a bit of obligatory rom-com charm. But unlike most rom-coms that rely too heavily on that rom-com charm, Gordon-Levitt digs deeper, analyzing the nature of addiction and how it can affect nearly every aspect of one's life, whether it be through a romantic relationship or a familial one. He's subtle about it, never becoming a preachy artist standing on a soapbox warning about the dangers of porn. ""Don Jon"" is so far beyond the other additions to the genre because it makes a good case to try to understand a character; even the secondary players seem rounded, not cutout (a risk considering the over-the-top NEW JOISEY flightiness of the majority of 'em).<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt gives an expectedly monumental performance, returning back to earth whenever he threatens to tread into Joey Tribbiani 2.0 territory, but the real stars of the film are the women, particularly Johansson and Moore. Johansson rarely gets the opportunity to let her comedic chops shine, but in ""Don Jon"" she goes all out, humorously embodying the blonde, gum-chewing, manicured, monotone Jersey girl with just enough credibility to win us over. Moore, as Jon's second love interest, is unrefined and sexy, playing a woman old enough to raise eyebrows but pushing doubts out of our judgmental windows through reasonable affinity.<br/><br/>""Don Jon"" is a satisfying project for a major talent — Gordon-Levitt has proved himself in his acting for years, and here we finally get to witness him directing and writing like it's no big deal: it seems natural, proper. Now that we've seen what he can do with the rom-com, it's only inevitable to want to see what he does next. This is a small movie, a diamond in the rough: one can only wonder what will happen if he does something bigger."

","Boy finds the girl of his parents' dreams. Then a woman finds him.<br/><br/>Interesting rom-com that doesn't lead the laughs home. The best moment was when he interrupted his singing to a gay song as his car came to a halt next to some girls. There's lots of structure and repetition, and you can see how it might work on paper, so I guess the miss is down to the direction.<br/><br/>Wonderful actors, but Moore and Headly should have had more developed characters. The sister was interesting - always withdrawn to her phone screen, then delivers a word of reality. I liked that, but didn't she have problems similar to her brother? The highlight was Johansson in an icy/steamy role.<br/><br/>Pace was fine, music whimsical.<br/><br/>Always a bad sign when you start discussing the actors. Still, it was good - but not that good."

","Very nice film from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, not only does he do acting, he also does some pretty good writing and directing with this film, it is a very good debut as a director I must say.<br/><br/>Our main character holds eight things very dear, those are his body, pad, ride, family, church, boys, girls, and porn, especially the two last have some conflicts and that is what this story is centered around.<br/><br/>It is very explicit and graphical, that works to its advantage and reveals a lot of our character Don Jon, but it also lacks a few pointers here and there, it is all moving fast and you don't really get every aspect of either Jon ""Don Jon"" Martello Jr. or the people he surrounds himself with."
"bradencn","7","1","2","20 March 2015"," Blunt and Honest, One of it's Kind
","""Every man everywhere watches porn everyday."" That's certainly what men believe that truly struggle with porn. For them, it's hard NOT to believe. I would certainly believe that basically all men struggle with this in someway, for sure.<br/><br/>When I say that this movie was blunt, it certainly is. It shows basically exactly what goes through men's heads when they look at porn and to be honest, they hit it exactly on the mark. That is something that should be praised about this film: it is honest to the core. I was really amazed at that. They really put you in the head of Jon and if there is someone out there that doesn't understand exactly what men go through, well, this film will tell you, that's for sure. I'm serious.<br/><br/>The message in this film goes out to both men and women, basically helping women realize that pornography is an addiction that men REALLY struggle to control. For men, the film makes it very clear that pornography ruins relationships, it takes away intimacy and loyalty in your thoughts to your spouse (I'm sure most that struggle realize this already). It is a distraction from things that are most important. Women will learn in this film that shutting men off simply because they have had or currently struggle with a porn addiction is actually very selfish, just like men who do not at all attempt to overcome their porn addiction is very selfish. Both aspects are extremely one-sided and, based on how you look at it, are equally harmful to a relationship. Women that show no sympathy and don't attempt to help are in the wrong, and men that believe that porn is an OK side-addiction are in the wrong as well.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to women that want to understand why men struggle more than I would to men. It still gets those hormones rolling for men and, honestly, if you are trying to already clear your mind of pornographic thoughts, this movie won't help too much. For women, however, you will get an EXTREMELY clear picture of pornography, and basically see it at its extreme. You will see why men turn to it when they go through a break-up, why it still occurs despite having consistent sex with a wonderful partner, how it consumes a man's inner thoughts, and why they go to such far lengths to hide it. You have to have a mature mind, though, and not let yourself get too curious and carried away. Women have been addicted to porn before, too.<br/><br/>I'm glad they made this film, but I would never watch it again. Being a guy and obviously struggling with this addiction myself from time to time, it won't help ME to overcome it. The girls are obviously sexy and the quick flashes to porn videos are erotic and purposefully trying to turn men on. I would hope that men that watch this film do not watch it for the purpose of getting off, as well. The film doesn't deserve that kind of reaction.<br/><br/>Now, for me personally, I would love to watch a film that showed an actually loving father and husband who is struggling with this addiction and how the family works through it (rather than just a single guy that has the addiction really bad). I believe that much of our society specifically struggles with this exact issue and it really can hurt not only one's spouse, but children as well. Perhaps this film might inspire a modern film like that. Regardless, this film deserves tons of credit. It is extremely eye opening, especially to people that don't really understand why this can be such and addiction and a go- to."
"Saman91IT","Null","1","2","14 November 2014"," Very well-rendered, realistic and useful movie!
","There is not much knowledge of porn or sex addiction. This movie is a great effort, and very tasteful, to portray this condition which to some more or less extent affects a lot of people in our western countries.<br/><br/>The path to true fulfillment is not consuming more or having more sex, ""loosing ourselves in porn"" and other quick-fixes. The only escape from a cyclical and boring life (depressing, if looked consciously at!) is to have compassion, be truthful to yourself and put effort to change your habits into healthier one! Compassion and real relations (not only but temporary fun) are the key!<br/><br/>Don Jon is incredibly realistic, showing both the symptoms and the cures. Very nice! Nice job Gordon-Lewit! Great!"
"TxMike","Null","1","2","13 February 2014"," 'Don't call me anymore!'
","This is a hard movie to get into because the first few scenes are filled with foul language and young men talking dirty with each other and about sex, as their only focus seems to be getting the next one-night stand. They objectivise the young ladies at the night spot, usually arguing if she is a 'dime' (a '10') or not.<br/><br/>Writer/director/star is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jon. Set in New Jersey, his friends have named him 'Don Jon' because of his almost 100% success getting the woman of his choice into a cab then into his bed. He is totally stuck on himself and satisfying his own needs for bodybuilding and sex. But casual sex doesn't do it for him, he can only get totally consumed by watching porn. Even right after his most recent one-night stand.<br/><br/>But then he meets Scarlett Johansson as Barbara, in her tight red dress, but she spurns his advances. She leaves without giving him anything, no phone, no name, no sex. He is crushed. He considers her the most beautiful woman he has ever met. At the advice of a friend he finds a name, finds a Facebook profile, sends her a message, they meet for lunch. <br/><br/>But as his almost silent sister observes one day over an after-Mass family Sunday lunch, Barbara just wanted to control Jon, wanted him as her own project. He is a bartender so she gets him to take a class. She wants him to strive for more. And she tells him, ""Never lie to me."" As the movie trailer plainly shows, she catches watching porn one night, he swears it was just a thing that a friend sent, he would never do it again. But that was a lie, he was addicted, it was part of his superficial view of life and pleasure.<br/><br/>At his class he meets Julianne Moore as Esther, a woman with her own issues, and after a very 'cold' start they eventually form a type of unlikely friendship. She may be the key to helping Jon understand that the only way to fully immerse yourself into life is to immerse yourself into someone else, to really care for them and about them instead of just what you can get.<br/><br/>This of course is a basic message of happiness, but one that some people never learn. <br/><br/>It was good to see Tony Danza, so good in the old TV series ""Taxi"", in the perfect role as Jon's dad, Jon Sr. And Glenne Headly, who was so good in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", as his mother Angela. Brie Larson was his sister Monica, always there for Sunday Mass and lunch, but rarely speaking, usually texting. It was also good to see Rob Brown, so good in ""Finding Forrester"", as one of Jon's friends Bobby.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In one last meeting with Barbara, where Jon tries to make amends, but does't, as she leaves she tells him ""Don't call me anymore."" But Jon and Esther have a quickie after class, he finds out she had recently lost her husband and son in a car wreck, and as the movie ends it appears that Jon may be finding some meaning in life through his relationship with her."
"Turfseer","6","1","2","10 February 2014"," Entertaining but repetitive tale of NJ Guido transformed into a mensch through the love of a good woman
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed and starred as 'Don Jon', about a New Jersey 'Guido' who is addicted to pornography. When we first meet 'Don Jon', he's hanging out with his pals at a bar, and has no trouble picking up women. There's a good deal of banter between the guys as they rate the women they see in the bar, on a scale of 1 to 10. Jon makes it clear that porn is still superior to having sex with real, live women.<br/><br/>Eventually, Jon hooks up with Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), who has a decided 'New Joisy' accent. She attempts to make a man of him by urging him to go to night school to get a more professional job and he indulges her tastes in romantic movies. Barbara keeps him on a leash for a while before they have sex but soon discovers his mean addiction to porn. Jon promises Barbara that he doesn't watch porn and brings her over to meet his over the top parents, who fall in love with her (the parents, are written as over-bearing Italian stereotypes). Finally, Barbara becomes aware that indeed Jon has been lying to her, after discovering that his browser history indicates that he frequents porn sites all the time. Barbara then promptly dumps Jon around the midpoint of the film.<br/><br/>Up until this point, the problem with Gordon-Levitt's screen writing is that there's too much repetition. We're constantly bombarded with near X-rated images illustrating Jon's addiction. There's also all those repetitious scenes where Jon is constantly at his local church's confession box, reporting his sexual escapades and porn excesses, to the local priest.<br/><br/>Finally, the story takes a more refreshing turn when Jon forms a relationship with Esther (Julianne Moore), a middle-aged widow, who lost her husband and son in a car crash a couple of years before. Esther turns Jon into a 'mensch' by impressing upon him that sex should be much more intimate, leading to a union of souls. Jon takes the bait and now 'Don Jon' has morphed into an updated 'Marty' (the 1955 drama starring Ernest Borgnine, who plays a working class stiff who grows to maturity through the love of a good woman).<br/><br/>Would the 'Guidos' of this world, end up opening themselves up to expanding their self-consciousness? In most real-life scenarios, unlikely. But here, after being bombarded with scenes of the boorish Jon 'doing his thing', it's a refreshing twist to have this clueless Guido, suddenly transformed into a sensitive guy, who relates to women as human beings. Many critics found 'Don Jon' to be one-dimensional in many places, which it is—but it also entertains to a good degree and features a neat shift in the protagonist's internal arc."

","Jon goes out clubbing and takes home gorgeous women to have sex with him. It does the job very well, but not like his beloved porn. Jon finds a breathtaking woman (Scarlett Johansson) , but she turns him down. He tracks her down and they start dating. Jon is able to let go of porn for a while, but he isn't able to abstain from it, even after promising her. Your enjoyment of this movie may depend on how much mileage you get out of Gordon-Levitt's character. I wouldn't exactly say I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, but I appreciated the originality. On the other hand, I had trouble relating to a guy that gets off on middling stuff like porn more than Sex. I don't see how anyone can do that, but I admired the gumption of Gorndon-Levitt to pull it off. Whether I agreed with it or not, Levitt has my respect for being original with his creative vision. On another note, there is some stuff that rings true about Porn. I chuckled at the little things, such as ""Waiting for the perfect video out of many videos"" , ""Ruining the moment when you see the guy's face"" It really is a polarizing movie. Levitt is fantastic. He bulked up majorly for the role and I thought he gave the performance of his career. Not only that, his direction was solid as well. Johansson plays her role well as well. Juliane Moore's role plays a pivotal part in this film and she was a pro like usual. I give Levitt props for giving me an unpredictable ending. It did NOT go down the way I expected it would. I thought I had it all figured out, but he got me<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I liked this film quite a bit. It's not something that is worth repeated viewings or anything, but I dug it. <br/><br/>7.8/10"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","2","24 January 2014"," Entertaining enough but without a hint of subtlety or edge.
","Porn stars, be flattered. You've inspired Joseph Gordon-Levitt to write, direct and star in his first feature film to talk about how much he likes you. I used to like Levitt a few years ago when he appeared in (500) Days Of Summer and Inception, but as he's slowly turned himself into a brand that his film career hasn't justified yet, it's come with a bulking ego. I was excited for Don Jon at first, but the film and Levitt have become much less endearing. I still like what he does sometimes, Looper was one of the best films of the year. But Don Jon is a satire that tries far too hard. The caricature performances and clichéd side-characters may be deliberate, but without a straight man in sight it ends up feeling juvenile and only occasionally funny. With their forced struts, exaggerated accents, matching tank-tops and chains, they talk as if Levitt desperately wants to be in a Scorsese movie, which the flashy camera-work and editing certainly try to match. Unfortunately, the way the, albeit valid, social commentary is on the surface and in the dialogue completely negates its effect.<br/><br/>Sure, he has a good point on the relationship between men and porn, women and rom-coms, but it's kind of stating the obvious. Despite attempts to repair one side, it doesn't elaborate on this argument or come to a thesis, it just merely brings it up. The main problem is that it's difficult to believe its main plot. With a character like Don Jon, it needs a real crisis for us to believe that he needs a real relationship. Instead the film shifts in the direction it needs to go in a contrived way. I quite like where it ends up where Don finds salvation, it certainly wasn't predictable, but there's times when the perspective of women matches this overly macho representation on men and it teeters uncomfortable lines of misogyny. However, despite overdone lighting and photography, its saving grace is its keen-edged editing which really cuts through the problem with the script where it overuses repetition without showing enough growth each time. It's mildly entertaining, somewhat interesting, but sadly without a hint of subtlety or edge. Perhaps I'm still a little bitter that Levitt gave Brie Larson literally nothing to do. <br/><br/>6/10"
"Ahmed_Abdellatif","8","1","2","25 December 2013"," The two sides of female objectification
","The movie tackles a hard predicament, one that has been around for centuries, which is how society objectifies women. the fresh thing done by the movie is that it tackles the subject from both sides - The male and the female. In the movie the main lead is a porn addict, and he is addicted to porn because he can't be satisfied enough with a normal relationship with a woman as he finds them substandard to what porn has to offer and on the other side one of the female leads is an archetype of the expectancy what a of a gender specific society asks of a woman. These paradoxes are summarised by certain key scenes,The opening scene is one of them, the scene at the store is another and the house party where all the little girls dress like princesses in the same identical attire, among other subtle hints to that gender role theme.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is good, and for a first directing experience by a main lead it passes fine. Acting is well done, and Joseph Gordon Levitt does a good job, Scarlett Johansson a great one. And Julianne Moore is as always a charm. The storyline is not great and it could have been written better to match the whole theme of the movie,and at points the movie felts stale, but it always picked up fast"

Movie is very funny, you will certainly have a good laugh while watching it, but also, there is another side... Movie is talking about a man who thinks that porn is the real deal, and that everything in those movies is natural and true. Because of that he can't experience pleasure of real life sex 'cause it's not like in porn movies. He develops an addiction for masturbation, or maybe even obsession 'cause he spends a lot of time surfing on the internet in searching for the right clip, and even after a real sex he needs to watch pornography and masturbate.

Don Jon has a very uneventful, over simplistic plot that leaves the viewer with very little message to grasp onto, other than the fact that watching porn is awesome. JGL has great proved his potential to be a great director through this debut. However, when it comes to writing movies, JGL may still need more experience if he wants to create something of substantial value.

","""Don"" Jon(Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a typical ""jersey shore"" type guido. His life revolves around the gym (and presumably tanning and laundry), road raging on his way to church and picking up women at the club. Oh, and pornography. In fact Jon is so addicted to internet pornography, he prefers the ladies online to the real thing. <br/><br/>I have a number of issues with this movie. I don't understand why they made the choice for Jon to be a ""guido"". Maybe they wanted to cash in Jersey Shore. Levitt doesn't have what it takes to pull off Jersey tough guy but he tries, I guess. Scarlet Johansson's ""acting"" is poor as usual but her character is just incredibly poorly written and completely unbelievable. Jon and his family are basically a bunch of Italian American stereotypes. Tony Danza is obnoxious as usual and Brie Larson (as Jon's sister) is more or less wasted. The guido stuff is just distracting and unnecessary. The gym and church scenes are incredibly repetitive and add nothing. I mean, at this point I'm just glad there wasn't a mafia subplot.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is Julianne Moore who does a good job as Esther, the older woman Jon meets while in college. But not even she can save this movie.

And some females as well. This is a observation movie coming from the thoughts of the protagonist, well the observation and mindset of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I thought the first segment got the point across, but it decides to rinse and repeat. Which would have been fine if, it added more to the substance of it all. I guess it's to show the repetition of life for some. But it just doesn't work as a whole, since after it gets it's message across it didn't seem to add anything to it. Well at least not enough. It is a confident movie, but I don't know about it being edgy or all that original. This movie started out with an idea, but just didn't have enough to have that momentum going.

","""Don Jon"" is one fun sexy and wild romantic comedy that keeps you entertained and gives you feel good laughs. It's something that many men can relate to and that's being a ladies man when they bed change on a relationship to relationship meeting phase. Joseph Gordon Levitt who also wrote and directed stars as Jon a young New Jersey man who loves family, sports, a gym workout and church confessions. Yet none of those hobbies can match his love for online porn viewing and going to bed with beautiful women. At bars and clubs he meets hot sexy ladies then Jon goes to bed with these sexy colored bra wearing ladies, only he meets his match when he takes up with tough and straight talking Jersey girl Barbara(the sexy Scarlett Johansson). And Jon struggles with the porn issue even though he has hot intimacy with Barbara along the way veteran actor Tony Danza is tough with love and concern as Jon's loving dad. Oddly like all romantic comedies this film twist as in an unexpected way Jon finds love and some happiness in the form of an older woman he meets in a night class named Esther(Julianne Moore) will it last? Anyway this is one sexy feel good watch of a film that highlights what many men have a passion for casual sex and a porn love while struggling for love that's ever lasting."

","Watching the trailer it looks like a movie that has a nice plot to spend a couple of hours with friends to get a few laughs; instead, seeing it in its entirety, you will understand more and more that it is actually a movie full of clichés that leaves no space for laugh, nor to an interpretation on a personal level. similar to ""the ugly truth"" that already in itself could not be called a masterpiece, Don Jon is definitely a movie that you don't see pleasantly unless you like the final granted and the insipid plot.

","I may miss something here. More than 100 reviews, 7,3 average, described as stellar and hilarious. Is it Italian dubbing's fault? Or American's idea of hilarious? Not really sure but what I found is simply ""genuine"" (like in the poster) foolishness.<br/><br/>The first section on Jon's porn philosophy is great and the camera work, the editing, the music just represent it in all its magnificent pride. Then comes Scarlett and the massive editing stops remembering us all what real life is (and how beautiful can be...). Then you forget that it's a film and it becomes a live bad drama-bad comedy-bad docu (some actors were pretty good nonetheless): here you're not interested anymore in the editing and you just wait for something, the climax, the point, a smile... then comes the end.<br/><br/>I don't really know if there's a point here. It seems that here we have a docu on porn addiction and sexual issues, a comedy on an ignorant nice guy in love with the most gorgeous girl of the town or a drama on sexual relationships and the balance of power between modern men and women. And I don't like either of them:<br/><br/>The docu is superficial. Some good moments with Julienne Moore only. I appreciate the view on Jon's porn philosophy he shared with us in his simplistic style: I find many interesting points of discussion in there and would have appreciated a film ""talking"" about that.<br/><br/>The comedy is not hilarious at all. It's a matter of tastes but this is truly bittersweet too much with the church and the family and the friends. Too much to make me something more than smile.<br/><br/>The drama is the least engaging and you would even like to see something else instead of Scarlett. Why should be interesting that a guy falls in love for his virtual sex dream without even knowing her, then porn separates them, then you get that some women may behave like b*****s with men without brains and with the sexual life of an orango in heat. So deep and engagin.<br/><br/>I think many reviews really overate it by finding something likable in any of the three tracks (Scarlett in the drama of course).<br/><br/>Intouchables was hilarious. This was just... meh."

","Sometimes I feel sorry for not liking a movie. It usually happens when I see tones of good intentions and talent put into a film, and yet the result is a disaster, or very far below the expectations. This is the case with this film written, directed and acted by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. If one looks at the cinematographic record of this 32-years young man he will see 63 movies on his acting record, 6 entries as a director and only 2 as a writer. These numbers actually tell the story of why 'Don Jon' is such a failure (IMHO of course).<br/><br/>Don Jon has in my eyes the most unbelievable and PC-twisted story that I have seen lately. Jon (J.G.-L. himself acting) is a blue collar (way of saying, we never know what his work is) young guy from New Jersey. His life is as empty in content as any life of a hero from New Jersey seems to be in movies - he works, goes to the gym, drives as crazy to church on Sundays, then confesses the sins of the previous week to the priest, and begins sinning again. At night he hangs out in discos with his friends, chases girl, beds a number of them - not in the low numbers, and they are all good looking. Did I say he is good looking too? There is only one problem - he is also a porn addict. After having sex with women, he sneaks out of the bed to watch porn! Even when he meets 'the most beautiful thing in the world' (Barbara - Scarlett Johansson) and falls in love with her he cannot give up his habit. Which of course, endangers the relationship. Well, losers and twisted minds exist, and they make movies about them, some are good. The problem is that in this story the script decided that vice needs a cure, and the cure comes under the face of a much older woman (Julianne Moore) who teaches him a great secret - well, I will not tell more, just that this seems so conventional that it is really ridiculous.<br/><br/>Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt is actually a perfect fit for the role, and Scarlett Johansson succeeds to bring to life the emptiness behind the physical beauty of a 'suburb princess'. Julianne Moore is a fine actress, but unfortunately she fails to convince and lacks the magnetism necessary to make the 'cure' credible. It was also great to see again Tony Danza of 'Who's the Boss' fame as Jon's father (or Jon's variant 25 years later). Director Joseph Gordon-Levitt has some interesting ideas, although I am not crazy about the trend of using video clips techniques in a repetitive manner in feature movies like this one. Unfortunately neither the actors (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt), nor the director Joseph Gordon-Levitt could compensate the flaws of the script written by writer Joseph Gordon-Levitt. From my point of view his only success with 'Don Jon' is to have made the first film with Scarlett Johansson that I did not like."

"JohnnyWeissmuller","5","1","3","25 October 2015"," Don Jon
","Don Jon, which was written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is an acerbic romantic comedy that asks what would happen if two people with completely unrealistic expectations of the opposite sex happened to be in a relationship. Jon, played by Levitt, is someone who lives his life without asking questions, only indulges in what he knows and likes, especially an addiction to internet porn. Oppositely, Scarlett Johansson's Barbara is a girl whose idea of a real man and true love is what she sees in the most saccharine of Hollywood movies. Traits handed down from their parents, it seems, Jon's father played here by a gauche Tony Danza. Jon's walk down the proverbial corridor of life sees him as someone more interested in playing with himself than playing with others, and even when he's joined on that walk by Barbara, his compulsions and her single-mindedness come to drive a wedge between them. The narrative here is fairly simple, however, especially during the first half of the film, in which the usual conventions of romantic comedy are adhered to in spite of the central character's compulsory masturbatory habits. And this makes for a slightly hollow veneer, in my opinion, especially with some horribly outdated and quite banal exchanges in which girls are rated out of ten. Which, had the dialogue and design not seemed so false, it probably wouldn't have been one of many issues I have with this film. Jon's wonderment that he can view porn on his mobile phone also left me bemused at the writing of a film that's nowhere near as sharp as it would like to be. Basically, it doesn't ring true. However, the introduction of a third character, played superbly by Julianne Moore, changes the dynamics of the film. Her ever-excellent screen-presence finds her well cast as a genuinely three- dimensional character with an emotional core. Here is where the best of the film takes hold, and that's also noticeable in how Levitt directs Moore and the scenes in which she appears. Still, I was disappointed with Don Jon, which is tame next to something like Shame, and is more generic than its fledgling director may have desired. But it isn't without interest or merit, given Julianne Moore's performance. But it needed to be smarter, shorter and that bit more daring."

","Starts very well, very impressive for first-time feature writer/director Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Then in the middle it loses a lot of its potential (especially when Scarlett Johansson's character is revealed to be a total bitch, which makes absolutely no sense in Joseph's character wanting to keep her and acting like her dog, apologizing endlessly - even after they already split; It's like he totally lost his balls; I couldn't stand watching her character! Also, he ends up with a woman 20 years older than him, ahm... isn't that a LITTLE weird?). I wanted to like the film, but found myself doing some stuff while watching it.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't understand whether Johansson's character was supposed to be Italian with this accent (first I thought she was supposed to be Jewish, but then you see her with a cross in one scene). It's funny that both lead actors, who are Jewish, are playing these very-Christian roles.<br/><br/>I liked Tony Danza. Haven't seen him acting in years and he was hilarious in most of the scenes (the best one was when he meets his son's girlfriend for the first time - actually made me LOL). The whole interaction between him and his son (and their accent) is great."

","Don Jon (2013): Dir: Joseph Gordon-Levitt / Cast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza, Brie Larson: Observant comedy about porn addiction and relationships. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars and directs this superb first time effort. He lifts weights; joins friends at the clubs where he picks up a female every night; he joins family at dinner with frustrated conversations in front of the sports channel; he attends confession where he admits his porn addiction. Scarlett Johansson plays his latest fixation but his dream girl is obsessed with romantic comedies, attempts to alter his comfortable lifestyle, and she flips out when she discovers his porn on his laptop. Julianne Moore steals scenes as an older woman attending a night class that Johansson pressured Gordon-Levitt to take. She sees through his relationship issues and provides insight much to his dismay. Tony Danza delivers perhaps his greatest performance as Gordon-Levitt's sports loving father. Brie Larson as Gordon-Levitt's sister plays off a female version of Silent Bob where her sound dialogue only arrives at the right moment. Gordon-Levitt deserves credit for his directional debut but also for his insight. While ending is satisfactory it is also debatable. What really works is its exploration of both sides. While Gordon-Levitt must come to terms with his lifestyle, Johansson fails to admit her delusions and expectations confusing romantic comedies to reality. Many males may relate to this amusing vision into the mouse tag that opens windows into the Internet that entraps many innocent minds. Score: 9 / 10"

"g-bodyl","8","1","3","15 December 2014"," Rather Impressive Directorial Debut!
","Don Jon, the directorial debut of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a rather impressive look on the issue of porn and how it can destroy (or even create) relationships. The movie does have a few flaws whether it was the unlikable main character or how the movie feels repetitive at times, but on the whole it was a good film with good themes. The movie is not just about porn, but it is about sensitivity, addiction, and finding love.<br/><br/>Levitt's film is about a man named Jon Martello who has a rather unhealthy appetite for porn. He lives life to a very strict routine whether that is going to church, being with his family, or just watching porn. But when he meets the most beautiful girl in the world named Barbara, his private world and public world are bound to collide.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty impressive. Levitt holds his own as Jon, but did I ever find his character repugnant and plain unlikeable, perhaps even narcissistic at times. But maybe that was the point. Scarlett Johannsson is just a film goddess and her beauty still shines like an angel in the film, but her acting skills are just as impressive. Julianne Moore does a good job as Jon's college friend. Finally, I have to give props to Brie Larson. She is mute for most of the film, but when she finally says something, that is the best moment of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Don Jon was an interesting movie to watch. I'm surprised it did not receive an NC-17 rating especially how the movie is very sexually explicit. While it may be about a porn addiction on the outside, the deeper theme is about finding love. The movie is meant to be a comedy, but I viewed it more as a drama. I did chuckle a few times though. I liked how they spoof New Jersey accents and our driving skills. As a resident of NJ, I found this to be accurate. But all things said, the film is a nice directorial debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I rate this film 8/10."
"Floated2","5","1","3","15 December 2014"," Not Bad but has Certain Struggles
","Though it's set in New Jersey rather than Brooklyn, Don Jon -- written and directed by Gordon-Levitt, tells a tale of an Italian-American student who harbors a spark of life that draws him toward the wider world. It's even more condescending to the small-minded characters around him, if that's possible. Don Jon is also fast and funny.<br/><br/>Jon's deliverance comes in the form of a messed-up pothead named Esther who sees through his insulation and tells him what he needs to hear.<br/><br/>The down-shift from cartoon romance to romantic drama would be jarring if Esther were played by a lesser actress than Julianne Moore, who makes the wisdom she's given to deliver sound like good hard sense from an older woman who's been through hell.<br/><br/>She's touching, Johansson is wonderfully awful and Gordon-Levitt is electric, making it easy to forgive the movie its streaking. The film wanders towards Johansson's character exits, as we see more screen time with Julianna Moore. Don Jon seeks a specific audience, but the overall tone of the film could have been far better than its content shows. Disappointment from critical reviews deceive."

Everyone else is just going through the motions of delivering bad dialogue like they know it's bad. Even the writer doesn't seem to believe his own words.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is sufficiently irritating as the shallow, self- centered girlfriend, but her performance feels like a performance.

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his directorial debut. He's probably the best actor of his generation, and he proves to be more than a competent director, but, I have to admit, I could never get over my initial hatred of his character here. A meathead guido is just never going to do anything other than repulse me. The truth is, this is a film about a jerk who grows into a better person by the end of the movie, but I just could never get over the initial jerkiness. JGL plays a stud who can bed any woman he wants, but he actually finds watching internet porn more stimulating. After an excruciatingly long courting period with his new girlfriend Scarlett Johansson, JGL instantly ruins it when she catches him watching porn. Johansson is good in her role, but she's every bit as despicable as JGL's character. Later in the film, JGL becomes involved with an older student in one of his classes, Julianne Moore, who helps him get over his addiction. Tony Danza is pretty good as JGL's father. Good enough where you can see that one other good role could redeem him as an actor. Brie Larson, who really broke out with Short Term 12 this year, has a Silent Bob-like role as JGL's sister. I swear I didn't even notice she was in the film until she spoke about 3/4 through."
"blature","5","1","3","19 January 2014"," Great Acting/ Promising Story of Unrealistic Expectations Misfires
","The film written by, directed by and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a really fine job for his writing and directorial debut, but he may have missed a great opportunity to tackle the subject of pornography and how many members of society can be on either end of the spectrum as either worshiping it or demonizing it. The acting by Gordon-Levitt and his supporting cast was great, although the over the top New England accents were a little too much for me. Johansson's character was absolutely obnoxious, in the ""chewing her gum while talking in New England accent"" kind of way. I'm sure that was the overall goal for her character, being obnoxiously uptight, but I believe it could have been achieved without the ""talking with gum and overdone accent"" bit. Gordon-Levitt's script surely leaves something to be desired. His character has no trouble with luring women to bed. It wasn't done in a very comedic way, but more of a repetitive loop of brief jump-cuts of dancing in a club, leading to taking the girl home, then a short clip of them in bed.<br/><br/>As they lay in bed, his inner dialogue explains that he feels he has never had the ability to interact with women on a human level. He repeatedly expresses his disdain for romance and his preference of pornography over intercourse. Johansson is the exact opposite, and has expectations that love meet the criteria that she develops in her mind based off Hollywood's over exaggerated romance stories. This story of two opposite minded people had promise, especially with such great actors. But it's brought to an incredibly unsatisfying halt, as they part ways, not once but twice, simply because his character realizes that his expectations of love and sex were too one-sided, while her character does not admit the same to her own flawed expectations. I think a much better resolution to the story could have been found if he could have shown her the light, and helped her come to the realization that her expectations from the romances she sees on screen were as selfish as his expectations of sex from pornography. <br/><br/>Instead we are left with him finding a more mature woman who teaches him that pornography is not worth demonizing, but equally not worth watching obsessively. This ending bothered me because as obnoxiously self- centered as Johansson's character was, she gave no indication that she was a lost cause. She was merely overly stubborn. She was still human enough to be worth trying a little bit harder to show that he had changed his ways and no longer addicted to pornography. All he needed was to reach compromise with her and eventually have her change her unrealistic expectations of a one-sided love where the man gives everything to the woman and ignores her imperfections pretending she is flawless. Instead he settles for the more mature woman, and just gives up trying to help his ex-girlfriend mature away from her spoiled rotten unrealistic expectations as if she is a lost cause."

But, is she enough to rid him of his ""problem at hand?"" Or will the older, wiser and higher co-student of his get him to remember life after (on)line?<br/><br/>The movie attempts to shock and splash multiples of porn images on the screen. For anyone over, say 14, none of this is new. Maybe not so much in a movie, but it's not shocking to most. But, it is funny and genuine at times. And I absolutely adored and loved Julianne Moore in this.<br/><br/>Ever since Hannibal, she's continued to un-impress me, sadly. This is not a great thing to say about her, because I know she's so much more. But, up until this, she's been in a downward spiral. Mercifully, while not perfect, she's definitely rebounded here and is absolutely worth watching this movie for.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a recommend, but only for those with open minds.

Jon, thinking that a long-term relationship might be the key to good sex, asks around about the woman, Barbara Sugarman, before finding her on Facebook and asking her out on a date. As their relationship progresses, Barbara asks Jon to expand his future by attending a college course and forbids him from watching porn. At the college course, he meets a woman named Esther (Julianna Moore).<br/><br/>The relationship between Jon and Barbara is supposed to be a representation of a modern day relationship, but it takes more of a comedic standpoint on modern relationships than a realistic one, which would be fine if the movie was supposed to be a satire, but it wasn't. The aspect of Barbara not allowing Jon to watch porn and getting him to take a college course is something you can see happen in relationships, but then there's a part to show how poorly compatible they are that she forbids Jon from buying cleaning supplies for his apartment. <br/><br/>The relationship between Jon and Esther is also predictable once she starts bonding with Jon. You can see that Jon and Barbara are not working out and that Esther is more understanding that Barbara. All the movie leads up to is that even though Esther is older than Jon, they were more compatible because they understood each other better, which you can figure out well before the movie is over.<br/><br/>Jon is depicted as being a hardcore religious guy who goes to church and confession every week. After Barbara forbids him from watching porn, he lies to the priest (Paul Ben-Victor) in confession that he stopped watching porn. It is never given any explanation for why he did that. It's not as if the priest can tell Barbara that he is lying to her and wouldn't Jon consider lying in confession something he should never do?<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Jon goes to visit his family and has dinner with them. His sister (Brie Larson) is constantly on her phone whenever she is seen, until the end when she explains why Jon and Barbara broke up. She was a completely pointless character who existed just to explain something to another character.<br/><br/>As I said before, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a good actor and ""Don Jon"" does show that he has the skills to be a good director. However, the movie also shows that Levitt's writing, not only of the story but also dialogue, is not good. There is supposed to be a realistic depiction of modern relationships, but the relationship is portrayed as something right out of a comedy, which I said would work if this were satire, but it isn't."

Dissatisfied, he embarks on a journey to find a more gratifying sex life, but ends up learning larger lessons of life and love through relationships with two very different women: Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) and redhead veteran Esther (Julianne Moore). When I choose to watched DON JON instead of 50 SHADES OF GREY I made a horrible mistake.At the end I regretted it so much that I want my hour and money back because this movie is really really terrible and boring.

","I want to start off by saying this film was a failure, from my standpoint, and as such I would have rated it below average. But then I realized how the trailer for the movie was specifically crafted to make you think this is another genre entirely, so I had to punish the grade further. It really gets on my nerves when someone cheats me by letting me think I am getting something else and then giving me anything else.<br/><br/>The plot, to make it clear, is that of a lower class guy who is addicted to porn. He meets a girl that he seems to be in love with, one that is the opposite of him, apparently: classy, beautiful, wants him to go to school, get a better job, watch romantic movies, etc. They split up over the porn business and he meets Julianne Moore, who is clearly not scared of nudity, porn or any sexual behaviour, and that cures him of his inability to relate to women.<br/><br/>That is the whole plot. It is a philosophical story, one that could have been better made, one that is worth telling, just not by tricking people to come see your movie thinking it's a romantic flick, as the trailer implied. It is NOT a romantic movie. Instead it is one that shows the first girl, Scarlet's character, is just as alienated as the main character, only in a completely different direction, that of the fake romance and perfect life plan. A film that shows that people are never perfect and illusions are fine unless they stop you from living your life (and even then, I would argue, but I am talking about the film).<br/><br/>Bottom line: I am sure there could be a better version of this story. As such, it almost feels like an anecdote that one says to a party or one of those awful education advisories children are forced to watch in school. The actors played well, but they just didn't have a good script to work with. One ""gets it"" and the ending is even slightly philosophical, but the presentation is all off."

","I've been a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt's since the first movie that I saw him in, so naturally I would see his directing debut, despite the subject matter. <br/><br/>JGL has written an inventive story that shines light on the expectations that people have when it comes to relationships. Nowadays, everything seems so one-sided. Typically, these expectations come from movies, or books, but the movie mostly focuses on Jon, a porn addicted ladies man. <br/><br/>Being his porn addicted self, a lot of pornographic images were shown. Yes I understand why, but it's honestly just not my thing. <br/><br/>Besides that point, I really thought the movie was quite excellent. JGL's directing is quite wonderful. A lot of the events were told in the same kind of scenes, as if they were on a conveyor belt, bound to come around again, always with something changed. <br/><br/>All in all, JGL really outdid himself.

","Honestly, this is the worst movie I've seen in ages. It follows a fairly standard romance pattern of: a boy meets girl, boy has argument with girl and loses her, boy realizes he was wrong for her and hooks up with some other chick.<br/><br/>All of the characters are one-dimensional stereo-types, with the exception of the star, because this movie is all about him. Look at me, my character is having major life revelations! I'm going to realize that sleeping around with heaps of chicks and watching heaps of porn is not very fulfilling. The fact he's going to hook up with that other chick is basically apparent the moment she first comes on screen.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of people can argue that this movie is all intellectual and has ""refreshing honesty"" and ""interesting perspectives"" on porn, but a) those opinions have been out there for years if people just did some reading and b) if you strip that away all you're left with is a really weak romance movie. <br/><br/>Oh, and it's not a comedy.

"AbhiMathews","3","1","8","23 December 2013"," The Struggle of Modern Times
","This movie certainly revolved around an interesting topic. Pornography is prevalent throughout society in all forms of media, and it's no surprise that it's one of the most common addictions today. Learning about this movie, I was interested from the beginning since it was a film that tackled a relatively sensitive issue head-on. For this, I congratulate the crew who produced Don Jon, but there were definitely flaws it should have addressed first. <br/><br/>The plot was...dull. Man sleeps, cleans his house, goes clubbing, has sex. Then masturbates. Going to Church to repent for sins yet committing the offence is something I agree many in the world do today. I just wish it showed some form of sincere repentance or even just a push to change since it diminishes the whole act. The movie starts to become incredulous here and only becomes more illogical later. Afterwards, the relationships seem a bit too bizarre. The romantic ones do not seem to be anything but physical. It appears the world is full of sex-driven individuals whose only desire is coitus. This version of life just seems so extreme and incongruent with normal society. Even the ties between siblings and parents are distant and it's hard to take this movie seriously when everyone's so detached from each other. <br/><br/>With enough will power, stopping anything is possible. To kick an addiction literally overnight, if it is as deeply rooted as depicted in this movie, doesn't seem realistic, though. The overall plot, even little things like dinners with his family, chilling with his friends and just total disregard for his future give me the impression that Jon is a pretty static character who's unwilling to change. <br/><br/>The acting itself had to be some of the worst I had personally seen as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favourites, but he disappointed me greatly after Don Jon. The sheer lack of emotions throughout the movie just prevented myself from relating with any aspect of it. I honestly found it a struggle to keep watching since it all just came across as artificial. <br/><br/>I can honestly say that my initial excitement quickly disappeared as I realized this movie was just about a man living a hedonistic lifestyle in a self-indulging society. That's it..."
"MCMAYNERBERRY","5","1","9","30 October 2013"," A film that muddles it's hard hitting commentary on today's culture with stereotypical rom com fluff
","I really wished this would've turned out better. I do. The message it strives to convey is an interesting one on the way people view media, but it unfortunately gets bogged down by corny scenes and underdevelopment.<br/><br/>Levitt, in his directorial debut, plays Joe ""Don Jon"", a stereotyped version of a New Jersey boy who, after bedding various one night stands, becomes enchanted by Barbara, played, sigh, by a very weak Scarlett Johansson. What is it about her? Her range is just not there. It always seems half assed and never fully committed to any film she does. And though it's cute that she plays a stereotyped version of a Jersey girl, there's no real emotion there to make me connect with the character, and therefore the film suffers. Joe and Barbara begin a relationship, with Joe modelling his love life after the porn he watches and Barbara after the romantic movies she enjoys. Complications arise when their views collide and cause irreparable harm to their relationship.<br/><br/>It spurns Joe to be taught how a relationship truly works by Esther, played by Julianne Moore. The character has a backstory, but there's no real development aside from that. She's just kind of there.<br/><br/>But what really makes Don Jon not work is how, while depicting the exaggerated views people hold, they exaggerate the way people from New Jersey act. A lot of residents from the area were offended when they were depicted as, for males, sex addicted, body building tough guys and for females loud, gum smacking, hoop earring wearing divas. It's inaccurate and unfair towards how life really is in New Jersey.<br/><br/>I once again assure I liked the message it tried to convey, but it's flaws stand out and become too distracting.<br/><br/>Don Jon 5/10"
"kblaseyx3","5","1","10","22 October 2013"," The dangers of pornography
","I recently saw Don Jon and had mixed feelings on the movie. While I am somewhat impressed that in our society someone decided to create a film that subtly showed how porn can ruin a man's ability to bond with a woman because it creates unrealistic expectations of women, I think it left out many important aspects of the dangers of porn, including how porn leads to violence against women. The porn is the movie was portrayed as fulfilling to Jon because he got to see people have sex in crazy positions that he didn't get to enjoy in real life. But porn is not just watching people have sex. It typically shows violent sex and portrays a man always in control. It often shows women saying ''no,'' a man forcing himself on her, and the girl then thanking him because she enjoyed herself, which is clearly sending a dangerous message and shows that porn could be a factor is the increasing number of rapes in our society. Other porn shows multiple men violating one girl at the same time. These ideas of violence and domination are influences the men in our society. Porn promotes violence by portraying it as sexy, and while some men think they are immune to the media, they all will be subconsciously influenced and for some, this learned violence can be carried over into their real life sexual interactions. This should have been addressed in the movie, in my opinion. I also think the movie made light of the effects of porn. In the end, it seemed that Jon's porn addiction was cured when he found the right woman for him. But she was not as sexually promiscuous as the women in the porn he was watching, so I do not see how his addiction could have realistically been cured. He still has an image of women that his girlfriend will never live up to. Porn hates men and women. It aims to distort man's image of women so he is incapable of forming a relationship with any woman, which includes the redheaded woman in the end of the movie."

","I think I've used this summary for another of my reviews - but I couldn't think of anything better for this repugnant offering.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll be giving anything away by saying that this is about a man who watches porn and his girlfriend doesn't like it... and that's it. Nothing else of interest happens, it isn't funny, it doesn't tackle any pressing conditions of modern man, the script is badly written and it isn't worthy of your time - despite some of the rather bewildering reviews to be found on here.<br/><br/>Everything about most of the characters is repulsive - from their accents to their behaviours and their inter-actions with each other.<br/><br/>It does raise three questions in my mind however.<br/><br/>1. How does this adolescent drivel get made ? Whoever was able to persuade studio executives that this would be an entertaining contribution to the movie world ? <br/><br/>2. What possesses previously well established and respected actors to take part ie Johansson and, especially Moore in a film that continues the depiction of women as objects to be conquered by a greasy sleaze-bag in a dodgy nightclub ?<br/><br/>3. Who would waste 1 hour 30 minutes (precisely) of their time watching this without wondering why they bothered ?<br/><br/>Wrap it up in as much pretentious mush as you like (and critics have) but this is, indeed, risible drivel.<br/><br/>For any of you who can't (or don't want to) keep up with the limited activity going on inside the main protagonists' head, his weekly confessions give you a regular handy update....yes really."

","I have mixed feelings about a movie. The film actually reflects our real life: the guy who addicted to porn because it is easy, accessible and acceptable, the girl, who is shallow, egoistic and think only about herself only. Jon's sister represents most of the people who cannot abandon their phones for five minutes. Jon's parent's demonstrates life of couple after thirty years of marriage: TV and arguments. Also, the movie touches religion, some people think that if they go to church, donate money and confess, all their sins will disappear. I think, it is not a comedy, it is a tragedy movie. It just shows how people are degrading. It made me really upset. At the end they show that there is hope. But it is like a thin thread that can pull main character from his problems."
"RayKarago","7","0","1","10 April 2015"," Pleasant Surprises are always nice
","This is one of those films where you have a really stupid story line, but end up with a surprisingly well written, touching and enjoyable film! Firstly, I loved the script and the story. On a personal level, I've never been great at relationships and used to be self conscious about it, and to see the journey our protagonist goes on to the morale where you realize that true love is not just all about sex, and its not about being overly romantic either but, love in relationships is about a genuine understanding between two people, and I feel that is a moral we can all agree with and relate to. Also, the film was also surprisingly funny in certain areas, funny because some of the situations are fairly reliable and also because the actors in the film (none of whom you'd particularly associate with comedy) just have brilliant comedic timing. The star of the film was without doubt, Scarlet Johansson; not only is she hot beyond belief but she is just so manipulative, and a down right bitch that I actually, don't like her anymore, it's just such a contrast to the way she normally plays her characters. The way the film is edited is also clever as you do not see to much graphic elements from the porn but you still know what he is watching.<br/><br/>However, there were a few elements that I did not see the point to. For example, Brie Larsson's character did not need to be in the film, at all. She makes numerous appearances in the film but only has one speaking point at the end and by this point, the point she is making is well established. In fact, it would have been more effective if the main character, Jon, had made the statement as it involves his story, but having a character in the film for the sake of making one point is not effective. Also, there were aspects that were not very clear, for example when he picks playing basketball with strangers over going to the gym, scenes like that that could have been cut as it was not clear what they were meant to represent. Its aspects like that that cause the film that stop me from really loving this film but DON JON still a solid film and I would recommend it as it gives a very effective view on modern day relationships. If this is Levitt's first directorial film, I hope it is the first of many."

And in a real modern-age story which is especially rare in American movies.

What I liked about this movie is how natural the guy is, after all. And how it deals with over expectations in our lives (not just the sex related ones, but generally).

","Don Jon (Joseph Gordon Levitt)is a confident, slightly arrogant Jack The Lad who is seemingly proud of his sexual prowess. Even his friends are impressed by his success with the ladies hence the reason that he got his nickname 'Don Jon'. Despite his success with the ladies, Jon finds that sleeping with women doesn't give him the satisfaction that he craves and finds that he has to watch porn several times a day in order to get 'lost in himself'. However, when he meets the gorgeous Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) whilst on a night out with his mates, he soon becomes infatuated with her and following a second 'date' with her he begins a relationship with her. Even though he's in a relationship with Barbara, Jon still can't stop watching porn and once Barbara discovers this addiction she dumps him. From this point on, Jon starts to wonder if there is more to life than porn.....<br/><br/>For me, this was a fairly tiresome affair for the most part. Don Jon goes out partying, sleeps around with lots of women watches porn countless times a day and then goes to see a priest to confess all of the above. This was OK the first time as it did help to understand just how troubled and shallow Jon was, but the problem is that these things seemed to just be on a loop for the majority of the first half of the film. Ironically, I think Gordon-Levitt was probably more guilty of revelling in the slutty side of things than the character he portrayed - I would say that nearly 50% of the first half was spent watching tits and ass and couples having sex. There's nothing wrong with all of that if you're watching a porn film and it's OK in a main stream film in moderation, but it did feel like Gordon-Levitt was getting a little carried away and seemed to forget about both character development and in moving the story along.<br/><br/>There were other issues with the film such as Jon's two mates who were just annoying for the majority of the film. Gordon-Levitt and Johansson didn't have particularly good on screen chemistry which meant I was indifferent when they broke up. Jon's family were also annoying (particularly his mother who was just unbearable at times) and it just made me cringe when I saw Jon and his dad both wearing matching white vests at every meal time. Really? I also thought it was interesting that the girl in this family (who I think was his sister) didn't speak for the first hour, but probably uttered one of the most important lines in the entire film.<br/><br/>There are some positives to draw from this film, but sadly they come in the last 30 minutes; Julianne Moore's character (who I admit was irritating at first) managed to be a very important character. She seems to be the only person who understands Jon and she seems to be the only person that Jon wants to learn more about. She also is successful at making him see making love as being 'reciprocal' which is a key scene in the film. Julianne Moore did save this film somewhat (both in terms of her acting and her character). Gordon-Levitt does an OK job, but I think he didn't give his own character enough depth. I kind of liked him towards the end, but for the majority of the film I just felt indifferent to him and that's really where the film fails.<br/><br/>Don Jon is a fairly poor film and the majority of the problems are in the first 60 minutes where the film is repetitive, shallow, and it seems to plod along without really going anywhere. It does improve in the last 30 minutes, but it didn't do enough for me making it a below average film."

It's a racy subject for what is, narratively-speaking, ultimately a traditional rom-com, yet Gordon-Levitt, here directing for the first time, manages to pull off the trick of being both sweet and provocative, regardless of it's many flaws.<br/><br/>Jon has a few simple passions in life - his car, his girls, his pad, his family, and his church. Yet none of those can eclipse the wonder of losing himself on the easily accessible world of pixelated pleasure. He goes out with his douchebag friends to clubs and rates women out of ten - ten's being 'a dime'. He regularly bags 8's and 9's and takes them back to his place for what he sees as dull, awkward sex, and can't resist a midnight liaison with his laptop as his weekend prize sleeps in his bed. When he finally meets a dime that steals his heart, Barbara (Scarlett Johansson on impressive form), he vows to change his ways and goes back to school, focusing all his attention on her. Yet regardless of how happy he is, Jon just can't resist having cyber-sex with his computer.<br/><br/>Don Jon asks a lot of its audience in that Jon is your atypical boring, conservative narcissist, one of those bronzed 'cheeky' chappies who manage to smile their way out of being an a******e. He redeems himself somewhat by genuinely trying to change for the better, as Barbara's high-maintenance girlfriend demands total dedication. He also redeems himself in the eyes of the Lord (or so he thinks), by frequently going to confession and vocalising his Hail Mary's while pumping iron. I can certainly appreciate Gordon-Levitt's attempt to subvert the clichÃ©s of the genre (Jon and Barbara go to see a ridiculously sentimental rom-com starring Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway), but it does makes the plight and arc of its protagonist somewhat less sympathetic.<br/><br/>Suspension of belief is also required, as Jon meets a lonely older lady (Julianne Moore) who teaches him the way of true love and real emotion. It's a sentiment worthy of the countless soppy money-machines it's gently mocking, and leads to an ending so abrupt, it feels like Gordon- Levitt was scratching his head when thinking about how to give closure to the story. Yet Don Jon is often very entertaining, featuring a supremely confident performance by it's lead, and one of Johansson's best roles to date. Gordon-Levitt could be an interesting director in the future, as although Don Jon features many rookie hiccups and some chaffing dialogue, it at least shows he's in no way deterred at the thought of a difficult topic."
"rtp4242","9","0","1","11 May 2014"," Don Jon. Dawn of a new kind of comedy.
","Jon (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a 20 something, single bartender, he likes to work out, he likes to go clubbing with his pals, Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke) He drives a 1972 Chevy Chavelle, and works out regularly. Jon lives with his parents Jon Sr. (Tony Danza) Angela (Glenne Headly) and his sister, Monica.(Brie Larson) Jon goes to church regularly, he sleeps around nightly, and is obsessed with pornography. He doesn't think he's going to settle down , but then he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) and she is a 10 on his scale, and is everything he wants in a woman.<br/><br/>Barbara wants to meet his parents, she wants Jon to go to school to be better than a bartender, and he wants Jon to be exclusive to her. He dutifully does all this, but can't give up his porn addiction. Barbara catches him one day, he gets out of it by saying one of his friends sent it to him one day, and swears to give it up, but doesn't. <br/><br/>At his night class, Jon meets a quirky older woman, named Esther (Julianne Moore) and they strike up an unlikely friendship. What does his porn addition do to his relationship with Barbara? Does he confide his obsession to his new friend Esther?<br/><br/>I love this movie. To most, it would seem like Joseph Gordon Levitt plays a stereotype. He plays a Guido, if you don't know what that is Google it. He's a musclehead, he drives a fast car, he has a hot girlfriend. Jon should be happy, but he isn't. He doesn't realize it, but he's being used by Barbara, who just wants someone to manipulate. He has a rationale for his addiction, so he doesn't see it as a problem, but it increasingly takes over his life.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is the complexity of the Jon character. His life is a walking dichotomy; he is part altar boy and part playboy. Jon sleeps around, but he goes to church, he moves on to have a steady girlfriend, which to him means respectability, but he watches porn every day, which even he realizes is getting out of hand. This movie contains a lot of truths, about sex, love relationships and the destructiveness of pornography, namely the objectification of women. Mainly, what this movie has going for it is, it's damn funny. Jon says the Lord's Prayer while working out, his sister always has her face stuck in front of the phone, texting, and Jon's Catholic Church confessions are laugh out loud funny. There is a scene where Jon and Barbara are also having an argument about Swiffer pads that is classic comedic dialogue. There's also a fake movie with Ann Hathaway and Channing Tatum which is also hilarious. There is also a subtle commentary about the prevalence of scantily clad women in everyday mainstream culture, from fashion magazines to TV commercials. The relationship with Esther is a little far-fetched, but it works in the larger scheme of things.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt plays this character perfectly, the muscles the hair gel, the car, the women, the porn, all leads you to believe that he's a jerk, but he's really not. He lives with his parents, he is a person of faith (however superficial that faith is) and he wants to settle down, he's just not sure if Barbara is the right woman to settle down with. He brings the perfect mixture of party boy player and sensitive guy looking for a deeper relationship to this role, with a perfect New Jersey accent, and perfect comedic timing. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as a woman who knows what she wants, and knows how to get it. She lays on the accent a little thick but gets the tone of the role down perfectly, she coos to Jon sweetly but she seeks to be a puppet master. Julianne Moore has gotten into a rut of playing these flighty older women , but in this movie, it works. Great supporting performances by Tony Danza, Glenn Headly, Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke. <br/><br/>Congratulations to Levitt for writing and directing such a complex movie, including so many disparate topics, and making it funny to boot. He's got a bright career ahead of him. The length was a perfect 90 minutes. It's not for kids, because of the preponderance of sex and pornography as a theme, but if you are an adult and don't have an issue with those things, watch this movie.<br/><br/>For more addicting movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

","This dynamic new dramedy is a sensational writing and directing debut by the irrepressible Mr JGL. What a presence and what a star he is from this film. I actually felt it an update or a remake of Saturday NIGHT FEVER but smaller scale and crossing much of the same male ego and sexually provocative territory. But updated with new century chrome slickness and filth. It is a good film. Great casting, especially with Tony Danza and young Scarlett, always game for a smutty drama, and here being the emotionally manipulative GF to JGL's ego bastard. Then along comes some mature mind-sex leading into the proper emotion of the story. Clocking in at a slim but sturdy 85 minutes and with far too much product placement including the porn site which actually exists like an 85 minute ad for them, DON JON is fast and furious phallusy entertainment. Unreleased in cinemas in Australia because of the porn advertising site so vigorously displayed, DON JON was no crowd puller at the box office but is a firm favorite on the couch at home. Just like our hero."

","I just watched Don Jon, written and directed by the Don himself Joseph Gordon-Levitt. <br/><br/>He has done an astonishing work here I must say; me myself being a man born in the midst 80's. <br/><br/>The movie centers around Don, a young man whose interests in life are the same as for many young men out there - himself, his friends, his car, one night stands and of course - Porn. <br/><br/>The reason I feel I had to write this review is not because I thought it was a Superb movie, it does though have in it a great value of truth to offer - as written in the headline - about relations between men and women, and egoism.<br/><br/>I'm gonna try to keep it short here, this is a film you should just watch, if you haven't already seen it stop reading Now and just watch it. But please continue anyway because I've got a point in this review!<br/><br/>I have read some bad reviews about this movie, some good. Fine this movie involves some breasts and moans, it involves a bunch of player- like guys etc..<br/><br/>But have in mind that Mr Gordon Levitt a clever man, also is his film..<br/><br/>The egoism within each of us is our biggest and single most dangerous enemy. <br/><br/>To buy your friends a beer, of to buy them a nice purse, that is not altruism (wich is the opposite of egoism).<br/><br/>This film can teach you a tiny bit of what ego-loss is about, once you take the step and let some of your ego go away, a whole new world will open. <br/><br/>Watch: Don Jon; and then, if you have any questions, just write me an e-mail.

"sumit-nsu-1","6","0","1","12 February 2014"," Good film about Porn addiction but overall is so-so
","I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.<br/><br/>Personally, I disliked the character of Johansson. She is a stuck-up, selfish, domineering woman... the kind I could not talk with without hitting her physically."

The character showed emotional growth and I for one appreciated how the lesson was sugarcoated but it was still there it was organic not just shoved down your throat and he didn't end up with the typical hot babe he ended up with the broken and wounded older lady but in her brokenness she opened him up and allowed him to find himself and get a better understanding of why he did what he did and that ladies and gentlemen is how you write a real movie with real characters who show growth in the movie and not just pay it lip service."

","OK so its a great and gritty idea which is true, porn is everywhere and the girls on there are what you wish you had, so its hard in the real world now, I sleep with my girlfriend, then go tug one off over Babestation before I go to bed, its routine. I am Don Jon but I am with that 10 or Dime as he calls it, 6 years going strong, she found out but we got through it, unfortunately Don Jon is a bit of a sad ending for me, the lovely Barbara Scarlett Johansson leaves him and he has to make do with Julianne Moore twice his age instead, a boring washed up ginger of a character who likes patronizes him constantly in her lines.<br/><br/>I love Joseph Gordon Levitt and I was so excited for this film for months but I have to say its kind of wrong, it seems to say that you can get a 10 out of 10 but in the end if you like porn you have to go with someone ugly who will do all the dirty positions from the porn. Hot girls are boring in bed, that's the moral of the story.<br/><br/>it even illustrates it going through how normal couple sex is boring, (its funny as its true), and how porn is so diverse its exciting (ATM, Anal, Reverse Cow Girl, Facial) but no normal person would do it, Juliane Moore is into all the dirty stuff, but she is not the girl you would want.<br/><br/>and (oh my god!) his accent was annoying to listen to! Its a film I might watch again if it was on, but would never own it just would not warrant a purchase.<br/><br/>so yeah I felt depressed at the end, you want Scarlett in your bed but you end up getting Juliane? its such a bad image."
"sahamh","6","0","3","9 January 2014"," Great Start but Poor Ending
","The story is about Don Jon who is a lady-killer and a porn addict, and now he tries to settle down and to be in a relationship with a beautiful and sexy girl, Barbara Sugarman. In the first act, the audience understands why he loves porn because he explains the differences between porn and real sex, which I personally can say it's mostly true, and honestly it's one of the best part of the movie. The movie also brings out some truth about the modern relationships, and I have to admit that JGL has done a great job showing them; such as, the stupid arguments or how someone can be so selfish in a relationship. JGL also brings out some really great side points to the story that perhaps not a lot of people would care or mind these days; great examples of them would be a Hardee's/Carl's Jr commercial that shows how women are being used as products for everything these days, and her sister is being constantly on her cell phone – I personally dated someone like that and she was using her phone on the first date, which I was close to either walk away or throw her phone away! Regarding the performances, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza, and Glenne Headly all deliver solid performances - Headly performance stood up the most to me. The problem for me is the third act and how the story ends, the main reason is the relationship of Julian Moore and JGL, it is forced or even unrealistic – at least that's how I felt it. Both of them have charming characters individually but how they're bonded is unsatisfying to me. I explain it below in details; because it might contain some spoilers to some people.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT) So as I mentioned, Don Jon explains why porn is better than real sex very clearly and specifically in details. Therefore, I don't see him quitting porn after being in relationship with Esther, and to me it's unclear if she cares about it or not. I also don't see Esther sleeping with Don Jon after a few short conversations that overall lasted less than 10 minutes - which is why I felt it was forced. In my opinion, it would be much better if Esther was a therapist and caught JGL watching porn in a library or a café shop, and then tries to convince and help him through therapy sessions. That way they could get more serious about porn addiction and its struggles. The conclusion of Don Jon shows that you just need to fall in love and your porn addiction will stop without any problems.<br/><br/>Overall, I think JGL has done a good job on directing this ""dramedy"", I just wish the ending wasn't disappointing. I give it 7/10."

","This directorial- and writing debut for J. Gordon-Levitt feels very much like a debut. In this simple plot we follow a guy who works at a bar, and the most important things in his life are his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls and his PORN - this is hard to miss, since it is shoved in the face of the audience.<br/><br/>He falls in love with a girl, played by Scarlet Johansson, who controls him completely and tries to make him the person she wants him to be. I did not like her character at all, she has this irritating accent and does not seem like a real person at all. On of the things she makes the lead character do is to take a class so he will not end up as a bartender for the rest of his life. There he meets an older lady, which seems crazy but turns out she is super nice and sensitive and he kind of falls for her after breaking up with the relationship-terrorist from earlier.<br/><br/>It is like this movie is trying to take on a serious matter with a comedic touch, but it offers rare laughs and seems to be trying too hard.<br/><br/>I saw an interview with Gordon-Levitt recently on Jay Leno where he stated that his inspiration for making this movie was he thinks mass media tends to affect how people live their lives. For me this it too obvious in this simplistic plot. Then again, the perfect girl turns out to be imperfect and the crazy lady turns out to be sensitive and giving - this might be something to take from this movie, I don't know and sad to say, I don't really care either.<br/><br/>I cannot especially recommend this one - 6/10"

I did enjoy watching it, therefore i vote 6 out of 10. There are several reasons why i watched it anyway. Like i said i like the actor, and Scarlett is a pretty good actress herself, i've seen a lot of her movies too. It felt to me like there was missing something, i always had the feeling that there was more to come, more excitement and perhaps even a plot twist. I guess the storyline was what made the movie this basic. I wish i cold rate it better but it just wasn't that good. <br/><br/>Joseph will have to do a bit better and step up his game to be what he showed me before, like when he acted in his other movies. <br/><br/>Still a great fan of yours though, that's why i'm rating this with a 6."

Personally, not a Gordon Fan, and I found it difficult to think of the simpleton as a Womanizer. The fit body, the muscle car, and the walk just did not seem enough to change my opinion.<br/><br/>Scarlett, puts in a nice performance as the typical modern day demanding Girlfriend, working along the cloaks of a mystery and making you think if there's something more about her. <br/><br/>Julianne plays the highly clichéd 'weird gal' and although she fits the part, once again the lack of usage of the back stories hurts the overall character.<br/><br/>It's a flick you may wanna watch with your partner, if you wanna bring porn up. Overall, a very simple story, a very plain presentation: even though Gordon throws in many SPUN-inspired fast stills and breaks. Avoidable."
"christophe92300","7","0","1","29 December 2013"," Promising
","Don Jon is in some way the comic version of Shame. The script tackles the subject of sex/porno addiction obviously in a lighter perspective than Steve McQueen's movie, trough two New Jersey guidos, Jon and Barbara.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt described with a lot of humour what is the sexuality and the way of consuming it nowadays for some men (and women). He particularly paid attention to the form of his first feature which varies depending on the three distinct acts composing the film. The editing is sharp and based on repeating — maybe a bit too much by the way — shots to show the character's evolution, and the soundtrack perfectly fits with those three parts.<br/><br/>Despite everything, the movie isn't exempt from flaws, it takes an unfortunate corny turn as soon as Julianne Moore's character Esther is (badly) introduced, and the ending is a bit too conventional and a bit too abrupt.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, for his first movie as writer and director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a pretty good job."
"clairezhou96","6","0","3","27 December 2013"," Romantic Fantasies, that's all this movie is about.
","First of all, great acting from everyone in this movie. The characters were portrayed just as they are meant to be portrayed. Only thing is, the characters are the problem.<br/><br/>Dialogue portraying stereotypes spoken by stereotypes and an unrealistic deus-ex-machina that feels forced. The woman lost her husband and kid and she falls in love with a Jon in just a few classes? Okay, she wants to lose herself, but if she really is that devastated, she shouldn't be all 'super romantic movie'-like in the last few scenes, which also contradicts what the movie tries to tell us. Yes, she feels forced and unrealistic.<br/><br/>Second, when a director tries to make the audience think about a subject, he should let us think. Though, Levitt thought of us as teenagers and thought he had to spell everything out for us. <br/><br/>Porn, apparently, is just as much faking as a cliché romantic movie. Only thing is, in porn and these over the top romantic movies an ideal is superficialized so much it takes out the joy of the real thing. We become so ego-centric wanting to reach our goals, it makes it impossible to get these experiences between two people. Great life-lesson, Levitt, but don't make me feel like an idiot.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the 'story' of Jon is not very interesting. It's quite hard to relate to a portrayal of a stereotype. The means of them are to be superficial. It's only when the deus-ex-machina comes crashing in that I started seeing some realness, but it was too late. If more time had been spend on deepening the stereotype Jon was, it could have been a really good personal revolution. That or it should have been a lot more focused on the cultural aspect of the superficial dreams the movie felt reaching for. Too bad it couldn't decide and delivered an unfinished part of both.<br/><br/>Then the music. I really liked the used of 'super romantic' music during the kissing scenes. An original way of telling how Barbara, the hot-rod actress Scarlet, was imagining her own romantic movie scene. Though a memorable soundtrack or a soundtrack at all was not present.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt's debut is not something very unique or original, apart from the subject it's addressing and the amount of boobs shown in just under a minute. Yet, the lesson it tries to tell you does open your eyes. I will listen to what more Levitt has to say in the future, I just hope he will do it better."

","#HotGuyProbz could be a fitting alternate title to Don Jon, a film that examines a man's complaints about his favorite hobby. Younger men often acquire a reputation of being sex- craving animals. The topic of pornography is on display as blatantly as Mr. Levitt can possibly make it. There's sex, there's boobs, there's Scarlett Johansson's voluptuous figure (Johansson is the Marilyn Monroe of our generation). <br/><br/>Levitt's directorial work is focused and carefully executed, while his screenplay is a fun little vehicle. Together those aspects create a mature film about masturbating if there ever was one. The stylized ""man dream"" and use of repetition grows tiresome by the conclusion, but you'll be glad you saw the film for its honesty about sex. Mr. Levitt comforts women wanting mature men by telling them that men are capable of growing up and have the ability to love the way they want them to with a little guidance.<br/><br/>The cast ensemble is outstanding. Taking the lead role, Levitt acts with great ease and the slickness we know he's capable of. Tony Danza gets a few scenes, which he uses to his make his character wildly memorable. Julianne Moore elevates any film she signs onto, no different here. She's an ally to Mr. Levitt's film; however, at times she is not as quirky as the character is meant to feel. The bulk of Moore's scenes take place as soon as Johansson exits the picture, which may explain my ""friendly-from-a-distance"" response to Moore. <br/><br/>The film's brightest and most clear star is Scarlett Johansson. Her casting in a selection of her previous films can be thanked to her beauty and sexual aura, not because Johansson was the best choice for the role. Consequently, she often is bland, but here she couldn't be more fresh. She mixes up her usual laid-back beat and jumps on her character with a hilarious accent and embodying the shady side of Barbara's psyche. It's her best performance and may be the reason the film signals a depression once she is no longer predominate to the plot.<br/><br/>Grade: B+<br/><br/>Rating: 7"

But what happens when The Don's not online?<br/><br/>A game-changing relationship with the girl Jon considers a ""dime"" (perfect 10) is his only complication. Scarlett Johansson's curvaceous Barbara tries her best to change Jon's habits, and breaks ground where no other ladies have. First by meeting his family, which includes macho Italian Tony Danza, and then giving Jon forceful advice on how to live: from shopping to cleaning house, she has all the answers. But it turns out Barbara's merely a distraction to an underline ""issue"" that must be resolved <br/><br/>The initially platonic relationship with night school older lady Ester (Julianne Moore) attempts to change Jon's perspective for the good and that's subjective. The film's sexually charged, potentially limitless, surprisingly insightful frolic – captured in vivid, frantic motion by a promising first time director – takes backseat to an attempted bittersweet romance that winds up crashing the party.<br/><br/>Oh well, it was fun while it lasted"

","DON JON (2013) **1/2 Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headly, Brie Larson, Rob Brown, Jeremy Luke, (voice of Paul Ben-Victor). Gordon-Levitt makes his big-screen filmmaking debut as writer/director in an ambitious yet very flawed dramedy about a New Jersey guido (um, one full star subtraction Just For That Crime Against Humanity; Thanks JGL!) whose online porn addiction threatens a possible new relationship with superficial Johansson. While the ensemble cast makes up for the stereotypical caricatures they embody, Gordon-Levitt has his hands full in making a one-note Johnny redeemable but Moore's adult education co-ed adds some much needed ballast to an otherwise over-the-top vibe sustained throughout. Hopefully next time the aspiring auteur will take into accounts that not all Jersey guys are ass-hats."
