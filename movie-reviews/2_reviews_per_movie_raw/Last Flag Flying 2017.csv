","When looking at the total body of work of writer/director/producer Richard Linklater, it would appear that this is a guy that relishes on throwing the movie going public constant curveballs. From the indie darling ""Slacker,"" (which people like Kevin Smith cite as a film that helped them become a filmmaker to begin with) to the ""Before"" trilogy with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, cult hits like ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""SubUrbia"" and the Oscar darling ""Boyhood,"" his diversity in storytelling is one that makes sure that can challenge both himself and the audience. When I found out that his latest venture was adapting and directing Darryl Poniscan's novel (which Poniscan also helped with the screenplay) ""Last Flag Flying,"" I was definitely intrigued by yet another left turn for Linklater.<br/><br/>In this film set near the end of 2003, Steve Carell plays Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd, who shows up at the bar owned by Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) after not seeing each other for almost thirty years since they served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam together. With shared experiences that they are not sure they want to talk about, they seek out their third running buddy from those days in Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne), who is now a reverend in a small church. As they are all catching up with each other, Shepherd drops on them his reason for getting together: his son (a Marine himself) has been killed overseas, and he wants Mueller and Nealon to come with him to not only help bury him but along the way heal themselves and each other.<br/><br/>This film was a pleasant surprise for me. The vibe that I got from the one sheet and reading about it was one where I thought would venture into darkness and politics quickly and for the duration of the two hours that it would be on the screen. While there is not much more than a smattering of preachiness here, it is Poniscan's story of these three characters that is relied on to keep things moving, as it should be. These three actors are such powerhouses in their own rights that their work together makes this story even more powerful and even fun. There are some great comedic moments, driven mostly by Cranston's character, that keep the balance of ""Last Flag Flying"" in perfect harmony with its drama and emotion.<br/><br/>There is also a ""name to watch"" here in J. Quinton Johnson. Mainly known for being one of the victims of the horrid ""Dirty Dancing"" experiment earlier this year, don't let that fool you. This young man, as the best friend of Shepherd's son who was there with him when he passed, shows amazing emotional range and compassion that shines through even as he shares the frame with some of the biggest actors of the last three decades. His performance is truly impressive, and I look for much bigger things for him in the future.<br/><br/>Amazon Studios continues to gain steam with their cinematic choices, and along with Lionsgate, they have another winner with ""Last Flag Flying"". Releasing over Veterans' Day weekend, this is a very respectful and engaging telling of a tale of our service men and women both current and former that runs the gambit of emotion and is truly a great way to spend a couple of hours in any form."

","Richard Linklater on Last Flag Flying: 'We're not meant to kill. We're not cut out for it' I agree. This film hits the right tone, respectful to the men who have served this country, while also pointing out the futility of war. The ensemble cast is brilliant: Steve Carell does such a subtle job with a great deal of poignancy and what can you say about Bryan Cranston's burned out veteran who is constantly looking for a good time, while Laurence Fishburne is marvelous as a pastor. Such a wonderful film... another great film by Linklater."
"FallonTimberlake2016","8","76","108","24 October 2017"," A hilariously profound film with three great lead performances.
","Last Flag Flying is a comedy/drama from the acclaimed director of Boyhood and Dazed and Confused, Richard Linklater. It stars Steve Carell, Laurence Fishburne, and Bryan Cranston as three friends from the Vietnam War who get back together when Carell's son dies in action. <br/><br/>Despite the serious subject matter, this movie is absolutely hilarious. Cranston is absolute comedic gold. He hasn't been as funny as he is here since his Malcolm in the Middle days, and even then he may not have been quite as funny as he is here.<br/><br/>You would think going in that Carell would be the comedian here, but instead he is the dramatic anchor. Carell gives a surprisingly emotional performance, keeping the comedy to a minimum. <br/><br/>Fishburne is between the two, giving both comedy and drama when it's needed. Of the three it is hard to say which gives the best performance, but the edge must go to Cranston. The movie would probably be ten times more boring without him. There are scenes where Cranston single-handedly made the entire audience in my theater howl with laughter. <br/><br/>Last Flag Flying doesn't just give comedy however, it also tackles a great amount of issues that a lesser film would not have pulled off. This film explores the purpose of life, a subject that Linklater is very good at tackling. I would list some of the other issues it tackles, but if I did i would probably be here all day. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely not perfect. Near the middle it starts to drag, which is not that large of an issue, but for one or two scenes it is noticeable.<br/><br/>There is also a very manufactured conflict in the film. It feels like the writers stuck it in just so there was a conflict of some sort, but it easily could have been taken out and the movie would not have changed. <br/><br/>Another issue involves tone. There are a couple scenes where I genuinely could not tell if the film was trying to be serious or funny, but this, like all of the other flaws, is not that big of a deal. <br/><br/>Overall, I recommend Last Flag Flying because of both its hilarity and its drama. It is one of the funniest movie of the year and very profound, despite its flaws. <br/><br/>I give Last Flag Flying a B+."

","Last Flag Flying. There's no denying, Director Richard Linklater (""Boyhood,"" ""Before Midnight"") knows his way around relationship films. Here, the reserved Doc Shephard (Steve Carell) reunites with his former marine buddies ""the no holds bar"" Sal (Bryan Cranston) and now man of the cloth Rev. Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) to identify and bury Doc's deceased son. With an unspoken history between the men, the reunion and journey is continually filled with tension. When by-the- book Colonel Wilits (Yul Vazquez ""Captain Phillips"") tries to stand in the way of the guys mission, especially after truths are told, comrade in arms and best friend to the deceased Washington (J. Quinton Johnson - currently on Broadway ""Hamilton"") join the men as they prove once again, friendships built in tough times are the strongest when times are tough. Based a novel by Darrl Ponicsan, Linklater and him have adapted a touching and honest film that equally pulls at your heart strings and makes you laugh. All the key players here are at the top of the acting game and should be recognized for their contributions. What I especially liked about this film was that the history between the men and the story behind the death were all told without flashbacks. And, when the terrific Cicely Tyson appeared on screen, one could feel the audiences appreciation for her years of screen presences. To date, this is the best all around film I've seen, and you shouldn't miss it."
"mmezajr","9","23","38","10 November 2017"," I laughed and I almost cried...
","This was an enjoyable movie. I think it was deep when it needed to be and light when it needed it. I laughed and I would almost came to tears (and I don't normally do that). I followed the story line and it was eventful. I will say it felt like a long time to finally get to the burial but it was a fun adventure. Breaking Bad star was amazing and funny. Lawrence did a great job playing his part. And Steve did amazing. Great display of emotions and carried his part nicely. Good movie to watch. I was not in the military so I am not as sensitive to how the marines were portrayed in this movie but I know that they make a huge sacrifice for serving for our country and I have nothing but respect for all military branches. I felt good after leaving this movie and you will too."
"larrys3","8","11","17","2 February 2018"," One of Linklater's Best Films
","I thought this was one of director Richard Linklater's best films, as he also co-wrote the screenplay with Darryl Poniscan, from whose book the movie is based.
The three leads here Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell, and Laurence Fishburne give terrific performances, with Yul Vasquez and J. Quinton Johnson adding well to the mix in supporting roles.<br/><br/>This film can be dark, crass, and very unsettling one moment but also be poignant and laced with humor that works more often than not. Also, the movie can be brutally anti-military at times, yet strongly patriotic as well. Somehow, the filmmakers managed to blend all of this together effectively.<br/><br/>All in all, I found this to be an exceptional film that stayed with me long after it was over."
"sandrene","6","51","101","22 November 2017"," Great idea, poor execution
","This film seems to suffer from an identity crisis. It attempts to tackle many underrepresented topics pertaining to the effect war has on veterans and their families, but it stretched itself too thin and each plot line ended up being a weak caricature of what they were trying to accomplish. With the exception of Bryan Cranston's character, Sal, and at times J. Quinton Johnston's character, Washington, all of the characters weren't very well fleshed out and none of them saw any change from the beginning of the film to the end. The dark subject matter was sprinkled with random bits of humor that, instead of lightening the tone, just felt awkward and out of place, while the story jumped around in so many places, it was hard to tell what it was really about.<br/><br/>There was a flier outside my screening that gave more information about the veteran issues that were highlighted in this film, which leads me to believe that it was made with a greater purpose than just to entertain. This made me even more disappointed in the fact that the writing and cinematography were often lazy, and the overall film felt like one done by an amateur filmmaker, not by a writer/director that's been around for decades. Although there are relatable moments in this film, I'm sure even more so for people who have experienced war, as a whole it is barely a step up from an over politicized after school special."
"Hellmant","9","7","10","1 February 2018"," A great tribute to our veterans!
","'LAST FLAG FLYING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Richard Linklater's new comedy-drama about three Vietnam war veterans who reunite, 30-years after serving together, when one of their sons is killed in the Iraq war. The film is based on the book (of the same name) by Darryl Ponicsan, which is a sequel to his 1970 novel 'The Last Detail' (which was also adapted into a popular 1973 film). This movie stars Steve Carrell, Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne. Linklater also co-wrote the screenplay, with Ponicsan, and the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a really well made character study, that's also a great tribute to our veterans. <br/><br/>The story is set in December of 2003, when former Navy corpsman Larry Shepherd (Carrell) is visiting the bar of an old marine he used to serve with, named Sal Nealon (Cranston). Larry reminds Sal who he is (and Sal only knew Larry by his nickname 'Doc'). He also reminds him that he was imprisoned, in a Navy prison, for a bad-conduct discharge, which (it's implied) Sal was somewhat responsible for. After the two get reacquainted, through a heavy night of drinking, they travel to the church of another Vietnam vet they used to serve with, named Richard Mueller (Fishburne). Larry then explains that his son was recently killed, while serving in Iraq, and he asks his two friends to accompany him to burry him. The three of course bond again while on their road trip together. <br/><br/>You almost couldn't ask for three better, and more fitting, leads for this film! Carell, Cranston and Fishburne are all extremely likable, and relatable, and they also all have magical chemistry together. The movie is also brilliant in how it combines heart crushing drama, with surprisingly feel good humor. You never quite know how to feel while watching it, but it's always very believable and seemingly true to life (and I did get teary eyed multiple times). The movie doesn't feel like a typical Richard Linklater film, but he definitely still did an outstanding job directing and writing it, and I definitely still recommend it (for all)."
"danielledecolombie","7","31","60","22 November 2017"," A moving rehearsal
","I had the feeling the film was shot before anyone was ready. I love Richard Linklater, Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne, Steve Carrell is also very good but I still have to surrender to his characters. I'm far too aware of him, the actor and Last Flag Flying puts that in evidence. This wonderful actors needed to get those characters a bit more rehearsal time. Also the look is so drab that I'm not sure if that was intentional or if it's just the new digital age. In any case I was moved and I was glad I saw it."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Apprehension and trepidation are the emotions that strike whenever anyone compares a movie to the classic 1973 Hal Ashby/ Jack Nicholson film THE LAST DETAIL. That holds true even if the novel the film is based on was written by the same author (Darryl Ponicson) who wrote ""The Last Detail"" (1970), and even if the new film is directed by one of the finest directors working today – Richard Linklater. This latest doesn't play like a true sequel, but the reuniting of three men who served together in Vietnam does hammer home a couple of interesting statements while also delivering the type of dramedy that 2017 audiences tend to connect with.<br/><br/>Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd (Steve Carell), a former Navy medic, has had the type of year that no one deserves. It's 2003 and he has just been notified that his Marine son was killed in action while on duty in the war in Iraq. This comes only a few months after Doc lost his beloved wife to breast cancer. It's too much for him to handle on his own, so he embarks on a mission to ask his Vietnam buddies from three decades prior to accompany him to claim his son's body at Arlington National Cemetery. <br/><br/>His two buddies are former Marines Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishbourne). Sal is a washed out dive bar owner and Mueller is now the Reverend at a small church. The three men share the burden of a war secret that each has tried to forget, and they begin what's basically a road trip movie of middle aged men bonding during what is the absolute low point in life for one of them. Simultaneously, it also seems like an opportunity for all three to rejoin the living.<br/><br/>Lost idealism is the shared trait now among the three men, though their levels of cynicism vary. Edwin Starr sang it, and the characters in this movie openly question: War  What is it good for? Doc, Sal and Mueller have separated themselves from memories of war in three distinct ways – family, booze, and God. It's only by reconnecting with each other that they begin the long overdue process of reflection. TV's are tuned to the capture of Saddam Hussein from the spider-hole, and the similarities of the Vietnam and Iraq wars are contemplated. These are patriotic men who once trusted the government, but are now so disenchanted they ask ""what's the point?""<br/><br/>Mr. Cranston has the showiest role, but it's Mr. Carell who shines as the still-in-shock father. J Quinton Johnson also excels as the young Marine charged with accompanying the gentlemen, and the best scene of the film features Cicely Tyson as the mother of a long ago fallen soldier who crossed paths with the three leads. As you might expect in a Linklater movie, the musical choices are unusual and spot on. Bob Dylan (""Not Dark Yet""), Neil Young (""Old Man""), Eminem (""Without Me""), and Levon Helm (""Wide River to Cross"") are all included.<br/><br/>The film is certainly an unusual blend of comedy, tragic drama, and contemporary political commentary. Unfortunately, the contrivances are too many and too frequent to allow the film and characters to breathe and achieve the greatness of a true message movie. It teases us with flashes us brilliance and then pokes us in the ribs with another goofy sidebar as if to say ""just kidding"". It seems this would have been better served as an intimate portrayal of these three aging men who were willing to die for their country than as a giant political anti-war statement and an accusation of how evil the government is. The ultimate message Linklater drills home: be a good friend, and be a good person. We can never have enough of those."

","Average soapy melodrama of three Veterans reuniting 30 years later is lifted by ""Rick"" Linklater and Darryl Ponicsan's writing and great performances by Bryan Cranston as a bar owner and Laurence Fishburne as a minister, more than main character Steve Carell.<br/><br/>Three former Vietnam servicemen meet 30 years later in 2003 when one of their sons is killed serving in Iraq. The three travel to Arlington and Delaware to see the body, destined for Boston. Carell's son, he is told, ""died with honor serving his country.""<br/><br/>As he mourns, his two friends learn what really happened from the soldier's best friend, a young marine escorting the body. He didn't die in battle. He was shot at a public market by a local when they went to buy soft drinks during their mission moving supplies for Iraqi schools.<br/><br/>After he demands to see his deceased son, he is so emotionally affected that the three decide to bring the body back home themselves, rather than let the military hold a funeral and burial.<br/><br/>This provides some mediocre humor in a few scenes with devious Cranston being the wild card, taking over the transportation, buying his friends their first cell phones and the three being chased by Homeland Security.<br/><br/>The story inspires us with the camaraderie of these three marines who survived to reminisce of their other close friend who did not. It shows the secrets of war and how our fallen heroes may have died through different circumstances than their families were told.<br/><br/>Such as their own friend killed in Vietnam while the other three were being irresponsible and not protecting each other. They visit his mother who thinks her son died saving them. As they sit on her couch they hide the truth. Should they reveal that her son's death may have been partly their fault or let her continue to believe what the government told her 30 years ago?"
"Quinoa1984","10","19","37","20 November 2017"," Go see this movie. We don't get American dramas like this too much anymore.
","Last Flag Flying, from its title to the author of the book to the three central characters to the entire milieu and even down to specific places (from Virginia to New Hampshire, and mostly by train), cant help but be compared and measured up to The Last Detail, Hal Ashby and Robert Towne's towering work of early 70s/Vietnam era tragic-comedy about two Navy officers taking a man to the brig for a petty offense. I'm sure Linklater as a filmmaker knows this all too well, so for him the challenge was to make it appealing to those people (like me) who have seen TLD about a dozen times and at the same time to those who have no idea what that is. It's a rarity in an American cinema that is defined today largely by franchise potential and nostalgic-fetishism for things of $ value to have a *spiritual sequel* at all, let alone one that works. Luckily for us, Linklater hits his dramatic goldmine here with an easy and effort that seems minimal. Which, of course, makes it all the more of an astonishing feat.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: Last Detail *is* different from this film in a key aspect- Marines. There was a line from ""Badads"" Buddusky in that (Nicholson, who this time is Cranston, more or less, maybe less prone to full-blown outbursts though anger is there) where he said in a moment of vocalizing his sympathy for Meadows, the poor sod off to the Brig: ""Marines are assholes, you know that? It takes a sadistic temperament to be a Marine."" I don't know if that was in Ponicsans original Last Detail book, but I have to wonder if that was on the mind of Linklater when he changed up the characters (I believe the book is a direct followup to the original characters, and for a time Nicholson and Freeman were sought to reprise and fill those LD roles respectively) - what happens when we see these 'sadistic' beings as older men, weathered over time after decades of Vietnam having kicked their asses? Larry is the first name of Carrells character, also an ex-brig man, though why he was put away is left carefully ambiguous, and yet he is so soft spoken... Most likely because at any moment one suspects he might just burst into tears as, in this story, he is a recent widower and even more recent father to a slain Marine from Iraq 2003. <br/><br/>So once again its a ""road movie"" as Cranston's Sal and Fishburne's Muller (close enough to Mule) are sought by Larry to help him with the funeral arrangements, chiefly to bring the body to New Hampshire. This is not, of course, by the wish of the Marines who want the guy buried in Arlington; how much the lieutenant or captain or whomever impresses this upon Larry is striking and could seem overbearing, but that's the point - this is as much about the system these men have equally embraced and have discovered is a massive hunk of s**t, so to spiel, when it comes to really reckoning with human beings. And along the way there's a train ride where characters grow closer and joke around (its genuinely funny behavior too, which is so welcoming because it's both disarming and helps to diffuse problematic tension with a younger marine who was Larry Jr's best friend in Iraq), and another stop off in New York where the trio miss the train and spend a night just soaking in the city. Where Last Detail may have shown our intrepid (notantibutclose) heroes going to a party to get high and hit on girls, or get drunk or go to a whorehouse, now with a reverend in their midst (Fishburne by the way has the finest material, dramatically, comedically, everything, in so long I cant even remember) they get these magical things called cell phones, at Sal's distinct insistence, and a stop at a diner. <br/><br/>All of this could be too much shoved in our faces like ""eh eh, remember that, remember this,"" but it doesn't work that way. This is a director so confident in his material and his actors that the pace is perfect; it reflects this time that has to balance how Larry is still in a vulnerable place (also the marine friend too who knows some things that lead to an awkward admission in front of the captain character), but trying to be among human beings who can genuinely comfort him and make him laugh and also reckon with their own past ghosts. These are people who exist in their own story, and the shades to the previous Ponicsan adaptation are like icing on a sweet drama cake. <br/><br/>All the cast is excellent here, but aside from Cranston, who one expects will be stellar (and is, makes it seem so effortless too when of course this takes as much character work as Heisenberg did), Carrell quietly walks away with this. He doesn't say much but that's they key: he's never not listening, even when he is a little lost in grief, and he is easily the starkest difference from what Quaid did in TLD. This is someone who has nothing left but tries and actually succeeds in carrying himself with dignity (or as much as possible). Yet he can be forceful, like he is with the marines when he first sees his son and then finds out what happens to him. Its a masters class in director and actor clicking in a way that is so quiet you almost don't notice it, and that's the key - by the end, a typical letter-discovery reading scene feels so earned. <br/><br/>This is deeply felt, haunted, but not without a sense of humor. It's what I want out of movies"

","Last Flag Flying is a comedy-drama film directed by Richard Linklater (Boyhood, School of Rock) and based on the novel of the same name by Darryl Ponicsan. Starring Steve Carrell, Bryan Cranston, and Lawrence Fishburne in the lead roles, it is a solemn and occasionally humorous story of three reunited friends and their ways of dealing with the effects of PTSD.<br/><br/>In 2003, Doc (Steve Carrell), a Vietnam War veteren, meets up with his fellow soldiers Sal (Bryan Cranston) and Mueller (Lawrence Fishburne). Doc reveals that his only son has been recently killed in the Iraq War and that would like the two of them to accompany him in bringing the body home for a proper burial. Sal accepts right away but Mueller is reluctant due to his new lifestyle as a clean-cut Reverend, but after some persuasion by his wife, the two join Doc in his lengthy journey back home.<br/><br/>Well-acted and carefully paced, Last Flag Flying is a respectable film about the effects of war on those who fought in it without the need to actually show the war itself. Each of the three lead actors did a fine job, in particular Bryan Cranston, who is responsible for some much needed comic relief during the film's more depressing moments. The film's simple plot allows for some engaging dialogue between the three friends to be real cause for holding the viewer's attention and, as a result, we are given an interesting look into the mindset of each of the three veterans and how they each cope with the post-war trauma, whether it's through light-hearted comedy or by following Christian principles laid out in the Bible.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10"

","Last Flag Flying is my latest review. Its story involves three wartime buddies who served in Vietnam. These marines who have almost nothing in common, reunite after many years to go on a journey. One of them has a son who was killed in Iraq two days ago. They start off traveling to Arlington, VA, get detoured to Delaware, and eventually find their way to New Hampshire to bury said son.<br/><br/>""Flag"" is directed by innovator and maverick, Richard Linklater. Sadly, it doesn't feel like it for he should know better. Linklater and co-writer Darryl Ponicsan, fashion a film that is pure miscalculation. Sans a serviceable ending scene and a budding opening scene, Last Flag Flying drags and goes nowhere for over two hours. Frankly, it could've managed better had it topped out at eighty minutes or so. <br/><br/>""Flag"" is a decelerated, road trip pic and an excruciating character study all rolled into one. Its box office take was incredibly lousy and I can see why (a worldwide gross of $980, 841). Usually, Richard Linklater can take a bare bones plot and combine it with lots of dialogue-driven fare. With Last Flag Flying, there's good intentions towards the aspect of veterans but it doesn't quite work. Every sequence involving Linklater's actors, laces itself with tedium, sanctum, manipulation, and monotony. Heck, it just goes on and on and on.<br/><br/>The three personas mentioned in my review's first paragraph, are Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd, Sal Nealon, and Richard Mueller. They are played by Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and Laurence Fishburne. The performances here are decent and utilitarian but it feels like everyone forgot to consult a script supervisor. Carell's ""Doc"" is muted and you almost forget that he's even present. Cranston's Sal is incredibly annoying and rude. Finally, Fishburne's Mueller constantly whines and preaches (he's a pastor so whatever). With its globetrotting nature, its lack of formation, and its hindered pompousness, Last Flag Flying is in a word, ""unsatisfying"".<br/><br/>Bottom line: ""Flag"" only reminds us that Richard Linklater is miles away from equaling the banter and brethren of his early 90's hit, Dazed and Confused. You could also call Last Flag Flying his semi-failed attempt at re-imagining 1973's The Last Detail. Rating: 1 and a half stars."

From Before Sunrise, to Dazed and Confused, to even his recent works in Boyhood and Everybody Wants Some!!, I find myself liking his body of work more and more. So, please take this review with a grain of salt, but I truly feel that his latest film, Last Flag Flying, is easily one of the best movies to come out in 2017 and also one of the most underrated. This film has slipped pretty far under the radar, and that upsets me because this is just about the most sincere and honest piece of filmmaking to come from last year.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Last Flag Flying follows Richard (Steve Carell), a former United States Marine who is informed that his son (who's also in the Marines) has been killed in combat. Seeking the help of his old friends in Sal and Mueller from decades ago, they embark on a quest to bring Richard's son's body home, as he doesn't want him buried with the rest of his crew. This is literally the only major plot that's followed throughout the film, but there's so much going on under the surface for each character that I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It never hurts when you have a director that knows exactly how to work with actors and ends up getting lucky with some of the most talented actors in these roles.<br/><br/>Linklater's films have always been about the characters first and foremost. If you don't buy into any of the characters, then it's highly unlikely that you'll end up enjoying the movie. That being said, each one of these characters is distinctly different, but Carell, Cranston, and Fishburne all do their utmost to truly embody these figures. Once again, I found myself invested in each and every scene, being moved along by the terrifically written dialogue from start to finish. The conversations between characters feel so natural, and that all comes back (once again) to writer/director Richard Linklater.<br/><br/>His unique/natural writing always leaps off the screen and his directing isn't too shabby either, but I feel the true star of this film is the story itself. It really makes you take a step back and appreciate what you had in the past because the future isn't always sunshine and rainbows. Even through dark times, there's always light to brighten up certain situations. The final act of this film left me in tears, due to the fact that I had no clue who any of these characters were in the beginning, and found myself attached to whatever they were going to say next by the end.<br/><br/>In the end, although very slow-moving, the dialogue moves Last Flag Flying along at a very brisk pace. This two-hour picture feels about 90 minutes long in my opinion and if you're into hard-hitting dramas, then I'd have to recommend looking no further than this. An older demographic will definitely get more out of this film than the millennials of today, but that's not to say that everyone can't enjoy this movie. Meticulously directed in terms of character, wonderfully written in terms of dialogue, and impeccably executed in terms of bringing the audience from point A to point B throughout long periods of time, this is a road trip movie that will have you laughing out loud and weeping all at once. I can't recommend Last Flag Flying enough."
"iantrader","4","6","12","10 April 2018"," Tough to really like
","It should have been a great, if somewhat sombre, movie, but it falls down in several areas, mainly the drawn-out script which wanders aimlessly and needlessly and lack of any sort of resolution or change or conclusion for the characters. Of course it's a worthy topic but that's not enough to make it a good movie.<br/><br/>I can only think writer/director (sigh!) again, although as it's from a book, maybe the book didn't have the requisite qualities either. <br/><br/>The leads, however, are brilliant! Cranston is outstanding although he far and away has the best part.<br/><br/>It's a shame but in all, disappointing."

However, the story goes steadily downhill. Bryan Cranston's character is very annoying, unsympathetic and offensive. He doesn't know what respect is, and he just kills the film for me. The story tries to be comedic as well, but the jokes are way off. I did not enjoy the film at all."

","But I had to stop watching this movie if I ever wanted to see him in anything else. It's not all of his fault, of course. The movie just never seemed to take off. Once the characters were established, it just seemed to spin it's wheels, and that's the script's fault. The direction was fine, but since it's a road movie, there was a lot of potential lost. There again, it was the script. But the worst part of the movie for me was Cranston's character...gosh, to be trapped with him on a trip is a living hell...annoying, annoying...maybe his character got better in the third act, but I'll never know.
Update: Well, I did go back and finish the movie, and the third act was somewhat enjoyable...but I still contend they needed to take the scissors to some of the Cranston scenes...there was just way too much of his character.

It's a road trip story basically without much in the way of anything happening on the road trip. <br/><br/>It seemed like Brian Cranston's character did all the talking followed my Larry Fishburne and Carrell who the story was about was regulated to the background. Everything about this movie felt to shallow. I didn't really care about any of the characters so their emotions didn't extend to me. It was only in the final scene where I felt a little bit but even then it wasn't much.<br/><br/>I think everyone was good as far as the acting goes so it wasn't bad acting that made this a mediocre movie it was the writing.

"secondtake","8","3","6","1 August 2018"," A great ensemble piece with meaning
","Last Flag Flying (2017)<br/><br/> A great, low-key mixture of comedy and sadness. The more it went on the more I appreciated the situation, which unfolds like a play, and the ensemble acting, which is sharp. Bryan Cranston steals the show as the outgoing practical bartender veteran, but Laurence Fishburne and Steve Carell are really spot on, too, in deliberately restrained ways.
 The film is trying to get to something here. At first it seems to be about some guys coming to terms with their time in Viet Nam, and how it compromised them then, with repurcussions ever onward. Then a slow critique of war and of the US approach to war, pretending everyone in uniform is always a hero, and fighting for questionable (or worse) causes. 
 But an important third element grows-the actual meaning these men have for each other. They hadn't seen each other in decades, but their comraderie was almost unbroken because of some deep bond formed in wartime. And when it really comes down to it, even as they reject and hate the government for what they were forced to do, they still understood honor and respect.
 Including a love of country, somehow. That it's there, despite the flaws. Or something like that. (There are complications, and it would be easy and shameful to oversimplify.)
 The big point is: see this and give it time to settle in and warm up. The three men are deliberately an odd mix, and there are a couple of scenes that are rather too neatly contrived to make a fast point in the narrative, but overall it makes sense and is moving."

","Last Flag Flying includes everything Richard Linklater's films are best known for: interesting characters, witty dialogue that will make you think about certain things and the realistic feel of the content. The story is very simple and moving. I believe it was quite brave to authenticly show how things proceed when someone's son loses his life in a war far from home, how the government deals with it, how parents deal with it and was it even worth it. Even though the story itself is serious, Last Flag Flying has some fun moments that will make you laugh. Bryan Cranston's character Sal is really hillarious at times and there is a great train scene in the second half of the film where all the main characters talk about misdemeanours from their youth, Vietnam and how certain things change as you get older. Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne can hardly ever dissapoint and Steve Carell proves once again his versatility as an actor.<br/><br/>Recommended to everyone who enjoy Richard Linklater's work and like life stories that feel real and maybe even hit close to home for some viewers."

Doc reveals that his marine son was killed in Iraq 2 days earlier and is set to be buried at Arlington Cemetery.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Richard Linklater. He certainly has a tendency to lean towards some experimentation. I am most disappointed in the flat, extended nature of this movie. With these three great actors, I expected much much more and there is no reason to take two hours to get there. Nevertheless, these are great actors. It may have helped if some flashbacks of the Vietnam days be included. The movie has a rambling unfocused nature which is not helped by the simple filmmaking. I'm fine with Carell's quiet suffering but I wanted an explosion somewhere. Cranston tries his best to be irreverent. Fishburne is cool. I don't necessarily have any big problems but I want better."

"2001ASOfan","10","5","15","17 December 2017"," Sadly lost in the Holiday film-release crush, ""Last Flag Flying"" is one of the best films of 2017
","""Last Flag Flying"" was playing in exactly one screen in one theater in the entire Sacramento area during the 2017 Holiday film-release crunch (in Roseville, about 20 miles away), and I drove the distance because I've rarely been let down by director Richard Linklater, and a few of his films are among my favorites of all time. I wanted to support the film while it was in its initial release, even though I could've save the bucks and waited for streaming. Turns out this is one of his best, most absorbing films (so I'm especially glad I saw it in a theater) featuring superb acting down to the smallest role, and a fascinating script based on a book written by Linklater's co-screenwriter. I thoroughly enjoyed its exploration of everything from friendship over time, to coping with life's unpleasant and sometimes devastating surprises, to questions of faith, to making wise choices about when to let go and be irresponsible, to when telling a lie may be better than the truth, even to airing out feelings and opinions about wars and our government's reasons for them (I've seen few films quite this respectful of diverse feelings about all of these subjects). The film packs so much into a two-hour running time that you feel you've come to know the three main characters in particular, and I know I'm not alone in hoping there is a sequel that follows what happens to the three of them after this particular film ends. Linklater leaves me feeling this way a lot of the time with his films--wanting more--and I love it."

"Tanay_LKO","8","2","4","12 January 2019"," Friendship over Grief under the ""Last Flag Flying""
","The ""Before..."" trilogy and ""Boyhood"" have been a few films for which film-maker Richard Linklater was in recent news. The trilogy happens to be one of the most celebrated romantic-dramas in the last few decades, whereas, the other, a remarkable 12-year long coming-of-age drama about the metamorphic journey of growing from a boy into a man.<br/><br/>Then arrives ""Last Flag Flying"", a multi-character narrative on the death of a loved one. Surprisingly, its all about life and living.<br/><br/>It's December 2003. A widower, Vietnam War-Veteran, ""Doc"" (Steve Carell, ""The Office""), is on his way to collect the casket of his son, killed-in-action in Iraq. Before the scheduled burial with state-honours, Doc has a plan of his own to cope up with the events - to visit 'not' his best friends, but former ""brothers-in-arms"".<br/><br/>Enter - ""Sal"" (Bryan Cranston, ""Breaking Bad""), a carefree, reckless owner of a small-bar and with no hoots for humanity; and then ""Mueller"" (Launrence Fishburne, ""The Matrix""), now a grandfather and a God preaching-reverend. Poles apart, but they stick along with Doc.<br/><br/>""Men make the wars and wars make the men"" - resonate their minds as they argue over differing school-of-thoughts and realising their mutual guilt over their past. Hence, beginning from an obligatory stand-point their camaraderie grows up to believing ""...that even old men should become threats."" So, our 'boys' not just share their sadness but also laughs at boy-funny jokes and eventually, just bond like old homies.<br/><br/>I've grown up reading Ruskin Bond and Mark Twain on 'bromance'. However, apparently it's not too melodramatic to experience friendship in its truest colours. It lies within talking about stupid versions of their philosophies, laughing your lungs out while travelling in an uncomfortable train, or by getting suspected as terrorists, or just buying mobile phones for the first time - the cheap-thrills, the idiosyncrasies are the 'fizz' and the 'buzz'.<br/><br/>But, those old veterans had their best years behind them with nothing more to gain and carried pain in their hearts over their old and new experiences, esp. Doc who lost his son and wife. ""Pain is Pain"", said Sal; though, in just being together reminiscing past frolics and failures must have brought them some catharsis. Maybe in emptiness, that does look like a sound start to pick-up our lives.<br/><br/>Righteously, as the end-titles role comes a bitter-sweet song ""Not Dark Yet"" by Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>""I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
It's not dark yet, but it's gettin' there.""<br/><br/>There's still some hope, even in the worst of our ends.<br/><br/>One remarkable control of Linklater is that his films may stay within the boundaries of crossing-over to pathos but, he puts forth the living in the most relatable of circumstances. That all may seem too articulated esp. around this scenario which may turn overwhelming for viewers. So at two-hours long drama and slow sequences it could be a drag. Nevertheless, I'd watch this film any given day again for Carrell, Cranston and Fishburne reminding how friends are - ""not the best, but still ours.""<br/><br/>That African proverb makes more sense now - ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone. If you want to go far, walk with a friend.""<br/><br/>A lukewarm, yet pleasing - 7.5/10"

Carell, is least amount of dialogue, but the most amount of physical acting. The pain he carries throughout the film, due to his son's death, is just done so well by the well rounded actor. Fishburne does some worthy work here as a former soldier that found his peace in religion and is now a Pastor. Finally, Cranston steals the show as a rebellious ex-military man who lives as he pleases and says what he sounds. All three of these actors work so well together. It is a joy to watch them since the chemistry they create is fantastic, due to successfully providing both laughs, thanks to Cranston, and the real life hell these men went through and still go through internally in their present and older lives.

","I wasn't entirely sure what to expect coming into Last Flag Flying, given the lack of the marketing surrounding the film and given that I did not enjoy Linklater's Boyhood (2014). But seeing three actors of such a high caliber was enough of a draw. While the movie appears to be a very emotional drama, it was very surprisingly to find that for the most part, its a road trip comedy. Bryan Cranston as the immature Sal is a strangely genius casting move. Everyone knew Bryan Cranston always had serious dramatic chops and could be charming, but he reaches a new form here as minute to minute, he is simply hilarious. The contrast with Fishburne's minister provides even more comedy when the two finally begin to get along. Carell's Larry Shepherd is the sad, emotional aspect of the story and he really brings in one of his best performances and makes the audience feel every burning pain as he goes through the proceeding to bury his fallen son. Linklater has perfectly crafted three unique and highly interesting, well-developed characters that are at the heart of the movie, providing hilarious, entertaining, thoughtful and even sad scenes throughout this movie. It's such a shame Last Flag Flying was so overlooked, given the quality of these actor's performances, the depth of skill demonstrated by the director and simply being a great time.

All three men have different personalities and add their own flavor to the plot and this is all good, but a lack of seriousness disturbs you throughout most of the movie. It's nice to see Steve Carrell out of comedy movies, but his character seems too relaxed for a father who just recently lost his son.

Which leads me to the cast. Fishburne, Carell and Cranston are all amazing in their roles and this a result of great casting because these roles seem tailor made for them. And even though they are all great, Cranston sticks out a bit more. He is always pretty good but this movie is his stage and he owns that stage.<br/><br/>Even though this movie deals with marines and serving your country it is not about that. It is about friendship, about forgiving about loss and so much more. For me it is really more of a nitpick but yes I think it wouldn't hurt to cut the movie by 10 to 15 minutes.

You'll get to meet these three buddies who re-unite 30 years after they honorably served together in the battlefields of Vietnam. Multi-talented Steve Carell is the shy former Navy Corpsman Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd whose young son (who was also in the Navy), gets killed in Iraq. Shepherd wants to receive the body of his son with his old Marines pals Sal (the awesome Bryan Cranston) and Richard (Lawrence Fishborne), who is now a Reverend. Not only the chemistry between the three veteran actors works wonders, but also the film's dialogue in which different points of view on life and the existence of God are debated. Sal and Steve are hilarious, as well as Lawrence, one of my all-time favorites. I loved Last Flag Flying, one of the best films of 2017."

"Jithindurden","8","3","9","27 December 2017"," Linklater is back again
","Carrel, Cranston and Fishburne in the hands of Linklater, now that itself make this a wonderful experience. Linklater's finesse on characters and dialogues are seen here but even with the great performances from the three actors the mixed message that is unsure of it in the story is a weakness evident here. But that doesn't make it any less effective though, at times sad but always keeping the spirits up this is classic Linklater although not his best."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","3","9","27 December 2017"," Consider Bryan Cranston
","Very good, yet a bit overlong film about three veterans reuniting and finding resolutions for old and new wounds. Richard Linklater's adaptation was good, moving and offered potential for great performances, and it delivered, however 30 minutes less and some cutting could have served it well.
PErformance wise it as excellent. Bryan Cranston was simply brilliant in his Jack Nicholson-mode. What a force of nature performance. One of the greatest works of the year for this versatile actor and I am shocked that he did not get any kind of serious attention. Steve Carell was very good in a very calm role. I preferred him in ""Battle of the Sexes"" slightly but still he once again proved how good he is when he is serious.
Laurence Fishburne had his moments but was by far the weakest of the trio. Was not too impressed by him in general. 
Decent soundtrack and some really good dialogues and monologues."

","From the trailer it looks like the pitch was something to the effect of, ""We want to make the most depressing film this decade."" This will rake in hundreds of dollars. I kind of understand the ""We're making this for the art, "" approach, but it seems insane to plan to lose money. Especially, when next to no one will watch it. Even the coloring is depressing - which I am sure is not an accident."
"vincenzogalvano","5","2","6","21 March 2018"," Solid Acting -- Longevity is where film falters
","Three dynamic characters come together to bury the son of Doc Shephard (Carell). Each representing a facet of war. Sal (Cranston), representing how he is still very much a soldier in the war. Shephard, defining the loss that war brings, and Rev. Mueller (Fishburne), characterizing the length a man will go to in order to conceal his past life of a soldier. From the time these three characters meet for the first time in decades and the time they spend with one another represent the power of camaraderie and offer some funny scenarios. For instance, Sal and Mueller renting a u-haul, all three at a phone store etc.<br/><br/>However, the length of the movie wherein lies the falter. I found myself struggling through some dim scenes to make it to the end. An hour and a half through felt like two hours and so on. It requires a significant amount of patience. In the end, not only did I deem most of it forgetful, but was finding moments left and right that could have been pulled from the final project to make it shorter. <br/><br/>It takes the three a lifetime to make it to Dover, New Hampshire for the funeral as much as it takes the viewer to finish a film that could have already ended with getting its point across."

","Story line was good but over and under acting makes it hard to like characters. Lawrence Fishburne is excellent and makes the movie watchable. Steve Carell as the damaged father tries to hard to be damaged. Brian Cranston who is usually good does nothing to makes his character likeable. He is so irrating and annoying I almost turned the movie off. Playing a total asshole with no respect for himself or anyone was no a good idea. His over acting ruins the movie. Fishburne saves the day."

"qui_j","9","1","2","2 December 2019"," Drags a bit in spots but overall just amazing
","Put 3 powerhouse actors together, and they produce a truly ensemble piece, with none trying to upstage the other. Each actor gets into their role in a really believable manner. Cranston and Carrell are the outstanding ones, Fishburne lags a bit but that could have been due to the lack of depth and shallow dimension they gave his character. There are scenes where it all drags a bit, and one just wants to fast forward, but they do pass. This is a truly sentimental, and heart tugging script that is beautifully done and executed. It may not be for everyone but for those who are into this type of character study, profoundly emotional movie genre, this is just a great example of that."
"fmd-41656","9","1","2","4 June 2018"," Outstanding performances and excellent story line
","This was a movie made for those of us who came of age in the 1960s. If you had some military background, it is even more meaningful to you. It transitions from those ""old days"" to today in a unique way. Bryan Cranston is excellent in his role as an ex-Marine who was originally from New York as is Laurence Fishburne, the bad dud turned minister. Steve Carell's character says little, but he comes across well as an ex-Navy Corpsman type. The story line interweaves three men's camaraderie and experience with ""the system"" with today's military. The old veterans have that distrust of the US government which was prevalent in those who served during Vietnam or who came of age during that same time frame. That distrust carries over to more recent times with the lies that Carell's character ""Doc"" gets as the official story of how his only son dies as a Marine in Iraq. The three veterans all question what happened now and then, and find many answers along their way to their destination at a cemetery in New Hampshire. This is a well done film that I would also classify as a film that will have much more appeal to men than women, especially older guys in their late 60s or 70s. It is a lot better than many of the films that were nominated for Academy Awards this year (2018) and one of those films where you shake your head and say why no Oscar? It's a great film."

"scott-logan-197-874075","9","1","2","23 May 2018"," Excellent Movie
","Dramatic, poignant, serious, and yet delightfully light hearted. It's about young men at war and the old men returned from war and their memories and the remarkably incommon issues they have handled and moved forward each in their own way. As a retired military combat veteran myself I loved it. The acting is superb by all the players and the story is just memorable and touching in a good way. Needless to say again I loved it for so many reasons. Also, in my view it's an exceptional story of how young men change and adapt to life circumstances whether they are combat veteran or not."
"SmileyMcGrouchpants","8","1","2","18 May 2018"," This is a good movie!
","Every scene gives you new information, and every scene -- uniquely, barring Richard Linklater's own ""Bernie"" or Todd Solondz's recent triumph ""Weiner-Dog"" -- takes the trouble to put the people in places they could *afford*. What's so astonishing about this ""bring it down to Earth"" tactic is, you end up being more absorbed *and* awed by seeing it on the big screen (or, even, the little one -- in a way that's ""cinematically encoded""). This picture goes to show, whatever it is to making movies, you can't just *do* it, and to have someone like Richard Linklater at the helm, who knows when to pull back or drop in, well, you find yourself responding to normally-corny ""movie"" tropes like shot-montages or establishing glimpses of places with a renewed sense of wonder. Terrific performances all around -- directors sometimes forget you have to give actors something to *do* (or is it screenwriters? producers?) and this is true all around the case: like they keep bringing out the best in each other. (Why hasn't someone cast Laurence Fishburne as a preacher? His oratory style alone is worth the price of admission!) Hard choices, never preachy, the movie lets the characters talk and is wary of soapboxing so you don't get thrown out of the film. And the director finds the perfect -- or, at least, perfectly *apt* -- place to end it. (This is the guy who made ""Before Sunset,"" after all!)"

"namashi_1","10","1","2","3 May 2018"," A Yet Another Triumph For Richard Linklater!
","Richard Linklater does some of his best work in 'Last Flag Flying'. In this deeply affecting & emotionally powerful film, Linklater brings us a story that offers heart, mind & soul. A Near Masterpiece, 'Last Flag Flying' is also bolstered by a robust performances by its strong leading men - Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and Laurence Fishburne.<br/><br/>'Last Flag Flying' Synopsis: Thirty years after they served together in Vietnam, a former Navy Corpsman Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd re-unites with his old buddies, former Marines Sal Nealon and Reverend Richard Mueller, to bury his son, a young Marine killed in the Iraq War.<br/><br/>'Last Flag Flying' is about love, loss, friendship, grief, redemption, duty & life itself. Watching these men, who once served for their country, reunite for the loss of another one in the battlefield, this one being the son of one our the leading-men, is a depiction of how with time & age, life's harshest moments can be a little less painful, if with the company of people around you, can understand & make your pain better. Linklater is at his most sensitive here, delivering a story on loss with a quiet, but impressionable impact. I simply loved how this story unfolded, scene by scene, dialogue via dialogue. Its done so beautifully & the slight humorous touches add the much needed relief to the proceedings. Linklater & Darryl Ponicsan's Screenplay, which is based upon the latter's 2005 novel of the same name, is fantastic. The Writing is pure emotion, pure heart & soul. Linklater's Direction, as always, is subtle, but detailed. Cinematography is excellent. Editing, too, is very good. Art & Costume Design are of high-order.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: 'Last Flag Flying' salutes its three leading-men & gives them characters worth remembering. Steve Carell is an acting masterclass here. His portrayal of a broken man, is so heartbreaking, that its impossible not to feel for him for even a second. Its a career-best performance, that definitely deserved some SERIOUS awards consideration this year. Bryan Cranston & Larry Fishburne support Carell, astoundingly. Cranston, as the more lively & talkative of the lot, is a joy to watch. The thespian brings depth & humor to his part & completely wins you own. Fishburne is simply outstanding. His turn as a former war-hero to now a Reverend, is done with the ease only Fishburne could bring in. In short, Carell, Cranston & Fishburne, all three, are a Dream-Team together! Take a bow, you guys!<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Last Flag Flying' is a winner all the way. This one's an Instant Classic!"

","""Last Flag Flying"" is the story of a Vietnam veteran who enlists the aid of two old war buddies to help him bury his son, a Marine killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The three principles all give excellent performances. While Bryan Cranston's is the most memorable (and that might be because as a veteran, I identified most closely with his character), Steve Carell absolutely surprised me. I never would have pegged him as a dramatic lead, but his turn as a grieving father is not only believable but relatable. Laurence Fishburne as a former hellraiser turned pastor brings the movie together.
At times hilarious, at others poignant, this film is an incredible tribute to those who served and serve today. At the same time, it asks the question our national leaders never seem willing to answer: are the wars we fight worth the sacrifices of the men sent into battle?"

"eddie_baggins","8","1","3","11 September 2018"," An effective and touching character driven drama
","It should come as no surprise that Richard Linklater's newest talk-heavy and character driven dramedy is both a further reminder of the talents of the Texas born filmmaker in his ability to extract out noteworthy turns from his performers and deliver down to earth and touching messages through his writing.<br/><br/>Coming from the man that gave the world Dazed and Confused, Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight and Waking Life (all dialogue heavy and carefully observed slice of life tales), Last Flag Flying is the type of film that may seem like its much ado about nothing but thanks to Linklater's emotionally resonate work behind the scenes and his actors on-song turns in front of the camera, Flying becomes one of the year's most memorable and likeable character studies, that also acts as a powerful anti-war examination.<br/><br/>Focussing on three Vietnam War veterans and long-estranged friends, Sal Nealon (Cranston), Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd (Carell) and Reverend Richard Mueller (Fishburne) as the trio reunite to support Doc as he looks to bury his only son who died on duty in the Iraq War, Flying mixes in a road-trip, family drama and expose of the after effects of war to great effect as Linklater narrows his focus onto these three aging men reminiscing about their younger year's and pondering the big questions of life as they enter their twilight periods.<br/><br/>It's a story that allows Linklater's unique sensibilities to shine through as the film is comfortable as both an emotionally engaging and serious tale as well as one that's perfectly at home letting its esteemed acting trio talk about their Vietnamese whorehouse escapades.<br/><br/>There aren't too many filmmakers' operating today that possess the easy to digest nature of Linklater's offerings and it's simply a joy to watch Carell, Cranston and Fishburne play off each other as well as devouring Linklater's script.<br/><br/>All actors do an exemplary job of bringing these wounded souls to life with Carell in particular impressing in one of his most restrained roles yet, while Fishburne and Cranston have a blast bringing their larger than life figures to action in the journey that will make you laugh, ponder and cry.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>A small film in many ways but one that's quiet power will sneak up on you and lay hold upon you, Last Flag Flying is another top class entry in Richard Linklater's increasingly impressive C.V and a wondrous showcase for its three lead performers.<br/><br/>4 U-Haul employees out of 5"

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. In the extras commentary it is mentioned as a ""sequel"" to the 1973 ""The last Detail"" but the focus of the story was changed.<br/><br/>The setting is 2003, the Iraq war was raging and Saddam Hussein is being captured in his fox hole. Steve Carell is Larry 'Doc' Shepherd who as a teenager served in Vietnam 30 years earlier as a Navy medic. He just got news that his son, a Marine, was killed in Iraq and the body was being transported back to the States for burial at Arlington Cemetery.<br/><br/>Using an internet search, which was still in its relative infancy in 2003, he looks up his two best buddies from all those years ago. Bryan Cranston is 
Sal Nealon, owner of Sal's bar. Laurence Fishburne is Reverend Richard Mueller. Neither one is thrilled at first but eventually they agree to accompany Doc.<br/><br/>So the story really is more of a road trip with three old buddies often commenting on the current state of affairs, and various life lessons. Sal is the ""agitator in chief"" of the group but in the end lessons are learned and life put into a proper perspective.<br/><br/>The three were accompanied by J. Quinton Johnson as active soldier

"zkonedog","7","1","4","6 February 2018"," Proof That Sometimes Chemistry Alone Can Make A Movie Entertaining
","If and when one gets right down to it, ""Last Flag Flying"" is a little bit of a mess, thematically. It tackles a number of different issues/themes, and comes up inconclusive on most of them. The thing is, though, there is such great chemistry between the three leads of the film that it almost doesn't even matter in the end, because their interactions are so entertaining.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Last Flag Flying"" sees Doc Shepherd (Steve Carell), a former Marine, being informed that his son has died in service to his country. Understandably distraught, Doc does the only thing that seem right under the circumstances, which is to reunite with former Corps mates Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) and Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston). When the trio discover that the military isn't being exactly honest with them about the circumstances surrounding Doc's son's death, they decide to take matters into their own hands and transport the body back home themselves.<br/><br/>If there ever was a movie that personifies the phrase ""more about the journey than the destination"", this would be it in spades! Along the way, the trio of former military men reminisce about old times, feel guilty about some events, and just generally try to come to terms with their service and what a mixed-up war Vietnam was both overseas and stateside. As I said in the opening paragraph, there are a lot of lofty themes thrown around during the runtime of this film. Some work...some don't. All told, the plot really doesn't amount to much in the end anyway.<br/><br/>But boy oh boy, is it ever fun to watch Sal, Doc, and the Reverend (Fishburne's character is now a minister, much to the delight of the gang) share the screen. Sometimes, three actors the caliber of Fishburne, Carrell, and Cranston would react like oil and water to each other. The exact opposite happens here, as instead all three bounce perfectly off of each other all film long. Carrell has more of the emotional role, Cranston is the clown, and Fishburne just rolls his eyes at it all (the straight man, if you will). It had been a long time since I had watched a film where the actors so firmly make the proceedings watchable even despite some meandering plot issues.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong...it's not like ""Last Flag Flying"" is devoid of plot. It indeed does just enough to keep events moving forward. What I'm saying, though, is that this is a film where the character interactions so effortlessly steal the show that it can still be enjoyable even with some pretty simplistic plot structures moving it along. One scene, where the guys just sit around on a train and talk about their past Marines experiences, might be the best of the whole show. That's quite a feat!<br/><br/>Despite being directed by Richard Linklater (now mostly known for the incredibly deep--and Oscar-successful--""Boyhood""), ""Last Flag Flying"" will likely never ascend to ""classic"" status. There just really isn't enough to it. If you are just looking for some great acting performances and verbal back-and-back from iconic actors, however, this will be something you can thoroughly enjoy."

","I had pretty low expectations for this going into it. The premise just did not sound very interesting. To my surprise, the film turned out to be much better. I think what makes it work is that, at its core, it is a dialogue-driven Richard Linklater film. The intimate and one-on-one conversations throughout the film make it pop and are incredibly entertaining. The problem is that the premise and the plot structure around which those conversations are built are incredibly flawed, sometimes seeming inconsequential and incredibly contrived. If Linklater had found a better way to structure the main conversations and main trio around a better plot, it would have been an undeniably great film. As it is, it's a good, sometimes very good, one. Both Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston give some strong work here, especially the latter. After several films where he has given broad, over-the-top, cartoonish performances that lack any real authenticity (e.g., Trumbo, All The Way) I was beginning to think Cranston had forgotten the art of nuance. Here, he's able to bring nuance and real, heartfelt authenticity to the role while still bringing the showiness as it calls for it. Finally my faith in him as an actor has been restored, after having disappointed again and again since Breaking Bad. This is the performance he should be in awards consideration for. On the flipside, this is yet again another dramatic performance from Steve Carell that feels forced and unnatural. Even with great roles like the one in Foxcatcher he fails to be entirely convincing.

","""Last Flag Flying"" (2017 release; 125 min.) brings the story of 3 Vietnam War vets. As the movie opens, we are informed it is ""December 2003"", and we see a guy arriving at Sal's Bar & Grille. The bartender (and owner) Sal doesn't recognize the guy at first, but then realizes it's Doc, who served with Sal in Vietnam. After a drunken night, Doc suggests they go somewhere and Sal, not knowing what to expect, nevertheless agrees. Turns out Doc takes him to see Mueller, another Vietnam vet who now is the pastor at a Baptist church. After dinner at Mueller's house, Doc drops the bomb: his only son was killed 2 days ago in Bagdad and Doc wants Sal and Mueller to accompany him to retrieve his son's body and bury him. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-director Richard Linklater, whose 2014 masterpiece ""Boyhood"" was my No. 1 movie of that year. Linklater is one of my favorite film makers, period. Here, he goes a very different direction from what he typically does, and brings an all-out sober, if not somber, account of how one guy deals with the death in combat of his son, and calling on two 'Nam buddies he hasn't seen in decades for moral and other support. And how exactly did his son die in Bagdad anyway? The war in Iraq is possibly the very worst presidential decision taken in the last 50 years, so I don't need to be told, again and again in this movie, what a lousy idea that was, so please stop the unabashed preachy tone of the movie already. Not to mention that certain moments simply feel contrived (the Dover AFB scene where Doc and Sal roll away the coffin; the TV footage of Saddam Hussein's capture, happening the very same day!, etc.). This film is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie. On the plus side, the performance of Bryan Cranston as the freewheeling Sal is spot on. I can't say the same thing for Steve Carell who as the grieving dad seems to try too hard to channel the grief and bewilderment. Bottom line: ""Last Flag Flying"" is not a bad film, certainly not, but the movie's message is at times too obvious and too preachy. I can't help but think back to that other recent movie ""Thank You For Your Service"", which didn't shout in your face how horrible the war in Iraq has been (or its aftermath for returning veterans), but instead lets the story do the talking without resorting to the obvious and the preaching. We get it.<br/><br/>""Last Flag Flying"" opened recently at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati (and it being an Amazon Studios film, it simultaneously started streaming on Amazon). The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (about 10 people in all). I can't say that when I walked out from the theater I felt good about having seen this film. I certainly encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","It's amusing to watch how three men with contrasting personalities begin a road trip to bury Doc's son. War indeed brings them contrasting memories but afterall, they are able to reunite because of their past. The movie also shows how it is important to sometimes deal with your past in order to have a smooth future. Even though, the three men have their individual coping strategies, they yet again face their past when they come together and they are finally able to come in terms with it."

","I was concerned with Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne, and Steve Carell. Three excellent actors together in the same movie usually mean terrible dialogue and story. I have to say other than a few flaws in the videography, the story and character building was excellent. Steve Carell did a fantastic job holding a serious roll, and Cranston did an outstanding job as a drunk bar owner. They stick together as they did in Vietnam, and remember the friendship they all shared. It was thirty years later and still came back as it if was yesterday. I do not want to spoil the movie, but I found it excellent, even the ending. One of my favorite films of late, as it was somewhat believable other than a few missteps. It is a storyline and character-building movie, so if you are looking for a lot of action, you have picked the wrong title."

It's just that simple.<br/><br/>Children should not be sent to die for a cause that doesn't need fighting. The people who invent the causes they rally others to die for is something we, as a species, has been struggling with since the dawn of time.<br/><br/>Seems like a lot of us are starting to wake up to that fact.

","Last Flag Flying - I had never heard of it until I stumbled upon it on IMDB; Bryan Cranston - arguably the preeminent actor of this millennium - said in an interview that this film is beautiful and ""I am so proud of it."" Well, that was all I needed to hear, and I was compelled to watch the movie. So very glad I did! Three of our best actors, and they are all in top form here. Strong supporting cast (with an appearance by the venerable Cicely Tyson). Profound truths are subtly conveyed. So many different feelings are enlivened in this film, in a pretty perfect blend. This is the kind of movie that makes me feel deep respect for those involved in making such a work of art."

","The film begins with anti-militarist and anti-emperialist point of view but ends up with American flags and a silly heroism. I was stuck on the film since the beginning of it because of Sal's critical comments and analyses about American political and militarist system. Three soldier friends who are the victims of Vietnam war meets years later. As the years went by one of them became a priest (Richard Mueller), the other an alcoholic and an opponent man (Sal Nealon), while the other became quite silent and moderate person (Larry 'Doc' Shepherd). We watched Sal's critical and opponent approaches nearly every subject especially during discussions between him and Mueller till the end of the film. However, at the end he compromised with the whole system and contradicted with the man we watched all along. I was totally disappointed. Was that all lies? Was also Sal lying? What happened to the lectures he gave to us since the beginning of the film? I finished it with these questions in my mind. I gave 6 points because of successful casting and Sal's smart and critical reasoning but I cannot give higher points to a film that has such a militarist final."

Sal just leaves his car in Delaware?<br/><br/>And last but not least, when the Marine was sitting around in the train's cargo compartment, and the 3 older vets go back to talk with him, you see the young Marine sitting on Doc's son's boxed casket, never, never, never would have happened."

","I've seen more movies over the past year, over 50, at theaters, than I've watched in the past 30 years. I'm no professional critic, but I have over 50 years of film history and tend to appreciate movies that, like the music I enjoy, may cross many genres, but especially convey a soulful feeling and are well told. I enjoyed Molly's Game and a few others at this level this year, and watched a lot of Hollywood garbage as well. This is a well written and acted character study of three vets who came together after a tragedy befalls the character who took the fall for a tragic decision that impacted their lives probably more than they all could have realized. I found the script and the connections between all the characters compelling and would recommend it without hesitation, especially to anyone reviewing their own major life decisions, understanding of the military mindset, and response to grief/loss."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Last Flag Flying"" (2017) has to say something about war and politics. It does not like either of them. What i did like about this movie was not its message, perhaps, but acting and writing. On its core its a 2 hours road movie with some war veterans who share some dark secret. There are no revelations at the end of they journey, but there is some sort of accomplishment of what they did on the road.<br/><br/>Overall, while ""Last Flag Flying"" isn't as good as Richard Linklater's previous movies (far from it), i did enjoy this picture entirely because of veteran actors doing good job and reading fine lines. This is a very anti-war movie without a war and a solid road drama."

","Linklater's films are always watchable, but this one is fascinating, because it's clearly an example of a project that has been ""cast up"".

There's really very little new or inherently great here, but the film is worth a watch nonetheless."

","I don't know if it was intentional or not, but I never really felt the grief of a father who lost his only son to a combat death. I don't think a grieving father would go travelling around to bars and cell phone shopping with buddies he hadn't seen for 40 years as he is simultaneously escorting his son's coffin to its final resting place. I couldn't get this thought out of my head the entire length of the movie. <br/><br/>The ages of the actors didn't seem quite old enough to be Vietnam vets in the year 2003. The only one who seemed old enough was Lawrence Fishburne's character. <br/><br/>Despite these flaws and some incorrect details regarding the military uniforms, I enjoyed this movie a lot and in the end it brought me to tears. I think because being from a military family myself, and knowing many people who served in the Middle East during this time period I understand the pain of so many families who have lost loved ones at the hands of the enemy of the time."
"mherrin-43253","7","0","2","4 May 2018"," Coming to grips with regret
","Last Flag Flying: Directed by Richard Linklater and written by Richard Linklater and Ponicsan<br/><br/>Hello folks and welcome back to the Chicken Shack. We have a new film from profilic director Richard Linklater. The last time we had one of his movies here in the Shack was the terribly bland Bad News Bears remake. This was an Amazon movie which is where I watched it sitting there with a tasty beverage to go along with it. This was more of a somber film. It is about three former buddies who served together in Vietnam on a journey to return the body of the son of one of them to his home to be laid to rest. It is about coming to grips with regret. An experience they shared that shaped who they had become as people and what paths they chose after the fact. <br/><br/>This is a dialogue heavy movie which is no surprise from Richard Linklater as he seems to prefer this type of story. I don't mind it. Sometimes the dialogue can have a stronger impact than action can. It all depends on what story is being told. This was a solid movie. It has the necessary moments of levity to keep the story from drowning in the sadness and sorrow that comes from a film of this type. This is a road trip movie but a good one unlike the last movie I watched Kodachrome. The emotions on display here felt honest and they did come with history between them but it never felt forced. <br/><br/>This movie lives and dies on the relationships between the three men. All the actors in this movie are pretty terrific. They all have strikingly different personalities but they seem to mesh well together. You can tell that even though it's been decades since they've seen each other, they fall back into the connective patterns that made them friends in the first place albeit a little wiser in some respects.<br/><br/>All in all this was a fine movie. It felt a little long and it followed the road trip movie formula a bit too closely but the performances elevated it into a solid but middle of the road film. I give this movie a C."

","Bryan Cranston gives the worst performance of his career. Too much energy, void of any nuance, completely unbelievable as a former marine going with a friend to bury his dead son who had been killed in Iraq. Ruined the movie for me. Steve Carrel, and Lawrence Fishburne were excellent, Cranston was over acting for the first time in his career. I really like Cranston, but his attitude and ridiculous performance made the film unbelievable. It's too bad, serious subject on many levels. The film is worth seeing, but The Director should have reined in Cranston from giving such an over the top, bad performance. His complete disrespect of a dead marine and process of burial are hard to understand."

"lavatch","Null","0","3","14 February 2018"," ""Humankind Cannot Bear Very Much Reality""
","In the bonus track of the DVD of ""Last Flag Flying,"" the film's executive producer Thomas Lee Wright described the theme of ""the internal consequences of war"" that the film artists sought to evoke. The film was successful in realizing that goal through three extraordinary character portraits.<br/><br/>The most engaging part of the film was the banter among three characters, each of whom was meticulously developed by screenwriter-director Richard Linklater. Sal (Bryan Cranston), a wisecracking owner of a bar; Mueller (Laurence Fishburne), a reformed alcoholic turned pastor; and ""Doc"" (Steve Carell) had such contrasting characters that film was constantly buoyed by friendly antagonism and one-upsmanship.<br/><br/>The three characters, all of whom are Vietnam vets, meet in the year 2003, a time when the Iraq war is well under way. The film is a no-holds-barred critique of the two wars, which had an eerie resemblance to each other in the enormous investment of money cost in lives in faraway conflicts. Neither the Vietnam nor Iraqi wars were defensive in nature, but each one was started by America and evolved into a brutal quagmire. The strongest line in the film is when Sal berates a Marine colonel, telling him bluntly that if they had worked together in Vietnam, the result would have been ""fragging."" The word fragging means mutiny in which American soldiers refused to carry out orders and killed their commanding officers in Vietnam.<br/><br/>The antiwar message is strengthened with a complementary philosophical perspective that is best expressed in the poet T. S. Eliot's famous line, ""Humankind cannot bear very much reality."" When the three veterans pay a visit to the mother of a Marine who died because of their horseplay, they plan to atone in a confessional to the mother. But they cannot bring themselves to tell the truth, instead choosing to lie to Mrs. Hightower in order to leave her and themselves with the sense that her son was a hero.<br/><br/>The moving funeral of ""Doc's"" son, who died senselessly in Iraq offers an exclamation point to the film's critique of the war and the prevarication of the government, when ""Doc"" was mistakenly led to believe by the feckless colonel that the young man died in combat, when, in fact, he was the victim of an act of terrorism.<br/><br/>The motto ""Semper fi"" (always faithful) is a reference point for the ideal of dying for one's country that the film portrays as hollow and tragic for such needless wars as the ones in Vietnam and Iraq. This was a memorable and provocative film that raises many ethical questions about our nation's foreign policy both past and present. Great work from Fisburne, Carell, and Cranston!"
