","If you want to bypass the quibbles and get straight to the meat of this review, please skip to my last paragraph.<br/><br/>The Battle of Midway is a story that's well known to most Annapolis graduates of my generation and earlier. The battle was a key inflection point in World War II, perhaps the pivotal moment changing the course of the Pacific War.<br/><br/>Although I loved seeing Henry Fonda as Nimitz in the 1976 version of ""Midway"" (Fonda was to play Nimitz in ""In Harms Way"" as well), unfortunately, I found that movie to be surprisingly dull, historically inaccurate, unnecessarily melodramatic, and generally not very good.<br/><br/>Because my experience is that more recent movie renderings of historical subjects usually don't improve the historical accuracy (I'm thinking of 2001's God-awful Ben Affleck ""Pearl Harbor"" vis-Ã -vis 1970's ""Tora Tora Tora""), I did not have high hopes for this new ""Midway.""<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>In short, ""Midway"" is a terrific movie. Not only does it get the history (mostly) right, it's a tight, elegant, and superb rendering that does the historical figures proud. It succeeds to pack way more into its 2 hour, 18 minute run length than you can imagine. It covers the attack on Pearl Harbor, the PACFLT-Washington tension & dynamic, Nimitz's ascension to command of the Pacific, LCDR Layton's contribution to the intelligence picture, Joe Rochefort's robe-wearing genius, Yamamoto's soul-searching, Halsey's tenacity, the ascendency of naval aviation, a tiny bit of the submarine contributions to the battle, and-oh yeah-the actual battle itself, to include the incredible, unbelievable jaw-dropping (but true!) heroism of our Yorktown and Enterprise naval aviators. And it does all this justice, in a superb bit of moviemaking.<br/><br/>Can a 26-year Navy veteran like me find nits to pick on? Of course:
<ul><li>I saw a few collar devices that weren't pinned on right (I'm talking about you, Layton!)</li><li>At least one scene that is historical legend but didn't really happen</li><li>The substantially underrepresented submarine role in the battle (being a submariner, perhaps my biggest regret)</li><li>Some Annapolis grads wearing their class ring on the wrong hand (tradition has us wearing our rings on our left hand, not the right)</li><li>Sailors not ""squaring away"" their Dixie cup hats the way they would have back then</li><li>I wish the Pearl Harbor officers' club was as nice as they portrayed it in the movie!</li><li>They placed a non-existent cemetery on Pearl Harbor's Hospital Point</li><li>Kimmel didn't watch the attack from the Pacific Fleet headquarters, he watched it from his office on the Pearl Harbor submarine base (which later became my office and is on the national register of historic places)</li><li>They would not have worn their service dress khaki in the Officer's Club-- they would have worn service dress whites (chokers)</li><li>The band in the O-club would have been locals not sailors (they missed an opportunity to have somebody like Gabby Pahinui playing!)</li></ul><br/><br/>But the good stuff way exceeds the nits:
<ul><li>They got the Pacific Fleet headquarters right-- it's not the Pearl Harbor shipyard commander's building</li><li>They got the torpedo failures right-- torpedoes were terrible early in the war</li><li>They got the Yorktown repair in 48 hours in Drydock 4 in the Pearl Harbor shipyard right-- the shipyard rendering was near perfect</li><li>They got the code breaking room in the basement of the PACFLT headquarters right (when I was stationed there the room was being used to store furniture and I petitioned to get it on the national register of historic places)</li><li>It might have been a lot of CGI, but it was really good CGI. They rendered Pearl Harbor almost perfectly. I could even make out my Ford Island house from my time as commodore, as well as a historically accurate rendering of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, the Pearl Harbor submarine base, and of course, the ships and planes.</li><li>Something I never thought I'd hear myself say: Woody Harrelson was superb as Nimitz. He's no Fonda, but he was understated and believable, the way I've always seen Nimitz in my mind. Not a casting idea I would have thought of, but it worked!</li><li>Except for the collar device issue listed above, the uniforms were exactly right for the period, from the flat shoulder boards that were being used in that era, to the beaten-up look the ship's laundry would have given Service Dress Khaki, to the way the sailors were dressed, to the way the pilots wore their wings, etc.</li><li>It even brought out the fact that movie director John Ford was on Midway doing a documentary when the battle went down. The fact that Ford volunteered for the Navy, saw battle, and was injured, while John Wayne remained (in his mind) safely at home, become a point of tension between the two men, with Ford being one of the few who felt comfortable belittling Wayne for his lack of service as the years went by.</li><li>I really liked the outtro mini-bios of the real characters at the end. I didn't learn anything new there, but thought they were extremely well done.</li></ul><br/><br/>In the end the 2+ hours flew by for me. It was so good, I plan on seeing it again next weekend. What a terrific way to celebrate Veteran's Day.<br/><br/>Of course, Roland Emmerich's prior movies have been, on the whole, simpleminded blockbusters. But this time he took a risk by doing something thoughtful, respectful, accurate, and artistic. The only way to ensure movies like this continue to be made is for the public to show we care about history and accuracy, and to make this movie a success. I very much hope it does well. Then maybe we have a chance of getting the right movie made about the Indianapolis.<br/><br/>A final thought: I've been disgusted by many of the cynical, snarky reviews written by professional movie reviewers, many of which sneer at the bravery of the warriors depicted. Yes, the dialog in this movie is sometimes simple, tired, and trite. A few of the characters are not well developed, particularly the women. It's perfectly appropriate for reviewers to criticize elements of moviemaking. One reviewer made fun of the line of dialog where Best says ""This is for Pearl Harbor."" There is nothing silly or unreasonable about that line. You can bet one of the pilots actually said something like that that day. As somebody who survived 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, when I later went to Afghanistan, you can bet if I had the chance to do so I would have said, ""This is for Gerry DeConto,"" one of my friends who didn't make it out that day. But many these sneering reviewers have gone on to say to readers that because of these weaknesses, they should not see ""Midway."" Keep in mind that there were similar elements of Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" that could be considered inaccurate and/or over-the-top movie-making (most of the scenes depicted in Congress, for example), but on the whole the events portrayed in that movie are important for Americans to understand. Same is true here. So the point I want to make is this: a movie can have elements of poor moviemaking, and yet be an important movie for viewers to watch. ""Midway"" is one such movie. It depicts a poorly understood event in American history, but one that Americans should be exposed to. The events depicted, and the people depicted, are real. They really did these things. The bravery was real. Americans need to know this, and reviewers who have likely never risked anything in their lives should have the good graces not to sneer at those who have."
"3xHCCH","8","390","524","29 October 2019"," Account of Crucial Naval Battle in Emmerich Style
","This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.<br/><br/>Along the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).<br/><br/>The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.<br/><br/>The execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""2012"" (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.<br/><br/>For its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in ""Midway."" There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first ""Midway"" film or ""Pearl Harbor."" While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible. As this movie is rated PG, so do not expect to see graphic injuries at the level of ""Saving Private Ryan."""
"brian-carter-110-625553","9","328","460","10 November 2019"," Hollywood actually made a decent war movie without pushing a political agenda
","This is probably the first time in over 50 years Hollywood made a solid war movie without inserting a sappy, contrived romantic sub-plot, pushing some radical political agenda, or re-writing history.
The movie is good. The dialogue is believable, natural, and convincingly delivered in almost all cases.<br/><br/>While no movie is perfectly accurate historically - historians don't even agree on much, so who is to say - the few errors here are trivial and immaterial to the how events progressed. As somebody who is a buff on this period of the early Pacific war - reading every book by Prange, Lord, and many others - I was very impressed.<br/><br/>I went into this movie expecting the worst from Hollywood, but this was their best historical piece in generations. Even the casting seemed to echo the real people in looks and demeanor.<br/><br/>The Japanese point of view wasn't neglected either. While I can't say whether the Japanese dialogue was believable or well-delivered, by all outward appearances this acting was also top notch. The similarity between the real Admiral Nagumo and the actor was particularly striking. They made the right call in using solid Japanese actors speaking Japanese.<br/><br/>The accurate portrayal of the friction between the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army with Emperor Hirohito almost powerless to restrain the militarists was very refreshing. This was a very important, complex contributing factor to the war. Few outside Japan and some narrow historical circles ever learn about this dynamic.<br/><br/>About the worst I can say about this movie is the pace was too fast. Unless stretched into an 8 hour mini-series, I can't imagine they could have avoided this. With my background, I could fill in gaps and context the movie seemed to miss. Others might be left confused. Even though not well-read on this chapter of history, my spouse followed the storyline without issue and really enjoyed the movie as entertainment.<br/><br/>Kudos to the producers, writers, actors, and entire crew. This was a job well-done and a fitting tribute to heroes like Layton and Best."
"rbstern","5","212","303","18 November 2019"," Can't get on board with the positive reviews
","First, I'll agree that the filmmakers got a lot of details right: The timing of the U.S. attacks when the Japanese were caught in the rearming process. The poor performance of the Devastator TBD. Faulty torpedoes. The politics of the Japanese military. The fast turn-around getting Yorktown out to sea again. And lots more.<br/><br/>But the errors, embellishments and omissions were glaring: The Marshal Islands attack was ridiculously inflated. The Kamikaze hit on Enterprise during that battle (complete with Nick Jonas saving the day) never took place. The complete absence of American fighter planes on the American carriers. American attackers going in and facing anti aircraft fire without having first been jumped by Zeroes, and the missing dogfights via F4F fighter escorts. SBDs blowing Zeros out of the sky. Taking the time to depict John Ford as a brave movie maker on Midway, yet not showing Marine Fighter Squadron 221, flying antiquated equipment, going out to meet the incoming Japanese attackers against overwhelming odds and pretty much getting slaughtered. Yorktown's involvement in the battle reduced to one scene where she is burning, depicted from afar. The Nautilus getting depth-charged U-571 style. The ships in both fleets in such tight formations, it's more like a photo op than a battle formation.<br/><br/>So many worthwhile details that could have been made right in the same screening length, if they would have simply ditched the goofy Doolittle sequence. I love Aaron Eckhart, great actor, but his scenes in China had no place in a movie called ""Midway,"" if the price was cutting out major elements of the Midway battle.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being picky, but when they go out of their way to glorify John Ford, while leaving out a squadron of Marine fighter pilots that sacrificed themselves so valiantly, it just strikes me as typical Hollywood b.s."
"rhease","10","257","374","9 November 2019"," GREAT WATCH!!!!!
","I am a veteran and this was a hit. The special effects were good and I don't understand why people were saying it was too much. The characters were evenly played out in the movie and there was no stupid romance part that was in the last Pearl Harbor movie. It told the story amazingly and it dived right into what it's all about. You don't need too much character development to tell a story of four people during that time. It was such a great watch and I Definatley recommend it. It ranks up there as we were soldiers! It's been a long time a good war movie came out and this was it. And when you see other reviews about it's a disgrace to veterans don't listen to those reviews. Obviously they haven't been through tough times such as how these people lived. I was in live fire so I can compare. Enjoy the movie is amazing!"
"sme3","5","205","296","27 November 2019"," Unbelievable
","Abundant, not-quite-realistic computer-generated images make Midway look more like a video game than a depiction of real-life events. The overuse of subpar effects is the most dominant - but hardly the only - problem dogging this film. Epic war stories are difficult to tell without focusing on a few characters. This film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads and too many characters to keep an emotional anchor to the simulated events unfolding. Woody Harrelson is outstanding, but other cast members cannot overcome the limitations of the material and the challenges of acting on computer-generated sets."
"atomsmasher3","10","241","353","9 November 2019"," Excellent Movie and Historically Accurate
","This is an excellent historical portrayal of the Battle of Midway, and some of the events that led up to it. There is a lot of intensity throughout the film, and it shows how some of the decisions on both sides were truly a gamble in that time. There were no satellites, gps systems, or sophisticated radar systems. The only missing pieces to this movie, as noted by others, is the lack of US fighter planes. Maybe it is intended to focus mainly on the Dauntless pilots.
I took my wife and kids to see this movie, as it seems much of the history of this country is being forgotten. I am so glad I did. The kids had no idea that any of this happened.
As for the critics that wrote negative reviews and trashed this movie, I think attributes to a lot of what is wrong with this country today. People who decided not to see this movie, on Veterans Day weekend, based on the critics reviews, are truly missing an excellent movie.
This movie is historically accurate, with no lame love story, or fictional substories."
"xhalonick","8","168","245","9 November 2019"," More than you'd expect
","Critics are trashing this film, I went into it skeptical. After, I'm not so sure why. They tell a simplified story of the events leading up to, and eventually the battle of midway. You get to see two sides of life, the Japanese and the American forces. The script is fine, acting is pretty good in my opinion as well (shout out to Dennis Quaid, he is a great salty kinda guy). CGI was not that bad, especially for fast paced scenes. Only complaint is it is a bit long, which I understand due to how much they wanted to include. But there were 2-3 times I thought it might end, but there were still a few minutes left. In the end, a solid war movie that, in my opinion, does a great job showing some brutality of war, in addition to brothership and slice of life of the time. A solid film to honor the brave men and women that died for a better future."
"mcsterg","9","123","198","12 November 2019"," ABSOLUTELY SEE IT
","I've read several of the critical reviews of ""Midway""; they seem to reveal more about the cattiness of the reviewer than any understanding of the movie, or its message.
I am part of the growing legion of American moviegoers who have pretty much given up on Hollywierd having any clue how to convince me to actually care enough about any of their offerings to part with the price of admission. I can wait a few months till they show up free on Youtube to confirm my suspicions that I haven't wasted my money.
I made the rare exception this weekend to see ""Midway"", because I'm a history buff, and the previews I'd seen showed promise that the story would be properly told. That said, I went in with the full expectation that it might fail my already low expectations.
Happy to say that it far exceeded my best hopes. Roland Emmerich has put together a gripping storyline that manages to get in all the important elements of an epic story in 128 minutes. For the story of the American victory at Midway is an epic tale that every American should become familiar with.
Few Americans today can fathom what dire straits the US found itself in in 1942: Our battleships lay in twisted ruins on the bottom of Pearl Harbor; we had four aircraft carriers facing a Japanese navy with twelve, equipped with aircraft which were far superior to anything that was then available to American fliers; those aircraft were piloted by experienced men who had honed their craft in four years of war in China. We helplessly watched as thousands of American soldiers, sailors and Marines in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines were made captive, beyond the reach of our aid.
All the Japanese had to do was to concentrate on Midway, overwhelm our inferior naval and air forces, and Hawaii and the West Coast would be wholly at their mercy.
The essayist Matthew Arnold once said, ""Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is all anyone needs to know about style."" Emmerich follows his advice. No actors involved in ""Midway"" will be nominated for an Oscar. Which is another way of saying that there are no star turns which detract from telling the story. I will say that the actors are very believable in their roles; as the son of a Marine who fought in the Pacific, I found their portrayals pretty convincing.
I'm firmly of the opinion that CGI effects are overused to distract from thin or non-existent plotlines. I credit Emmerich for using them to reinforce an already strong narrative. To those critics who found them overpowering, I inquire: How in hell do you think the shock of modern warfare registered on the men who actually faced it at Pearl Harbor and Midway? They called it ""shell shock"" for a damned good reason."
"ymyuseda","4","305","514","13 November 2019"," With Great Expectations Comes Disappointment
","Rating 4.0/10
I had high hopes for ""midway"" war between America and Japan, unfortunetly this movie goes to war of the bored. With the epic status that this movie was advertised with, it was a supreme disappointment. You will willingly sit through this movie but when it's over you'll feel like you wasted two hours. The action and special effect was okay. But the movie is somewhat claustrophobic. The acting was okay even if at times the script seemed daunted. In the end, If i had to describe midway in one word it would be disappointing."
"jrougeux-71286","6","93","148","17 November 2019"," Just an OK movie
","Overdone special effects. The story was historically accurate but the plot was pretty boring. Maybe they tried to cover too much time in one movie. The 1976 Midway was much better"
"jimschultze","6","59","91","10 November 2019"," Both good and disappointing - depends on the target audience
","As someone very knowledgeable about the subject, I was somewhat disappointed. Whether it was the wrinkled uniforms, the painful dialogue, the over-the-top dramatics and exaggerated explosions (hey, it's Emmerich!)... it was clear the film was not made for people like me who know the details and the characters very well.<br/><br/>The rating depends greatly on the target audience. It's clear this film was made for a younger audience, and as such, it does a very good job of conveying the history quite accurately. It's a lot to take on with a 2:20 movie (complete with a 6-month summary of events leading up to the title battle) and it does a fine job of that.<br/><br/>Correct history of this great nation tragically just isn't taught anymore, so I heartily applaud any effort to do so. I just wonder if younger audiences have any desire to learn it. So if I'm rating from that perspective, it jumps up a few points.<br/><br/>I just wish a little more care with the details and script had been taken to leave the older audience satisfied from our knowledge level."
"bartdereu","5","98","158","4 January 2020"," Too much bad CGI
","All i can say is this : it's typical when an american history story is put into a movie it gets descent scores. This movie is not bad, but the quality of the CGI for a 2019 movie is just not good enough."
"kenneth-chang-usa","10","123","202","10 November 2019"," what a great solid movie
","Agree with other reviewer, this is the best war movie in a long time, it went through three historical events, attack on pearl harbor, doolittle Tokyo air raid and battle of midway linked together with a human story of a dive bomber pilot, and what a great history/story telling it was.
The beginning of the massive Enterprise aircraft carrier, shaking the theater with the Dolby sound has the feel of Star War IV Battle cruiser opening scene, and a tight story line and pace ensues. The CGI is the best, you don't see AT-6 Texan painted as Zero fighters, you don't see modern warships disguised as battle-hardened WW2 ones,from this point forward I predict we will see more movies with period-correct war machines. The movie has moments that make you sigh (dud torpedo that hit but didn't explode, bombs missed after pilot braved through clouds of flaks) and cheer (bulls-eyed on the giant Sun on the deck, and chain explosion of the littered ammos because of tactic confusions), this is Hollywood at its best in rare moments, no over lingering love story, no cliche stereotyped GIs, what you have are characters in a war trying to survive, trying to outsmart the other side, and trying but dying ... you can read about those three events before or after the movie, but for me, I enjoyed a great movie, finished till the credit ends and walked out feeling great, grateful and blessed as an American."
"mxt-thomas-966-541497","3","125","209","11 November 2019"," Entertaining for 9 year olds... dull for the rest of us
","So my boys (9) liked it... especially the action sequences. I on the other hand didn't. Some good stars but all lacking any sense of believable performance, with a script that lacked narrative, coherence or direction just lots of cliches and other words. Given the Historic event and the heroism associated with it, just how Emmerich managed to produce something so uninspiring and lifeless is beyond me. The back and forth between the front and the home is laughable. Cardboard cut out Japanese characters and superficial un-engaging American heroes were boring, the action sequences overblown and exaggerated up-to and including planes flying through wave tips and the wreckage of other planes only to emerge unscathed, combined to stretch credibility to beyond breaking point. 2hrs and 18 mins of my life that I will never get back."
"azanti0029","8","82","134","8 November 2019"," A commendable effort but needs a longer directors cut - RELEASE IT PLEASE
","Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.<br/><br/>What MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.<br/><br/>Before I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.<br/><br/>That said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>Credit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)<br/><br/>Director Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level."
"shnames87","3","102","170","26 December 2019"," Just don't bother
","Oof this movie had a lot of potential and was a bigger disappointment than I was expecting. It had so much going for it too that it should have been much better than it ended up being.<br/><br/>The movie had its good points along with its draw backs though. The cast of this film was outstanding and I was pleasantly surprised every time a new big name actor popped up on screen, I was really not expecting that. But even with all that star power the movie fell short, the overwhelming cast is really the only big positive for this film and the general historical story that it told.<br/><br/>The movie does cover much much more than just the battle of Midway and jumps around quite a bit. That wasn't bad necessarily but it left you trying to follow lots of major events that happened during World War 2. This could be perfectly fine if done a little better but over all was not the end of the world.<br/><br/>The two biggest things that were the downfall of this movie were the main character and the general look of the film. Ed Skrein is absolutely abysmal in this movie, his acting was bad, the depiction of a historical figure was terrible and the fake accent he was trying to do was just grating in all regards. He was such a bad choice for this film and brought down the stellar performances of all the much more seasoned and proven actors who were in this.<br/><br/>The movie is almost all done CGI which was to be expected after all but it looks so cartoonish and bad. The entire time I was watching it I was wondering how this new film could make this all look so bad when it had been done in the past and looked so much better. The best example would be Pearl Harbor from 2001. That film used CGI as well but it looked so much better. I wish who ever had been in charge of visuals for that movie had done this one too. It took you out of the epic events that they were showing.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for a good World War 2 movie look else where.

","The events of December 7th 1941 left an indelible mark on the psyche of America and became a date that truly has lived in infamy. Though historians, authors, and filmmakers have attempted to analyze the events during and leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor; there is still a great deal of interest about the attack and the aftermath.<br/><br/>While Pearl Harbor was for many the opening shots of the U.S. entry into World War II; some would say that the stage was set earlier when the United States attempted to curtail what they saw as an aggressive and Imperialistic Japan by placing restrictions on their vital resources such as oil and the tonnage of their Navy.<br/><br/>In the new film ""Midway"" we are given a glimpse into this when four years before the attack, when Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) who lets him know that hardline factions in his government have been buoyed by their invasion of China and will do what is needed to make sure the vital oil that is supplied by the U.S. remains constant.
Flash forward to the day of the attack and Layton who has warned that an attack was possible at Pearl Harbor is seeing his worst predictions come true. In the aftermath he is assigned to Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson); who has been given the thankless task of taking charge of what is left of the Pacific Fleet and finding a way to stop the Japanese fleet.<br/><br/>The U.S. finds themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and waging war with ships and planes that are inferior to the Japanese but they must find a way to overcome the great obstacles before them and defeat a relentless enemy.
Layton and a team of code breakers are convinced the Japanese intend to attack the island of Midway and go all in to set a trap with the goal of destroying the enemy carriers so the U.S. can gain an aerial advantage in the Pacific.<br/><br/>With a strong cast which features Luke Evans, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas and a fine supporting cast, Director Roland Emmerich has given audiences a gripping war movie that despite the impressive visual effects; never loses site of the fact that this is a story of real people who found themselves in pivotal moments of history.<br/><br/>The film also shows how the Japanese commanders had differing views of the Americans they fought. Some considered them to lack braveness while others admired their tenacity and were grateful that they had what they saw as inferior and outdated planes to attack them in.<br/><br/>The film also does a great job showing the Doolittle Raid and how what from a military standpoint caused minor damage yet was a huge psychological boost as Japan believed they were immune from attack yet the American forces found a way to bomb Tokyo by the impossible task of using land based bombers off a carrier.<br/><br/>The film is a great mix of human drama that shows not only the terrible toll of war but how a group of extraordinary individuals gave their all.<br/><br/>4.5 stars out of 5"

","When I first saw the previews of this movie, I feared another ridiculous and distorted movie like the 2001 movie, Pearl Harbor. I was relieved it was not. It is amazing how many specific details of the early days of the Pacific War are crammed into this movie. So many that only those already familiar with the battles will be able to spot them all.<br/><br/>Although I am a former Naval Aviator, kudos to the writers to giving the Marine Aviators and Army Air Corps their due credit in the battle of Midway, something the 1976 movie neglected. Only one minor disappointment in that the sacrifice of the three American Torpedo Bombing squadrons was underplayed.<br/><br/>I suspect those not familiar with history will not be able to keep up with all the details portrayed, but outstanding job by Roland Emmerich for even trying.<br/><br/>PS. To the dude below about the glaring historical accuracy, you are correct. Midway was reinforced with a detachment of B-26 bombers armed with torpedoes. One of the did make a suicide run at IJN Akagi, which prompted Admiral Nagumo to prepare for a second air attack on Midway Island, only to reverse his decision when one of his cruiser's scout plane's spotted one of the American task forces, all of which contributed to ordnance to be stacked all over the Akagi's hanger bay when LT Richard Best's single bomb detonated inside the Akagi, causing an inferno that doomed the ship."

","Finally there is a WW2 movie with the right balance of modern effects and good storytelling. I've always preferred the straightforward stories in Tora Tora Tora and A Bridge Too Far over the newer gory angst filled war movies and those which deal with obscure insignificant incidents. Unlike Bay's Pearl Harbor or the older Midway movie there is no wasted time on silly romances. Also the dragginess of Eastwood and the gore of Spielberg are not present here.<br/><br/>The screenplay is clear and comprehensive from pre Pearl Harbor to the decisive day everything is clearly explained. Doolittle deserves mention. Good history lesson for some folks nowadays who seem to forget which country was defending themselves against those who waged aggressive wars! Slower moments are not dull as they are used to explain strategy, training and the role of intelligence.<br/><br/>The air battle scenes and dive bombing scenes are thrilling yet clear. You can still see who is who. You are really put right into the center of things. Superb exciting cinematography without looking fake or too CGI.<br/><br/>The casting is brilliant. Using distinctive famous actors to portray the various heroes helps the viewer remember who is who and build up sympathy for whether they make it or not. Ed Skrein usually the anti hero type role. Here he plays the cocky pilot and his eventual vulnerability is touching. Luke Evans is convincing as another hero pilot. Patrick Wilson is perfect as the intelligence officer who helped get it right. The older actors like Denis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart are well cast too and Woody usually a goofball is fine. Actors usually don't associate with historic roles like Darren Criss and Jonas are surprisingly right. Mandy Moore looks pretty and suitable in her WW2 getup. Should do more roles from this period. The Japanese naval officers are distinctive enough to differentiate.<br/><br/>A truly international effort it took a German director, Chinese producers, an American writer and great British and American cast to make the best WW2 movie in decades."

","I had high expectations for this movie, and they were absolutely MET and EXCEEDED.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""Midway"" is the best and most historically-accurate WWII movie of recent memory, and it's one of the few that actually highlights the air war in the Pacific. The writers seemed to recognize that simply recreating this momentous series of events was an amazing story in-and-of itself, without wasting time on unnecessary drama and distractions.<br/><br/>You can tell that the writers, producers and actors all paid close attention to maintaining historical accuracy throughout the film. From Pearl Harbor to Midway, they captured many of the key interesting and critical moments along the way. They also showed both the American and Japanese perspectives in an insightful and respectful manner, which only adds to the complexity of the story.<br/><br/>Also, the action scenes will have anyone (history lover or not!) on the edge of their seats the whole time!

"oaktownvic","10","84","148","9 November 2019"," Don't believe the negative reviews!
","The most impressive aspect of the film is the amazing cinematography and special effects (including sound) which surpass by a wide margin anything previously attained regarding era warships and naval aviation. You MUST see this in a Dolby equipped theater to get the full body rocking audio and visual experience. Don't settle for a normal theater.<br/><br/>Without question, this is the best movie ever made about the crucial WW2 Battle of Midway which (closely following the American tactical defeat-strategic victory at the Battle of the Coral Sea) forever changed the course of the Pacific War. In fact it is the best movie about World War 2 naval and aviation warfare ever made in terms of visual and audio presentation and historical accuracy.<br/><br/>As a serious albeit amateur historian, I can only offer kudos to the film's fidelity to the facts of the events as they unfolded. Yes, there is truncation of history necessary for translating these sorts of events to film. But the film's creators somehow manage to get right at least 80% of things involved in a very complicated sequence of battle events in a bit over two hours of action packed mind-blowing movie-magic.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the film's steadfast adherence to the facts and actual events and its presentation of the tools of warfare. I might quibble with certain depictions of people and actions, but in the main they get it right. My fears that this might be another abortion like Disney's ""Pearl Harbor"" or star laden inaccurate version like the 1976 ""Midway"" were blown away by the fidelity of this effort. The special effects used to show the ships and planes in action are nothing short of marvelous. Bravo!<br/><br/>The weakest aspect of the film are the handful of dramatic interludes of worried loved ones and troubled commanders and portrayals of some of the individuals involved, but even these are tolerable. I should also say that the film doesn't show as much gore as what really happens in combat so it doesn't have the accurate stomach turning scenes as present in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I didn't mind that.<br/><br/>What drives this film are the action battle sequences showing the destructiveness of the tools of war at the time. They'll knock your socks off! The brief but breath-taking reenactment of the Pearl Harbor attack starts the film off on its roller coaster ride with sequences of ships and planes and people being blasted to smithereens from both the perspective of the fish in the barrel and the folks shooting at them. You see these events on both the micro and macro level. Thankfully, the movie doesn't treat the Japanese as mindless monkeys as so many World War 2 films do and it presents their dilemmas and derring-do quite fairly.<br/><br/>The visual depiction of the planes, warships and weapons of the era appear to have been thoroughly researched and are presented more accurately, beautifully and forcefully than any other film about World War 2.<br/><br/>But it's the action sequences that will have your eyes glued onto the screen and your ears begging for relief (in a good way) and thanking the folks from Dolby. I think many folks will enjoy this picture, especially history buffs.<br/><br/>Don't believe the negative reviews from the professional reviewers. They're looking for auteur, drama, dialogue and art rather than history, audio-visual dynamism... and your own thrilling experience in the theater."
"mhorg2018","8","61","105","8 November 2019"," Good movie with a few glaring errors.
","First, the cast was great, especially Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz. The Battle scenes and the movie itself, were far superior to the 76 version, and they left out the lame love story. The two biggest errors were: Wade McCluskey loses his bomb due to an electrical arming error in his dauntless (he was also a dauntless pilot, but they did Hollywood it up a bit), and they never once showed an American fighter, which is a glaring omission. The F4F Wildcat was the fleet fighter at the time. Both it and the horrible Brewster Buffalo (flying from Midway) should have been present. The torpedo hitting a Japanese ship and failing was totally true, in fact, one broke up and floated, enabling Japanese sailors to use it to be rescued. This was thanks to the penny pinching of the US government before the war. Some authors I'll suggest are, Prange, Lord and Symonds if anyone wants to know more."
"keikoyoshikawa","1","80","141","9 November 2019"," Appallingly Bad
","If you want to see good war movies, watch 1977 ""A Bridge Too Far"" and 1969 ""Battle of Britain."" By contrast, this movie is simply rubbish. Also poor choice of writer and director.<br/><br/>""A Bridge Too Far"" had way better explanation of the overall situation through skillful use of exposition within the first half hour, and they did it with very good acting and dialogues that expertly differentiated all the major players. ""Midway"" by comparison is like having a kindergartner write the script and a manic preteen direct the movie.<br/><br/>The aerial combat scenes in ""Battle of Britain"" are probably the best ever done on screen. And they did not have any CGI. The big air battle towards the end of that movie had more tension and realism that put all the fake and unrealistic plane scenes in ""Midway"" to cartoonish shame. Heck, even the ensemble cast of pilots in BoB were more interesting and memorable.<br/><br/>Both ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Battle of Britain"" cost about the same as ""Midway"" in today's dollars. Both also had an ensemble cast of well-known and very good actors. Sadly, ""Midway"" seems to have wasted all of its money on really bad-looking CGIs and also failed to have the same quality of actors as in 1969 or 1977. Probably all the good actors read the script and immediately saw how dumb it was.<br/><br/>A quick note about how this 2019 version compares with the 1976 movie: Both are equally bad. A few examples: A complete disregard for the order of battle, which was of critical importance in the actual battle. The several air attacks from Midway Island were never shown. This is a deep disrespect for the men who died in these crucial assaults that made possible the final outcome. Also, the older version used historically inaccurate footage, while the newer version had inexcusable inaccurate CGI version of aircraft and ordnance.<br/><br/>If you enjoy history and in particular WW2 history, then skip this dumb movie."

""Midway"" while not perfect, did not fall into the same trap. Overall, the film focuses on the battles from the attack on Pearl Harbor through Midway.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are the battle scenes, which in the end save the movie. The special effects are very good, although some are over the top, like the laser-like machine gun fire and powerful some over the top explosions.<br/><br/>The film would have been better without the omnipresent loud background music that over powered the dialog. The acting was decent, but the scenes switched rapidly from one to the next, so few individual scenes lasted more than a couple of minutes. This lead to little character development. War movie cliches in the dialog were frequent.<br/><br/>The film would have been better had it focused solely on the Battle of Midway- the intelligence effort to discover the Japanese attack plans, the preparations for the defense of Midway, the deployment of the U.S. naval forces, the actual battle.<br/><br/>In the end it was decent entertainment; saved by the battle scenes. Not a war movie at the level of quality as ""Dunkirk"", but not as disappointing as ""Pearl Harbor""."

","One of the few blockbuster war movies to give credit to the oft-maligned intelligence component of World War II, and yes I've read Layton's salty 1985 memoirs. If you like remarkably realistic battle scenes, this movie is for you. As an intelligence professional, I loved the scenes in ICPOA (Intelligence Center Pacific Ocean Area) although for the life of me I still don't completely understand the difference in Layton's role as Nimitz's intelligence chief and Joe Rochford's role as chief of Nimitz's intelligence center. I didn't know he wandered around in a bathrobe but I did know he got screwed by jealous Washington rivals and shipped off to command a drydock on the West Coast. Given that he and Layton were among the fifty (!!) Japanese linguists the Navy had, a shameful waste on many levels. And guess who replaced Rochford? One Commander Roscoe Hillenkoetter, surviving EXO of West Virginia who as naval attache in Paris in 1940 had watched the Germans march in to Paris. After the war, and a stint as captain of USS Missouri, he was appointed by Harry Truman as the first director of the CIA.<br/><br/>This movie is like the world's greatest Trivial Pursuit for historians. look, there's CNO Admiral King giving Nimitz the bad news about his next assignment; look: John Ford with his signature round sunglasses madly filming the attack on Midway. Oh, no, that torpedo bounced off the hull of the Japanese warship: wait til the same thing happens at Midway and the torpedo squadron goes down in flames. And having seen MANY photos of Admiral Nimitz, a shout-out to Woody Harrelson, who looked and sounded just like a good ol' Texas boy."

Anyone who was unaware of the events of the title battle and Pearl Harbor would have no more idea of what actually happened after seeing the film than he or she had before watching it.

What an insult this movie is to the brave sailors and avaiators who fought and won this pivotal battle, which is the single most important one in the entire history of the U. S. Navy. Some have compared it favorably to the 1976 film with Fonda, Ford, Heston, Holbrook, Mitchum, et al; that is beyond absurd.

It seems to be only a version stemming from a book written by the lead code-breaker in an attempt to beat his own drum ... Attempts to decry its better than Pearly Harbor is lost due to the horrible movie PH was ... It places its main heroics on the Edwin Layton (intelligence) and Dick Best (bomber pilot) instead of the more historically accurate focus on John Waldron (squad commander not portrayed in the movie) who's instincts actually led to the discovery of the Japanese fleet ... The portrayal of pilot Wade McClusky correctly showed his discovery of a solo Japanese destroyer which he followed to eventually catch up with the fleet ... The movie also did a terrible job of setting up the strategic battle plans both from the American and the Japanese points of view ... It failed to emphasize two major elements of the battle - 1) After Pearl Harbor, the Japanese thought it had damaged all the US carriers, 2) Admiral Nagumo's hesitating twice when preparing his carrier's planes first to be configured for an air attack, then changing for a land attack, only to change back for the air - which lost all time to counterattack the US - which destroyed not only his carrier but the majority of the Japanese fleet ... Lastly, while including Doolittle's Raiders, it did an inadequate job of reflecting on their heroics of bombing Tokyo knowing they didn't have enough fuel to return to any carrier or American base but left to crash into the ocean hoping to be picked up ... While this was not definitively part of the battle of Midway it contributed to the Japanese defensives and air support being incapable of proving what it needed for Midway."
"skunkworksalpha","10","69","123","8 November 2019"," Excellent Movie a must see for WWII aficionados
","Midway was an excellent movie that depicts the events leading up to the battle of Midway and the battle itself.
It is fairly quick paced with enough historical background character introductions to leave the viewer invested, even if we already know the outcome. The family and buddy scenes are not lengthy, and add just the right amount of the human element.
The movie covers the events from before Pearl Harbor, the attack on pearl Harbor, the US raid on the Marianas islands, Doolittle's raid, the battle of Coral Sea, the battle of Midway and the intelligence, strategy, of both the US and IJN navies. Though none of the events is overly detailed it is enough for the average historian to see all the ""easter eggs"" and the non-historian left informed and intrested.
While the movie covers a lot of historical ground it doesn't get overly detailed on each event, even the Midway battle itself. What it does do is provides the viewer the overall tension, concerns and apprehensions of the mood of he US durring this time in history.
Midway does leave out certain historical events. It didn't cover the PBYs search, the B-17 raids on the IJN carriers, it didn't include Jimmy Thatch, or the two attacks on the Yorktown in detail.
But, and I must stress this fact, what it did cover was accurate (with the exception of the US torpedo planes carrying bombs on wing hard mounts).
For the first time in a movie it covers the air raids on the IJN carriers from Midway itself, including thr B-26 Marauders, but not the TBF avengers. It included the Nautilus Gato class firing on the IJN taskforce and the reason the Japanese left behind the destroyer which was later followed by the US SBDs that led them to the IJN carries.
The CGI was adequate for visual effects, and the detail of the Yorktown class carriers and even the IJN carriers was incredibly accurate.
Midway focuses on several key individuals to be the protagonist rather than a PBS style docudrama.
Midway also pays attention to detail about the age of the sailors, the types of aircraft, and weaponry aboard ships.
Midway does feel like it needs the director's cut and would do better as a three hour movie as it felt a little rushed at times.
Bottom line, if you're into WWII and history you'll like this move, it's a go see."

"olihist","8","23","40","9 November 2019"," Thankfully, not the sequel to Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor""
","Out of all the battles of World War II that have been portrayed on the big - and small - screen, the Battle of Midway has been the among the most difficult to adapt. The battle itself consisted of a complex series of events spread out over hundreds of miles of ocean and spanning a period of several days. There are the technical challenges of depicting naval and aerial combat. And there was also a considerable amount of prologue leading up to the Battle of Midway involving episodes occurring around the Asia-Pacific theater.<br/><br/>Any attempt to depict the Battle of Midway in a film setting is therefore going to face all of these challenges, and more. But all in all, Director Roland Emmerich does a fair job in balancing the history with dramatic interpretation.<br/><br/>
The strongest parts of this film were the battle sequences, particularly those involving the actual battle of Midway. It's interesting that Emmerich chose to focus more specifically on the USS Enterprise and particularly on the dive bombers of ""Bombing 6,"" and I think that this approach actually worked well. Unlike the 1976 version, some of the actual pilots of Bombing 6 (particularly Richard ""Dick"" Best and Wade McClusky) are portrayed extensively - and for the most part sensitively - in this version.<br/><br/>The Japanese perspective is also largely portrayed respectfully in this film. One particularly moving scene involved the scuttling of the Hiryu and Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's decision to go down with his flagship.<br/><br/>All of this being said, this version of the Midway Battle suffers from a number of issues. In particular, the movie drags at the beginning and then feels rushed at the end. I'm not sure if this movie really needed to depict Pearl Harbor, the Marshall Islands raid, and the Doolittle Raid in the detail that it did. And some of the actual Battle scenes felt rushed, with important details omitted (e.g. the contributions of the PBY Catalina search planes, which get a lot more mention in the 1976 version than this one).<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the acting in this movie was good, although you can tell the actors who were really settling into their characters from the ones ""phoning it in.""<br/><br/>In terms of historical accuracy, I did not detect any glaring errors or omissions. I could tell that certain episodes received special mention (perhaps due to the producers involved in this film). The Marshall Islands are not ""high"" islands like Tahiti or Hawai'i but low lying coral atolls like Midway. And as mentioned previously, certain scenes from the actual Battle of Midway were omitted or felt rushed.<br/><br/>
But overall, I enjoyed this film version of the Battle of Midway. To some degree, this version is more historically accurate than the 1976 version. There was quite a bit of CGI, but that's to be expected from a war film covering such an epic battle (and CGI is better than recycled war movie footage). And thankfully, this is not the ""sequel"" to Pearl Harbor that I was afraid this movie would be. If anything, this is the way they should've made Pearl Harbor, with all the romantic triangle story baloney minimized or thrown out.<br/><br/>
A Solid 8/10 (especially for the actual battle scenes)"

","I guess Dennis Quaid, seeing his future as just an esurrance spokesman wanted to go out and prove he could be part of a movie worse than Jaws 3. I went in with expectations so low, I figured I'd have to be pleasantly surprised, but with acting worse than Daytime Soaps, ludicrous action scenes, and annoying a-hole characters, I was actually happy when the Japanese killed them, which I didn't think could ever be possible. This movie is a cliff note version of early WWII naval action made for video gamers with Attention Deficit Disorder with too many faults to mention. Terrible movie from the opening flight scene to the last cornball line. The only reason I didn't walk out of my empty theater, is that I wanted to see if the next scene could possibly be worse, and here, the director didn't fail. Crap building on crap that Hercules couldn't shovel. Purely an absolute waste of time. A complete joke."

","I'm not sure what others believe constitute a good movie but this is far from it. The opening credits highlighted the Chinese producers/influences of this film and makes sense as the movie trudges along. The overall story-telling and lineage of the movie are very disjointed and fractured. It feels like they were trying to recreate the magic of Dunkirk but didn't have a clue how to implement that strategy. There are also scenes that have no place in the movie or add zero value,if anything they create more confusion as to what this movie is really about.
Moving on from the choppy story-telling, the character's are super one-dimensional and are in now way representative of members in the military. The lead character is your basic cowboy/maverick embodied in how others may view us or our military members. The only thing that saves the horrible character development is Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Nimitz.
One shining light in this whole mess of a film is the action scenes. If there is one thing they got right, it was this. We like our intense explosions and in-your-face camera shots as they zoom across the screen but this is even watered down by the cheap feel of the CGI.
See at your own risk and be sure to know the history of the Pacific campaign in WWII before seeing this movie!"

The flimsiness of the aircraft, and of the ships for that matter, are conveyed effectively. You do get a sense of the mortality of sailors from both sides and a little of the dignity of the proceedings too. Ed Skrein does come across as a bit of a gung-ho hero, but without the puerile ""Ye Ha!"" type of nonsense that we see more commonly now in almost every movie which centres around the achievements of the US military. Perhaps because it is based on real people and events, it is a more respectful tribute to their accomplishments. Needs a big screen - will look dreadfully man-made on telly."
"promontorypoints","8","9","14","9 November 2019"," Great tribute to WWII story
","I think an interesting aspect of this historical event (Midway) is how we (US) were the underdogs, not only because of the losses at Pearl Harbor, but because the war machine wasn't in great shape. It's just one small part of the War and one perspective (a Hollywood one), but it does do the job of letting viewers feel more and reflect more on those events, and pause to consider great men and how fortunate our country is. I remember watching the old version as a child and feeling awe. This new version left me with that feeling and more, green screen action and misplaced cinematic music notwithstanding."
"justinjsalmon","3","12","20","12 November 2019"," On a par with Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor
","I'm genuinely shocked at all the 10/10 reviews here - we must have seen different films, as I found Midway a bit of a mixed bag to say the least! It's in a very similar league to Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. Amazing action sequences of planes attacking ships (reminiscent of Star Wars space battles - a credit to George Lucas for setting the standard), but the rest of it is pretty duff - I guess I shouldn't have expected too much more from action director Roland Emmerich.<br/><br/>A lot of the time, it felt like I was watching a Commando-style comic book (""Take that, boche!""). All the characters were muscular and had prominent chiselled chins. The script was pretty awful. One of the main characters was called Dick Best (at the end it was revealed he was real), a gum-chewing maverick pilot, and so there were lines like, ""It's because of men like Dick Best that we'll win this war!"", or ""Goddammit Dick Best!!"" As well as a comic book feel, it came across as a propaganda war film. It was unbelievably full of cliche; I think the worst might have been when Dick Best flew his dive bomber the length of the Japanese carrier just above the deck to drop his bomb right through the very centre of the red sun painted on the deck, while snarling ""This one's for Pearl Harbor!"" One of the consequences of this cliche was that it made it hard to care about any of the characters. There was only one line I enjoyed: Woody Harrelson saying something about a man in fuzzy slippers leading a bunch of tuba players to crack the Japanese codes.<br/><br/>It followed a potted history of the war in the Pacific from Pearl Harbor, through the Doolittle raid (including a sequence where Doolittle is in China), Coral Sea, and then to a longer sequence about the Battle of Midway, all in 2hrs 20 mins, so quite a pace of events. I don't understand why a film called ""Midway"" needed to cram all this in.<br/><br/>Lots of things irked me. For instance, during the Pearl Harbor attack, I couldn't understand why the Japanese fighters kept strafing perfectly between the US battleships, instead of strafing the actual ships. Or, after Doolittle bails out in China, he hooked up with some Chinese guerrillas, and as they leave a village it is subjected to a raid by Japanese bombers. ""But there's no installations here!!"" cries out Doolittle in melodramatic anguish, and one of the Chinese peasants replies to him in English something like ""They're not bombing installations, they're bombing the people!"" Yet 10 mins earlier we watched Doolittle flying over densely populated Tokyo merrily dropping bombs everywhere.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the Japanese was pretty poor. It was interesting that an attempt was made to show the Japanese side, but it was half-hearted and entirely served the purposes of exposition. Whenever we switched to a Japanese scene, the soundtrack helpfully signalled it with Japanese traditional music (no reciprocal traditional American music for the American scenes). There are no named Japanese characters apart from the Japanese admirals making their fateful decisions, though there are some hapless sailors saying things like ""This place is a tinderbox"" as they reload planes.<br/><br/>Worth seeing for the drama of aircraft diving through flak to bomb ships (and bringing to mind what must have been the incredible bravery of the aircrew), but the rest of the drama is pretty terrible. On reflection, it's actually almost indistinguishable from Pearl Harbor."

The end result is still a rousing drama despite knowing the forgone conclusions. The only things that detracted me were the little jabs against the Japanese demanded by the Chinese producers of the movie, so transparently added to the story line to further the real grievances the Chinese people still have against Japanese aggression. But really, the war is long over and those guilty of atrocities are long dead or surely will be."

","First I'd like to start out saying I am the type of person that can spend all day in a WW2 museum and feel like I need to go back the next day, so my review is from someone who knew almost everything about the Battle of Midway going in.<br/><br/>Midway is an authentic and historically accurate WW2 movie that opted to follow characters based on real life sailors and aviators instead of creating fictional ones. The movie gets off to a good start before dragging in the middle. There are a few too many characters and it jumps around a lot for the casual viewer to keep up with but history buffs like myself won't have as difficult of a time with it.<br/><br/>However, once we get to the actual Battle of Midway the movie really picks up and is a thrill the rest of the way. The action sequences are very well done and the heroism of both sides is adequately depicted without going over the top.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say this is a must see in theaters for someone that has a passion for history. For the more casual viewer it is an entertaining movie with some flaws regarding pacing and a few too many characters to keep up with. Because of the attention to detail and respect for history I'm giving this movie a 9/10. I will absolutely be watching this again in the near future."

","I was not expecting much from ""Midway"". As soon as I watched the trailer I already knew that this was going to be a bad movie, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is awful on every aspect: impossible explosions, unrealistic airplanes monoeuvres and incredibly bad action in general. Some green screen scenes are terrible. From an Hollywood movie you are expecting more, considering the budget. After 20 years Pearl Harbour has better effects and cinematography and still today remains one of the best and solid movie about that period. This movie reminded me the Fast and Furious saga, that I always avoid.<br/><br/>Cast was good and overall the acting part is solid. No surprises here, there were a lot of well known actors, so at least characters are credible and entertaining. If you exclude fights battle (that are the 80% of the movie), the remaining 20% is well conceived: the movie is extremely balanced as shows the perspective of both americans and japanes, deepening some aspects that other movies such as Pearl Harbour or the original 1976 Midway, did not take in consideration, because too political and on the side of Uncle Sam.<br/><br/>I was not expecting a masterpiece, but neither this garbage.

","This is an excellent film with an accurate portrayal of historic events. I had misgivings about it when I had heard the director of Independence Day would be doing it but he actually did a great job at staying true to history while making it entertaining. He didn't simply focus on the heroism of our American soldiers but also covered other aspects that contributed to our success such as code-breaking, strategy and sheer luck. He crammed a lot into a 2 hour film. Many historical names, places and events were mentioned in passing and if you're not familiar with this battle you might miss them. But no matter, you'll still get the gist of this film.<br/><br/>The aerial battles were beautifully shot and the attention to historical accuracy was incredible. This film did justice to the code-breaking aspect and treated the Japanese with respect, even though they were the enemy. Because of its historical accuracy, this film could pass for a docudrama. On the other hand, it covered a lot at the expense of character development, although it did manage to focus on a few protagonists.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich's Midway is a historically accurate, beautifully shot film with none of the fictional romantic soap opera that weighed down the 1976 version or Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. It's puzzling that critics didn't like it. Perhaps they forgot this film was a historical drama and there's no room for a fictional event or character to promote their social justice agenda. They complained about the lack of character development. Again, this film needed to cover a lot of history in 2 hours so something had to give. That said, many of the characters were adequately developed, which is more than I can say for The Last Jedi. Oddly, critics overlooked the non-existent character development in The Last Jedi and laughably praised it anyway. Midway is a far superior film and is just another film that's exposed the critics' bias. Ignore the paid critics and take it from me, someone who hasn't been paid by any studio to write this review: Go see this film!"
"jdesando","Null","4","5","5 December 2019"," Beautiful mayhem.
","The Hurt Locker, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket: quality war films that exceed Midway in story-telling originality but not in astonishing graphics and fidelity to the facts.<br/><br/>If you had a hunch that Midway is another Roland Emmerich eye-porn spectacle that defined that genre along with Michael Bay (whose Pearl Harbor could have learned a lesson or two from Emmerich), you are right. Midway takes a well-known and revered battle in WWII and milks as much clichÃ© and melodrama as possible.<br/><br/>Yet there is a wholesome honesty about this spectacle, a desire to tell it like it was that makes you feel you are witnessing the countless small decisions by admirals and pilots to bring the formidable Japanese to their knees. Pilots falling from the sky and Japanese carriers sinking to the bottom with their heroic admirals all seem real and heart-rending. Emmerich and writer Wes Tooke depict the deal deciders with their hubris and humanity in sharp detail.<br/><br/>Midway will not be on the Oscar finalist list, for it is too formulaic a war film and deficient in deep character development, but what it has is a firm grasp of the historical details and a dedication to showing the difficult decisions that rely partly on gut and valor. Moreover, the CGI battle scenes are remarkably realistic.<br/><br/>If you have a great grandpa who rode a dive bomber at a Japanese warship and refuses to talk about the experience, then see Midway to get the authentic feeling of being in battle. And besides, the CGI and overall visuals are what Americans get right, despite Japanese brilliance in animation and cinema in general. Both sides recovered nicely but not without unbelievable losses on both sides.<br/><br/>""That's the bravest damn thing I think I've ever seen."" Admiral Bull Halsey (Dennis Quaid)"

","Unlike the previous Midway movie, this one SHOULD be shown in a history class due to its historical accuracy. No ""love story sidelines"" to get in the way BUT it showed how war affects loved ones & families, not just those fighting. While graphic, it wasn't gratuitous. It fairly depicts both the American & Japanese sides and their decision-making well with the struggles they BOTH faced in a BALANCED way. YES, we won, but ALL wars have 2 sides. This presents the thinking of the OTHER SIDE, too. WE see no reason for why we were attacked, BUT let's look at what the thinking was from the OTHER side, agree with it or not. War tactics are some of the BEST EXPLAINED in this movie of any I've ever seen. The only frustration I had was with the subtitles. They were difficult to read at times due the lack of contrast between the words and the background. Personally, I dislike subtitles anyway. While it may have been deemed ""inappropriate,"" I'd rather they had the Japanese parts spoken in English with a Japanese accent. I felt I missed some words when I was unable to read everything thoroughly (and I'm a very good, fast reader) and missed seeing the emotion expressed by the speakers while reading. That's why I gave it a 9 & not a 10."

However, a movie cannot be built on accuracy alone, and the acting in this movie is also superb. The storytelling is throrough but not dry, and the length of the film is almost perfect, with the film spending adequate time on the Pearl Harbor attack, the Doolittle Raid, and finally Midway, with lots of interlude details in between. There was a brief narrative about Doolittle's escape through China, which was well done but I thought out of place in a movie about a naval battle in the middle of the Pacific. Overall, I highly recommend this movie as a movie to see with a friend, with family, or alone."
"codyco2000","9","4","5","24 November 2019"," Very Good, Well Done
","Midway is an historically accurate, intense, and exciting portrayal of one of the most important battles of WWII. They do a nice job of giving the back story so those not familiar with the history can understand the battle in its historical context. The plot is fast paced and at times riveting. It was a pleasure to sit through a movie of over two hours that kept your attention the whole time and didn't lag. No looking at your watch in this one.<br/><br/>While there is some Hollywood bending of the facts, overall the movie is very historically accurate, much more so than many war movies, and close enough to the truth that people with no knowledge of the battle will leave with a pretty good understanding of what actually transpired. The CG is very good, perhaps overdone in places but that is the nature of movies today. The ships and planes are quite accurate and only the rivet counters among us will quibble over the inaccuracies; none of which detract from the story.<br/><br/>I'm not a Woody Harrelson fan, but he does a really nice job in this movie as does Dennis Quaid.<br/><br/>Good flick. Two thumbs up, worth seeing."

","Bottom line: if you like historical dramas, you are likely to like this film. If you don't, avoid and save yourself several hours.<br/><br/>Spoilers are minor (if you know your history).<br/><br/>For intents and purposes, this film does do justice (for the most part) of the account of the Battle of Midway. This is a very fast paced film with little character development. In this case, it really does not need it as the director concentrated on McClusky and Best. This fine but in many ways it may not be needed. Harrelson does a decent job as Nimitz and Quaid did very well as Halsey.<br/><br/>As stated above, this a very fast paced film which starts with the reason why the US carriers were not at Pearl on 7 Dec 41, then moves quickly through some other actions to include the Marshalls, Dolittle Raid, Coral Sea and then on to Midway. Considering the amount of action in this film, I feel the Dolittle Rain could have been omitted and the scenes from China should also have been absent. That said, considering there was a Chinese production company putting money into this film, I think directors and writers were forced into this. The main reason I feel the Dolittle Raid should have been eliminated was there was A LOT omitted about the planning from the Japanese side and US side that was very important and the ""fog of war"" issues that dogged Nagumo during the battle itself. These issues really could have helped the understanding of the decisions the commander made during the battle.<br/><br/>There is on BIG issue I took with the film. During the first attacks on the Japanese carriers, a B-25 was hit and nearly hit Nagumo's carrier, which the pilot was trying to hit the carrier because he could not return to base. The film portrayed Nagumo reactions to the apparent attempt by the American pilot to ram the carrier as a coincidence saying ""Americans are not that brave"". In reality, Nagumos writings indicate that incident shook him to this core and made him reassess US forces as whole. This film did not show that.<br/><br/>All that said, this film is very much so worth watching."

This is a time period I've always been fascinated by, and Midway is a battle I've read extensively about over the years. So for me, it was important that the story be told accurately, and not munged up with fake characters and story in order to give some star screen time.<br/><br/>Is the story accurate? Fundamentally yes. While there was some very minor conflation of supporting events, mostly for time, everything that unfolded is true, and I don't think there is anything shown that flat out did not happen (like in Pearl Harbor).<br/><br/>I thought the CGI work overall was excellent. It added to the story in the right way, and it was amazing to see them bring the Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown back to life. It was incredible to see those classic Dauntless's, Devastators, Mitchells, Zeros, Kates, and Marauders in the air again. I know some folks will quibble over aircraft insignia and the like, but the story is still intact.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie. See it for the history, the story, and for the appreciation of the Greatest Generation. One thing that is undeniable, is that those guys had balls the size of coconuts."

","Student of history here and one who is familiar with much World War II, having built the Nichimo 1:200 Yamato (for the second time) last year. The books, Lord and Prange, are the Bibles of the battle and this film took pages and turned to screen intact and with respect. Harrelson was amazingly good as Nimitz too, did not think he had it in him. The rest of the cast - some well known, Quaid and Eckhart, and others new worked excellently ..... and the Japanese view was square solid too. Special Effects , CGI of course - were on par with the best though the Japanese films THE ETERNAL ZERO and THE ADMIRAL are just as good. Recommend these two films for a solid trio. We do not go back to the emotional slop of PEARL HARBOR or the accurate and very very dull TORA of so many years ago. But the one rare film where people CLAP at the end of it and sometimes you want cheer. Waves the flag without politics. A time and people to be proud of and render honor to. This film does precisely that."

","When I heard a Midway movie was being made I could barely contain my excitement, when I heard Emmerich was directing it I started to control my expectations. However, this movie surprised me in a very good way. While the characters are a bit flat and Hollywood does indeed come through here and there, the pros heavily outweigh the cons. The movie is historically accurate, and does very well in capturing the defining moments leading up to, and during the battle of Midway. What shocked me the most though was how tragically beautiful this movie was. Emmerich gets very creative with his shots, especially during the battle sequences, and it pays of massively. If you would have told me before I saw this movie that it's one of the most hauntingly beautiful war movies I've ever seen I probably would have laughed in your face, but it is. This is without a doubt a movie worth seeing, and a must see if you're anything of a history nerd. This is definitely a film you should see on the big screen to get the full experience."

","As usual, liberal critics who hate America and nationalism bashed this movie. I went in wanting to hate it completely, I had a discounted ticket and just wanted to get out to the theater because I'm working a very stressful job now. Ed Skrein did an amazing job and Roland Emmerich did an amazing job recreating 1940s America and the Navy. Many directors just choose to hire today's flavor of the day actors and won't even make them adopt period-accurate hair styles and personalities. Even Saving Private Ryan was pretty bad about that, with soldiers talking like they were from the modern day, haircuts that the actors wear everyday, there was just little effort put into recreating the period.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised at the battle scenes. From what I've read of the actual Midway battle, they got many of the details that I remembered fairly accurate. I'm no expert, but at no point was there any head-scratching moment like you saw in ""The King"" or ""Outlaw King"" where they had something ridiculous happen like the King of France trying to fight the King of England 1v1 and getting killed by some ordinary soldiers after slipping in the mud, lol! To make matters worse, that's a Netflix movie, not something commercially released in theaters! I think if this movie was that ridiculous, it would have FDR in one of the dive bombers or something, good lord.<br/><br/>I will definitely be buying this on home video when it is released.

","This film definitely won't rank among the greatest war movies ever, but phenomenal all the same.
As an enlisted US Navy sailor of 19 years now, and having served aboard multiple aircraft carriers while attached to several different aircraft squadrons, I thought it was very well done. The culture has changed since that time, but people haven't. The focus on over the top emotions played out by combatants seeking vengeance on the Pearl Harbor attack was not overplayed, that was the same attitude across all military branches following the September 11 attacks. The raw emotions felt by soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen when heading into an operational area is often intense and over the top.
The movie jumped a lot, and the pacing was fast, but all the events depicted were actually important in order to tell the story of Midway.
I read a review about the suicide bomber attack on the Enterprise, and Bruno Gaido saving the ship from a parked Dauntless bomber on deck, and then being meritoriously advanced two paygrades by Halsey was not only ridiculous, but also never happened? It absolutely happened, which is the only reason to even have it in the film. The purpose of this movie isn't to show the lives of the men and women that individually endured the war, or the overall emotions of the nation as a whole...this film's goal was to show the heroism displayed by American sailors onboard the highest decorated carrier in American history during the navy's most trying time and our most intense battle space to date.
The Navy holds our heritage above so many other things, and pushes us to learn as much as possible about our history. Was this movie perfect? No. Did it do a hell of a job in its representation of the rocky early days of the Pacific war and the sailors that fought valiantly against insurmountable odds? Absolutely.
If you want romance, bad writing, too much time spent on character building at the expense of accuracy, go watch Pearl Harbor. If you want a fantastic movie with a front row seat to one of the US Navy's greatest accomplishments, watch Midway."

The millennial critics don't like the movie because it shows the realities of war and how a few people made a difference. In other words - America is a good place.

Instead it shows us the attack on Pearl, which I thought would be just a very quick introduction, and then the Doolittle and Marshall Islands raids before the actual battle of Midway. I couldn't ask for more action after all this.
Although the VFX of M.Bay's Pearl Harbor have aged well, this movie still gave us jaw-dropping battle scenes that feel huge, with a fair amount of screen time for the Japanese side. The Japanese fleet was gorgeous and I loved every shot of their ships.
'Midway' earned a place in my top favourite WW2 movies, along 'My Way', 'Cross of Iron', 'Thin Red Line' and 'Battle of Britain'."

The Navy and the characters are perfectly created we the viewer, experience what the command structure and characters in the film. How strong the wives are. The confidence of a leader/ pilot has to be in-order to survive. Either do it or bounce off the Carrier. The command structure has to be trusting, yet strong. The middle of the movie is historically accurate. One experiences how military intelligence is a must for war. Many decision are made on educated gambles. If one did not know about World War 2 in the this film educates about Pacific Pear Harbor to Midway perfectly; The special effects are realistic! One experiences the nerve, and chaos of warfare, and the part with the brave pilot who hit two Carriers is memorable. The conclusion is great. One sees how luck, military mistakes, and listening to good intelligence is a must for battles. Midway is a well acted, directed, and executed. Much better than the original 1975 Midway, which side stories slowed the film. A must see. 9 stars."

A wonderful and moving glimpse into the bravery, sacrifices, compassion, ingenuity, leadership and fortitude of those who gave all for our freedom. WWII veterans are almost all gone now, and we need movies like this to remind us of what America was once and can be again. I am sure some liberties were taken, but when preparing to see this film with my son I reviewed the history of Midway and gave him a brief overview at dinner before we went to the theater. I realized that you cannot tell the story of Midway without starting at Pearl Harbor, moving to Doolittle's Raid, showing where the Midway Atoll is and talking about Admiral Yamamoto's idea of extending Japan's reach into most of the Pacific. Midway did exactly that, giving the full context and then showing the battle. A great move of American Exceptionalism!"

The movies biggest strength is visual and it's next is no trying to over-reach.<br/><br/>Previous versions of this story were melodramatic and hollywoodized beyond reality. This one isn't, and the best thing is no one cast member has such an ego that they attempt to dominate the movie. That is a refreshing change from previous depictions of this story.<br/><br/>Intelligence information is used properly, and the lead up from 1937 to the Midway battle are really well done. The re-enactment of Pearl Harbor is well done. The miracle that the US Carriers were not in Pearl that day is not dwelled upon, just shown. That is the strength of the entire film. It is done as it happened. It amazes me that the 2 locations are Hawaii and Montreal, Canada.
It seems like there are more locales, but this is good film making, the story is rock solid, well written, and actually dominates the film instead of the acting. This does not happen often enough in movies.<br/><br/>Loved the history of the characters at the end of the film, and did not realize that 2019 is the year the last of Doolittles raiders on the first bombing run on Tokyo died.

"helenbassett","10","5","7","29 November 2019"," Midway Film Review - Roland Emmerich Directs The American Naval Fleet To Victory In WW2
","Roland Emmerich takes the action to the Pacific in Midway. When years earlier as Naval attachÃ¨ to Japan, Patrick Wilson's Edwin Layton's advice is ignored by his bosses, and the Japanese had a free shot to take out Pearl Harbor in December 7 1941. And as we know the neutral US then entered WW2. But new Commander of the Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, played by Woody Harrelson, is prepared to listen to Layton, the man who tried to warn Washington, and his code-breaking intelligence staff, in the future. Interestingly a band from one of the sunken Pearl Harbor ships increased the code-breaking team. Their knowledge of music useful in identifying patterns in the intel they picked up. Fascinating. And with Brennan Brown's Joseph Rochefort in charge of the code-breaking team, it felt like The Man In The High Castle alumni with Luke Kleintank. This time on the same team.<br/><br/>Midway wasn't the beginning of WW2, not for Europe anyway!, and it wasn't the end, but I watched a tv programme a while ago that showed how unprepared the US was at the time. Their torpedoes failing even to blow when hitting a Japanese ship. And Japan had a commanding Naval fleet that dwarfed the US. That would rapidly change over the course of the war. But the US had oil, which the Japanese did not have. And fortunately the Pearl Harbor tankers were not hit.<br/><br/>Of the men that will win this battle, Ed Skrein's Dick Best is a maverick in the air. A pilot who practises by cutting off his engine to see if he can still make it. His co-pilot is none too happy about the practise runs! Best's friend was killed at Pearl Harbor and we know he will take his plane to the wire. Much to the chagrin of his superior officer Luke Evans's Wade McCluskey. And Dick's daredevil exploits are what's kept him from promotion. His gutsy dive-bombing will be much needed. And Admiral Nimitz hopes there are more like him when they go after the Japanese Fleet. With pal Clarence Dickinson played by Luke Kleintank, this is an all star cast of sailors and airmen. Dennis Quaid is Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey of the USS Enterprise. I do hope the Star Trek USS Enterprise was named after his ship. And the courageous Nick Jonas as Bruno Gaido, firing a stationary plane's gun at a dive-bombing Japanese plane, to keep his Brothers-in-Arms safe. What a star, and he gets promoted for his services by Halsey. And then walks the plank. All of them heroes and all mentioned at the end of Midway with flying colours.<br/><br/>With Midway Island picked up as the Japanese next target by our former tuba players, god love em; to win the battle was crucial for the US, if it were to fall, Hawaii would be next and then the West coast of the US. But back in Tokyo the Japanese are unaware that their messages are being decoded, and the enemy are crossing the Pacific Ocean to be ready for them. But Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, played by Etsushi Toyokawa, we met him at the beginning in peacetime with Layton, knows they have woken the beast that is the USA.<br/><br/>I wasn't so sure about the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo led by Aaron Eckhart, the Japanese reprisals against the occupied Chinese seemed too high a price to pay for a few bombs on Tokyo. The end credits said that Nimitz did get to sail into Tokyo Bay on the USS Missouri to accept the Japanese surrender. Far more satisfying.<br/><br/>A fun bit of real life trivia was John Ford actually filming at Midway and got more than he could ever have hoped for with his live action filming. And what a feat of engineering when the USS Yorktown holed out after Pearl Harbor, sailed to war in 72 hours. It wasn't just airmen that won this battle.<br/><br/>And Roland Emmerich definitely brings the battle to life, and while I wouldn't turn on the tv to watch an old war film, I thought Midway was fantastic. Very exciting with an excellent cast. I'm not going to pretend that it all seemed like a blur at times, because to the guys on the ground it probably was too. War happens at a ferocious pace and I didn't think Emmrich let anything get in the way of telling the story. The CGI special effects were well done and the photography and sound was breathtaking. I cannot recommend Midway highly enough."

"timdalton007","8","5","7","21 November 2019"," Another Emmerich Spectacle, But This One's True
","Since practically the dawn of cinema, there has been something about war films that have captured the attention of filmmakers and the public alike. Perhaps due to it taking place amid Hollywood's Golden Age, World War II especially has earned something of a prime spot. Midway, the latest film from Rolland Emmerich, proves that interest is still very much alive.<br/><br/>In looking over Emmerich's filmography, there are usually three things one can be confident about going in knowing. The first is that he can assemble an excellent cast, and Midway is no exception to that. To tell the story of a tide-turning battle and the man who fought it, he's assembled one that takes in a wide range. There are the comparatively fresh faces of Ed Skrein and Luke Evans as the lead characters, two naval aviators who take viewers into the heat of battle. Elsewhere, established character actors like Patrick Wilson take us into the back rooms, as do the likes of Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson playing Admirals Halsey and Nimitz, respectively, showing the strategies been laid out at the upper levels of command. The Japanese side of the cast is equally steadfast, lead by Etsushi Toyokawa as Admiral Yamamoto. Meanwhile, the civilian side of the war comes from Mandy Moore's character, the wife of Skrien's pilot, though it is something the film doesn't give much time toward portraying. On the whole, though, they do an excellent job bringing the history to life sincerely.<br/><br/>The second point of confidence is that an Emmerich film will be a special effects feast. Midway, too, scores on that point. From the attack on Pearl Harbor that comes a short way into the film to the Doolittle raid and the climactic ait attacks during the titular battle, the film does everything in its power to make viewers feel like they're flying alongside these men. Something which the film does with some fine CGI work that creates everything from early war Hawaii, to the ships and planes involved. Combined with all the other tricks of the trade, from the editing of Adam Wolfe to the score from frequent Emmerich collaborators Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser, the result is some of the finest aerial dogfights you're likely to see anytime soon.<br/><br/>The final thing on our Emmerich checklist regards the script. As has been the case throughout his career, but especially in the last decade or so, he's a director with a habit of getting ones full of interesting ideas but often cliched or merely functional dialogue. Midway, though based around historical events, does suffer from some of these faults as well, especially where its dialogue is concerned though the actors do their best with it, helping to mitigate the worst of it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's the historical elements that make Midway stand out. In presenting what is essentially a Cliff Notes version of the early Pacific War, Emmerich and writer Wes Tooke pack a largely accurate history lesson inside an action movie. Viewers get to see battles going down, the decisions leading up to them, and what it was like to face life and death during them. It allows the film to cover a lot of ground in a mere138 minutes, something which isn't always to its advantage (as the short-shifting of things like the Doolittle Raid and an underutilized Aaron Eckhart can attest). Despite that, it's hard not to think of it as the best script he's had since at least 2012 and maybe even longer ago than that.<br/><br/>Indeed, one might go so far as to call it Emmerich's best film since that 2009 outing. It has all the ingredients of his better work, as well as some of the flaws, and tells a fascinating real-life story to boot. Along the way, it also proves one adage to still be true: that truth can be just as compelling, and stranger, than fiction."

In terms of seas battle ""Midway"" may not match the Battle of Leyte Gulf in size and intensity, but it turns the tide after Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>The movie ""Midway"" (2019) is a delightful surprise in resisting the temptation to succumb, like most other Hollywood war movies, to blatantly stereotype characters or shallow melodramatic romances.<br/><br/>After a brief prelude of an earlier sojourning of naval intelligent officer Edward Layton (Patrick Wilson) in Tokyo, the movie plunges right into the infernal of Pearl Harbour. In addition to very good CGI scenes, there are also some detailed, gritty depictions. One scene shows a half-stunned man trying to stand up by grapping half-collapsed railings, only to have his palms seared by the red-hot metal.<br/><br/>I am not going into any detail of the events. The crux of the story is on how, after the devastating Japanese unannounced attack of Pearl Harbour, Chester W. Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) was selected by President Roosevelt be the commander-in-chief of the Pacific fleet, with the most difficult job of turning the tide of the U.S. naval campaign against the Japanese. It was essentially achieved by sinking four major Japanese aircraft carriers by air strike, after luring them into a trap.<br/><br/>The captivating ""subplot"", if you will, is the intelligence support from a group headed by Layton. With the technology available at the time, this involved a substantial combination of experience, intuition, as well as brilliant logical analysis of often scanty information. In the movie there is an interesting analogy of a wedding when the invitations are sent (the bait to lure the Japanese fleet), the banquet is ready (air striking power standing by) and waiting to see when and from where the guest would arrive. At the eleventh hour, with so much at stake, Nimitz says to Layton that he needs more specific information. After a brief pause, Layton recites the precise time, longitude and latitude. When things unfold and scouting report finally come, Nimitz beams at Layton, saying that everything is within a few percentage points of the prediction. Without missing a beat, Layton replies ""I'll Endeavour to do better next time, sir.""<br/><br/>It is with something almost skin to joy watching a Harrelson as I have never seen before, so contain and measured to the extent of under-acting. This feeling is particularly accentuated by seeing him just a week ago in ""Zombieland: double tap"". To the general audience, Nimitz is probably the only name familiar, and perhaps even more as a mega aircraft carrier than as a person. But then, in the end credits, it is quite uplifting to see that all the characters are real, with the image of each actor fading out, replaced by the real person and a brief bio in text. And this is such a remarkable cast. Wilson is always solid, if not spectacular. We also have Dennis Quaid, Luke Evans, Aaron Eckhart, Ed Skrein and, on the Japanese side, Tadanobu Asano, prolific on the Hollywood screen and best recognized probably by Marvel fans as one of Thor's four warriors.<br/><br/>""Midway"" (2019) is not to be missed by war movie buffs as well as the general audience.<br/><br/>

","This is an excellent, solid depiction of the WWII battle of Midway and the background surrounding it from both the American perspective and the Japanese. Excellent acting, which I expected from a cast like that, vivid graphics and great story. Plus, no smarmy love story and even better, NO POLITICS. How often do we get to see a picture like this without a political agenda? So refreshing."

","No political agenda, no cheesy romance, just an account of what happened. It feels like your grandpa telling you stories about the war that people know very little about nowadays.

","This movie was a boiler-plate but satisfactory action movie, though weighed down by a poorly written, terribly constructed, and woodenly acted script, with some dialogue so clunky, I could almost see the words land on the ground with a thud as soon as they left the actors' mouths. It's filled with a cavalcade of young, nubile Hollywood hunks (Nick Jonas, Ed Skrein, Keean Johnson, Darrin Criss), as well as a smattering of grizzly veterans (Dennis Quaid, Woody Harrelson) and an openly gay actor (Luke Evans) successfully playing against type, and while it was just this side of jingoistic, it didn't demonize the Japanese as much as it could have. We probably enjoyed it more than we might have, having just watched the episode in the Netflix WWII docuseries about the battle. Definitely not the best war movie I've ever seen, but enjoyable enough so as not to be completely wretched (damning with faint praise, I know)."

","Pretty gripping retell of an incredible battle that more citizens of the US need to know. Aside from the incredible battle scenes, the tension and grueling pressure of leadership placed on the shoulders of the military leaders on both sides adds great flavor to this epic film. You can't but help feel the strain on the wives of the pilots as well. Mandy Moore does an incredible job. I saw this in a theater sitting near silver haired veterans that were on the USS Yorktown, and USS Hornet. Grateful to all who have served!"
"westsideschl","4","9","15","4 March 2020"," Gum
","When the opening scenes show a gum chomping, high risk cowboy pilot putting his & other's lives at risk by showboating a dangerous stunt onto a carrier I knew what type of factuality was in store for the rest of the movie. Lots of, we never do anything wrong, nationalistic fervor which added to questioning where the movie was going. Movie is filled with scenes of animated fighters being shot at, and shooting back. The usual family, romance scenes to capture more paying viewers. Japanese, of course, mostly portrayed as ruthless such as tying an anchor to a captured pilot who upon refusing to divulge info on his unit is tossed into the sea (we see him sink slowly down of course). Odd that the end credits said dedicated to the American & Japanese sailers at Midway."

","Don't pay attention to the people who rate this less than a 6, they must have some other issue because this movie was excellent. As far as Hollywood, sure it was Hollywoodish, but mainly just in the special effects. The expressions and 99% of the dialogue was well done in true to the time period. While the characters were Hollywood stars, the planet portrayed the actual people flawlessly.<br/><br/>The story moves at a quick pace and they do a good job building many of the characters and assuming you have some intelligence to know with Admirals Nimitz and Halsey as well as Yamamoto and Genda on the Japanese side.<br/><br/>Well worth the watch!!"
"springfieldrental","10","8","13","18 November 2019"," Should Be Required Viewing By High School Students
","Midway, a very accurate depiction of the battle that turned the tide in the Pacific in the first year of the United States involvement in WW2, stirs the soul in illustrating the sacrifices of thousands of young Americans turning the powerful Japanese tide.
Ignore all those who say the CGI were amateurish. Pushing technology to its limits, the special effect experts working on the movie convincingly portrayed how close to realistic the historic series of events appeared. Short of getting antique WW2 planes and naval carriers, with would be impossible today, the magic of computer-generated images made this film drench in heroics virtually unmatched in aviation history.
The science fiction films of Star Wars, et al, cannot come close to the real life experiences of these brave airmen. Midway should be required viewing to all high schoolers who either fail to appreciate the ultimate sacrifices these brave naval and air men took after Pearl Harbor, or are ignorant through the failings of today's education to understand what it took for all of us to have the freedoms we enjoy today. Midway, the movie, serves as a rewarding memoir to those men."
"donaldnwolfe","8","8","13","11 November 2019"," Nail-biter!
","This movie is like Pearl Harbor (the Affleck/Hartnett one) but with a lot less corniness and glamor, and a tighter focus on the challenges faced by the armed forces in the Pacific in the aftermath of December 7. The battle scenes are more gripping than any I've ever seen in the big screen. A few times I found myself wringing my hands so hard that they hurt. This is a very straightforward war movie - one that illustrates the sacrifice of war veterans like few others."
"indylovelace","9","8","13","10 November 2019"," Very enjoyable

They rarely make them like this anymore. The CGI helped to create that pit of the stomach feeling of what it might have been like to dive bomb a Japanese carrier knowing you are probably going to die. Sure, there could have been more character depth, but come on folks...how much character depth was there really in some of the 2019 Oscar winners. I ignore Hollywood and Oscars anymore...just call out great filmmaking on the rare occasions I see it, and this is one film to see.

"RinoBortone91","5","6","9","15 January 2020"," INTERESTING, BUT NOT THAT MUCH
","We know Roland Emmerich and we know his cinema. His are films that entertain you, that make you pay for the ticket and that surely also make you have fun, but despite his aspirations, sometimes he does not hit the target and Midway is nothing but one of these cases. Film with a very delicate story to tell, so a very important point in the WWII history. Despite the history was treated with respect, was just poorly written, Roland's direction uncertain on different points of the plot and sloppy shots outclassed by a not always excellent CGI, even though the cast was gripping and believing it, especially Ed Skrein. Despite all, the film is watchable, entertains and succeeds in ""wanting to know more"" whilst you're watching it, too bad for the wasted opportunity to be something more and unique in war movies."

"Wuchakk","8","6","9","24 November 2019"," Just the facts, Jack
","Intelligence officer Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) warns that a Japanese attack is imminent, but his advice is disregarded and the Japanese use their carrier fleet to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) swiftly assumes command of the heavily weakened US Pacific Fleet. After the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo & Honshu 4.5 months later, events lead up to the Battle of Midway on June 4-7, 1942. Ed Skrein plays cocky pilot Dick Best while Dennis Quaid is on hand as carrier commander William ""Bull"" Halsey.<br/><br/>""Midway"" (2019) tackles the Battle of Midway and events leading up to it without throwing in a dramatic fictional story, like the love triangle of ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). While I loved ""Pearl Harbor"" and proudly stand by it, ""Midway"" chooses to stick to the facts and is thrilling from beginning to end. The main cast members are all real-life figures and there's a tribute to each at the close.<br/><br/>This is superior to the 1976 movie because Roland Emmerich had the CGI technology to pull off the battle scenes which take place in & above the Pacific Ocean near the atoll of Midway, which is located a little over a thousand miles west of Hawaii. The flick successfully takes the viewer right into the midst of the fight on the water, in the air and under the water. It's exciting, horrific and revelatory.<br/><br/>The film runs almost 2 hours and 18 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

"Bee_F","8","6","9","15 November 2019"," The critics got it wrong
","The critic consensus is quite gloomy, painting the film as poorly executed and at times, slow. What it really is, is an almost lovingly accurate retelling of the entire story... including the motivations and actions leading up to Pearl Harbor, the lives and stories of some of the incredible heroes, and even some aspects of political climate on the Japanese side (which I can personally testify are quite correct). The critics seem to be dismayed that the special effects don't take center stage and that the explosions and action are not more fast-paced, but this is a movie about history and real people, not the latest installment in that horrid Transformers franchise. Those interested in feeling the tension and motivations of the actual people and even their families and getting a true picture of some of the incredible heroism, skill, and luck that made Midway the turning point in the Pacific War, instead of the prelude to the invasion of our West Coast, should really enjoy this."

","I saw ""Midway"", starring Ed Skrein-Alita:Battle Angel, Deadpool; Patrick Wilson-Aquaman, Watchmen; Mandy Moore-This Is Us_tv, 47 Meters Down and Luke Evans-the Fast & Furious movies, The Three Musketeers_2011.
This movie is based on real life events that happened in the Pacific Ocean during 1941. It starts with the Pearl Harbor attack by Japan and continues through to the battle of Midway. It shows both sides of the conflicts-the American Fleet vs the Japanese Navy-but leans heavily on the Americans' struggles, of course. Ed plays a top pilot with Mandy as his concerned wife. Patrick is the head of military intelligence for the U.S. and Luke is another pilot. There are several good cameos-I remember seeing Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart and Nick Jonas-and lots of excellent battle scenes. During the end credits, the real people the actors are portraying are shown and you learn what happened to them after Midway. If you are a WW2 fan/buff, you should enjoy this one.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for war violence, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental."

","Finally a movie about ww2 with no stupid subplot. Show us the battles, the tactics, the carnage, make it as big as it was, with cgi nothing is holding you back. You cannot make up a story more interesting than the real deal, so please please don't try. (Saving private Ryan is a prime example of a moronic plot in a ww2 setting.) The cgi has been criticised, I cannot see why. They are great and necessary, because there are not a fleet of veteran warplanes and -ships laying around to blow up. I hold one star back because they held back on the blood and guts, which needs to be there, because they are in war. War is not a sport, it is awful, and should be shown that way. This is a true war movie about the war itself. I do not care if the lines are sparse and cheesy, ww2 is not primarily remembered for its dialogues but for the total chaos which swept around the globe and left a wake of death and destruction in a scale never seen before or since."

","When I posted on Facebook I was seeing this movie, a friend asked me what I thought of it.<br/><br/>I was surprised to answer that I thought it was wonderful.<br/><br/>It really is.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of historical war movies. I don't like war. I don't love the military. I'm more of a science fiction fanatic and Marvel groupie, but this movie is truly and surprisingly wonderful.<br/><br/>As I told my friend who went with me, I often have trouble making sense of war movies. An example is Dunkirk. I just have a hard time understanding them because I'm not familiar with the military. Instead I often feel lost and confused.<br/><br/>But this movie is engaging and engrossing. It provides a good combination of breathtaking action and personal stories. It's not overly patriotic. Its subject matter is interesting. And the acting... the acting is simply superb.<br/><br/>There are a lot of characters to keep track of. A lot of men (no criticism here -- lets face it, this particular history is about male soldiers). A few of the characters stand out and you become invested in their survival. They are brilliant, brave and very human characters.<br/><br/>There's good casting here and favorite actors from Person of Interest and other TV shows show up (including Stargate!): Brennan Brown, David Hewlett, James Carpinello. The latter plays a submariner -- the movie makes me want to learn more about that aspect of the war. There are plenty of claustrophobic scenes of men in small, cramped places, but the submarine scenes are truly disquieting.<br/><br/>And then there's Woody Harrelson. He seems to be everywhere these days. Like always, he's just simply excellent as Nimitz.<br/><br/>I love what Emmerich does at the end of the movie, with an homage to the real people who are portrayed.<br/><br/>This movie made me think about that old Midnight Oil song -- The Forgotten Years. How phenomenally brave these people were. And how horrible war is. We are the recipients of the peace and prosperity they fought for. It is so easy to forget how dreadful it was.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a fine movie that leaves you thinking but (thankfully) not depressed."
"wongcalvin","8","7","11","15 November 2019"," Great War Movie with Accurate Facts
","One good thing about this movie is that it has a great cast which each important character has its own fair share of time and it sticks to the facts pretty well. From the start to finish, there isn't much dull moments and there is always something heroic actions and building up characters which is important for the later scenes.<br/><br/>There is a balance scenes and moments between Americans and the Japanese which is quite a good thing as isn't biased on any side. The movie kinda have many great historic moments alongside with the CGI scenes not the best as practical effect from Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, but it's still pretty impressive on some of the scenes.<br/><br/>However the score of the movie does lack a little, and it just needs a little more punch and more dramatic score to match up with those battle moments, just a bit lack of tense in the music design.<br/><br/>Overall not bad for this movie. Great time if you wanna learn more about this great historical moments of WW2. Worth a shot !"
"infantry_x","10","7","11","14 November 2019"," Great movie

If you wanna dip your toe back in time when all the action took place at the hands of men and big metal machines then this is your movie. The battle scenes are incredible. In fact, the movie is just one long battle scene. Detail was not sacrificed for special of facts. You really feel like you are in the plane or on the boat. Anyone intrested in World War II should see this film. Roland Emmerich crafted a surprisingly well done tribute to both the American and Japanese soldiers who fought this horrendous war."
"walter2-1","10","7","11","13 November 2019"," An amazing slice of history
","While I don't doubt there are some mild inaccuracies in this film, it does a wonderful job of showing the courage of the men involved, and the high role fate, bad decisions and chance played in our history. I am not normally a big historical war movie fan, but this was an exceptionally good film that really highlights how close our history came to being much different.<br/><br/>Incredibly well done, and full of great moments, it is a surprisingly good story that covers the characters that form the core of this story, and gives some good insight into the key events and how important they were. Note the importance China had in this story that is almost unknown here.<br/><br/>Very popcorn-worthy, and highly recommended."
"Solnichka","10","7","11","13 November 2019"," Very good movie, surprisingly so
","I didn't expect much when I went to see this movie on Veterans Day, but I was pleasantly surprised with the acting, the cinematography, and the screenplay. I'm a historian, albeit not a World War II one. Nonetheless, I'm well versed in the era, and the movie did a good job looking at real-life individuals as well as fictional ones as supporting characters in a great narrative. The balance to the storytelling was good, too, giving insight into the Japanese mindset of the time period. There is really only one scene-other than the bombing of Pearl Harbor, of course-where the audience truly can lose respect for the Japanese side of the story. That balance is key to making a good film these days. Who knew Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson still had it in them, either? Nicely done by the director to bring out those key performances. The cinematography of the air battles is pretty intense, putting the viewer right in the cockpit insanity of the situation.

","Absolutely a great well told terrifically acted movie. How can these knuckleheads critics bash this film. I'm so tired of transformers and kid animation and X-Men London has Fallen crap . Here is our history not 100 percent accurate but pretty darn close and my local paper had 2 stars keeping people away. I haven't been to a movie since Bohemian Rhapsody because it has been a very dry year for movies with substance. Entertaining from start to finish, I truly think the scenes they used in trailers don't do the realism of Midway any favors and make it look too much like Pearl Harbor the only scenes I thought were too much were the dive bombing flack shots . I liked the Japanese side being shown and in the proper language. The intelligence chess game both countries played was terrific. Plus the Doolittle raid and what they did to the Chinese for helping them. Well add this to Bo Rhap, Hostiles and Greatest Showman that the critics and their self agendas and or kick backs totally don't have a clue and why our society has no attention span and sense of history. They come out with another transformer movie and give it 4 stars and tell everybody how great it is I will rest my case."

Most people today don't understand what a pivotal battle this was in the Pacific Theater because had the US lost at Midway, the Japanese would have controlled the Pacific for 10 years or more, and would've completely changed the complexion of WWII. Only a little too much CGI kept me from awarding a perfect 10. Grade: A-."

We were both amused at our cinema with 8 theatres in using a regular sized one as opposed to the two giant seated ones. I asked an attendant about this and they said they should be moving Midway into the larger seated Theater as the crowds are bigger than they thought. This might be because of the Remembrance Day weekend and many people are paying tribute to our veterans.

"jvg37","9","7","11","10 November 2019"," Action-Packed and Fun While Staying Faithful To The Service-Members
","This is NOT a remake of the 1976 Midway, but is a fresh take on the people who really were instrumental in the success of the US Pacific Fleet following Pearl Harbor. Where the first film focused on the strategic side; The planning and mental chess game played by military leaders -- this one is geared more towards the people who actually carried out the plans and engaged the enemy. It is more of an action piece than a cerebral 'behind the scenes' what-really-happened film.<br/><br/>First the Good: Acting was great, though nothing Oscar-worthy. The effects were fantastic as to be expected. It stayed fairly true to the actual history of what really transpired as told by the survivors. Well-paced, nothing too dragged out, but not too rushed either.<br/><br/>The Bad: The writers obviously tried to use the language that people from that era would really use, but it doesn't equate well to today. The result is that some of the dialogue comes across as cheesy.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more of the actual processes the Navy took to locate the Japanese fleet and a little more on how they came to the conclusions they came too when making strategic decisions. But I cannot fault the film for being made to pander to the highest denominator.<br/><br/>All in all in was an enjoyable movie to watch and I have the greatest respect for the real people that sacrificed so much to get America the victory in the Pacific."

"euplay1220","6","2","2","13 April 2020"," Mediocre
","A mediocre war film. It has it all - an admiral and his staff discussing the dire situation, ragtag soldiers (or pilots) sacrificing themselves, wives and children worrying at home, and action-packed battle scenes. But everything is done in a mediocre way.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, this flim is a little too long for what it is. Because it is unfocused. Contrary to my expectations from the movie title, the Battle of Midway accounts for only one half of this film. The first half is spent on showing bits and pieces of prior engagements including Pearl Harbor, Battle of the Coral Sea, and Doolittle Raid. I mean, they can make good stories too, but they are not directly relevant to Midway (or, at least, this film fails to link up these events in a coherent story line).<br/><br/>Characters are disastrously shallow. They are just like symbols each assigned to a typical role in a war film and uttering designated cliches. In fact, the best characters in this film, in my opinion, are the Japanese ones.<br/><br/>Cinematography is ok, but nothing outstanding. Some scenes, including the Pearl Harbor scenes, look cheap because they are so obviously computer-generated. Of course we all know it's all CGI nowadays, but it still hurts when it actually looks CGI. (Probably something is wrong with the rendering of fire.)<br/><br/>An upside of the movie is its generally even-handed approach in depicting American and Japanese sides. Many war films, such as Pearl Harbor (2001) and Hacksaw Ridge (2016) for example, show the Japanese as inhumane demons or maniacs. On the other hand, this film follows the style of Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) in showing how the Japanese made their decisions for their part. It even explains briefly why the Japanese were ""forced"" to attack the U.S. in the first place. But consistency fails here again when the Japanese tie an American POW to an anchor and throws him overboard.<br/><br/>All in all, it shouldn't be a high priority in your war movie list. There are many more worthy films dedicated to naval battles of the Pacific War."

","Midway (4K Blu-ray)<br/><br/>Forget the insanely cheesy dialogue and the lashings of schmaltz.
'Midway' is best enjoyed with the brain turned down and your home theatre system turned up way past eleven.
On 4K Blu-ray this film boasts one of the best sound mixes ever to grace home media.
The film tells the story of the battle of Midway.
An important turning point in World War II.
With a stellar cast, Roland Emmerich's film has all the right ingredients to be a blockbuster.
Sadly the cliche script, and hammy acting do this movie no favours.
In terms of cinematic quality think less 'Saving Private Ryan' and more 'Pearl Harbour '.
That said this film is still huge fun and it can't be helped but to get caught up in all the spectacle.<br/><br/>Bringing me on to this movies biggest selling point.
On 4K Blu-ray this movie is a must have for the Home Cinema enthusiasts.
Picture quality is good but not demo worthy.
There's a layer of grain added in post production which elevates the cinematic appearance.
The colour palette is vintage helping give the movie a Saturday afternoon matinee feel.
HDR helps generate some blindingly bright explosions and adds a three dimensional look to the aerial battles.
'Midway' doesn't boast a 4K crisp image throughout but for the most part it is a fine transfer.
Sound quality on the other hand is a different story.
This is one bass heavy mix.
The Dolby Atmos track that accompanies this movie is an absolute belter.
Height and surround effects are constant with the battle scenes being demo worthy.
If you're sat on the fence about buying a dedicated Home theatre system. This movie will sway you.
Your neighbours might not be too happy if you crank this movie up to the max.
You may even crack the plaster on your ceiling.
'Midway' has a 10/10 sound mix and will be your new go to disc to showcase your system.<br/><br/>Overall the movie maybe a little cheesy but as a surround sound experience this movie is the best offering so far in 2020."

His tough way of talking through his nose, as if he has a serious speech impediment also irritated me throughout the movie.
On the other hand i was glad that Alexander Ludwig's role was short.
For the rest, an exciting film with good actors.

Here we had a great movie, excellent action sequence and outstanding photography yet all was brought to the ground with the pathetic actin of Ed Skrein."
"Chief270","7","2","2","8 March 2020"," Nice Historical Accuracy
","The Pacific Theater of World War Two has always been of great interest for me. Overall, this movie was quite accurate. Unlike Midway (1976) this one did not create fictional charracter and story lines, like Charlton Heston's Captain Matt Garth and the whole story line about his son loving a Japanese-American woman. In this movie, all of the principle characters were based on real people. This movie included the first cinematic portrayal of Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas) that I'm aware of.<br/><br/>I think the movie could have better if it would have only focused on the Battle of Midway rather than try to cram the Pearl Harbor attack and Doolittle's Raid into the film. Both events could, and have been, their own movie. The Doolittle Raid part of this movie was poorly done and unnecessary, and seemed more like filler than anything else.<br/><br/>As mentioned in several reviews, the CGI effects were really bad. The did indeed look like a video game. Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) had more convincing visual effects.<br/><br/>Ed Skrein's performance as protagonist LT Dick Best (another historical character) was grating and unlikable, but who knows? Perhaps the real Dick Best was grating and unlikable.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson's Admiral Chester Nimitz was passable, as was Dennis Quaid's Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Pacific Theater. It gets points from me because it didn't foul up an interesting historical event by injecting fictional story lines like Midway (1976_, Pearl Harbor (2001) and Titanic (1997.)"

Also why is a Chinese company in control of a film like this?...It had the potential to be great but just turned out average...not bad but not great. I would say it's worth seeing.

","I saw the original when it came out in 1976 and now this one which I felt like I was watching a video game with their cheap CGI rather than a movie. On the plus side, there was no Matt Garth, not ""I'm in love with a Japanese woman"" junk and the Japanese spoke, well, Japanese but that was about the only redeeming value. And just like the movie Pearl Harbor, they went to a brief clip of Yamamoto uttering the line ""I fear that all we have done was to awaken a sleeping giant......."" and just like Pearl Harbor, the audience who has little clue of the history of the Pearl Harbor attack, do not know why he would've said such a thing or even thought it since it's still debatable if he actually said that line in real life or something similar. In Tora! Tora! Tora!, the audience knew exactly why such a line would've been said. The flying sequences were downright ridiculous with planes flying so low that they flew in between the battleships and 20 feet off the ground and down a street and in between buildings, trees and telephone poles or the way Dick Best would land his plane on the carrier. I just wish these movies would focus more on the historical accuracies rather than focus completely on dazzling us with their CGI. At least this wasn't a romance movie in which a war inconvenienced them and Benn Affleck taking to the skies during the Pearl Harbor attack, and taking part in the Doolittle Raid, after coming back from England of course where he defeated the German Luftwaffe!"

You can't believe a single thing in this movie. So yeah I'm not on board with people giving the movie a high score. Not when so many other movies have been made where they can bring the viewer into the movie this one you're too much of an outsider and believe nothing.<br/><br/>I was just so angry at the acting I gave it a 1 but if you like to just have a very light non-believable war movie that has cool looking scenes then it probably deserves maybe 5 of 10. But you're not going to like any of the actors there so bad it makes you think that a director must have a lot to do with their presentation arcana just be a bad combination of both.

","Roland Emmerich's Midway is a loud brash World War 2 action film with plenty of CGI. The inspiration might had been Star Wars rather than actual events.<br/><br/>After a prologue set in 1937 featuring Intelligence Officer Edwin T Layton (Patrick Wilson) and Japanese commander in chief Isoroku Yamamoto regarding Japan's increasing bellicose attitude. It then moves to the bombing of Pearl Harbour that marks America's entry into World War 2 and its aftermath.<br/><br/>The American navy need to fight back and hotshot fighter pilot Dick Best (Ed Skrein) wants to take the fight to the Japs.<br/><br/>Others like Layton and Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) need to work out what the Japanese will do next and rely on their intelligence experts.<br/><br/>The film has actual real life players but it tries to cram too much and instead concentrates on the gung ho antics of Best and fellow pilot Wade McClusky (Luke Evans) both with dodgy American accents.<br/><br/>The subplot featuring Lt Col Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) was of interest but it just faded away.<br/><br/>At least Emmerich did not try to emulate Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour with an attempt to make an epic World War 2 love story. The scenes of domestic life is perfunctory, most of the characters are broadly brushed. The green screen work is very obvious. It does come across as a middling shallow action film."

I get why they are loose on the ground, but in the air, during dogfights, even on the flightdeck when a plane is taking of you see a flightdeck crew member withouth chinstrap while you see it's nearly blowing off his head.<br/><br/>And it's possible to have a conversation in an airplane, without comm system, in a dogfight, with the canopies open like you are sitting next to eachother in a quiet park.<br/><br/>And when Doolittle's squadron takes off, the weather and the sea are in such turmoil that there's is a bow wave large enough to swallow a complete B-25 while taking off (which survives). Yet there is no pitch and roll on the flight deck, you could put a marble on it and it wouldn't move.<br/><br/>Things like this make this movie feel unrealistic, combine that with the lack of emotional depth and commitment, the fast pace and the abundace of CGI and the result is a movie that's quite disappointing."
"merpman-94402","6","3","4","19 April 2020"," Hoped for something better
","This is a movie called Midway, but it does not get to Midway until about halfway through the 2 hour movie. It spends time at Pearl Harbor, and briefly hits on some other battles in the 6 months between Pearl Harbor and Midway.<br/><br/>Because it spends an hour pre Midway and 1 hour at midway, the details are lost and become somewhat vague. For example, you are not really told or have a clue how many or which ships were at the battle from each side, or their losses. So unless your interest meant you read up on it before hand, or after, you are not aware of the size of the battle.
Same with the importance of the battle, it was turning point that had a massive impact on the rest of the war, but that is not really conveyed in the movie.<br/><br/>My other thought was just how white the movie was. Not a single black dood. Sure i understand back then it was rarer, but one of the most incredible stories of the men at Pearl Harbor was an African American cook who jumped on a Browning machine gun and took down at least 4 enemy aircraft and maybe as many as 6.<br/><br/>My other issue with the movie is that it seemed to show that just 3 men did everything, everyone else was brave and risked their lives, died valiantly, but ultimately was these three guys that did everything. Yes these three men went above and beyond that day, but heck, everyone else failed and died bravely apparently. Somehow lessened the sacrifice of everybody else."

","I hope to save two plus hours of your life with this review. It's pretty simple, if attention to detail, engaging dialogue and dynamic acting are your thing then don't watch this movie. I will give it credit for being relatively spot on with the historical facts, with a couple glaring weaknesses. If ever one goes to the Marshall Islands be sure note the absence of the large mountains as shown in the film...could they not have CGI'd planes flying over an atoll???<br/><br/>Every time Ed Skrein was on screen it was like watching paint dry, only more painful. The casting of he and Luke Kleintank in lead roles was whatever the opposite of inspired is. Woody Harrelson and Dennis Quade did a decent job of earning their paycheck and there were good showings from Luke Evans, Patrick Wilson and Aaron Eckhart (why not just end the movie after his raid?). But that couldn't rescue the wooden dialogue, cliche pep talks and utter lack of character development.<br/><br/>I was so excited to watch this because of the importance of the battle of Midway, but by the end of the movie I was hoping that somehow Skrein's plane wouldn't make it back so we wouldn't have to hear him talk anymore. Was he trying to do an impression of Bill Guarnere from Band of Brothers? If so, epic failure.

"zardoz-13","8","3","4","26 November 2019"," The Best Cinematic Account of Midway
","Historians classify the battle of Midway in 1942 as the turning point of World War II in the Pacific. Since invading Manchuria in 1931, the Japanese had been on a roll. This runaway success lost momentum on June 7th, just six months after their surprise attack on December 7th devastated Pearl Harbor. The earliest movie about Midway appeared in September 1942. Renowned Hollywood director John Ford lensed battlefield footage of the Midway attack for an 18-minute documentary. Indeed, Ford filmed the bombs as they fell! Later, director Henry Hathaway's ""Wing and A Prayer"" (1944) was the first Hollywood feature-length film about this landmark battle. Audiences would have to wait until 1976, when Universal Pictures released director Jack Smight's ""Midway,"" starring Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, and Glenn Ford to commemorate this extraordinary victory. Ironically, German director Roland Emmerich's ""Midway"" qualifies as the best version of the battle. Apart from Ford's documentary, no movie about the Midway victory has bristled with the amount of historical content as Emmerich's film. Mind you, no movie can ever claim to be 100 percent authentic. For example, the U.S. carrier-based planes were the wrong color, and the decks of Japanese flattops weren't painted the color yellow. Nevertheless, Emmerich's epic clearly tops anything done about this Japanese defeat. Every character is based on an actual individual. Virtually every line of dialogue contains material about the battle. Hampered by an inadequate budget, Emmerich and freshman scenarist Wes Tooke have done a commendable job of depicting the clash from both American and Japanese perspectives.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this ambitious depiction is as comprehensive as most armchair admirals would probably prefer. Of course, money dictates everything in Hollywood. Reportedly, the most expensive independent film in history, ""Midway"" boasted a budget of a $100 million, but it wasn't adequate to cover the whole fracas. Comparably, ""Midway"" (1976) relied chiefly on recycled war movie footage and vintage newsreels spliced into star-studded command post scenes to recreate a fight which Universal Pictures could hardly have afforded on its relatively modest budget. Meantime, Emmerich's dramatization created authentic-looking, computer-generated imagery to immortalize this seemingly implausible American triumph. Three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers participated at Midway. Emmerich concentrates on the U.S.S. Hornet and the U.S.S. Enterprise, but he relegates the U.S.S. Yorktown to the periphery. Furthermore, the film omits one of Midway's greatest heroes: Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron, who led a squadron of 15 Douglas TBD-1 Devastator torpedo planes from the Hornet. Tragically, the Japanese slaughtered Waldron's squadron. One of Waldron's fliers--Ensign George Gay--survived this catastrophe. Ditching in the ocean, Gay had a ringside seat to watch his compatriots sink a Japanese aircraft carrier.<br/><br/>In ""Midway,"" Emmerich intersperses scenes of the codebreakers at Pearl Harbor with scenes aboard the aircraft carriers Hornet and Enterprise. After the debacle of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt orders Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson of ""Zombieland"") to destroy the Japanese Imperial Navy and take the U.S. Navy into Tokyo Bay. Nimitz relies on Lieutenant Commander Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson of ""The Conjuring"") and Navy Intelligence cryptologists. They intercepted enemy radio messages and then predicted where they thought the Japanese might strike. Meantime, the film shifts from war councils to a rivalry between Navy aviators Wade McClusky (Luke Evans of ""Dracula Untold"") and Richard 'Dick' Best (Ed Skrein of ""Deadpool""), who commanded two bomb squadrons. Back at Pearl Harbor, Best's wife Ana (Mandy Moore of ""47 Meters Down"") worries about her husband.<br/><br/>Otherwise, ""Midway"" ranks as an old-fashioned World War II epic like ""The Longest Day"" (1962), the D-Day classic featuring a star-studded cast headlined by John Wayne. The battle of Midway is reminiscent of the desperate attack on the Death Star in George Lucas' classic sci-fi saga ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977). Lucas patterned ""Star Wars"" in some respects on several World War II era battles. At the time of this Pacific War battle, the U.S. Navy was struggling for survival against a clearly superior enemy that had out-numbered, out-gunned, and out-fought them. If you reviewed the battle on paper, the Japanese enjoyed an overwhelming edge. The Japanese were forged in fire and seasoned by experience, something their American adversaries lacked. Our planes couldn't match the legendary Japanese Zero fighter planes. These Zeroes descended in swarms onto the American pilots and shot them to ribbons. Just as Pearl Harbor had been a military intelligence failure for America, the Japanese underestimated not only the American fighting spirit but also our unwillingness to capitulate. Early in ""Midway,"" Japanese Admiral Yamamoto describes the U.S. as ""a sleeping giant"" waiting to be awakened. Yamamoto knew Japan couldn't survive a drawn-out war with America and its industrial superiority. Therefore, he planned Midway as a stroke to destroy what remained of the U.S. Navy fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Midway"" (1976), Emmerich and Took have put the famous battle into the context of World War II. Layton chats with Yamamoto before the Japanese created the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."" Later, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor without warning and sink the battleship U.S.S. Arizona. Best loses a beloved Annapolis roommate. Meanwhile, Admiral William F. Halsey (Dennis Quaid of ""Wyatt Earp""), suffers from a mysterious skin ailment, and Nimitz packs him off to the hospital. He replaces Halsey with Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Webber of ""Meet Joe Black"") who distinguishes himself, despite his lack of knowledge about aircraft carriers. The combat aerial scenes are breathtaking, especially when we are looking over a tail assembly of an American SBD Dauntless dive bomber before it plunges from several thousand feet to bomb a Japanese carrier. Clocking in at two hours and 18 minutes, ""Midway"" teems with fascinating details. For example, U.S. torpedoes were unreliable. Often, they bounced harmlessly off the hulls of Japanese ships without exploding. War movie buffs, military veterans, and historians are going to salute ""Midway"" for its factual approach and its meticulous reenactment."
"adam-kear","4","52","138","6 November 2019"," Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour was a masterpiece after all
","It's a hollow, vacuous and impersonal dramatisation of an integral Pacific battle that ultimately makes Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour a comparative masterpiece! Seriously, what did you expect from the man who directed 2012 and Universal Soldier?<br/><br/>At least Pearl Harbour had panache. Midway is a soulless experience that lacks even the faintest flicker of a visual flair. Viewers are taken through the events of December 1941 as a means to explain how it led up to the Battle of Midway between America and Japan in June 1942.<br/><br/>On paper at least, Roland Emmerich, as the master of disaster, was probably the best man to handle and choreograph the carnage of Midway. However, he relies on a jarring overuse of shoddy Chinese CGI that desperately lacks the practical authenticity of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. I realise however, that due to the sheer scale of destruction that occurred at Midway, a minimal use of CGI would have proved virtually impossible. But it didn't have to look so cheap and distracting.<br/><br/>The effects however, were not nearly as distracting as Nick Jonas or likewise, Woody Harrelson's wig. Characters are threadbare and underdeveloped. Ed Skrein (Deadpool) is oddly miscast as Lt. Dick Best (Dick Best, I mean really?), a steely do-or-die squadron leader with a dubious and unconvincing New Jersey accent.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid and Mandy Moore are all fine in their thankless roles but it's the majority of the other characters, including Dick Best (stop sniggering!), that are annoying and cliched caricatures that are high on the fumes of American patriotism and gung-ho jingoism. Not only that but the dialogue is conventional and expositional at best and toe curling at its worst.<br/><br/>It's not all terrible though! Firstly, the runtime is mercilessly shorter than Pearl Harbour whilst some of the action is, on occasions, quite exciting. It's also, for the most part, historically accurate but it was the sensitive portrayal of the Japanese that surprised me most. Unlike their American onscreen adversaries, they are not caricatures of themselves.<br/><br/>But none of that is not nearly enough to outweigh the criticisms, which is a shame because Midway is an important story of WW2 that deserves to be told, just like Dunkirk, D-Day, Stalingrad and the Battle of the Bulge. Emmerich was not the right man to tell this story.<br/><br/>3.5/10"

","I was all set to go see this movie on Veterans Day weekend.
However, after watching the preview clip, I had second thoughts about going.
First, it shows twin-engine Japanese bombers bombing the US carriers at Midway.
They look like Mitsubishi 3GM ""Nell.""
Although in service with the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1935-1945, they were land, not carrier-based aircraft.
The closest Japanese-held airbase for them to take off from would have been at Wake Island.
With a range of some 2,400 miles, the could have flown the 2,054 nautical miles from Wake to Midway and back, with 346 miles to spare.
However, Wake's airfield at that time would have been too small to handle a large number of land-based twin-engine aircraft.

Unlike Dunkirk for example where you see empty beaches while in WWII documentaries you see the beaches are packed with soldiers, Midway is pretty much very realistic and it got the facts straight.<br/><br/>Overall, a must see for those who can enjoy a WWII movie and I think one of the best WWII movie about air fights during WWII."

"itsbobr","10","4","6","20 February 2020"," Perhaps the most complete telling of the Battle of Midway
","The Battle of Midway starts with the invasion of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 7 December 1941. From a statement in the beginning of the movie, ""The Battle of Midway turned the tide of the war in the Pacific.""<br/><br/>This is a more complete story because of the expertise of the code breakers, numerous books about Midway and the people involved. But also because Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and his cryptologists who surmised that AF is the Japanese code for Midway and another clue mentions the water supply (at AF) is down. Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) is impressed and goes with that info and now knows the Japanese target is Midway.<br/><br/>The CGI in here is most incredible and credit must be given to the person who edited all the aerial fight scenes. Kudos.<br/><br/>Notables: Ed Skrein as Dick Best, a cocky pilot under Commander McClusky (Luke Evans); Patrick Wilson as Edwin Layton an intelligence analyst and aid to Adm Nimitz; Mandy Moore as Ann Best, wife of Dick Best; Dennis Quaid as Admiral Halsey; Aaron Eckhart as Jimmy Doolittle; Nick Jonas as Bruno Guido, a seaman promoted for jumping into a plane and firing and destroying a Japanese fighter plane and who also was captured by the Japanese who wanted information from him and he insulted the Japanese officer who threw him overboard with an anchor tied to his feet; Tadanobu Asano as Japanese Admiral Yamaguchi; Etsushi Toyokawa as Japanese Admiral Yamamoto; Geoffrey Blake as Movie Director John Ford who was in the process of making a movie on Midway when the Japanese attacked.<br/><br/>Ed Skrein as Dick Best is given most screen time in here and he is quite a character. But my vote for any Oscar goes to Woody Harrelson as Admiral Nimitz. As I have said before, when Woody Harrelson is in a movie, just give him the Oscar for Best Actor and move on. He is always that good. Got it?<br/><br/>The cinematography is simply outstanding. It's like you are actually there in every battle scene. Am glad this wasn't in 3-D otherwise I may have had to check myself into the ER. Might anyway. The pacing is excellent and there are no long drawn out CGI battles.<br/><br/>I remember the MIDWAY movie with Charlton Heston back in the day. In that movie I recall that Navy Pilot, George Gay, played by Kevin Dobson was shot down and watched the Battle of Midway from the water. I mention this because George Gay was from my hometown and later became a pilot for TWA. But no George Gay in this one. I kind of missed it.<br/><br/>Watching this movie I can only hope that all who see this movie are reminded that very brave men and women fought in these battles and allow us to live the way we do because of their heroics. God Bless them all. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Hey, this is war.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: There are some good lines in here.
Language: One S-word and one F-bomb.

","An entertaining film though try to throw too much into mix. Meaning little detail and bouncing from one ill explained battle to another. The movie was called Midway yet encompasses Pearl Harbour, The Battle of The Coral Sea, the Doolittle raid on Tokyo and also the battle of Midway.

"Dan-332","10","4","6","17 November 2019"," Emmerich did his homework!
","As a student of history, whose interest was originally piqued as a kid by the 1976 version of Midway (which told a great story, with great actors, but was also one rolling anachronism with little attention to historical accuracy or detail), I was completely mesmerized.<br/><br/>There are multiple histories written about the USS Enterprise (the CV-6 tragically sold for scrap in New Jersey in the early 1960s, after naval service equalled only by the USS Constitution); the Navy air groups that flew off of her; and the first seven months of the Pacific Theater of World War II - and it is apparent that Tooke and Emmerich have read all of them.<br/><br/>The level of historical detail throughout - from the tension b/t the Japanese Army and Navy about the wisdom of going to war with the US, the hazards (and casualties) of early flight training in SBDs and Devastators, the Feb 1942 hit and run raids on the Marshall's and Gilbert's, the execution of 250,000 Chinese suspected to have hidden the Doolitle Raiders from the Japanese after bombing Tokyo - was remarkable, without even getting to the Midway battle scenes. And of course, I was impressed when they showed a doomed B-26 just miss wiping out the Akagi's bridge at the outset (history says the plane was flown by Herbert Mayes and a crew of 5 from Midway).<br/><br/>I had to warm up to Woody Harrellson as Chester Nimitz, esp. when Henry Fonda was my previous point of reference, but by the end, I thought the casting was well done on both sides. Patrick Wilson was terrific playing Edwin Layton - Emmerich hit the nail on the head not inventing any stories to try and make the movie more interesting. The history of the time was the story, Layton was perfectly positioned to see it then, and this movie tells it really well.<br/><br/>I could go on about this movie, but just ignore the critics (if you didn't grow up on this history, you'll never be able to appreciate the commitment to accuracy and detail that went into it) and just go see it. I'm grateful that someone finally got the story straight."

"alindsay-al","8","4","6","15 November 2019"," A Great War Film
","I am usually a big fan of war films so I was excited to see Midway and I have to say I really enjoyed the experience of watching this film. The premise of the film sees after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour a group of US Forces have to predict the Japanese next attack and hit them first. Ed Skrein plays the main character in this film and I thought he did a really good job in the film, usually he has been known as a good supporting actor but he steps up here and I thought did a good job in the lead. I cared about his character and he was a protagonist that was easy to sympathise with along with a huge cast of good performances. Patrick Wilson plays a big character in this film as the head of intelligence and I thought he did a really good job, you just see how the pressure is affecting him throughout the movie and he was an interesting character in this film. Luke Evans is one of my favourite actors and he does a really good job in the film, Skrein and him have some tension in the film but you can tell their is respect there and you do still care about his character. Woody Harrelson and Aaron Eckhart have smaller roles in this film and they both fit their roles well. Alos a shout out to the Japanese actors who do really good work with the material that is given. The story is your usual War film and does a good job of making you care about the American heroes and their plight. However, I felt like for a part the film tries to make this film from a bit of a balanced perspective between the US and Japan but then the film moves away from it and makes the Japanese seem evil and The US as the conquering heroes which I thought was a missed opportunity. The script has some really good drama in it and a nice use of humour to flesh out the characters, I also liked how their was a strong use of Japanese as it actually made sense for the film. The style is visually pretty stunning, the battle scenes look absolutley brilliant and they will keep your eyes on the screen. But I felt like this film had a bit of a pacing issue keeping you fully invested in the whole of the film, including the film going a bit longer then was unneccessary. Overall this is a great tribute to the real life events and a great action film that is worth a watch."

","I guess I can report on the obvious efforts to make everything look so real, as many others have pointed, which would not add much to what was already stated.<br/><br/>I would like to address the claim from someone that there was an 'obvious error' in having McCluskey not having lost his bomb (it was Max Leslie from the Yorktown, who is not portrayed in the movie, who lost his bomb due to a fault in the arming mechanism).<br/><br/>The over-Hollywood things that caused the loss of one star is the dramatic dead stick landing of the last plane well after everyone else came back (I mean, come on, everyone took off at the same time, went to attack the same ship; coming back well after everyone else means he would have needed to stop somewhere...), the fact that Nimitz learned as a pleasant surprise the deception of having the enemy report on the loss of water processing capability on Midway (Nimitz was notified from the beginning, as he had to authorize the preparation of the fake report), and (probably an oversight that most everyone would have missed) the fact that a ship as large as an aircraft carrier exploding would still have the report come a second later than the flash, since sound is still propagating at, well, the speed of sound.<br/><br/>On the (very very) positive plus side: the almost maniacally accurate depiction of the aircraft and ships, a selection of actors that is apparently not based on the star status of the actor but on the fact that, with the proper haircut, those actors are jaw-dropping doppelganger of the real historical figures. When I first heard Woody Harrelson would be portraying Chester Nimitz, I had doubts. But see the pictures? Holy smoke! That's HIM!<br/><br/>That film should have been longer, there is so much that happened that is not shown (the amazing work of Yorktown's damage control crew, who managed to keep operational a ship that kept getting hit; the CAP fighters protecting the fleet and escorting the waves of attack planes, with their Thach Weave that helped balance the superior speed and maneuverability of the A6M Zero), but I assume a film long enough to do justice to all the action would reduce the number of showing per screen... Well, hopefully, there will be a 2 DVD edition some day..."

You get a good history lesson on the first six months of the Pacific war, the portrayal of the intelligence efforts to set the stage for the battle is well done, the acting is decent for this kind of epic movie, and the CGI effects are excellent. Some of the battle scenes are actually terrifying, even though you know how events are going to turn out. Is it a perfect movie? Of course not, some of the inevitable war movie cliches crop up, and some facts get fudged, such as where the actions of U.S. fighter planes in the battle, as noted by others, are completely omitted, but still a good, respectable effort."

"kmsmith-61353","6","4","6","10 November 2019"," Overly dramatic acting left what could have been a serious story into something cartoonish
","Went in expecting a version of ""Pearl Harbor"" minus the romance. Went out wondering, perhaps alongside the romance, the editing dept. got snip-happy and hacked the film apart, only to have to tape it all back together again without much attention. Hard to follow even with BIG PRINT on the screen, as more often then not, those scenes were on the vast Pacific, not much to help the audience; planes, ships, submarines were suddenly one place before appearing/disappearing with little comprehension/logic.<br/><br/>When the main actor, playing the role of Dick Best is unlikeable due to a fifties actor mockery, all brash, every word delivered from the side of his mouth, more hammed than all of Easter, yet none of the underlying charisma, can't invest much emotion. Nick Jonas matched in over-stated cheese'mo. Woody Harrelson was doing his best Bruce Willis impression, making that same Bruce face - no real effort at acting, a semi-smile leaking out of every shot. Real shame as I love Woody.<br/><br/>Squeezed in a subplot about bombing Tokyo, with even a tighter fit, landing in China and squeezing in a scene that would get it onto the Chinese big screen. Unnatural.<br/><br/>Code breakers bit could have been interesting. Editing could have made sense and not assumed the audience would fill in the blanks as would fans of Pacific military engagements.<br/><br/>No reason a movie, a re-make, which was shooting for historic accuracy, couldn't have been well played on the big screen. Does an actor; director; producer ever sit back and watch the final product and sink into their chair and whisper, ""WTF, that's not how I imagined it would come out?"""

"BA_Harrison","6","7","13","8 November 2019"," You sunk my battleship!
","Midway is not just the name of the place where a historic WWII sea battle took place between the Americans and the Japanese, it's also the point in this film where I realised I didn't know what was going on. Director Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, 2012) is obviously no slouch when it comes to action scenes, bringing us some truly astonishing battle sequences that provide much bang for your buck, but he struggles to tell his complex historical story with any coherence.<br/><br/>As the movie cuts back and forth between the American and Japanese forces, with numerous ships, locations, characters, and much detailed wartime strategy to take in, it's easy to lose track of what's what and, more importantly, who is who, making it hard to feel anything when they meet their inevitable fate in a ball of flames and twisted metal (the most emotional part of the whole film comes right at the end when photos with captions show the real-life people who were instrumental in the battle).<br/><br/>Of course, those who are watching, not for a history lesson or for heart-rending pathos, but for thrilling scenes of destruction and derring-do, are more than catered for with countless huge explosions, plenty of machine-gun fire and loads of impressive aerial combat. While most of this is realised through the use of CGI, it's well-handled and, for the most part, very convincing.<br/><br/>5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Japan's World War II goal was to devastate the United States Navy fleet in the South Pacific, thereby securing the area as their own and crippling the U.S. military beyond hope. The December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor was the first step and the most infamous. Over the next few months, what followed were the Raid on Tokyo (April 1942), Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942) and the Battle of Midway (June 1942). Stating that these battles changed the war is not an understatement, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had previously been viewed as superior (especially after the destruction at Pearl Harbor). Director Roland Emmerich (THE PATRIOT, INDEPENDENCE DAY) has never met a war or explosion or special effect he didn't like, so we know going in that, given the subject matter and the filmmaker, the screen will be filled with action.<br/><br/>Emmerich co-wrote the script with Wes Tooke (his first feature script), and as with many WWII movies, it acts as a history lesson on a war that changed the world. This one focuses on naval strategy and particularly on the individuals who defined courage and heroism ... many names we recognize from history books. The contrast between Japanese military leaders and United States military leaders is on full display, and it's no surprise that the Japanese leaders are mostly portrayed as cold and calculating, while the U.S. leaders come across as more humanistic and resourceful. Pride is evident on both sides - it's just displayed differently.<br/><br/>The players are crucial to the story. Woody Harrelson plays Admiral Chester Nimitz, Dennis Quaid is Vice Admiral ""Bull"" Halsey (commander of aircraft carrier USS Enterprise), Patrick Wilson is Intelligence Officer Lieutenant Commander Edwin Layton, Jake Weber is Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance, Luke Evans is Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky, Brennan Brown plays Joseph Rochefort (leader of the code breaker team), and Aaron Eckhart is Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, the extraordinary pilot who led the Raid on Tokyo in April 1942. On the Japanese side, Tadanabu Asano plays Rear Admiral Yamaguchi (commander of the aircraft carrier Hiryu), Jun Kunimura is Admiral Nagumo (he of questionable battle decisions), and Enushi Toyokawa plays Admiral Yamamoto, the most dignified and influential of the Japanese leaders.<br/><br/>Much of the story is told from the perspective of naval pilot Lieutenant Dick Best (Ed Skrein, DEADPOOL). While personal stories and challenges faced by individuals makes for a relatable story for viewers, there is something about this particular actor that comes across as awkward and difficult to bond with. There is no doubting the character and courage of Dick Best as a pilot; however, Skrein's performance is flat out annoying and distracting. The dive bombing missions are breathtaking and thrilling, but overall the liberal use of green screen for effects detracts from the realistic looks we've come to expect for war movies.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore as Anne Best, and Nick Jonas as a mechanic, are cast for relatability by viewers, but the value in the film comes from an easy-to-follow description of the contrasting strategies of the two militaries. It's also a reminder that the ""big"" story of WWII is comprised of many individual stories of people ... people who were brave and heroic in a time of need. So ignore the cheesy affects, unrealistic dialogue, and irritating performances, and instead take in the work and actions of those who saved the world."

","In terms of the Spirit and realism of WWII the characters were real and loyal to the spirits and souls they represented. They say that great men, and women, rise to their best when when times are at their worst. That was certainly true for those involved during the Battle of Midway.<br/><br/>Still, the folks responsible for making the movie, the CGIs, made one big mistake. During the opening scenes of the battle of Midway one sees a large flight of two engine bombers going after the Japanese carriers. Problem is that Midway never had any two engine bombers. They only, ever, had the larger and heavier, four engine B-17 bombers. And, they were awfully happy to have them. The two engine bombers were B-25s just as were flown from the carriers when Tokyo was bombed. No B-17 ever took off from a carrier and no B-25 ever took off from Midway.<br/><br/>Also, Dan McClusky did not follow a Japanese destroyer back to the Japanese fleet. He made an educated guess that turned out to be right. God was with him that day.<br/><br/>Finally everyone should know that the name of the downed flyer who floated around in his life vest watching the big show was Ensign George Gay. He survived the war.<br/><br/>I know these things because my 100 year old father-in-law flew bombers for the Army Air Force .

","What is the deal with the cgi in this film. When there are now films like saving private Ryan, Dunkirk and 1917. How can the director think using 100% studio cgi was something that would go down in history as a Great War film while at the same time paying tribute to the veterans. If you can't be bothered using real planes and real ships and real actors don't make a movie! Tripe!"
"cruise01","6","6","12","9 November 2019"," Lots of action to make this worth watching but lacking in a good script.
","Midway (3 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Midway is a fair war film delivered by Roland Emmerich who makes films that are big blockbuster action movies. Midway is not a great war movie or a great film in general. It delivers on plenty of action sequences with aerial combat. Realistically it is no Dunkirk with the realism on the practical stunts than having actors sit in a stage production with all visual effects. The visual effects are decent. The script lacks in delivering characters that stands out. The story was okay about the Battle of Midway. Roland Emmerich's focuses on building the action suspense but not leaving any satisfaction in the end. I feel like this film does make Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor feeling like a masterpiece when it comes to a story with a forced love story, better action and aerial combat that puts you on the edge of your seat, and the emotional impact you have with the victims and soldiers that was under attack.<br/><br/>What worked great with Midway? Well for a war film, Roland Emmerich does pack a punch with having a lot action in it. The cinematography was good and making you feel like you are with the pilots in the fighter planes. The opening sequence with Pearl Harbor being attacked tried to set the tone of the film. It was not as powerful like Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. The rest of the film focuses on Dick (Ed Skrein) flying in the air, and getting into a lot of aerial combat with the Japanese. Dick is a cowboy, and cocky personality who flies and living on the edge when he is dive bombing. Evantually, the action sequences with aerial scenes do get repetitive. Dick and his other fighters flying high and dive bombing into a Japanese carrier. Hoping their missiles hit their ships.<br/><br/>The film has a great cast ensemble. Sadly, none of the actors have room to develop their characters. Ed Skrein, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Nick Jonas, and Aaron Eckhart. None of the characters have a characterization which makes them standout. The script lacks in delivering actual people who went through these events. Instead, the film makes every character forgettable.<br/><br/>The plot about the battle of Midway is a great feature to be brought onto film. After Pearl Harbor, Americans sent out several carriers to aid in Midway. Which American fighter pilots were trying to stop the Japanese carriers from beginning another attack. The movie lacks in delivering an emotional story when it is too focused on bringing flat characters from one set piece to another. Then, having the repetitive aerial battle throughout the two hour time frame.<br/><br/>Overall, Midway is a fair war film. It delivers a lot of action and aerial combat. The visual effects are a little decent. The actors are forgettable with their characters from a shallow script. The story is lacking emotional depth with the characters."

","I quite enjoyed Midway: it is actually a solid, very watchable movie, professionally crafted, rich with spectacular scenes.
Point is, it also is a very, very conventional movie; Midway is not able to propose one single fresh, surprising scene - let alone concept - apart from the usual orgy of CGI. The movie proposes such an unlikely quantity of incredible heroic acts to make heroism a commodity. The actors performances are also quite professional, but they are terribly retro, vintage...Midway actually could have been a phenomenal ""colossal movie"" of the 50' or 60's.
So, I enjoyed it today and I am sure I will have forgotten it tomorrow..."

"nimiipu","5","4","7","23 February 2020"," Review of Movie
","My opinion is of the movie and not how accurate the movie is historically. The battle scenes were more like a video game some showing some impossible and ridiculous maneuvers by both aircraft and ships. there was some poor casting thus bad acting on the part of the amateur actors. A lot of the actors lines were quite juvenile and seemed aimed at a high school type audience. I would not recommend this movie for those reasons."
"likkitysplit-19261","4","4","7","23 February 2020"," Great Eye-Candy
","This movie, which most say is historically correct, really isn't. There's no way anybody from either the Enterprise or the Hornet could look off the flight deck of either ship and see the Yorktown creeping up behind them on their way to Midway. It left Pearl long after the other two and was way under speed as it was still being repaired on the fly. When Halsey shows up with the Enterprise at Coral Sea, it's stated that ""the Enterprise and the Hornet are the only two carriers left in the Pacific"". Wrong. The Yorktown's entire story is missing, and as far as Midway is concerned it's one of the most crucial parts. The Yorktown was bombed something horrible at Coral Sea but limped back to Pearl under tow. Then it's repaired and was hit TWICE by Japanese attacks at Midway. And due to the excellent fire and damage control crews of the Yorktown, (which weren't even mentioned) they thought they had hit two separate carriers. Then, even after being hit twice, the Yorktown still manages to exit the combat area under tow, but is leaving an oil slick a quarter of a mile wide. Japanese submarine I-168 finds her and torpedoes the Yorktown before being run off by escort ships. The Yorktown was never sunk by the Japanese, the Americans scuttled it themselves. I did appreciate the lack of any silly love story, but where were Thatch's fighters? What about Ens. George Gay? Midway sends an erroneous radio dispatch about their fresh water condenser without being told to do so? And who can pick up an anchor by themselves and toss it overboard? There's a reason they're used to secure ships, because they weigh a ton. And why was Spruance told to maintain radio silence? They were at sea, in a battle (?) As a historian of the Pacific Campaign, I was truly disappointed that some of the real heroes weren't given adequate credit, or mentioned at all. Namely the entire Yorktown story, which, in effect, sacrificed itself at Midway after being risen from the dead at Coral Sea."

","Wow! The greatest sea battle movie ever made. Can't understand how anyone could complain about anything. Being extremely familiar with the history of events, I didn't expect Hollywood to come close to accuracy, but I was pleasantly surprised. Acting and SFX were as good as it gets. Before seeing the movie, I had read a few complaints about the CG. Now I'm wondering why? The special effects were truly excellent, never seen better. No film before has ever provided a movie-goer with such a realistic naval aviator perpective of attacking an enemy ship. The movie highlights the complexity of war, the risks, importance of military intelligence, and the heroic actions of the American military. No movie is perfect, but this is as close as it gets. I see plenty of pointless, fictional, meaningless movies--some are enjoyable to watch (especially sci-fi), but they are no comparison to the real-life story of Midway, which will go down as one of the greatest war movies ever made. See it now on the big screen! And celebrate the warriors who turned the tide of war in the Pacific in 1943!"
"aniljoshi100","9","4","7","16 November 2019"," Surprisingly wonderful film
","The story of Battle of Midway during the World War II in 1942 has been very effectively conveyed on the big screen this time by Roland Emmerich. He is back again lifting up a few notches higher from his recent films nearly back to his best.<br/><br/>The graphics have been used very well and apt to the storyline. Film's screenplay is tight holding the audience throughout the length of the film. Its a very good war film without pushing all the nationalistic feelings that some others have done in the past giving a fairly balanced view from both American and Japanese perspective.<br/><br/>Ed Skrein and Patrick Wilson have portrayed very well and so has Nick Jonas.<br/><br/>Well worth watching this one."
"CANpatbuck3664","6","4","7","16 November 2019"," Midway Barrel Rolls Away from Being Good or Bad and Flies Straight Down the Middle
","I've taken my share of WW2 history but I never had to study the battle of Midway. So I walked into this fairly fresh and one of the more pleasant surprises was the more balanced look this movie presented. There's no confusing which side the movie is on but humanizing the antagonists always helps the drama sink in a little deeper and it helps sell how devastating this period of WW2 was. The actors playing the Japanese command (e.g. Etsushi Toyokawa and Tadanobu Asano) are given a lot of material to chew on and they succeed in getting you to at least look at their side of things. You still get the elements of cheering on the Americans (which is what most of the movie going public wants to see) but a bigger picture point of view is a unique element for Midway.<br/><br/>Midway boasts a surprisingly large cast, its not full of a lot of A-list actors, but you've seen all these people working in mid-large budget releases or in some well reviewed TV dramas. Leading the cast is charming but unfortunately miscast Ed Skrein. He's normally playing a villain and I was intrigued to see him go a different direction. He's working hard here but he doesn't seem to fit what this movie is going for. It doesn't help that his accent is pretty rough, hopefully he'll bounce back. Woody Harrelson is the type of performer who can elevate substandard material but he's not putting much into his interpretation of Nimitz. Nick Jonas is fine as Bruno, he's a better actor than I thought he would be but considering his background in music, he's hard to buy as a tough guy type. Much like Harrelson, there's a lot of workmanlike effort put in here (Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart come to mind). That doesn't make the acting bad, they're all performers that are easy to like, the acting just isn't something to write home about in Midway. I'd credit Patrick Wilson and Dennis Quaid for being the most effective (even if Quaid just growls through 90% of his scenes, at least he's good at it?).<br/><br/>Emmerich has a more varied career as a director than you would think, but his main claim to fame is his big budget disaster flicks. You don't get those opportunities without knowing how to use special effects to deliver the goods on some action scenes (the overall quality of the movies... that's a different story). The movie didn't start well, I found the attack on Pearl Harbour to be underwhelming when it came to the action but there was plenty of movie still left to go. The scenes with Skrein's character in a dogfight or manoeuvring to dive bomb enemy ships were pretty intense and they really play up the chaotic nature of the battle. Everything is covered in smoke, shrapnel, or fire and it serves as another reminder that war is h#!! The movie delivered the thrills more regularly as it went on and by the end, I got what I wanted out of Midway.<br/><br/>Midway falls into a category of movie that's tough to write about. Its hard to make pointed arguments or have poignant opinions about a mediocre movie. The really good ones and the really bad ones are the easiest to write about, its the movies that leave you shrugging your shoulders when you leave the theatre that really stall your creative impulses. This is a tough genre to stand out in too, there's so many great war movies, you really have bring something shocking or affecting to the table to grab the public's attention. Emmerich's ability to work with CGI and experience shooting big set pieces keep this movie afloat. Providing more context by showing the situation from both sides is also a nice bonus to Midway. But conversely there's the cliche dialogue, the middle of the road acting and the long running time dragging it down. I'm not shocked that Midway has surprised in theatres but I could have waited for Netflix and had a similar experience viewing it. The big action scenes are cool but nothing screamed ""I had to see this in a theatre!"" If I hadn't seen this with a good friend, I would have called it a disappointment. Its hard to recommend Midway with being over 2.25 hours long but I wouldn't stop you from checking it out. I'd avoid paying full price and just catch it on your preferred streaming service."
"coyotetwp-1","10","4","7","13 November 2019"," Accurate telling of the Story!
","Unlike many productions from Hollywood now days, this movie stuck to the facts. It probably did a better telling of the story than the 1976 version of ""Midway"". The actors and Director deserve a big congratulation on this production. It is well worth watching and learning about this pivotal Battle of World War II, often considered one of six most important naval battles in history.<br/><br/>Their interpretation of the men and women who fought and lived through this event was very well done. There were no hollywood prima donnas among the actors or their protral of the real men and women who lived this event. Unlike Hollywood's previous retelling of a crucial battle in World War II (""Pearl Harbor"" which was a poor attempt of remaking ""Tora! Tora!

This didn't seem the type of role for him given his prior filmography; however his physical likeness was close enough. Every time I saw Woody I expected some kind of goofiness to come out of this film, but he kinda proved some versatility here. Still... Anyhow, a truer tribute to those who fought, died, yet won this crucial battle in the Pacific. Anything below an 8 rating on this film is placed on ""ignore""..."

I'd go as far as to say I'd rather watch this version because it's at least more fun to watch. Then again, I didn't walk into this movie expecting an amazing deep movie.

"rkramden-14425","8","4","7","11 November 2019"," Not bad, actually
","All things considered, this was a pretty good genre flick. The story was elementary, men in war. With not a lot of needless psychiatric expose, Basic in the ""guys caught in a maelstrom, with no choice but to do as they're trained to do""vein. Not a lot of soul searching or wrestling with the deadly, dangerous task at hand. If you're looking for ""Platoon"" keep looking. This is more in the vein of ""Private Ryan"" without the nervous tremors.<br/><br/>The dialog for the most part exists only to advance the story. Some of the dialogue is reduced to period piece, Gung Ho, rubbish, but it's not important to the narrative.<br/><br/>The effects were adequate for the settings. There is the slight feel of computer combat flight sim to much of it. A lot of exploding airplanes and ships and a blizzard of anti-aircraft fire. A cacophony of explosions. Perhaps a little overcooked, but, hey, it's Hollywood and everyone was having fun.<br/><br/>The cast was interesting. Harrelson was adequate as Nimitz as was Quaid as Halsey. Neither had a big stretch to make. Patrick Wilson as Ed Layton was underwhelming. Frankly, I thought he was not nerdy enough for his role. The rest of the cast did their part. The story was the star in this picture. Except for Ed Skrein, who absolutely nailed the role of Dick Best. A lot has been said about his accent with some of the Corporate critics calling him out for his ""Jersey"" accent. Let me tell you, the accent was absolutely perfect. Perfect to a point where, being a native of New Jersey, I guessed the location of Best's actual home within 10 miles, only on the basis of Skrein's acting. Best was from Bayonne, NJ, but I didn't know that until I looked it up, I had guessed Newark. And then to learn Skrien is a Brit, well, Bravo, sir, well done."

","First Hit: Besides being too long, I didn't like and couldn't engage with the main character Dick Best (Ed Skrein).<br/><br/>As portrayed here, Best was a pilot that liked breaking the rules, thought highly of himself and his skills, and eventually, his arrogance, depicted as bravery, helped to win the war over Japan at Midway.<br/><br/>I don't know what it was, but if another actor played Best, I might have engaged more with this character. Actors from another time who would have made this role work would be Steve McQueen or Paul Newman. These guys had a way of being edgy but likable.<br/><br/>There are other issues with this film that stood out as well. There were whole sections that were supposed to color the background but seemed needless. Additionally, the strategic planning of the attack on Midway became muddled.<br/><br/>On a positive note, many of the action scenes were well choreographed and exciting to watch.<br/><br/>This film is about how the battle of Midway became the turning point of the Pacific War between the United States and Japan. Early on, we see Pearl Harbor being bombed. This was particularly effective and was well depicted with the surprise and the panic that set in after the attack.<br/><br/>The US goal was to hit back at Japan in a way that would have them rethink their choice to attach the United States.<br/><br/>The key players in this story are Best, Lieutenant Commander Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson), who was an intelligence officer, and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Woody Harrelson). Layton had developed data, with a team of intelligence analysts, that gave him a hunch that the Pearl Harbor attack was coming. Nimitz had heard about Layton's ideas and after his assignment to head the Pacific Fleet, he told Layton to bring him information that would allow his decimated fleet to execute a surprise counterattack.<br/><br/>Midway was that surprise attack. In addition to this story, there were side stories. One was about Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid), who was the on-boat commander of the aircraft carrier leading the fleet. He had a horrible case of shingles, which eventually put him out of commission. There was also a story about Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) who first bombed Japan, and because the way the mission worked out, he and his entire squadron had to ditch their planes because they ran out of fuel.<br/><br/>There are also sweet scenes with Best and his wife Anne (Mandy Moore), one of the few who understood and embraced her husband's erratic intensity. There are also depictions of Japanese ship commanders and Admirals, which are brief and attempt to show the ignorance of and blind devotion to the war effort as commanded by their emperor.<br/><br/>Skrein was not likable as Best. What I don't know was it Skrein or his character I didn't like or want to champion. Eckart, in the bombing of Japan side story, was solid as Doolittle. Wilson was excellent as the intelligence officer Layton. The scene where he is pressed for the details on the theory of a Midway attack by the Japanese was powerful. Harrelson gave a strong performance as Nimitz. His belief in his team, especially Layton, was well executed. Quaid was good as Halsey, a ""bull"" of a man. Moore was excellent as the trusting and understanding wife of the film's wildcard character. Wes Tooke wrote a meandering script that seemed to take in too many stories. Roland Emmerich had an excellent eye for many of the action scenes, but the story seemed to take too large a bite.<br/><br/>Overall: Because I couldn't get into the main character, the film fell flat."

","War is hell a wise person once said, and in many ways we the general public have no idea what it was like on those battlegrounds where so many sacrificed so much. Fortunately for many of us, the movies have offered a glimpse into the world, opening our eyes to the world that cares little of its soldiers in regards to decency and humane treatment. Many of these films are often about the action, and while not as prominent as they once were back in the day, they still offer some intense views of history. Past this introduction, this weekend, yet another historical remake is flying in to make a landing, in hopes of wowing the group once more with its depiction of the great war. Robbie K here with yet another review as we look into:<br/><br/>Movie: Midway (2019)<br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>The Modern Technology Prowess
Multiple Aspect providing different viewpoints
The Intensity Of Some War Scenes
The Decent Acting
The Intelligence Aspect<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Disjointed Plot
Too many Perspectives
The Semi Forced Love Story
The Choppiness of the scenes
Semi-sloppy use of big names
The Action Scenes<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Modern technology allows us to make things more realistic and engaging, and should in theory lead to better fights. In a way Midway accomplishes this by bringing the chaos with speaker booming effects, special effects that light up the screen, and dances with planes that once relied on plywood models. It is certainly the selling points of the trailers and should appeal to the modern audiences expectations as realism and style come together. This film though took a different approach compared to the previous theaters of war, not focusing so much on the action from America by itself, but instead dividing the focus between both parties involved. This dynamic is impressive to see because it helps show the strategy involved in something you have only read about in a history textbook, allowing for a different appreciation of the tactics in war. In fact, my favorite aspect, as well as my good buddy, both agreed that seeing the intelligence component involved with determining how to fight the Pacific campaign. Much of the film is dedicated to showing how codes were cracked, departments coordinated, and risks were taken to determine the best places to strike and this new perspective was very strongly placed. When the battles did finally occur, there are several moments where you get pulled into the intensity, feeling like you are part of the squad and in the cockpit during this operation. Nice editing on these parts, and quite an adrenaline rush at the times it works. Finally, the acting is not an issues in this film, as all personalities of war are brought in and everyone executes there roles quite well when they are on stage. I'm not saying Academy Award Level, but it's believable and appropriate for this film's approach.<br/><br/>For all its worth though, there are several limitations for this reviewer that make the film a little less impressive compared to its predecessors. For one thing, the film feels disjointed, as our time hops and evolution of war occur a little too frequently to necessarily keep track of everything. All the pesrpectives, while again interesting, also have too much going on, leading to breaking up a lot of scenes just as they start cooking with gas. The result is a rather contained movie that struggles to find the approach it wants, with choppy scenes that sort of scatter the coordination rather than unite it. This is especially true for the romance story they try to put in here, which was unnecessary giving the presentation and could have been left out. Throw in several attempts at character development, the potential bonds that can form between a number of characters, and even the squad mates themselves and you again get sort of piece meal presentations that did not achieve what Pearl Harbor did long ago. Once more, this reviewer feels part of this is due to how many big names they have, trying to get the most out of the big price tags that come with them. Midway's crew acts just fine, but there were so many missed elements and character interactions that I feel many of these people were unnecessary. Certainly they were able to point out all the contributions they did, but to deny the full fledged chemistry and quality, well that was the disappointment for me. Finally, the action scenes. An action junky like me always crave for cohesive battle scenes that utilize their groups well, something that the early war movies, and even some films like Saving Private Ryan knew how to do. In this one, all the perspectives and heroes were scattered that the action scenes felt again very sloppy and short, chopped up moments that ended too fast or how long it took to start. Again realistically it accomplishes the portrayal, but at this point and with what the trailers built up... I wanted more out of a modern day, technological behemoth like this one looked to be.<br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Let's wrap it up then shall we? Midway accomplishes the idea of putting modern faces in traditional stories, and this theater of wars proves that trying new things does not always come together for this reviewer. Sure, the technological advantages are good and all the actors recruited do their parts to bring the group of heroes to life and retell the legacies of men who faced the demons of war. I'll also again give them props for focusing a lot on the strategy and intelligence required to pull off the miracle that we did. However, all of these perspectives and approaches to the story made for what looked like a difficulty to focus on the story they wanted to tell. The result is again a disjointed movie that struggles to bring A games to any perspective, and relies on B and C graded stories. Your truly would have loved a little more action to come together, as the trailers promised, but at least the intelligence parts work together to make for an engaging plot. For special effects it qualifies for a theater visit, but outside of that, hold this one for home viewing instead.<br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Drama/War/History/Action: 6.5
Movie Overall: 6.0"

1917 is much better. An example of great writing, plotting and a story not so tread on. Let that moment rest, enough money has been made. Even Micheal Bay's pearl harbour was better then this, more heart towards the moment itself. Even in that movie it's CGI was heavy but for some reason in Midway it feels forced, burdened by it.
Roland should stick with aliens and gates to the stars. If you want mindless entertainment and graphics till your senses numb and your eyes bleed. If you've always wanted to see Nick Jonas with a dirt stash in the 1940's, this movie is all yours.

"soundoflight","5","3","5","23 December 2019"," Disappointing, reminds me of ""Pearl Harbor""
","For me, ""Midway"" is a frustrating film because the source material has so much potential but what we get is so lackluster in comparison. In many ways, I am reminded of the (awful) 2001 ""Pearl Harbor"" film, which was over-expository and spent far too much time creating and following around flimsy 1-dimensional characters that the viewer is supposed to care about (but really, we don't) in a series of tear-jerking moments as opposed to really telling the story of what happened that day. And despite the obvious lesson there, ""Midway"" inexplicably goes down the exact same path.<br/><br/>There is a youtube video by a user called 'montemayor' that explains the battle for Midway from a strategic point of view, and that video is unironically more compelling and entertaining then this film. The Japanese were faced with several really tough and crucial decision points on that day, and ""Midway"" managed to miss or ignore all of them. The main one of these, which the aforementioned video calls ""Nagumo's Dilemma"" is that he had a choice between launching strike aircraft against the American fleet or waiting to land and refuel his initial strike force against the island of Midway, and risk having to ditch the entire 97 plane force into the sea. He decided on the latter, and thus became a fat sitting duck with a hold stuffed with planes and bombs.<br/><br/>Instead on focusing on these compelling things, ""Midway"" gave us shots of weepy wives and what Admiral Nimitiz was up to. I'm surprised they didn't include the ""Admiral Nimitiz visits the lavatory"" scene. The battle scenes they did provide were confusing and video-game like (absolutely NOT realistic) in an attempt to dazzle the audience as opposed to the more difficult task of story-telling. I think the only hope one has of enjoying the film is if you are completely ignorant of the actual events of that day and can then attempt to enjoy the film 'as-is."" Also check out that youtube video, seriously."

"jackjack-2","1","2","3","30 March 2020"," A BAD REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE OR AS HAMMY AS THEY CAN GET!!
","This film should win the Raspberry Award for the worst film of the year. It is a cheap remake of the 1976 movie of the same name but which had real actors in the cast which this film did not. The cast consisted of would bes that probably were extras in high school dramas. The original film had a cast of Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, Glen Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum. James Coburn , Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert just to name a few. The best this film could come up with was a hamWoody Harellson who never could act his way out of a wet paper bag and is horribly amatuerish in this film.<br/><br/>I have a special interest in the Battle of Midway. As a youngster, my father was stationed on Midway when the war broke out. He survived a shelling on December 7 which was nothing compared to the pasting Midway took during the Battle of Midway while he was there. It was a very tense time for my mother and her children at this time.<br/><br/>About all the makers of the film achieve is some degree of accuracy in the details of the equipment shown in the film. The film uses a lot of special effects that were not available in the original film but the original film depicts the events more accurately and it was much easier to understand. One of the problems with this film, is it tries to go to far back to tell the story by trying to make an intelligence officer seem more prescient than he actually was. The film also tends to exaggeration in trying to make its heroes bigger heroes than they were. That was unnecessary because they were great heroes without any exaggeration.<br/><br/>One inaccuracy was the depiction of the Japanese killing a captured American aircraft crewman
by throwing him off a ship tied to an anchor. In fact, the Japanese would never have wasted a useful anchor and actually tied him to water filled fuel cans. Except for the execution, the scene like many in the film, is fiction because the only record of the execution was a brief entry in a ship's log. All three of the captured American airmen were similarly executed.<br/><br/>While the Battle of Midway was the beginning of the end of the war, one thing that is ignored in the film is as decisive as it was, it still could have been disastrous for the U.S. in that after the carrier warfare ceased, the Japanese had a very strong armada that could have easily taken Midway even though the Japanese no longer had any carriers. Even though the U.S. had two carriers left, neither had enough aircraft or crews to do anything to deter the Japanese had they chosen to continue their attack on Midway.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that people who want to watch a movie about the Battle of Midway should watch the 1976 version."

"jljacobi","6","2","3","14 February 2020"," Parts are decent, but amateurish and too fantastic
","This hopefully will replace my last review, which was a bit hasty. I still think the movie does the audience a disservice by not portraying the action as it actually happened, and that the characters are more more caricature than real, but there are moments. Over-dramatized moments, but moments where I didn't find it completely unworthy.<br/><br/>The air action is fantastical at best, with flights of planes in stupidly close proximity being shot down by Japanese AA fire, which in reality, was not very effective. Most planes were lost to Japanese fighters. I could go on, but realistic it ain't--more Star Wars than Pacific.<br/><br/>The backstory is actually very accurate, so kudos there, even if it is relayed in ham-handed fashion. Don't get me started on the ominous, melancholy soundtrack. The acting, given what there was to work with is actually quite good. But there really wasn't much to work with, and the mood is non-stop dark, as it the color treatment. The Pacific at that latitude is generally blue skies and bright sunlight. The color editors know that, don't they?<br/><br/>In short, this is yet another movie that relies on CGI rather than good dialog and assumes everyone has the sensibilities of a 13-year old. Actually, that's insulting to 13-year olds.<br/><br/>This is a great story that deserved to be told and shown more as it actually happened, but at least it was told. I'll give them that."

"ashwetherall1","6","2","3","1 February 2020"," Pretty historically accurate . But that's about it.
","I've just seen Midway and I must say that in terms of historical accuracy its better than the 1976 film of the same name and a better film than 2001'sPearl harbour, But that's not really saying much.
Although mostly accurate in presenting what happened Midway has some major flaws . For me these are the CGI battle sequences, many of which come off as looking very fake and video gameish. giving the film a sifi feel than an historic edge This tended to detract from the life and death situation that the film aims to present. The other flaw is the dialogue which is pretty awful. That said the actors do there very best with the inane lines they have to say.<br/><br/>Now that said. I did find myself enjoying Midway, because as I said It at least got many of its historic facts right and got almost everything covered in 2h 18 mins. I really liked the part where legendary Director John Ford is filming the Japanese attack on the island. I've seen the real footage and it was a nice addition to the story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Director Roland Emmerich should have used films like Tora Tora Tora, Patton and Saving private Ryan as a war movie blue prints than say Independence day and Star wars. This approach tended to make this viewer care less for the characters who die and the overall tension of situations presented.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly solid with the always reliable Patrick Wilson,Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson adding some gravitas. Ed Skrein and Luke Evans as the two action leads fair less well. This isn't because they are bad, in fact I like both actors. It 's just that they have been saddled with the worst parts of the script saying those cod macho lines that seem to find there way into mediocre action films. We know that they would have been  them selves in those situations and wouldn't have time to say "" this is for pearl? They just wanted to get the job done and get the hell out of there. Watch any documentary and that's what your told.<br/><br/>So to sum up. Midway isn't a bad film but with it could have been a truly great film in a different director at the helm. I would recommend this as a first stop to anyone who has a passing interest in the battle of Midway and then tell them to read some history books and watch some interviews with the brave men that fought for that little island."
"stankactorman","6","2","3","17 December 2019"," Lacks heart
","MIDWAY: A history lesson for those who don't know. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, brought the US into WWII. It's very apparent that the budget for this film was huge. But it wasn't spent on the biggest A-list cast, but rather on the battle sequences. Too bad they spent so much for so little: Ships and planes shooting at each other with the occasional torpedo launch; planes going down; battleships and aircraft carriers exploding; grimacing pilots trying to evade shells while still trying to remain on target; planes and pilots getting hit; bombs dropping. Except for the epilogue which summarized the lives of some of the major figures involved, this one doesn't touch us. The acting across the board is serviceable (no pun intended). The wives of the pilots are clones of each other. Something is missing from the depiction of the events, even though it's told from the perspective of the individuals involved on both sides. The direction is much more concerned with the action while slighting character and humanity and the sheer heroism of the pilots who flew those missions and the crews who supported them. We're not given the chance to connect with the characters. It's factual. The movie tells the story, but we're not involved, we're not moved, because the telling lacks heart. It's cold. Score: 6. Not worth it. The heroism is deserving of our upmost respect and honor. 12/16/19"

","Not familiar with the details or the art of war used in the battle of Midway but I will definitely be checking it out after watching this film. After watching this film I can't even imagine how all those people felt in the midst of such a battle. Seems like something terrifying and that feeling of watching those men in battle is what makes me think it is a good war film. It seems to go into detail regarding the occurrences of the battle and the ones that lead to it with almost all of the main characters having really existed (unlike the character of Ben Affleck in Pear Harbour for example).
On the other hand, the dialogue at some point seems a little cartoonish with characters saying or even behaving like what I would see in a cartoon or anime. It's normal that in cinema you often see people not behaving or talking like you see in real life but the film seemed to exaggerate at times.
The CGI are sufficient to transmit the feeling but not nearly enough for a film with a battle of this scale and historical importance lol. At times it seemed like the characters were looking at a screen with a movie playing (especially during the Pearl Harbour bombing scene).
But all in all, I recommend it for people who like war and/or historical movies."

If they, with FDR's concurrence, had not ignored Leyton's intelligence then Kimmell would have received and then made (different) preparations.<br/><br/>This policy, that intelligence had to be ""approved"" by Washington, was in an around about way, stated by Nimitz when he told Leyton ""If you think it's Midway, you need to get Washington to agree"".<br/><br/>Leyton was always upstanding and outstanding, same for Kimmell and his family and today's descendants (I am not one).

Action scenes are pretty intense, and give you quite the experience of making you feel like the pilots in the plane. And the effects are pretty good also. The all star cast perform well too, from Woody Harrelson to Patrick Wilson, even Mandy Moore, and Dennis Quaid. The movie does slow down a bit, and may get a little boring.

The film looks great ,being stationed in Pearl Harbor prior to the attack looks like great fun.<br/><br/>There seems to be several historical errors in the films but they are not obvious to most viewers who are not geeks.<br/><br/>I do get annoyed when characters say things like INTEL and INCOMING because I am sure nobody used these phrases in 1941.<br/><br/>As a British person very interested in WW2 it amazes me that anybody can make a film about the Pearl Harbor attack without mentioning the Royal Navy's attack on the Italian navy in Tatanto harbour in November 1940.<br/><br/>The Japanese naval attache in Italy made a full report to the Japanese Navy about the attack and they used the information while planning the Pearl Harbor attack.<br/><br/>To sum up then an old fashioned story worth seeing at the cinema."
"davidgee","8","2","3","13 November 2019"," Vivid CGI lesson in naval history
","The last movie take on PEARL HARBOR (2001) was largely spoiled by a soapy love story. There's only one wife featured in Midway and she's just there as a token Woman Who Waits For Her Husband's Return. What Roland Emmerich gives us this time is a solid chunk of naval history, superbly illustrated by the GGI effects he used so thrillingly in INDEPENDENCE DAY and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.<br/><br/>With lengthy scenes of both the Japanese and American battle planning, the movie shows how the Japanese superiority after the 'infamous' damage they inflicted on the US navy at Pearl Harbor was overcome, mostly thanks to radio intercepts and code-breaking by the guys at Naval Intelligence (sorry, ladies).<br/><br/>Back stories are minimal, in keeping with the documentary style of the film. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid give un-showy performances as key admirals and all the fighter pilots play as a team, much as they would have in wartime, with nobody pushing for extra screen time. Good to see Luke Evans on solid form; he reminds me increasingly of the young Richard Harris, and I hope he has an equally substantial career ahead of him.<br/><br/>The CGI bombing at Pearl Harbor and out in the Pacific is nothing less than awesome. Here and there the aerial combat scenes (and camera-shots behind ordnance) give off a PlayStation flavor, but overall MIDWAY does eloquent justice to a turning-point moment in 20th-century history."

I am a veteran from 1969. I have always enjoyed all wartime movies. 90% were done very well. This was not. And I did not like the wrinkled heavy khaki uniforms. At least put them in the light weight summer uniforms we have all seen in every Navy film. Wearing heavy cotton jackets in a tropical setting made no sense.
All in all, I taped it and I will watch it many times. But only because of the history and special effects involved NOT because of the actors.
One item about any Pearl harbor movie: Please don't have sailors struggling to hold on to anything on the deck of a sinking ship in Pearl Harbor. What will holding on accomplish ??

","The film was released on Veterans Day, very appropriately, and is a solid effort from R. Emmerich who tends to be a director bent on spectacle especially as it relates to disasters on a grand scale (Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, White House Down). But, with this movie (budget of $100 million and runtime of 2 hours and 18 minutes) he takes a step towards substance which is positive, but again retains too much of his desire to make an CGI event picture. Emmerich, also, goes mercifully easy on the flag-waving patriotism and he's pretty even-handed, too, in his portrayal of the Japanese enemy. But at its runtime, film could have easily lost 30 minutes and been a lot more enjoyable. Ultimately, I give ""Midway"" a lot of credit for exceeding my expectations and providing more entertainment than I could have predicted at the outset. This movie is definitely a must-see for action fans who don't mind a little bit of a wandering story.<br/><br/>Rating: 7+/8-"

"anselmdaniel","6","1","1","4 April 2020"," Ambitious but muddled
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Midway is a war movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Wes Tooke. The movie features an ensemble cast of Hollywood and foreign actors. The movie covers events before, during, and after the real life Battle of Midway.<br/><br/>Midway is an incredibly jumbled movie. The movie is chronological in the events that it depicts, however there are many loose threads of stories that are loosely connected in this movie. The movie is ultimately too ambitious for its 138 minutes of running time. The movie starts 1937 when the relations between the United States and Japan are breaking down. The movie then transitions to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The audience does not get into the Battle of Midway until the movie is well underway. The lead up to the battle is not as well earned as the events seem incredibly disparate. The different characters do not intertwine in a meaningful way. In addition the movie does not feature a protagonist. We follow many different perspectives. The closest character that comes close to being a protagonist is Edwin Layton portrayed by Patrick Wilson. The movie frequently switches to perspectives of the bombing squadron to tell their story.<br/><br/>Midway is a visual treat and the movie does treat the history with respect. I did enjoy the movie discussed the Japanese perspective as they began the battle. The battle itself is impressive to watch in this movie. The United States pilots are portrayed as heroic with the Japanese pilots not being featured much. The one item that was missing was the bombing of Yorktown. The Yorktown carrier being attacked is cut to after the bomb had already devastated the carrier. It felt cheap to the audience that we were not able to see the Japanese retaliate after their carrier fleet was decimated.<br/><br/>The direction and writing of the movie could have been in better hands however the movie has enough enjoyable elements for the viewers.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Midway'.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","A fine depiction of events leading up to Midway and Woody Harrelson was surprisingly good as Nimitz. As expected, the film has attracted mixed reviews with some clearly angry that America won the war and that the US military are not depicted as homicidal, xenophobic murdering maniacs. It is a film and not a documentary, so character's behavior has obviously been modified for dramatic effect, however, it manages to be generally factual and covers the crucial events and actions leading up to Midway as well as the day of the battle.<br/><br/>Doubtless, someone will complain that there are no female generals or women in significant roles, but if you are looking for a good factual war film, Midway is the best for some time."
"dylanrenner4","7","1","1","18 March 2020"," Action Packed
","A lot of people didn't really like this movie for many different reasons. I will day for the most part I agree with them. I think the historical accuracy, from what I've heard, is spot on. Many people think that because there are so many different characters with different stories in this movie it's hard to keep track of everything that is going on. But I think that all of these characters are necessary for the movie because every single character had an impact on the battle and history. The acting was okay, a lot of the cast is super young, Patrick Wilson and Woody Harrelson both did a great job, outside from that it wasn't incredible. It's also a little cheesy which is what you get sometimes from these sorts of movies. But it was an entertaining movie and a deeper look into WWII and how America got involved that is full of action packed scenes."
"MrDHWong","6","1","1","12 March 2020"," One of the better entries in Emmerich's filmography, but only barely
","Midway is a war drama film directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Patriot, 2012) based on the decisive Battle of Midway during World War II. Starring Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, and Woody Harrelson, it is one of the better entries in Emmerich's filmography, but only barely.<br/><br/>In 1941, America chooses to remain neutral to the ongoing conflict raging across the globe. On December 7th of that same year, the American naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii is attacked by the Japanese, killing several people and forcing the US to enter the war. In the aftermath of this preemptive strike, the US stages the battle of Midway six months later, a subsequent retaliation against the Japanese at the US territory of the Midway Islands in the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>There's no denying the actual effort being put into making it look as modern and unbiased as possible, but this retelling of the battle of Midway still has some glaring issues. For a start, the film treads cliched territory with corny dialogue and flat characterisation of its real life subjects. Lines such as ""This is for Pearl Harbor!"" and ""We have awoken a sleeping giant"", (the latter of which was taken from the 1970 film ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"") feel like the typical over-the-top Hollywood sentiment one would expect from a war film like this. In addition, most of the characters were underdeveloped, being pushed aside to make way for an action scene. All of this is a shame because I believe all of these problems could have been avoided if only there were a better screenwriter at the helm.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich, while I don't think he is a particularly good director, does actually handle this film surprisingly better than expected. According to some research, making a film about the Battle of Midway had been Emmerich's passion project for a considerable amount of time and it definitely shows at certain points. His choices in cinematography during the air battles are quite interesting, often featuring the pilots charging their way into enemy fire like the way an army of soldiers on the battlefield would advance into the crossfire on land. This style of creativity was previously shown in Emmerich's 2000 film ""The Patriot"", which was not a perfect film by any means, but came off as entertaining enough to prove that he could handle a film based on war with the right amount of precision and care to not be considered entirely terrible. In addition to this, I enjoyed the way he chose to show the differing viewpoints of the American and Japanese strategists as each side plans on how to deal with any potential attack. We see how the Americans tended to go for an all-out assault on their enemies while the Japanese were more about biding their time, patiently waiting out for the appropriate moment to strike.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, most of the film's characters felt underutilised and underdeveloped. If you're going to make a film about a real historical event that went the way it did due to the figures involved, you'd better make sure you do their characterisation justice. There were some characters that I completely forgot about as they were only in one scene and then we never see them again until the ending coda. If it weren't for the fact that some of them were played by well-known actors like Dennis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart, I would not have realised their importance in the story. With that said, Ed Skrein's depiction of Lieutenant Richard ""Dick"" Best was the only person I felt had some dimension to him. Even though the British born Skrein's attempts at an American accent came across as cartoonish at times, in particular his liberal use of ""Goddamn it!"", he at least had some likeability and admirable traits that kept me invested in what he may end up doing next. There were also some nice scenes with him and his wife, played by Mandy Moore, that did remind the audience of what he is fighting for, apart from his country.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while I do appreciate the effort Emmerich has gone to making something he has wanted for a long time, I believe he needs a better screenwriter to collaborate with. All of the potential is there in terms of his direction but the poor dialogue and character development is his biggest downfall. In spite of all this, I would much rather watch this film again than Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>I rate it 6/10"

","Who doesn't like a war movie ? especially if it has great actors. the real midway battle and all the events that led to it were great no question about it, but there is something wrong in the movie itself . the movie really has some elements of poor movie making and i felt somehow disconnected in some scenes."
"CubsandCulture","6","1","1","2 March 2020"," Almost a good movie. Almost. Entirely by Accident.
","Several factors of this production work against it to be a fully engaging piece of *cinema.* The production values-CGI especially-are all fairly cheap and are pretty far from convincing on the photographic level. However, they are slanted just enough to feel oddly stylized. This separates the film from being just warmed over WWII stuff.<br/><br/>Likewise, the script as a *story* is quite messy. There are too many main characters and subplots to follow. Certain narrative threads get dropped. Others feel rushed or incomplete. The plotting such as it is feels haphazard. I am not entirely sure why the Doolittle raid was included. But this results in a panoramic take on history and it was sort of nice to see the lived experience not forced into a conventional story.<br/><br/>This film doesn't add up to much but it is an inoffensive way to get a primer on the military history and operations."
"Movie_Viewer23","6","1","1","26 February 2020"," Cringey dialogue, reasonable action
","The movie screen is a little wider than 16:9 ratio, but the big screen isn't worth it, nor is a purchase. I'd recommend a rental on a small screen.<br/><br/>The movie is too long. Too much attention paid to interpersonal things like a crying widow at a funeral. I'm sure this happened but it's not necessary for the telling of the story. This is a 2.5 hour movie that only needed to be about 1.75 hours.<br/><br/>In a night club the wife of Lt Best asks to someone (who states in the movie that he isn't in charge of these things) why Best isn't being promoted. If the question was asked in a joking manner it would have been perfect. But the line was delivered with deadly seriousness. It's like the women were injected in this movie to tick a box and add appeal for people who probably wouldn't be interested in it in the first place.<br/><br/>All the dialog was either clichéd, smart-aleky, bravado; or whining and complaining, with almost nothing in between. Over the top bravery, or airmen who didn't want to go out and fight because they just wanted to go back to their families.<br/><br/>There was a small amount of attention given to the fact that the Japanese didn't expect the presence of US carriers, but it should have been expanded much more. I'd prefer if they cut out the recap of Pearl Harbor and Doolittle, and focused more on the Japanese objectives and why they failed. And to give more time to the Midway battle.<br/><br/>Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson seems to be getting dementia) was condescending to the idea that a music band was code-breaking. There was a ""really bright guy"" who was able to piece together snippets of decoded messages, but they didn't expand on why. He was just smart and should be believed, or not, depending on how people felt that day.<br/><br/>Some historical inaccuracies I didn't mind such as the mountainous terrain of the Marshall islands. One inaccuracy I objected to was when a US airman was captured in China by peasants after the Doolittle raid, every peasant had a top-quality rifle. If this was accurate, and the Chinese were this armed, the Japanese invasion of China wouldn't have been feasible. In reality, most Chinese soldiers didn't have a rifle, let alone peasants.<br/><br/>Another objection was how the Japanese dialog was in Japanese and sub-titled. If they did expand on the telling of the Japanese side of the story as I had hoped, it would have been awkward to read the subtitles - it'd be too distracting.<br/><br/>The parts I liked were the action scenes, the CGI and the attention given to detail such as the levers under the plane that extended when the bomb was dropped. The backdrops and costumes were good (except for some wrinkled uniforms).<br/><br/>Overall it was reasonable. I'd have preferred it if it was a little more like a documentary, with more attention to battle detail and facts, and less cringey dialogue."

The leads were unknown to me and it seems to me that they suited the feel of the movie. It is an epic movie in some senses ... but it missed the mark in my mind that could see it becoming a classic. For all the special effects and grand scale setting of this movie, I am guessing that the actors are one to two generations too young, to properly capture the essence of who they were portraying. There is a glaring lack of gravitas. The movie tries to pack in so much detail and so many sub-plots, that just aren't properly developed. This also goes for the characters and if it wasn't for what I consider to be reasonably skilful editing, it would seem like I was constantly being robbed, just as I got to know a character. It is a movie that comes across as being done by 'someone' who really wanted to create another 'Lawrence of Arabia' or a 'Gandhi' ... in other words a movie that was profound ... but you know how it is ... when you have too much money and technology at your disposal, it's hard not to be seduced by taking advantage of all the whizz bang toys you can get your hands on. .... but still, I gave it an 8 which means I really enjoyed it and I hope the film makers made a profit with this because in many ways it is a brave movie to make in an environment that is upside down nowadays in the West ..."

Furthermore, I love to learn about events on that side of the world(not just with America but with things that happened in China/Japan/Indonesia and so on that we're never taught in the west).<br/><br/>One of the more notable things to mention about this movie is how it's not politically driven. The director/writers set out to make a re-enactment of an event that not many people know about unless you're in the military. I'll admit that some of the character stories aren't the most interesting but there had to be something there to get the audience interested and to propel the movie along.<br/><br/>Unlike some of the other war movies, I like how this movie tied the opposing side in. Usually we hear and see it from one side(America's side). It's critical that when we learn about history that we learn about all sides and perspectives.<br/><br/>If you like war movies, you'll love this movie. It doesn't waste anytime ramping up the action. They even include(while very little) some of the Japanese invasion of China in this movie. Can the West please start giving us some films about history in the East? ... because we definitely aren't going to be taught about it in school.<br/><br/>We all obviously know how WW2 turned out but this movie gave me the feeling that it really could've went either way.

"tomfeller","7","1","1","25 November 2019"," Story of the Battle of Midway
","Although there already exists a film about this battle, released in 1976 starring Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda, the new one is actually better. All the major characters in the new film are historical, whereas the character played by Heston is fictional, and the earlier film has a totally unnecessary inter-racial romantic sub-plot. The old film began by showing the Doolittle raid, but the new one starts in Japan in 1937 at a dinner party hosted by Admiral Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) and attended by Assistant Naval Attache Lieutenant-Commander Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) in which they discuss the possibility of a war between their two countries. It then fast forwards to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid. (Doolittle himself is played by Aaron Eckhart.) The film actually focuses on Navy pilot Lieutenant Dick Best (Ed Skrein), who was one of the dive bombers who took out the Japanese aircraft carriers during the battle, and his wife Ann (Mandy Moore). Admirals Halsey and Nimitz are played by Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson, respectively, but Admiral Spruance (Jake Weber), who actually commanded the U.S. Navy forces during the battle, is given a rather short shrift. Of course, in the original film they actually had to fly real planes and use models to represent ships, but now they can use CGI, which is excellent. On the other hand, the characterizations seemed clichéd, and the film makers felt obligated to insert frequent info dumps."
"masonsaul","6","1","1","25 November 2019"," Above average war movie
","Midway is an above average war film that surprisingly gives a balanced account from both sides. Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson and Luke Evans give really good performances. The music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is excellent and there are genuinely thrilling moments in the third act.

Still much better than Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor."

"vexted","7","1","1","19 November 2019"," Good but still lacking in this oh by the way day of movies.
","This IMHO is a much better outing in so far as covering the actual battle as apposed to Pearl Harbor. That being said it glossed over so much of the meat and bones of the battle in favor of added drama, (love store and such). I'm not against such things just not a fan of covering a half a year on a 1 day battle. While Layton's arc is excusable as the code breakers journey. The motivation for the Enterprise pilots could have been done in flashbacks as opposed to a nearly full retelling of Pearl Harbor yet again. The Doolittle Raid did motivate the Japanese to push for an engagement that would expose our Air craft Carriers but again to much time wasted on ANOTHER Battle. All that aside I liked the movie and it's cast immensely and thought some of the revelations quite interesting. The special effects while generally good IMHO could have been better. They were to clean and glossy they lacked a tactile feel of having been real. While I can recommend this film as fun just don't expect high art or a sense of wow after the fact."

","If there's one thing Hollywood does well is CGI.

The screenplay was pretty close the original with the ""enhancements "" of super realistic battle scenes and a love story (required in all Reenactment films now). Maybe I'm just not bright enough to understand the complexity of this critical WWII battle, or maybe they couldn't figure out how to tell it clearly in 2 hours."

","What a missed opportunity! On one hand this movie has a great set up: a huge event that's easy to bring to film in a setting that's still somewhat overlooked when it comes to WW2 movies. It even manages to avoid the typical Pearl Harbor pitfalls and doesn't really bother with romantic subplots getting in the way of the main story. It's also a giant CGI fest that turns out pretty good. Mostly.<br/><br/>On the other hand...acting is bad. Like. Really bad. The first act in particular is horrible. The story is jumping all over the place, trying to make us care about way too many characters. The main character even manages to be an utterly unlikable Dick (pun intended) that walks around like he's the best thing the US has to offer. CGI also looks fake as hell in the first act. It's the sort of thing that'll pop up on an episode of the How Did This Get Made podcast.<br/><br/>Things sort of pick up in the second and third act with some impressive big fights but the story keeps on jumping around like it listened to Kriss Kross too much. The end is, of course, a giant Murica F Yeah eruption that had people during my viewing shaking their heads.
That might seem harsh, but maybe that's because there are the building blocks of a perfectly fine movie scattered all over the place. Better editing and storytelling would've made this movie genuinely good instead of mediocre.<br/><br/>Not that it isnt enjoyable so it's not a total warning to skip it. It's just... Meh."

The screen was alive with star studded names and Captain America like bravery full of cliche dialogue and cowering cowards needing encouragement from the brave heroes we all have come to know through the annals of history. I couldn't help but snicker towards the end as my boyish comedic brain was firing on all cylinders as we watch ""Dick Best"" heroically drop a bomb on the last Japanese carrier exclaiming ""This is for Pearl Harbor!"" as he narrowly escapes the explosions and the seabed below. I was able to almost recite verbatim his speech to his cowering gunner who no longer wanted to fight that if he didn't do this he would regret it the rest of his life. Or the pure comedic moment another Pilot is grasping for bravery and asking Dick to turn in his wings only for Dick to promise to watch after the young pilot and be his wingman only in the very next scene to witness the scared, young pilot not even be able to get his plane off the deck of the carrier as Dick Best yells to abort!<br/><br/>The special effects and battle scenes are entertaining and visually stunning on the newer screens with incredible sound systems.

","The Battle of Midway was a clash between the American fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy which marked a pivotal turning point in the Pacific during WWII.<br/><br/>When you see that a film is directed by the man who bought us Independence Day and White House Down, you know that the film isn't going to be very subtle, or have the greatest script in the world.<br/><br/>But at least it could pass two hours without causing too much concern.<br/><br/>And this is what the film exactly is, nothing to be too concerned about. It tries to compete with other WWII films released in the past 20 years, but emulates them, rather than try to supersede them, which in all fairness, is a plus point with this film.<br/><br/>What we have is your token WWII characters we have seen depicted on film since the fifties, melded with CGI that isn't too bad, but nothing we haven't seen before.<br/><br/>It's not saying much, but Skrein has never been this good in a film before (just besting 'If Beale Street Could Talk' but he's only in that for a hot minute), as the central character, Dick Best (insert joke here.....).<br/><br/>He's the Maverick of the film, a misunderstood cowboy who grumbles at rules, and then listens to them begrudgingly, we've all seen this character a thousand times before, and you can see what his outcome will be from a periscope.<br/><br/>Then we have Harrelson, in his most restraint role ever, he may as well be wearing a stars and stripes suit, he is the epitome of flag waving, just call him Mr. All American.<br/><br/>Wilson has the sixth sense with the bloke who played Mr. Dresden in the orange Wednesday adverts. Ten years ago, this would have been played by Kevin Spacey, and the role would have been so much meatier. But Wilson is quite watchable whenever he is on screen.<br/><br/>Eckhart pops in for a couple of minutes as the hard as nails Doolittle, and like his characters name, he has very little to do, other than land a plane, and run off.<br/><br/>Evans is the Iceman to Skreins Maverick, and although Evans is good, in the actual film, his character is given little to do.<br/><br/>Then there is the star of the show, Dennis Quaid, who literally grizzles and chew scenery whenever he appears. He is hilarious for all the wrong reasons, and clearly awful, but I couldn't help but get excited whenever he appeared on screen.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, it's just your atypical 'people discussing tactics around a table film, intercut with familiar action set pieces'.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible film by any means, there is just no cause for concern with this film, and unlike WWII, it's pretty harmless."

Additionally the CGI is largely cheap and its painfully obvious when people are running around a shipwreck and its green screen. This makes the sum total really unengaging.

","I'm a bit of a WWII history junkie. I came into this with high hopes. In 10th grade, I had the pleasure of meeting Ensign George Gay and hearing his firsthand account of this battle (he is very briefly shown in this movie). Ever since, I've had an intense fascination with this particular battle, the events leading to it and the impact from it. That said, I really wanted to love this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't. At all. The sheer number of 10-star reviews on here makes me question their authenticity, because this movie is simply a mess. It looks like a video game. The script and screenplay are a total disaster. The actors, for the most part, are bad. Although that script gave them little with which to work. I will give the filmmakers credit for attempting to honor certain key historical elements, although the omission of others is a head-scratcher. To be fair, this movie would need to be 4 hours long to have a chance of covering all bases.<br/><br/>The story is poorly told. The heroic actions of our pilots, seamen and intel officers are either omitted completely (Marine pilots of squadron 221, Ensign George Gay, etc) or overdone with the worst kind of glossiness of Hollywood (Dick Best).<br/><br/>If you can stomach the Xbox styling of the action sequences, some of them are good, although strangely inaccurate in many ways.<br/><br/>I walked out of the theater not quite knowing what I'd just watched.

The characters were poorly built and did not make any impact on the audience. So when someone died the audience did not feel for that person as they never connected. Poor use of CGI made it even worse where you can actually tell the things in the background are not close to real. Lot of action sequences but not connected to each other at all. There was no suspense building around the war as everything kind of fell apart. There were more american planes that went down in the movie and still somehow we managed a victory.

"movieman6-413-929510","4","9","33","8 November 2019"," The new Midway movie comes across as a predictable game of battle ship.
","Midway is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name. The film is directed by Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow.<br/><br/>In the film, the US Navy in Pearl Harbor has been attacked by Japan. Japan thought it had sunk the entire fleet, but the remaining aircraft carriers decided to take revenge on Japanese troops with a surprise attack. For this they need to locate the enemy forces without getting noticed. The Navy knows how to locate the Japanese around the Midway Island in the Pacific. Now, with espionage and war tactics, they have to outsmart the larger group of Japanese with their surprise attack. This is how the battle of Midway begins.<br/><br/>This film is about famous events from the Second World War around the attack on Pearl Harbor. This event has previously been filmed in the original film from 1976 and in 2001 in the Pearl Harbor film directed by Michael Bay. Michael Bay unfortunately chose to fill his film with his own fictional version and a triangular relationship. Although he filled this film with a fictional and long-winded story, he managed to put in credible and entertaining action scenes with explosions. Roland Emmerich also tries to do this with this film only without the success that Michael Bay had. In Midway, both navy fleets always try to sink each other with surprise attacks. The problem is that as a viewer you get to see the scenes in which both navy fleets plan their surprise attacks and this only remains a surprise for the film characters. This makes the film a kind of predictable naval battle game for viewers and especially for viewers who are familiar with the history of this battle. After the umpteenth planning and attack scene, the film also feels a little repeatedly what makes the film more predictable and thus a bit more elaborate.<br/><br/>Michael Bay managed to fill his film with exaggerated but credible explosions that he is familiar with. In his older films such as Independence Day, Roland Emmerich managed to make the explosions in the film more credible than he does nowadays in his films. He now chooses to place this in a more technical way in his films with CGI and a green screen.<br/><br/>The cast consists of a group of famous actors such as Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Mandy Moore and Woody Harrelson. The problem is that most of their characters have not really been worked out, making it difficult for them to keep track of who exactly is and what he is doing during the film. Most characters you only recognize by the face of the actor who plays the character."

It is so obvious that the entire film was shot in front of a green screen that it is impossible to enjoy the movie and forget about it.

The lighting on the actors is very different then on the enviroment . Everything just screams greenscreen. They might have well made the characters cg as well. Then it would not have looked so out of place. It's like they tried to make a serious movie out of modern game cutscenes.<br/><br/>This lack of focus can be found in the rest of the movie as well. The characters are too polished, you do not feel any connection to any of the characters and then the attack of pearl harbor already begins.
Everything is extremely heavily dramatised. You have the cowboys, the honorable guys, the imperial japanese. I think this amazing historical story deserves a lot better and with a cast like this one they should have done better.<br/><br/>I work with 3D software as a profession, if you think that my critical review somehow reflects on veterans.. then I think you've lost some connection with the rest of the world."

I am a fan of Harrelson, professionally and personally, but he could not rescue this role. He would have been far better placed as a pilot or intelligence lead.<br/><br/>Still, the writing is shallow and disconnected with the dialogue splattered with modern-day vernacular and post-operation lessons as if they were known in the moment.<br/><br/>It is good that there is an interest by young filmmakers of the battle itself, but one gets the feeling that the technical consulting for the script was only Google-deep. Instead, this movie comes off as a computer graphics and money-making playground using this pivotal point of American history as nothing more than a superficial backdrop.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a promising dramatic pre-war scene that sparks intrigue, if not promise, but then steeply falls off into an abyss of disappointment. Images of tragedy are brought to visualization, but are so sharply fragmented that they interrupt, rather than add, to the flow of the movie.<br/><br/>It is a shame, this could have been so much more, but ""Midway"" results in little more than a video-game quality story that should be played out on X-Box instead of Blu-Ray."

"kuarinofu","6","2","4","6 February 2020"," Wow, a comic book action about war
","Roland Emmerich, ladies and gentlemen.<br/><br/>I knew what to expect from him but still am quite impressed. I mean, he only does relatively big budget huge in scale nonsense films with little to no story split between 20-25 characters (and re-using them, I felt sad this film had no smug and sleazy supposedly Jewish lawyer stereotype).<br/><br/>And this film is no different except for one important thing - real people are being portrayed.<br/><br/>The film has two major issues. The first one is expected - the story is a mess and the pacing is all over the place. The film jumps around places and characters, half of which get nearly not enough screen time to make them memorable. All the dialogue is either cliche heroism motivation speeches or 100% unrefined exposition, when a character says literally the key note you have to be getting out of that scene, since it's so bad its incomprehensible without an explanation. It just follows the pattern - action scene->nonsensical dialogue->exposition. After a couple of iterations the film ends and we are told some backstory about the real people that were shown in the film, and it just makes you wonder how good would it be if they had actual real characters with emotions and motivations besides ""that one guy we didn't know anything about who died in the first 5 minutes made him really angry"". They could've written this in a way to provide great service to the real people portrayed in this, who did their best and acted selflessly, but they didn't bother. So all of our ""characters"" are mostly cardboard cut-outs who are more shallow than modern comic book superheroes. It was nice to see real pictures in the end, but please, have some respect. I would never care if an overblown action film had badly written characters but these are real people.<br/><br/>The second issue is the look of the film. The lighting and the color correction is probably intentional and is done to reference some sort of style (and the poster too). So it feels like they wanted it to look this way. But the horrible green screens and composite shots really hurt this film. Roland Emmerich actually made me feel like I'm watching a Star Wars prequel, you know, with full CGI backdrops that never look realistic or believable. Some of the CGI shots also felt like a modern video-game cutscene. It looked too bright, too polished and new for a war film. I mean yeah, Dunkirk also looked stylized, but Nolan was actually able to present three different timeFLOWS, not even timelines. So don't get me started on this one (and the budgets are comparable). I haven't seen this in a theater but my home setup is sufficient to enjoy a good picture with surround sound, and I mostly laughed at the dialogue or felt bored during CGI battles.<br/><br/>
P.S. I also want to commend most of the actors for giving a good performance even given the bad script, except for Ed Skrein, he was clearly cast only for the looks and he felt confused on what he is trying to deliver throughout the film.
P.P.S. Also, the way the Japanese are portrayed at first comes as a bit of a surprise, but when you check the production companies and the markets this film was aimed for (mostly Chinese audiences) it all makes sense. I mean, I'm not going to talk about propaganda and conspiracy theories, but a thinking person will understand what I mean with a single viewing."

","They made a little effort to get the story right, it would probably take a longer movie to get most of the background material and the movie covers a 6 month period, Pearl Harbor to Midway. Most of the fx were reasonably well done but like Bay in 'Pearl Harbor' the director tried to cram way too much action into each frame showing planes flying several feet off the ground, or flying in spaces between ships that they couldn't actually fit through. And the characters are every bit as wooden and cliched as you've read about elsewhere. For a thorough understanding of this period of WWII a much better choice would be to read 'Pacific Crucible'.My guess is that the screenwriter(s) probably did."
"jingram-81427","9","2","4","16 December 2019"," Midway 9 stars
","The Battle of Midway is a famous story from the Pacific in World War 2. Midway was a landing station for planes in the Pacific and vital to the war. The movie begins by featuring a scene of US officers speaking with Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto as he tells the, ""Don't push us into a corner."" A few years later it shows the attack and bombing on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. It looked like a terrible loss for the US, but Yamamoto brought up a key point in where they made a huge mistake. First off they were supposed to try and take out all of the aircraft carriers, and second and more importantly, to destroy the oil reserves on the island. This would have been vital to Japan in the war, as all of the military ships would not be able to efficiently fuel up, and be used in war. These mistake proved to be very important, and Yamamoto even knew that when he expressed that they, have awoken a sleeping giant. I love how they really incorporate the code breakers into the film and show how they proved to be one of the biggest assets possible. They intercepted multiple extremely important Japanese messegas that allowed them to take control in the war. They break the film into two views of the war based on two very different characters that were extremely important in the war. Edwin Layton was on the outside of the battle, gaining information, and making decisions needed in the war. While Dick Best is an adrenaline craving fighter pilot. They show the intellectual aspects of the war on Layton's side, and the daring action on Best's side, which was very interesting to watch and learn about. These code breakers were able to intercept a message that held the encrypted location of Japanese battle ships, and their plan for attack including the date and time. This allowed us to win the battle of midway which was vital in winning the overall war. This movie was extremely interesting an inspiring as it showed aspects of war that i had never seen before, and story that is engraved in history."

The script is stifling, the characters are awkward stereotypes with silly accents that seem dishonest. Each time Dick Best sticks his gum to the dashboard of his plane it is truly cringe-worthy. Something about his gum and chewing it is supposed to be really defining of the character, but is painful. Woody Harrelson as Nimitz no doubt has the great admiral rolling in his grave. Mix eminently hatable characters in with some weird computer generated effects and the whole thing falls flat.

"tom-456","6","0","0","5 July 2020"," The 1976 movie is better in most respects
","I will try to watch this movie again, and maybe I'll have a better experience the 2nd time, but there are obvious problems with this movie, including the casting. In the 1976 movie Admiral Nimitz was played by Henry Fonda. In this movie Admiral Nimitz is played by Woody. Since when has Woody ever been a serious actor, known for playing serious roles in serious movies? Why stop with Woody, why not cast Bill Murray to play Admiral Nimitz?<br/><br/>As with most great battles throughout history, a proper telling of the story needs to reveal the key decisions by the leaders, the turning points in the battle, the extent of good vs. bad outcome of the various decisions, and the extent to which dumb luck and mother nature had a hand in determining the outcome. We, the audience, want to be educated by a movie of this type, not entertained per se. This movie seems unable to make up its mind what it wants to accomplish. The extensive use of CGI does very little to enhance the telling of what happened in the battle of Midway. I'm not suggesting that this movie should have been a documentary of the kind you see on the history channel. Although many of the documentaries on the History channel are easier to sit through than this was. The IMDB viewer ratings are essentially the same for this movie vs. the 1976 movie, but this is a reflection of the fact that the modern audience was mostly born after 1990 and doesn't want to watch any movie that isn't filled with special effects. The producers of this movie could have made a better movie than the 1976 movie, through judicious use of more modern technology. This clearly is not what they set out to do, as evidenced for one example by the choice of Woody to play Admiral Nimitz. Some of the other actors in the 1976 movie: Charlton Heston, Glenn Ford, James Coburn, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner. Around half of the actors playing the major roles in this 2019 movie are pop music starts with no experience playing serious roles and not having the right stuff for the audience to take them seriously as military leaders. Another decade from now this movie will be largely forgotten, and the 1976 movie will continue to be televised on Memorial Day and on the Fourth of July. And don't get me wrong about Woody. I'm a fan of Woody. Just not when cast as Admiral Nimitz in a movie about the battle of Midway."

On a whole, though there may be the usual amount of accuracies versus inaccuracies, this is simply a poorly conceived and executed dizzying hodge-podge that fails on almost every level to capture the moment. The problem with the CGI Brainiards making events like this is they don't know how to create a simple scene without having to show off their 'skills'.

"MiketheWhistle","8","0","0","5 July 2020"," Good in its own right, but different than the 1976 Midway.
","I had read many of the bad reviews so I was expecting to be unhappy, but ended up generally enjoying the film. It is very different than the 1976 version and I'd say somewhat similar to Pearl Harbor except that it deals with actual and pretty accurate portrayal. Visually the film is very good but i would agree with some of the reviews saying it almost gives a feeling of a video game, but this is the quintescel naval and naval air forces battle and the cgi is of the ships and planes so that's ok. Probably the one thing I didn't like was that the movie's title is Midway and it spends a lot of time on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid. The 1976 film has Doolittle so guess can't say that's bad. I think the problem for me is that it took away from the time that could have been spent on the intelligence that was key to the US victory. The 1976 version spends much more time on it. It's a long movie and glad that I didn't see it in the theatre.<br/><br/>As a former navy vet, I enjoyed the film, but I think it could have been far better so I understand why many disliked it. The time spent on Pearl Harbor could have been used to develop characters more sharing some of the what it means to have been in combat and dealing with the losses. Midway was such a pivotal battle and as it said in the opening ultimately led to the US victory as it dealt a defeat that Japan couldn't come back from. Something I did find interesting was showing the Japanese strafing our pilots in the water and the killing in China. I was surprised that this was shown because if it had been China it would have definitely been cut as China would have banned the film similar to what happened with Red Dawn.<br/><br/>As much as I disliked the time spent on Pearl Harbor, I wish more time would have been spent on the Arizona. And although I have a prejudice as a navy vet, I feel like the film did a good job of showing what our military does when it's in a fight whether it's WW2 or Desert Storm or the 20 years Iraq/Afgan war. I think this gives those who have not been exposed to a military life a little bit of the sorrow and victories.<br/><br/>I would definitely say it's worth watching."

Broken airplane and lots of injuries would be the outcome, along with a grounded pilot in all probability. Kind of a turnoff, but in general I liked the film.

The Battle of Midway alone is a subject worthy of it's own movie, there was no need to touch, briefly and sometimes confusingly, on the Marshal Islands, the Coral Sea, and even Pearl Harbor. It made the move confusing, scattered and rushed. We watched this at home and I was constantly hitting pause to explain to my wife what was going on, and my wife is a very sharp person.<br/><br/>Midway could have easily filled the two plus hour run time of this film on it's own. If they had done that they could have covered so many more interesting parts of the battle that were either touched on very briefly or left out all together. Some of these that come to mind;<br/><br/>They never even show the Yorktown being attacked and only refer to it very briefly toward the end of the film.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable aspects of the battle that has reached legendary status over the years is the doomed attack of Torpedo 8 squadron. They do touch briefly on this and show the one survivor, Ensign Gay, in the water but it deserved a lot more screen time. They didn't even show Gay being rescued and just left his fate up in the air. He later became an airline pilot and wrote a book about his experiences in the battle.<br/><br/>There are no Wildcat fighters in the film at all, to someone who knows little about the subject it would appear that our carriers had no fighter aircraft at all because they are totally absent. Wildcats played a huge role in the battle.<br/><br/>A great many aircrews got lost or simply ran out of fuel after their attacks and many of those were never heard from again. This has always been a haunting part of the battle for me, it's not even mentioned here.<br/><br/>The incident in which a Dauntless crew are interrogated and then murdered by the Japanese is shown and is true to the facts so I appreciated that. I found it interesting that, after depicting this scene, and considering all the other atrocities committed by the Japanese in WWII Roland Emmerich found it necessary to honor the Japanese forces at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I also wondered throughout the movie what was up with the wrinkled uniforms...I doubt any naval officer at the time would have appeared in such a state, war or no war.<br/><br/>With all of that it was still an enjoyable movie but in the end something of a disappointment because it could have been so much better. Less would have been more here and sticking to the Battle of Midway would have been the thing to do. If you're interested in the battle I do recommend the 1970's movie, it's a more focused re-telling of the battle and doesn't include some of the cheesy dialogue this movie has."

In June 1942, just six months after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway set the course for the rest of the war with Japan.<br/><br/>The key to getting the upper hand were code breakers, some were musicians in civilian life before the war, they were able to figure out when and where the next attack would be. So even though the US forces were outnumbered, and many planes and pilots were lost, they managed to sink the Japanese carriers and cripple their operations. Japan never recovered.<br/><br/>The movie is very accurate, some viewers may complain about the special effects but those are secondary to the story which recounts what happened. The disc has extras, including interviews with two remaining survivors of the Battle of Midway.<br/><br/>Good movie of an important battle in the 1940s war with Japan."

","As an amateur military historian, Midway surprised me. Judging by the reviews here I expected it to be another Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>It is much better. In fact it is almost four movies in one. It covers (albeit briefly) Pearl Harbour, the Doolittle Raid (Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo), The Battle of the Coral Sea, and Midway.<br/><br/>The CGI is amazing, and the flight characteristics of the aircraft is done very well. Adding to the sense of reality is the loud and extremely realistic sound track.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't get bogged down in a love interest, and the two hours passed quite quickly.<br/><br/>The only negatives were that some of the CGI effects were overdone. Like when during the Pearl Harbour attack almost every strafing Japanese fighter's bullets caused massive explosions. This did make it look a bit like a computer game at times.<br/><br/>The other problem was the lack of historical detail. Rather than show the Doolittle raid, It would have been better to have shown what had happened at Coral Sea instead, and why Yorktown was damaged and in for repair. The same went for the battle of Midway. My partner, who didn't know the story, was lost. Not only with what she called technical terms - SBD, TBD, TF etc., but also with what was going on. She didn't know whether she was looking at American or a Japanese planes.<br/><br/>There was no explanation on how at Midway the American squadrons got separated and how they were desperately searching for the a Japanese fleet, which meant they attacked piecemeal. There was no explanation of how the Japanese had put out many search aircraft, but the one which had the search area the American fleet was in, was delayed. No mention was made of the a Japanese subs which got to their blocking positions too late.<br/><br/>What Midway did do well was depict the horror of diving vertically onto an aircraft carrier trying to shoot you out of the sky, with enemy planes on your tail. It also appeared to present a lot of historical fact, rather than interpreted fiction. It even shows that the truth can be better than fiction, like when a sailor on the carrier jumps into the back of a parked aircraft, grabs the machine gun and duels with a Japanese aircraft heading for the carrier deck. It was amazing to see how heroic this was - after reading about it many times.<br/><br/>This is a Great War movie, especially for amateur military historians. Otherwise you might want to read up on the battle before seeing the movie."

"Screen_O_Genic","8","0","0","10 December 2019"," The Turning Point
","Confident after their success at Pearl Harbor the Japanese armed forces decided to lure the American navy into a trap near Midway Atoll, an important area in the Pacific crucial to both sides. Japanese underestimation of the American response, poor placing of their ships and most importantly the breaking of their codes by American cryptographers dealt the doom of the Japanese fleet as they in turn fell for the net the American fleet spread out at them. The predator became the prey. ""Midway"" showcases the action and drama involved as one of the turning points in history unravels in the silver screen. Good acting features the important personages involved and the personal lives of individuals adding the human element always turned upside down in the turmoil of war. Good special effects highlight the exhilaration, chaos, tragedy and high of battle as dogfights, fighter planes, anti-aircraft guns, aircraft carriers, artillery, streaming bullets and crashing bombs erupt as the soundtrack to death and carnage where the conflict leads its participants to destiny. An added plus is the depiction of the Japanese side of the story where unlike past war films where only the Western perspective is shown here the Japanese experience is represented giving the movie a fuller well rounded whole. Although not as fast paced as a war flick should be the film delivers with its no frills depiction of the battle. As war films go this is one of the best with no politics and agenda to taint it, just a solid recreation of history as it occurred. And in these times is a winner just as much as the quality of the film itself, perhaps even more."

I'd have to see the 1976 version again to judge the historically accuracy, but as I recall, it was not inaccurate.<br/><br/>The new version is entertaining. The CGI is pervasive but quite good. At a few points I found myself thinking ""this is good CGI"", followed quickly by ""ah, but it's CGI"". Then again, since we no longer have squadrons of PBY's or Grumman torpedo bombers lying around, CGI is the only alternative.<br/><br/>This movie is quite watchable, with several well-drawn characters.

This movie has too many characters, a haphazard storyline, no character depth whatsoever and does not leave one with a feeling of awe, as good war movies should do. I had already forgotten about it as soon as I left the cinema. What does this movie have? A lot of well-known actors. A lot of actors. Actors with perfectly combed hair, even in the midst of battle. A lof of CGI. Dramatic music (which always enhances the movie: if it is a good movie, it becomes a great one, if it is a mediocre movie, it becomes even worse). What doesn't this movie have? Depth. A storyline that takes you into the story. A sense of identification with the characters. A sense of the reality of war. If you're looking for chewing gum chewing, too cool to be real soldiers, who perform superman like stunts and still survive, watch this movie. If you want many superficial characters, watch it. But if you want a story that takes you somewhere, leaves you baffled, AND has the visuals and music that amplify that story, watch Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, Black Hawk Down or even Dunkirk (a great less = more movie).

The writing is just very mediocre, the script consists of almost every movie cliché and a million one-liners. The movie doesn't make you care for any the characters, so you'll feel nothing when some of them die.
This is also due the the acting being not so great overall.<br/><br/>The writers tried to put way to many events in this movie. Most of the battle scenes have a very bad build up in terms of suspense and feel rushed.

","Roland Emmerich is not a name that inspires much faith for historical accuracy, but hey the Patriot was at least entertaining.<br/><br/>This is not the Patriot.<br/><br/>I noticed they were getting details wrong so I turned my brain off and just tried to enjoy the movie as a movie. That didn't go very well because it's not very good as a movie either.<br/><br/>I don't know who thought it was a good idea to have one movie cover about seven months of history, but they need to be fired. This movie condenses the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the aftermath, the Raid on the Marshal Islands, the Doolittle Raid, the Battle of Coral Sea, and the Battle of Midway into one movie.<br/><br/>I know who these guys are, however the audience must be so confused as characters come and go with maybe a few minutes of screen time. Take the Pearl Harbor scene, we get this officer telling an enlisted sailor to set up deck chairs for the Sunday church service. The enlisted sailor says he's an atheist and I rolled my eyes figuring this kid will be a secondary characters learning about faith and god and stuff.... I was giving the movie too much credit. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor he has one more scene. You see it was the officer that was important because he was close friends with Lt. Cmd Dick Best, our main character and he needed to ask the kid what happened to his friend.<br/><br/>Then the whole second act is basically everything that happened between Pearl Harbor and Midway, (that's December 1941 to June 1942). They have Admiral Halsey in this movie for some reason as a secondary character which was probably not a good idea because Halsey wasn't at Midway so I'm wondering why are we spending time with a character who won't matter in the freaking climax and leaving people don't know this wondering why this Admiral Spruance is joining us this late in the movie.<br/><br/>It just goes on like this for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Things I did like was the sound design and I really enjoyed seeing the CGI renditions of the real ships. I liked that I could look at ships and actually identify them by class. The battles mostly look fine, but I have problems with Pearl Harbor (but that's mostly nitpicking)... though the CGI during that scene did look odd. The acting was also fine, eventually I got used to some of the cheesy 1940s accents the actors were using.<br/><br/>I don't hate this movie but if you know nothing about World War II this movie will not be fun because you'll be very confused. If you do know a lot about World War II you still won't like it because they abridge so many important events and people.<br/><br/>Go see the 1970s version, it was a tighter and more accurate film."

I was expecting a tight account of the several coincidences, doubts, gambles and strategies that led to the outcome. Instead, I got an unwarranted focus on 2d-rendered characters I couldn't care less for. It's hard to understand the real dynamics of Midway watching this film. Other shortcomings: 1) Clichés, such as pilots questioning their commanders orders in their face and doing ""rebel"" things, as if this was ""Top Gun"". 2) Terrible choice of starting the story from Pearl Harbour. Because of this, the script is cramped and many scenes are rushed. The day of Midway needed two hours of narration itself to adequately tell the almost unbelievable development of events. It was a griding day of crucial choices and risks taken, that would not show their consequences until two hours later. Tension at its best. 3) Ok with the ""realism"", but why insist with japanese people speaking Japanese and having me reading subtitles? That was unnecessary. 4) The CGI. Good grief. Most of it is very good. But in the most spectacular moments, you can clearly see the heavy hand of the director and imagine him say: ""More spectacular! More spectacular!"". I'm talking about the super fake cameras moving around the crashing planes: that was good 20 years ago, now it's just boring and fake. Gimme some good vehicle mounted cameras (as Nolan and Miller still do) and that's ten times more breathtaking. Other laughable and heavy-handed CGI moments are the large fires: burning Pearl Harbour has nothing realistic to a trained eye, it's more similar to an imperial cruiser crashing on a planet. 5) Exposition. 6) Acting. They spent 100 millions, and couldn't sign good actors, aside from Harrelson who by the way is going through the motions.
Overall: hot garbage."

","For a movie with a lot of action, I was a little bored.<br/><br/>This is helmed by disaster movie director Roland Emmerich. He is a guy who found his voice in the 90's, and this movie kind of feels like it was made during that decade. The execution is too light for its own good. I don't mean this in a complimentary way. Dialogue is undercooked and at times cliched. I felt like a lot of good actors were wasted here. There is a lot of quick jumping from scene-to-scene. Yes, I know this is one of those war movies that look at many players, but even by the standards of these types of films, the scenes often don't hold weight.<br/><br/>Also, this movie feels kind of odd for today. More recent war movies have tried to look at the more realistic and darker elements of the subject and the human toll and psychology of it all. Not that this movie isn't about human sacrifice, but this tries to be more of a crowdpleaser like the war films of yesteryear. It feels out of place in today's climate.<br/><br/>Of course, I could just be jaded. If you want to see movie honoring those who died for our county, then this might be for you. The movie does a good job of laying out how the battle of Midway went down on both the American and Japanese fronts and evoking the old feel of wide-scale military battle films.<br/><br/>Emmerich maintains his eye for action. The combat scenes are all done well. The computer graphics aren't the best; none of them look realistic enough. In Emmerich's defense, I give him credit for showing a lot of them during full daylight scenes, which is trickier than doing them during night or in grey/blue lighting. Also, props to hair and costumes in this.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that looks good enough but just doesn't stand out."

It would be great to blend the best parts of the 1976 Midway with the modern graphics of Midway 2019.<br/><br/>There was no depth to this movie. Too many characters who were each ill defined. No character development at all. If you are a student of WWII as I am you, of course, know the story. But for those who are not familiar with the events and details of WWII they are greeted with a choppy exposure to bits and pieces of the true story. Forget historical accuracy.<br/><br/>There were scenes of air battles or attacks involving the ground or ships but they would abruptly end and the scene would shift to a quiet dialog portion that seemed quite out of place. The next scene change would then be to some dramatic high volume war segment.<br/><br/>The graphics were the highlight of this movie and there were many scenes that were well constructed. Nearer to the beginning of the movie the ships in Pearl Harbor were about 90% real, unfortunately that 10% that was missing was quite visible. The rest of the graphics were quite good.<br/><br/>I can't comment on the acting because I don't think the director gave the staff a chance to show their talents. While I very much like Woody Harrelson he was not the right actor for this role.<br/><br/>It really is a shame that the director did such a poor job on this movie. It is quite clear that huge amounts of money were spent on sets, which were very good, but they were wasted by not focusing on a thread of a story.<br/><br/>I did something that is extremely rare for me.

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>With all due respect to Roland Emmerich and to his fantastic Independence Day, his movies never quite reach their potential, ending up in constant disappointments. It doesn't matter if he has excellent casts or amazing VFX teams, his films' screenplays are almost always stuffed with narrative issues. Midway is simply another installment in his saga of letdowns. Without knowing the director, anyone who looks at this movie will feel instantly captivated. From the unbelievably talented cast to the impressive visuals, it has two attention-grabber ingredients, which can result in a remarkable film... only if the two pillars of any cinematic production are decent enough: story and characters.<br/><br/>These are the main issue with Emmerich's movies. His characters are not compelling or intriguing enough, and his screenplays lack creativity and excitement (whether these are written by him or someone else). When I noticed that Midway had such an acclaimed cast and that it was about the Battle of Midway, I immediately got excited. War epics are a genre that I sincerely appreciate. However, when I checked who was ""running the show"", I instantly lowered my expectations. Honestly, it's exactly what I expected it to be: visually gripping, but emotionally hollow.<br/><br/>I don't want to understate it. The CGI work in this film is jaw-dropping. The actual war is riveting with astonishing aerial sequences and powerful sound design. Even at a regular screening with the usual 7.1 Dolby surround speakers, the floor was rumbling with the explosions and the planes. This is why I think audiences will definitely enjoy this movie. Maybe not a vast majority, but surely most people will leave their theaters feeling it was good entertainment. It has a long runtime, and it's hard to get through the exposition-heavy story, but in the end, I bet the general public will appreciate the war action enough to give the whole thing a thumbs up.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's still a very superficial flick. While it's very respectful to everyone who fought in the war (including the Japanese) and to the historic event on itself, it lacks emotional attachment to its characters. Dunkirk was praised by both critics and audiences all around the world, but its main criticism connects to what I just wrote. Christopher Nolan's film also didn't have any compelling characters. However, there's a big difference between these two movies. Both their marketing and their ultimate goal are distinct. Dunkirk was all about showing the actual war. It never marketed itself as a character-study or that it would even have a significant focus on some of the heroes that fought there. Nolan repeated several times: it's about the war and the war only.<br/><br/>It's genuinely one of the best, if not the best, *pure* war film I've ever seen. When it comes to depicting the claustrophobic, unbreathable, restless, bloody, loud event that a devastating war is, Dunkirk is so realistic it can even become uncomfortable with just sitting in your chair (at least, I did in IMAX). On the other hand, Midway's marketing was about paying homage to ""people who fought in the Battle of Midway"". Hence the stellar cast compared to Nolan's just competent actors (with obvious exceptions like Mark Rylance or Tom Hardy). It spends most of its screentime trying to develop the actual people that helped win that battle, not with the action itself. Therefore, these characters need engaging scripts and emotionally resonant arcs.<br/><br/>Wes Tooke delivers a screenplay packed with so much exposition that a lot of it looks clearly unrealistic. Characters discuss specific topics that don't make any sense of being in a conversation at a particular time and place. Throughout the runtime, there are dialogue sequences with the sole purpose of explicitly telling the audience what we need to know to understand the story, which ends up turning the narrative confusing, convoluted, and lacking faster pacing. It's tough to get through the non-action periods, and I can't even imagine how dull it would be without such an impeccable cast. Ed Skrein remarkably portrays Dick Best, the only character who's genuinely compelling and carries a complete, well-developed arc.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn't feel invested in any other character. Only the best movies of every year can have a numerous and talented cast while giving each and every actor an exciting role. Midway has too many characters for the story it wants to tell. In addition to this, it has to stretch its runtime because you can't get Woody Harrelson or Dennis Quaid playing secondary roles and not giving them more than just a couple of lines. As time goes by, Emmerich's storytelling structure gets needlessly more and more complicated to follow. It's yet another film added to the ""wasted potential"" list...<br/><br/>Potential due to how truly magnificent the action sequences can be. It's undeniable that these are entertaining, gripping, and exciting. The dive bombers' scenes are packed with so much tension that I was getting more and more frustrated every time they missed their target, and a bomb went into the sea. I wanted them to succeed so bad, and this feeling can only be triggered by something extraordinary. Midway's war is as close to epic as it could be, but as with every other cinematic production, if its story and its characters are not up to par with the action, there are no outstanding VFX that can save a lousy screenplay.<br/><br/>All in all, Midway is a respectful homage to the people who fought in the Battle of Midway, but it fails to deliver an engaging story with compelling characters. With more characters that what it needed, the runtime is stretched beyond its limit due to the numerous acclaimed actors who would never be in a movie if they didn't have more than a couple of lines. Roland Emmerich has to thank his VFX team for presenting the closest war action we could ever get of the famous battle. Truly epic visuals with tense and riveting aerial sequences, plus a powerful sound design, get your teeth biting the nails. Unfortunately, except for Ed Skrein's character, I didn't feel invested enough to appreciate the non-action moments due to the confusing, convoluted, and exposition-heavy narrative. It's a shame that a visually impressive film possesses such an emotionally dull story. However, I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys war epics and ""based on a true story"" adaptations.<br/><br/>PS: it doesn't hurt to research a bit about the Battle of Midway. I didn't and I'm sort of regretting that now. Don't make the same mistake. Going in with basic knowledge of what, how, and why it happened will only help you enjoy this movie more."

","Look, I'm a huge war movie buff, and always look super forward to seeing the next one, especially when they are called ""Historically accurate"". This movie was a bit of a mess. I know that it was covering a long period of time and attempting to cram in a lot of history, but it was almost unwatchable due to the cadence of the film. Mostly, the character portrayals were just terrible, not one made to be likeable. I've watched ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"" each a dozen times, and that is because the characterization of the men who served in this horrific war was amazing and realistic, and truly honors their sacrifice. Somehow movies like ""Band of Brothers"" and ""We were Soldiers"" seems to truly capture the feeling of what these men went through. Midway falls short of doing those who served justice. It felt more like a bad history lesson, that was not completely understandable, filmed without care of the sacrifices of the actual servicemen.<br/><br/>I don't mean to mock Woody Harrelson, he's a great actor, but it just throws you off to be watching the pot smoking sex guru as one of our nations greatest Admirals. It's an indication of how superficial this film feels. Sorry Woody. The rest of the characters, specifically Dick Best, were too mouthy and anti-authoritarian to be a soldiers in the 1940's, no less be promoted to commanding officers. Just not realistic, and I don't feel an honorable representation of these men.<br/><br/>In the end, there are so many movies that young people should see to get as close to understanding and feeling something for the great sacrifices of the millions of Americans who came before them. But sadly ""Midway"" is not one of them. Watch it, because the history is important, but be prepared to be disappointed."

"jljacobi","6","2","5","9 February 2020"," I really wanted to like this movie, but just can't
","First off, my dad flew SBDs in the Pacific. This is stuff I grew up with. It's tough to know where to start, but the characterizations are as good a place as any. Overblown would be the kindest way to describe them. Borderline disrespectful caricatures using Hollywood's naive idea of what military types are like would be the worst.<br/><br/>Then there's the dialog. I know they're trying to set the stage, but having characters flat out spout the historical setup is crude at best. If you know nothing about WWII, it might not bother you. If you do, you'll likely cringe.<br/><br/>Then there's the CGI. The actual renderings didn't bother me much, but darkening the entire color palette to stress how somber the subject is an amateurish move. The entire screen play is overwrought as well. Perpetual seriousness. If you've ever been involved with such things, you'll know that there are months of boredom and normalcy, interrupted with a hour of terror here and there.<br/><br/>It seems as if the filmmakers wanted to honor the subject, I'll give them that. So an A for effort, but they miss the mark. Badly IMHO.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie about the Pacific, see Tora, Tora, Tora. The stunts are real, and the characterizations far more realistic. I didn't think the previous Midway was all the great, but this one is way off the mark.<br/><br/>Dunkirk it ain't."

"jamesnoro","4","2","5","27 November 2019"," A potently great movie bogged down by terrible editing, a misguided narrative, and a handful of other problems.
","I would like to start by acknowledging that many of the reviews here are written by veterans or their family members. As a son of a US army soldier, I respect their views but respectfully disagree. My review is not about the accuracy of navy procedure or even the accuracy of the movie in general. If you want that, there are many others who have reviewed the movie on this basis. I am here to review this as what it is, a movie.<br/><br/>Midway is a misguided mess. A movie that is supposedly a retelling of the decisive naval battle does not open strong. In fact, in the first scene, we are introduced to the main problem of this movie. Midways' editing is atrocious. One moment we are in 1930's japan, then the attack on pearl harbor. The way scenes are edited together is messy. A scene can come and go without any real relation to the scene preceding and proceeding. Because of this, the story comes off as choppy and we get long amounts of time where characters just disappear from the story only to pop up randomly later. This isn't helped by the fact that we are never introduced to characters outside of what I guess is our main protagonist, Lieutenant Richard ""Dick"" Best. I say this because, as I said before, there are large portions of screen-time he just disappears. Along with this, characters do not progress through the film. They pop up randomly having achieved something off screen since the time we last saw them. Best is a great example of this. Outside of his initial introduction, we see him do very little until the real battle.<br/><br/>This is one of Midways greatest faults, the ""characters"" are poorly developed and get no screen-time to develop themselves out of what we as the viewer are introduced to them as. Best is introduced as a cocky smart-mouth who's one hell of a pilot. That is what he is. Nothing is done to develop him out of this and we learn nothing about him. This would have been fine in a 70's action movie. However, this is based on a real person. Someone who actually fought in the battle of Midway. Almost everyone suffers from this, a great example is Joseph Rochefort, the Chief Cryptanalyst during this time. He is given no introduction. Thrown onscreen and portrayed as an eccentric who is good at his job. He is given one scene and then disappears forever. All ""characters"" in this movie are nothing more than means to an end.<br/><br/>This is all a fault of the overall narrative. Midways' storytelling is awful. ""Characters"" are thrown into the plot to only disappear and never be mentioned again. No regard is given to time as we fly down the timeline, sticking scenes that are sometimes months apart next to each other with no mention. Events like the bombing of Tokyo are thrown in with no concern, given a few scenes, then forgotten about and wrapped up in an ending memorial. What makes this worse is that we never stick with one story for more than a few scenes. The plot jumps around after every scene. Sometimes forgetting stories for long periods only to jump back with no real continuity. This is compounded by the fact that the dialogue sucks. It's cheesy, dated, and sometimes downright cringe-inducing.<br/><br/>The real tragedy of Midway, however, is that underneath all of this there is a beautiful movie. The cinematography in this movie was fantastic. The attack on pearl harbor and the battle itself is magnificent. When we actually follow the planes into battle I found myself shocked by how well done the shots were.<br/><br/>This is why I'm more disappointed with Midway than anything. Because once we get past the poor editing and story. We get what I consider a good battle scene. Once the plot actually slows down and follows the battle, we get a good movie. We still have the Cheesy dialog and overuse of poorly done CGI. However, the movie actually picks itself up and delivers us a great battle. We have callbacks to the original attack on pearl harbor and well-executed character moments. In fact, we have an amazingly-done scene of Best and his co-pilot as they prepare to go back out to find the final aircraft carrier. Along with this, the scene of the Japanese commander going down with his ship is a shining moment that shows the movie can have well-written scenes.<br/><br/>This is the true tragedy of Midway. Underneath all the problems, we have brilliant cinematography and a potentially great third act. Because of everything else though, this is nothing more than what could have been. A movie that is dedicated to those who died in these battles and risked their lives in it can do better, and should. Like I said before. I'm not here to review this movie for its accuracy. I'm not here to pretend I understand what these men sacrificed. If you want that, there are other reviews that will tell you that. I'm only here to tell you of what could have been a good movie, and what we got. Would I recommend this? No."

","Too many camera changes, well over 2000. I had to watch this a few times to figure out just what was wrong with it; there was just something not quite right. The scenes didn't 'flow' together, it seemed like it was all just stuck together. Then it hit me; it was just 'all stuck together'. Each scenes is almost all just quick one or two second video clips, joined to create the final product. Then that is joined to make another. No cohesion. No continuity. You very rarely see both characters in a conversation at the same time, because they weren't there at the same time; each was filmed from behind so you saw the other person without any camera behind them. So it feels disjointed. I watched it three tijmes, and averaged 2136 separate video clips for the entire movie. All were taken separetely. No wonder if feels like it's not together; because you don't get to see the characters interact; you only see one at a time; when that one is done speaking, the other takes a turn. Same with the flying. You see the pilot, they cut away and all you see is feet, or all you see it stick, or all you see is throttle. It's never the whole person. When two people are in a conversation, you have no idea what the other person is feeling/thinking while the other character speaks, because you can't see their face. They may as well be talking to a manniquin. Perhaps it's cheaper to do it this way? Short solo scenes are easier for actors do to, less to memorize for each couple of sentences, and of course, with only one person speaking in each clip, it's easy to just have one person do it. Watch the 1976 version and see the difference (that one, BTW, has a total of 1023 scenes). Don't take my word for it. Watch both. See which flows better. Yes, the 2019 film has plenty of explosions, lots of shooting, but the story? Nope. Plane appears to be flying directly into the side of a ship, but comes out high on the other side. HOW? We never see it. All the flying here is CGI and special effects. Nothing real like you see in the 1976 version.
Oh yes, and the first 25 minutes of this 2019 film, were of the attack on Pearl Harbor, then some more on the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. So they apparently had to rush through the story about Midway. Perhaps a terrific movie for a Saturday matinee for the kiddies."

","Forgive me. I made the mistake of watching Midway after watching 1917 and here are my takeaways. 1917 is high art from its camerawork, set design and action. Midway is not. It's a poor depiction of war which plays and looks more like a video game. Complete with over the top computer generated effects and unrealistic characters being superheroes.<br/><br/>The special effects are terrible here, laughable even and the characters are even worse. I could have sworn I was watching a parody. This is a cartoon war movie compared to 1917 void of any emotional weight. Shame because the real story is so compelling.<br/><br/>I am surprised the ratings are as high as they are. This was a big disappointment."

In the end, when a character meets their fate, you don't feel any emotional attachment.<br/><br/>I sorry to say I have to recommend watching the original 1976 film which while it didn't have great CGI did involve you with the characters so you had a feeling of the human aspect to the battle."

Basically... Its just awful,.. Full of clichés, over the top American 'heroism'for the screen, reasonable CGI, but it's nothing we've not seen before.
This is a typical, dumbed down pro American film that Hollywood (with I note Chinses money)!, is churning out for the past few years.

","Where to start.... Well the only reason this seems to pass as a 7 star is nationalism, nothing more nothing less.<br/><br/>
The movie seems to at least take the historical events serious and is partly historically accurate. That is the biggest pluspoint of the movie.
Sadly the script is bad, it lacks narrative, coherence, has tons of cliches and simply doesn't give the actors anything to make their character feel real or alive. Simply put it feels like they got a high school drama club with no experience in plays or acting to write it. The American characters are like cardboard and the japanese like a piece of paper, there in no depth(or attempt to create one) in the characters. They're just superficial and it feels like they're there for the sake of the plot and nothing more.<br/><br/>The acting is so-so, it's mostly bad but here and there you can spot some decent acting. It mostly just feels like people are spitting their lines just to get it over with, not that they really could have done better with such an abomination of a script.
The CGI is just terrible, if there was a decent budget for it, somewhere along the lines there was a lot skimmed of and it looks like they went for their last resort, a guy living in his mothers basement.<br/><br/>My grandfather was at both Pearl Harbor and Midway and if he were alive today(god rest his soul) and gone to the cinema to watch this, he'd have ripped out his chair and thrown it through the screen. Sadly the only thing he can do now is roll over in his grave whilst the movie just milks money from the historical events without showing proper respect for those who died(American and Japanese).<br/><br/>The only ""good"" thing about this movie was that through some miracle there is no pushing of a political agenda. Together with the fact that it's not completely historically inaccurate it's the only redeeming factor of this movie.
If I were to guess what ages they made the movie for I'd say younger than 12, because anyone older(and clear of mind) will zone out within half an hour.<br/><br/>How so many can rate this a 10 or even an 8 is beyond me. I guess patriotism makes people blind for the true disaster that is Midway(2019)."

","Midway tells the incredible true story of the Battle of the Midway in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It boosts an incredible star studded cast of talented actors, showcases flashy special effects and gives us a balanced perspective, but that movie can't help but feel just overly bland.<br/><br/>Midway is yet another film by infamous director Roland Emmerich that fails to understand that drama is through character and not situations and explosions. In the end the film really fails the real people that risked their lives by portraying them as flat one dimensional people.<br/><br/>As I said the cast is really good and sometimes they all manage to give at least something memorable to the film overall, but there's really not a reason to care for these characters aside that they're based on real people that have their lives. The action scenes are good, but it's nothing we haven't seen before and done much better.<br/><br/>Midway ends up being a lifeless soulless recreation of historical events that fails to illuminate on the horrors of war, or the sacrifices made.

","This movie is confused. It's an exploration of the conflict between American and Japanese forces in the Pacific from primarily the American perspective and yet the movie has nearly half of its budget coming from Chinese backers. I don't generally care where the money comes from on these movies but in this case I feel like it might have something to do with the confusion.<br/><br/>We get a lot of time on both the American and Japanese sides of things with the Americans often treated like the clumsy buffoons who accidental themselves into victories while the Japanese have the superior force and skill yet suffer from sheer rotten luck. Which is maybe how it really happened, I don't pretend to know, but it doesn't film well.<br/><br/>That alone wouldn't kill it, but clumsy plot movements don't help and neither does an unnecessary number of underdeveloped characters. Couple that with a firm jaunt into the uncanny valley with the effects and this movie is a mess. Too much of the budget must have gone to the cast and not to the finishing touches on the visuals because there are times planes are crashing into the ocean and it looks like an AR effect I could get on my phone.<br/><br/>Weirdly, despite all of that, I didn't hate this movie, it just wasn't very good and a surprisingly disappointing theatre experience."
"acppage","3","2","6","29 November 2019"," Garbage - Style over substance
","I'm somewhat confused by all the high scored reviews, we seem to have watched different films.<br/><br/>In my eyes this is a classic example of attempted style over substance where a huge amount of money has been thrown as what is essentially a very bad made-for-tv script and then directed by a hack in full Michael Bay mode.<br/><br/>The pacing is deeply uneven, the accents are often bordering on atrocious (stop forcing actors that can't do a convincing accent foreign to them to do one for god's sake), the acting is all nover the place (dennis quaid being a strange example of a really good actor horribly directed as a walking gruff cliche) with the best performances being woody harrellson (in a role that didn't push him in any way) and the japanese admiral/generals (although they are largely presented as pastiche save for a couple of moments). The somewhat dodgy CGI is heavily over-relied on, especially in the opening battle making for a jarring and visually chaotic experience where it didn't blend particularly well (it does work fairly well in the main battle sequence, which is the best part of the film by a very very long way).<br/><br/>Character development is thin on the ground, what little there is mostly being crammed into about 15minutes before the main battle. Although I mention development, you can't really develop two-dimensional cardboard cutouts that are essentially walking talking cliches (something which plagues almost every aspect of the film: seeming obliviousness to agonising cliche). The dialogue meanwhile is simply abominable except for one or two short exchanges which raise expectations only to have them quickly dashed again in the next scene.<br/><br/>The director of photography and the person doing the scoring appear to have tried their very best to put the oscar-worthy epic films stamp on it, but mostly serve to over-egg the pot and further highlight the rest of the film's short-comings. It's almost like someone planned the aerial scenes in the battle of midway then frantically tried to cobble a film together around them. There are a few small nods to the period and atmosphere of the time, but just that, small ineffectual nods that simply place the setting in that peculiar world of soft-focus, sepia-tinted, whisky-soaked nostalgia that never existed but is used as a crutch in so many films.<br/><br/>This film has very clear aspirations above its station but merits none of them and conveys little of the surrounding history. A tale full of sound and fury, told by an idiot and signifying nothing (with a cool dogfight and a couple of noble deaths.)<br/><br/>(I will give them a tip of the hat where due for deigning to recognise the japanese as actual human beings as opposed to just inscrutable stoic enemies in the ending dedication.)"

"chris_dias","4","2","6","18 November 2019"," Meh... Watch ""Storm over the Pacific"" instead.
","I'm a bit nostalgic since I saw the original ""Midway"" in 1976 IN Sensurround! For 10 year olds we still knew the story and the hardware, e.g. the difference between a F4F Wildcat and a F6F Hellcat or that the torpedo planes should've been TBD Devastators and not SBD Dauntless. Midway (1976) used real airplanes and WW2 gun camera footage alongside outtakes from ""Tora Tora Tora"", ""30 Seconds over Tokyo"", ""The Battle of Britain"", and ""Storm Over the Pacific""; and one really out of place jet plane crash on the USS Essex (from the Korean War). It had Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, Pat Morita, Hal Holbrook and a cast of stars and future stars (Tom Selleck, Eric Estrada) ... It's one of my favorite movies despite some inaccuracies and 1970's limitations. That all said, I HATED ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). After a certain point film-makers have the technology and HISTORY to tell an accurate story (I could write a Phd. dissertation on the inaccuracies of ""Pearl Harbor). So (FINALLY) where does Midway 2019 rank? I give it 4 stars (out of 10). Midway was a HUGE battle and setting it up w/ Pearl Harbor AND the Doolittle Raid added too much story to tell in 2 hours 20 minutes. If anything the film SHOULD'VE been titled ""Enterprise CV-6"" since apparently only pilots and crew from that ship did anything in the Battle of Midway (or that's what the Director thinks). Missing (completely) from the movie: Rear Admiral Fletcher who was the (frickin') overall commander of the fleet defending Midway. Also MIA, US Fighter planes...really! No mention or footage of ANY US fighter planes (just dive bombers and torpedo planes). No mention that USS Yorktown's/Hornet's fighter cover that had to turn back or ditch in the ocean. No mention of portrayal of the brave Marines (led by Major Parks) flying obsolete Brewster Buffalos defending Midway Island (they got obliterated)... no portrayal of the Yorktown fighter escort (led by CDR John Thatch) that actually engaged the Japanese combat air patrol only losing one plane (shooting down 6) and allowing VT-3 to attack the Japanese fleet. Not ONE F4F-Wildcat in the entire movie. There were some other inaccuracies (like HUGE holes in the Order of Battle: e.g. VT-8, from Hornet attacked first, not VT-6 and the ""Glee"" guy, from Enterprise) but in closing I'll just say that anyone from the USS Yorktown or USS Hornet or even the (glossed over) USS Lexington should feel pretty slighted by this movie. But hey, at least this movie has a Jonas Brother."
"gnix1979","4","2","6","17 November 2019"," A remake that's sadly executed
","Having watched and come to love the original Midway movie starring some juggernauts of Hollywood history, I was really looking forward to a more modern version of the story of Midway.<br/><br/>However this movie suffers in the same way as Pearl Harbour was a bad movie, only this time there is no love story. My heading states badly executed, here is why.<br/><br/>Plot:
The movie itself is overloaded with narrative, from the attack on Pearl Harbour, to the Doolittle raid over Tokyo then onto Midway. Everything moved so quickly that there is no real character development nor any real reason to invest any emotion in them.<br/><br/>Pace:
Imagine having a DVD with the events of WW2 and then playing it on 10x speed, that's how this movie was. In my opinion the attack Pearl Harbour should have been left out, and start the movie with the Doolitle raid. At just over 2hrs, this movie was so overloaded that it missed key important and interesting elements of the events leading to the battle.<br/><br/>Cast:
I love Woody Harrelson, and he looked and acted the part, but was so under used it was very disappointing. I also love Dennis Quaid, he was probably one of the standout actors on the movie playing Admiral Halsey. However I felt he had too much air time in the movie considering he wasn't involved in the battle due to being hospitalized. The two US admirals (Fletcher and Spruance) who were involved had very little to no airtime in the movie, this made no sense as they had to make on the spot decisions that helped turn the tide of the battle, specifically Spruance's decision to launch the first attack at max range which cost the lives of some airmen due to running out of fuel. The actors who played the Japanese were pretty solid, seeing a familiar and reliable face of the actor who played Admiral Yamaguchi. But again I felt they deserved more airtime.<br/><br/>Historically accurate?:
For the most part I would say yes, but even some of that is given some of the typical Hollywood treatment. For instance when Torpedo 8 has an unsuccessful attack on a battleship at Corak Sea due to poor torpedoes, and when the squadron is wiped out at Midway is 100% accurate, even the comments made by the Japanese commanders about how bad the planes and crews were is true, because the planes were outdated and crew not experienced.<br/><br/>However there were some things they overlooked for instance the fact that a third of the Bombing 8 squadron had no bombs due to faulty equipment was missed out. The crucial role that fighting 8 played in the battle was cut. The invaluable role that the PBYs from Midway played in locating the Japanese fleet was cut (airgroup was called Strawberry) the movie suggested that it was Layton that put them on the right path, truth is that the Jap fleet were coming out of a big storm and it was unknown exactly where they would come out of."

","While sitting in the theatre, I was sure most men wanted to be them, and most women wanted to do them. Hell, when I watched Dick Best dive bomb a Japanese destroyer and then turn back and go at them one more time as if he was returning a few rounds of blazing hot lead he borrowed last week, I briefly considered giving my wife a hall-pass for him that night; only him, though.<br/><br/>That, though, is the problem I have with Roland Emmerich's Midway, the mercurial, big-screen action director, whose new film is much more Independence Day than Saving Private Ryan. These CGI special effects are great to look at, gorgeous even, but cartoonish because so much of it is computer-generated. You never have the feeling that if you reach out, you could touch a live-action plane; this is Star Wars, but now instead of Star Fighters and Y-Wings they are Aichi D34 Carrier-Borne Bombers, Douglas SDB-3 Dauntless Dive Bombers, and Douglas TBD Devastators; the carriers and destroyers are Star Cruisers and Death Stars. The film though, you are talking about a film which is so heavily invested in flight and vintage aircraft that it does an admirable job. The team here does build up a certain amount of suspense and thrills; mainly, the dive-bombing scenes gave me a sense of awe-struck pride and amazement. It's almost the equivalent of a child playing with a toy plane, and making bomb noises with their mouths as they send the plane towards the mother's carpeted family room floor (not the living room floor, that's the room always marked off for ""company""). The film's scripted dialogue is recycled from war films of its own ilk multiple decades before, even though I was slightly relieved when they did acknowledge sacrifices on the other side of unseen events by civilians."

","This film portrays the battles in the pacific in the World War 2 era of the 1940s. The battles that take place in it are against the Japanese and the United States. The film shows many different battles such as Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>The film had many quality actors such as Ed Skrein, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson, Nick Jonas, Dennis Quaid, and many more. These talented actors do a very good part at portraying their roles in the film. Overall I felt the actors committed well to their roles. Having such a high level cast attributed largely to why I believe this film was such a success in my eyes.<br/><br/>I felt this film very accurately showed the historical aspect of the battles of the pacific. Be that submarine, carrier, or battleship warfare. The film also shows many dogfights throughout. They also show things such as Doolittle's raid, which was a retaliation attack that the begging of the war on the Japanese, for Pearl Harbor. This depiction of the raid was very accurate. I appreciated how they showed that the bombers were not able to make it back to the carrier. Many of the pilots struggles to escape from the Japanese and most became prisoners of war. Some of the pilots in Doolittle's raid were executed for their actions.<br/><br/>The film had very period correct vehicles and costumes. The ships, planes, and cars are all very period correct for a film that is supposed to be set in the World War 2 1940s. A large part of the film follows various characters in different positions as they work to battle the Japanese in the Pacific theater. Many of these actors contribute greatly and selflessly to the success of the United States in battle. The film also has little scenes showing the Japanese and their struggles throughout the war. It also shows a prewar meeting between Edwin Layton and various Japanese generals. This helps to see the success of Edwin and how he is able to see what moves the Japanese will make next.<br/><br/>My drawback of this film is some of the cinematography isn't very believable. The computer-generated graphics of some of the planes and ships does not seem real or believable. I have viewed other films that have much more believable CGI. The overall portrayal of the film and layout was presented very well from scene to scene. If the film would get better CGI I believe it would easily be a 10/10 film."

","I can imagine that this version of Midway is going to get a bimodal distribution of reviews. On one hand, it is an excellent play-by-play depiction of the first few months of the Pacific War in WW2. It is tremendously detailed and for the most part factually accurate. Broad-strokes, every big event (and many of the small ones) you see in this movie really happened. The movie not only does a decent job of covering these events, but also gives a good insight into the strategy (on both sides) behind them. Historically-speaking, it's just excellent in a way that few war movies ever are. It's 1976 predecessor, as an example, got a fair number of the little details correct, but at the same time either ignored, glossed over, or got wrong a number of other things.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this (kind of like the 1976 version, but for different reasons) just isn't that good of a ""movie"". The acting is a bit hackey, and the dialogue isn't great. Harrelson and Wilson are great in their roles, as is the guy who playes Rochefort, and most of the Japanese actors, but the biggest roles of Dick Best and some of the other Navy pilots, are just not done very well. I'm not enough into this world to know if it's the acting, writing, or directing, but there's a fair bit of performance here that just isn't believeable for some reason. I guess they're trying their best, and for a movie of this kind of historical significance, maybe that's enough? As a history buff who has been reading on this topic since my early teens, I'll rate this movie highly for its accuracy, but I can see why a lot of people who either don't care about history or don't like war movies in particular just won't like it very much. If you do like those topics, and the thought of what humans go through during conflicts like WW2 makes a chill run down your spine, then you'll like this.<br/><br/>I will say, it is a FAR superior remake of this event than ""Pearl Harbor"" is to ""Tora Tora Tora""."

One thing for example is the CGI. It was terrible. It was only good if it was in the distance. Besides that, it was terrible. It was so easy to tell if there was a green screen. They could have spent more money on the CGI. I thought the story was good. The only thing I didn't like about it was how much jumping around there was. You didn't really know what was going on. How many characters there were also didn't help that. The score wasn't bad. It made the movie feel more of a navy movie and that was good. There were some intense sequences in this film too. They made you want something and if it didn't happen you would almost get mad. That is a job well done. This movie also gave you a good perspective on how hard it is to hit a ship with a bomb. You see the Michael Bay movie Pearl Harbor and you think it is a fox trot. You watch this and you see how hard it is. They did a good job with that too.<br/><br/>Overall, Midway was a good war film that got you on the edge of your seat but the CGI disappointed. I would recommend this film for people that have been in the war or fascinated with the subject of World War 2."
"markrocha","8","1","2","27 February 2020"," Midway doesn't need artistic liberty
","There were many well done action scenes, and character development (for the most part) was not bad. It was important to set the stage regarding the far-reaching impact of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor; however, there were missed opportunities to portray the overwhelming American sentiment after the Japanese attack. Moral on-base was really low, and many officers felt badly, given the circumstances: the overwhelming challenges, loss of lives, and the embarrassment of the battle.
Admiral Nimitz was really more of a hands-on leader, he had a silent presence and he understood the sense of urgency. The film did not fully portray his burden of rebuilding the Pacific fleet and how Washington was not willing to acccept failure.
While I also appreciated the attempt to develop the Japanese perspective, many of the portrayals were softened. For example, the Doolittle raid infuriated the Japanese public as several bombs fell on the the Emperor's grounds. The detail and character develop for Japanese commanders fell short too. Some facts were wrong, but the film isn't a documentary, it's entertainment.
Some scenes could have been cut: John Ford filming on Midway, the submarine scenes, the pilot's wife's gathering, and the capture and subsequent death of an American at the hands of the Japanese. It's a story about the battle and these subplots do not add any value.
Still, I wish the general public would also realize that no one ""wins"" a medal. The ""receipients"" are awarded their medals and recognized for their acts of heroism. An act of valor is NOT a competition. Sadly, I don't believe most Americans understand resolve and personal sacrifice. It would be a powerful lesson from history if we would be willing to listen, let alone learn it."

","The effects / CGI & attention to small details (horrifying or otherwise) of war - eg the poor burning sailors shown (albeit at a tasteful distance) falling from ships during the Pearl Harbour attack...certainly advances in technology have allowed better combat 'epicness' when comparing this to 2001's 'Pearl Harbour' which obviously utilised more real life shots than here. I don't mind the pace, the time spent on critical characters (nice that they mix ideas & info from other films, like Halsey's hospitalisation etc). Characters are generally very well-played (Patrick Wilson, a classic gruff Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Etsushi Toyokawa & Tadanobu Asano & Woody Harrelson is solid in a rare serious/historical role), the photography is just lovely & w/delightful vibrant Pacific colour in outdoor scenes, possibly a little dark in interior shots...my main issue w/this picture is some of the pilot & crew leads who (accepting the classic presumption of fighter pilot types & their common/assumed over-confidence) just stick w/their starting personas of attitutude & arrogance, being continuously disrespectful of authority etc in a number of the main roles (esp.Skrein) who'd been flying for some years & would've surely lost that act pre-war, let alone once a combat veteran, right through to young inexperienced crew/gunners who even once 'experienced' w/multiple combat sorties, act like its their 1st fresh-faced flight. That character 'behaviour choice' made some of these men's portrayals seem VERY questionable to me & unfortunately shot holes in an otherwise decent attempt to cover a LOT of historical lead up, often forgotten behind the scenes / codebreaking coverage, the mistakes/choices on both sides in huge battles & the excellent action."

","I am not a history expert but from my reading on the Battle, the movie gets it fairly right.<br/><br/>Other reviewers who are USN veterans found it so. I did wonder about the be absence of USN fighter aircraft. And I was disappointed that the lossbof the Lexington in the Battle of the Coral Sea, which is what we Australians say saved Australia from invasion was not explicitly noted. The loss of the Yorktown at Midway, where, badly damaged and listing it was abandoned, and reboarded by a salvage crew as it was still aloat, and wounded sailors found and evacuated; and finally sunk by the only Japanese Navy unit that distinguished itself, a submarine, might have been fleshed out. But perhaps that ended up 'on the cutting room floor' to keep screen time to just over 2 hrs.<br/><br/>I admit that after the disappointment of the earlier movie, and poor reviews of this one by the professional critics, I was not expecting much. At the beginning of the movie the 'soapy stuff' with wives made me think it was going to be another 'stinker', maybe as bad as the awful Ben Affleck movie 'Pearl Harbor', which couldn't even get the cringeworthy RAF part right (US Eagle Squadron pilots volunteered illegally under the US Neutrality Act, their heroism appreciated by the Brits but which would early on, have gotten them prison time in the US. When the US enterred WW2, the Eagle Sqns were transferred to the USAAF forming a core of experience around which newly arrived USAAF sqns could be built. USAAF pilots did not turn up to join the RAF wearing US uniform!)<br/><br/>Thankfully my first impression was proven wrong and 'Midway' turned out to be a serious effort to get it (mostly) right.

We didn't see much of it other than it's fast recovery. Marshall Island's skirmish was unnecessary to include for the storyline. The Battle of Coral sea could have been shown instead.

","""Midway"" (2019 release; 138 min.) brings the story of the WWII battle of Midway. As the movie opens, it is ""December 4, 1937"", and British, US and Japanese dignitaries are exchanging toasts in the name of peace. We then go to ""December 7, 1941"", as the Japanese are starting to attack Pearl Harbor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Roland Emmerich, yes, he of ""Independence Day"" (and its sequel), ""2012"", ""White House Down"", and so on. That is really all you need to know to put this latest version of ""Midway"" into perspective. Character development is minimal, but who cares anyway, as we all await the battle scenes. Once they come, starting with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the movie's last hour with the actual battle of Midway (on June 4, 1942, amazingly only 6 months after Pearl Harbor), all restraint is thrown overboard, and it's almost an assault on the senses. And yes, quite enjoyable. The thing is that the battle scenes are perfect, frankly too perfect. Think of it like watching video games on steroids. I can't help but think back to the 1976 movie of the same name covering the same events (starring Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda), when CGI was not available and the movie makers used other means (including actual archival footage from the battle). While I enjoyed the Roland Emmerich re-imagination of Midway better than I expected, I nevertheless feel that the 1976 movie is slightly better, or perhaps I should say that it feels more realistic. Please note: Emmerich financed this $100 million production movie independently outside the Hollywood studio system, and he ended up getting a sizable part of the budget financed through Chinese investors. That comes at a cost of course, and hence the script makes a couple of unnecessary, if not questionable, detours into China's role (?) in the battle of Midway. A darn shame.<br/><br/>""Midway"" opened wide several weeks ago, and I finally got around to seeing it. The Friday matinee screening where I saw this at the day after Thanksgiving was attended okay (about 20 people in a large theater). If you have an interest in WWII and/or in big budget war movies, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"frobrojkt","8","1","2","27 November 2019"," One of the most visually spectacular films of the year!
","Midway absolutely delivers with its visual recreation of the battle of midway and several of the battles leading up to it.
The acting for the most part is spot on! The more well known actors like Dennis Quade and Woody Harrilson (probably spelled wrong) put fort a flawless performance. While even the lesser known actors do a pretty good job. Only a few poorly delivered lines out of the whole 2 hour + running time.
Based off of the limited research I did prior to seeing the film and what I knew previously, Midway gives a extremely accurate depiction of the battle. As well as the details of the war behind the scenes on both sides. My feeling is that it this film did quite well accurately describing the war from both the US and Japanese military. The film obviously has a American spin on the story, but I really appreciated how humanizing it is to both sides of the war. This is NOT an American military propaganda film.
All in all a solid film, however it's running time seems a little excessive. If they wanted to put that much detail into this, I would've loved to see this as a miniseries as opposed to a 2h+ film.
I hope there will be more films like this to come."

After making the fatal error in not believing the Japanese were going to strike Pearl Harbor, the Americans are determined to make a decisive attack on their foes by taking out their aircraft carriers (using dive bombing tactics). Using a plethora of CG imagery (some an eyesore, others impressive especially the aerial combat sequences) to depict the battle sequences, the film works whenever Emmerich decides to let the images speak for themselves but whenever the poor actors open their mouths to espouse obvious historical points in 40's twinged New Yawk accents, one's eye rolling can become a liability. Starring some Brits playing yanks like Ed Skrein (who's gunnery partner is played by Keean Johnson, they both were in Alita: Battle Angel) & Luke Evans & able support by Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Mandy Moore, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas & Darren Criss."

This seemed to lead into an awful lot of foreshortening and simplification of Midway itself.<br/><br/>With that being said, it was well-paced, with good performances, and covered a lot of the essentials well. Details such as the ""water"" message from Midway were well-placed, as were refernces to the well-known shortcomings of the Bliss-Leavitt Mk XIII aerial torpedo (""clunk""), and the TBD Devastator torpedo bomber (although in the actual battle the USN had 6 of the newer, faster, better armed and armoured TBF Avengers and lost 5 of those, so it wasn't just the planes).<br/><br/>I was surprised to see comparatively little involvement depicted of the fighters in the actual battle, and I think that not enough explanation was given of the US Navy's plan for coordinated aerial attacks with torpedo bombers at low level, dive bombers from high level with fighter cover provided by the F4Fs, and importantly why that didn't happen and its devastating conseuences in terms of the virtual annihilation of the torpedo squadrons.<br/><br/>In all, I think it was a good film that simply tried to cover too much historical ground in too short a time.

But we don't only see the ferocity of Midway itself, we're given the build-up to the War in the Pacific plus depictions of the Pearl Harbor attack and the follow up engagements between the Japanese and American forces. This was important in setting the stage for the main event as it were.<br/><br/>Turning to the special effects briefly. The CGI is absolutely mind blowing, as would be expected from an Emmerich film of this nature. I could not get over the attention to detail of the ships, aircraft, firepower and landscapes rendered. Simply magnificent. To my mind there's never been a more, dare I say it, ""beautiful"" depiction of war in the Pacific. It really raises the bar to a height I dont think will be surpassed for a long time in movies of this genre.<br/><br/>Another very important aspect of war films for me is how ""the enemy"" are portrayed and to be fair the Japanese aren't painted in simple-minded, propagandistic terms. They are mostly shown as the brave and thinking airmen and naval personnel we know they were. At one point for example Yamamoto mentions how the oil embargo on Japan is leaving the country with no option BUT war. Again this is important in a historical context, especially as so many people these days are ignorant of the past (not saying i'm an expert on it of course!). We know that Japanese forces did indeed commit many atrocities, against Allied troops but more especially against the Chinese population and other Asian civilians under their occupation, so it's good that these are highlighted at various points in the film too."

","Midway Is an WWII war movie made by action blockbuster writer/director Roland Emmerich (Independents Day,2012, Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow). Emmerich is known for his dazzling special effect and this film does not disappoint.
The film portrays the events that led up to the turning point of the War in the Pacific ""The Battle of Midway"".
I have read that this version of the story is more historical accurate than the 1976 Charleston Heston classic. The film mainly follows two (real life) American soldiers, pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack. The film also has other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).
The film moves quickly through the events in the early months of the War., from the attack on Pearl Harbor, to Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942).
The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.
As I said before the battle scene were fantastic, and the acting was top notch. May bestest complaint was how it jumped quickly from screen to screen and battle to battle. I would have also liked to see the Japanese counter attack that led to the destruction of the USS Yorktown, which was something the 1976 film did well. The Charleston Heston film is one of my favorite War films (even if it was not accurate). So this film had a lot to live up to, and it did! The film does have a 2 hour 18 minute run time (which is 6 minutes longer than the original). This is a PG film so there is no graphic violence, so it's fit for the whole family.
With this past weekend being Veterans Day, avoid the critics reviews, are check out a great movie."

You don't have to be a history nerd to keep up with the story of the battles that build up to the battle of midway, because they're explained by the characters. Is the majority of the backgrounds and battle scenes CGI? Yes! But after a while, the intense action makes you forget.
It seems as though some of the stories were taken straight from the History Channel documentary ""Battle 360"" on the USS Enterprise's role in WWII. Even some of the fighter scenes and dive bombings are reproduced in this film with uncanny similarities. But overall, this film is riveting at times and down right entertaining."

-The physical aircraft mockups were very well done and, from what I've been told, the TBD mockup was even donated to the USS Midway museum.
-The sound design was fantastic and very immersive. Not as amazing as Dunkirk but deserves props nonetheless.
-There were a lot of little historical nuances that they nailed including the historical timeline leading up to the battle. Other, eve smaller, things appeared such as Halsey having shingles, Gaido's heroic action at the Marshall Islands, the Japanese wargames, etc.
-Some very memorable scenes. Everything involving Nimitz, Layton, and the codebreakers was fantastic. The Japanese scenes were all very well done as well.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>-The writing, oh the writing. It really feels like this was written by a film school student. The dialog was stiff and wooden along with the cookie cutter characters. While they represented real people, the film mostly made up their personalities with exception of a couple. The entire film was very disjointed and jumped around constantly and featured many scenes that served almost no purpose whatsoever. There were also scenes and characters that would appear randomly but we would never go back to them thus leaving the audience hanging with no follow through. While historically ""neat"" to see, they could have cut the Arizona scenes at Pearl Harbor, all of the Doolittle scenes and all of the Nautilus scenes. Honestly the whole way they lead up to Midway was a mess. They tried to cover too many events and, in doing so, was a master at none of them. In my opinion, they should made the first half an espionage thriller leading up to the battle rather than trying to spoon feed and explain/show the entire first year of the war in the Pacific.<br/><br/>-Animations. While the CGI itself was very good, the animations were not. Many of the aircraft maneuvers made zero actual sense. For example, the Pearl Harbor scenes featured Kate torpedo bombers dropping torpedoes from high altitude and parallel, not perpendicular, to the ships they were targeting. I'll be entirely honest in saying that the aerial combat was better in Pearl Harbor than this. Pearl Harbor gets a lot of hate but one thing it did well was blending real aircraft with CGI and making a rather believable air combat scene. The attack by B-26s annoyed me as well as those should have been B-17s, not B-26s. There were only four B-26s in the attack and they were all low level torpedo bombers.<br/><br/>-Acting. Well only about half of it. Nimitz, Layton, Halsey, the Japanese, and others were well acted. However a majority of the USS Enterprise cast seemed like a sequel to the Newsies with all the fake New York and Jersey accents. A lot of that goes back to the bad writing.<br/><br/>Overall the film was clearly made more to be a action blockbuster than a historical war film. In the former it did well, I'd give it a 9/10 if I were to watch it as a action blockbuster. As a historical war film, it's a 6/10. I'd definitely still recommend seeing it and I'll definitely still buy it but it could have been much better."

"Boristhemoggy","5","2","7","7 February 2020"," Like a lot of over hyped films, this one was over hyped.
","This film had been built up in my mind from trailers, interviews online and by friends who had gone to see it at the cinema.
By the time I got to see it I was expecting too much, but had I been expecting just a great film, I was sorely disappointed.
The first thing was the acting. Dennis Quid is always great and he was here, as was Woody Harrelson who is always flawless. Aaron Eckhart and Patrick Wilson could be said to be very good, although Wilson sometimes appeared not to know what he was doing.
The plot was fabulous. I've read the book and seen 2 films so far about that famous battle and this was probably in the middle of the other two films. Cinematography was sub par considering the budget of over a tenth of a Billion dollars. When you've got CGI your camera angles and views and effects are limited only by your imagination, and clearly the cinematographer/CGI artist had none. It failed to impress and sometimes I think the effects were the point of certain scenes rather than the life and death bravery shown by the actors. (Playing real people)
The home view, showing wives and children was pathetic. I was never once made to feel any empathy at all for the partners left behind and the kids who might soon be fatherless. They got plenty of air time, it just wasn't very well acted or directed.
All in all I think the director did a pretty sloppy job all round and considering the colossal budget he had for this there really was no excuse at all. A great shame such a big film can only scrape 5 from me, and I think I am being generous with 5."
"ultrafox69","1","2","7","4 February 2020"," I didn't believe all the negative reviews. Boy was I wrong.
","From the start this whole movie is set up to make the Americans look like saints and the Japanese like the boogie man.
Reality and history FACTS tell a very different story.
But it gets even worse.
In the beginning there is a scene with a plane landing on a carrier that is so beyond logic that only a person that is braindead would believe it.
And when the Japanese do their attack on Pearl Harbor it is a bloody miracle they didn't kill each-other with the way they are shooting their on-board cannons.
And then all that zoomed-in close-up shots of all the actors.
Why not zoom out a bit and show the scenery a bit more.<br/><br/>
My advise is to view this movie as an example of how a movie can be bad for all te wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Now if you like to see a few good WWII pacific movies go and watch the original Midway from 1976.
And for another really good WWII pacific movie go and watch Tora Tora Tora (1970) as the much better version of Pearl Harbor. (2001)"
"rehrhousehold","5","2","7","25 November 2019"," Military Authenticity in question.
","I've seen the 1976 version and this one and the first thing I noticed was the ""Sloppy"" looking uniforms. I'm a veteran and the uniforms looked terrible. Next concern is one minute the pilots are at sea, the next they're back home in Hawaii. The constant jumping from American Carrier to Japanese carrier to aircraft flying to Midway, Japan, Hawaii leaves one constantly say, eh? What just happened? On the plus side are the special effects with the flying sequences. Aircraft looked very authentic even down to the dive brakes on the dauntless dive bombers. I'm not too sure about the methods that the Japanese used with captured U.S. military personnel. This movie was ok for a matinee showing but I almost wish I would have waited for the dvd release."
"theredsky","4","2","7","18 November 2019"," Midway Review
","This film was slightly better than I thought it was going to be. It's not a good movie but it's not terrible but what do I expect from director Roland Emmerich. It's definitely one of his better films but that isn't saying a lot. This has to be one of the worst scripts of the year. Every single line of dialogue was awful and insufferable. It was obvious that all the film cared about was its visual effects instead of its script and characters. Even though the characters are based on real people, they still feel very bland and boring. I don't know why they put Nick Jonas in this movie other than to just have him in the film. The acting from most of them isn't half bad. They are trying their hardest with the material they are given and do a good job for what the film is going for. Aaron Eckhart for his limited screen time probably gives the best performance of the entire film. Ed Skrein does a pretty terrible American accent though. There were aspects to the presentation of the film I did appreciate. Before I saw the film, I did some research on the Battle of Midway and the film was actually very historically accurate. The dive bombers did miss a lot of shots and maybe only one or two would manage to land a hit on the Japanese carriers. While some may call that cheesy within the film, it was historically accurate. I also like how the film didn't demonize the Japanese unlike a certain 2001 film (Pearl Harbor). It shows them as human too and that they were doing what they had to do to protect themselves and to follow orders. The action scenes weren't half bad but mostly forgettable although some scenes did look really cool. The visual effects weren't that bad either. They were pretty meh in the beginning but they got better as the film went along. Another thing I will give the film credit for was that it was for the most part entertaining. I didn't ever feel bored even with the 2 and a half hour runtime but that might be an issue for some. The music sounded like stock war film music and there was a large amount of war film cliches thrown into the film which were very obnoxious. Some scenes are loud enough where some actors have to overdub their voices but it wasn't properly synced up at some points which took me out of the film a little. Overall, Midway may be entertaining and very historically accurate but it falls victim to an awful script, bland characters, and too many typical war film cliches."
"drjgardner","3","2","7","15 November 2019"," cgi vs character
","Here is another example of the emphasis on cgi over character development. The cgi effects in this film are great. You really get the feeling of being a dive bomber pilot. It would make a great video game. But not a movie. The character development is really sparse. What's even worse, some of the major issues surrounding the battle are neglected. The change in the Navy from ships to planes was a major struggle at the time. It's never mentioned. Torpedo planes were a new technology and very controversial. Barely a mention. The discord in Washington between the European and the Pacific emphasis is never mentioned, nor even alluded to. The discord within the Japanese is the only thread given attention."
"ashketchum-57468","4","2","7","14 November 2019"," Worst War Film
","I went to see the film in the cinema in metrocentre and I found it lacking as many scenes have been rushed. As a history buff the Film lacked quality but the Film did gave historical account of the battle for Midway"
"ijnfleetadmiral","4","2","7","8 November 2019"," Good, But Could've Been a LOT Better
","We start off with a scene of Edwin Layton at a party in Japan before returning to the United States from an assignment overseas. ADM Yamamoto chats with him in a room filled with large, framed photographs of various IJN vessels (many of which we've all seen before). This is the only time a Japanese person speaks English in the film; all the rest of the Japanese scenes are in Japanese. ADM Yamamoto is - at the time this scene occurs - serving as Navy Minister. He is wearing full ADM's insignia, which is inaccurate; he was not promoted ADM until 15 November 1940, over a full year after assuming command of the Combined Fleet. This minor point is indicative of how the IJN is going to be passed off in this film.<br/><br/>As to the Japanese ships themselves, from what little they are shown - the USN is the main focus - don't look too bad at a glance. Akagi and Hiryu have their islands on the correct side (at least that much was accurate), though the bridge sets for the Japanese carriers could've been done a little better. The character of Genda Minoru is wearing Captain's insignia; again, incorrect; he was a CDR at Midway and was not promoted CAPT until 1 May 1944. He also appears to have taken over the role of Nagumo's Chief-of-Staff, as RADM Kusaka Ryunosuke (the actual Chief-of-Staff of 1st Air Fleet) was apparently eliminated from the film entirely.<br/><br/>Yamato is shown in the film three times, but I was unable to tell if she is accurately portrayed (correct gun placements). Nagara is seen a couple times briefly during the air attacks; she doesn't look too bad at a glance. A Tone-class CA is also seen briefly in the same scene. There is a Kongo-class BB that the main character (LT Dick Best) flies over, though she appears to be portraying an early 1930s version of the ship as the bridge structure is horribly wrong. Tone #4 sights the Americans, and the vessel shown is a Colorado-class BB steaming along accompanied by what appear to be some DDs. I visibly cringed, as there were no American battleships present at the Battle of Midway.<br/><br/>Another main character is Bruno Gaido. His capture and execution as a POW is portrayed, but it is done inaccurately. According to numerous sources, Gaido was tied to some fuel cans and dropped overboard. In the film, he is tied to a spare ANCHOR and dropped overboard. Where a DD got a spare anchor I have no idea; also, one would think fuel cans would be an easier prop to use than an anchor, but what do I know? Again, the insignia is wrong; the officer portrayed as Makigumo's CO (CDR Fujita Isamu) is wearing Captain's insignia; he never wore that rank while he was alive (posthumous promotion after being KIA as Senior Staff Officer of Cruiser Division 14 aboard Naka on 3 November 1943).<br/><br/>The submarine Nautilus is shown attacking the Japanese fleet, though she is depicted as firing a torpedo at Akagi, which hits, but is a dud. In reality, she didn't attack a Japanese carrier until AFTER the fatal attack occurred, and the ship she attacked was Kaga, not Akagi.<br/><br/>The sinking of the Japanese carriers is done well; Emmerich excels at explosions and his destruction of Kaga (pretty much the explosion of the White House in ID4, only put a carrier in place of the White House and no alien ship firing a laser beam at it and you've got it) is perfect proof of that statement. As in the 1976 film, the sinking of the heavy cruiser Mikuma on 6 June 1942 is eliminated entirely. Yamaguchi's final moments aboard Hiryu are depicted correctly for the most part; the only inaccuracy is that it is apparently his Adjutant - a LTJG - who asks to stay with him and not his Senior Staff Officer CDR Ito Seiroku. Also, Yamaguchi does not hand over his cap as a souvenir like he did in real life. While Hiryu is shown being torpedoed, she - like the other Japanese carriers - are not shown sinking on screen.<br/><br/>One plus this film does have over Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor is that there is NO love story focus. The film does show interaction between one of the main characters (LT Dick Best) and his wife, but it is by no means a focal point of the story.<br/><br/>In closing, if you're a fan of war movies, exciting aerial action, or explosions, watch it repeatedly...you'll love it. If you're a history buff, definitely see it once. If you're an IJN fan, see it once, but that's about all you need. The 1976 film - while more inaccurate, shows more of the Japanese side than this film does. Stick with that.<br/><br/>My grade for Midway: A low 'B' or a high 'B-'. It's definitely worth seeing once, but I won't be paying to see it again in theaters, nor will I be buying it for my DVD collection. I might change my mind once it hits Walmart's $5 bin, but for right now, no."

Several other things were problematic, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>More soap opera scenes than I expected from other reviews.

","Ronald Emmerich is such an uneven filmmaker - he can make a masterpiece like The Day After Tomorrow, and at the same time he can fail abysmally in such flops like 2012. Here, in Midway, he is at his very best - powerful script, awesome casting, magnificent battle scenes, excellent dialog, tremendous message. The plot shines all through the movie with its sparkling beauty. The horror of war is depicted especially well, and all those huge aerial fights are so quick, so cruel, so mighty that they leave you breathless.
The correct pacing, correct depiction of both Japanese and Americans, correct delivery are knitted seamlessly here.
Very beginning, with the Pearl Harbor battle, one can feel deeply satisfied to relive the all too familiar scene from Michael Bay movie, albeit better shown and better handled.

","Review:
With all of the Hollywood buzz around 1917, I was surprised that this movie seemed to come and go out of people's minds so quickly after it's release, and now that I have seen the film, I can understand why. After the first 30mins, I totally got fed up with the movie because it turned out to be your typical American heroic film, about guts and glory, which we have seen time and time again. There really wasn't anything original about the film, and the character-building was awful. It's basically a part of American history, which happened after the terrible Pearl Harbour fiasco during World War II. From an entertainment point of view, it does become slightly repetitive, and corny in parts, and the script wasn't that great. Visually, it isn't that bad, and the epic battle scenes sound great, if you have a heavy sound system, but I struggled to keep my eyes open after a while. The performances were mediocre from the whole cast, mainly because it switches between various characters from scene to scene, so it certainly lacked depth. As this is based on a true story, and the characters are actually based on real people, I was intrigued about how the intelligence agency and battle scenes would pan out, but it just turned out to fit every other American war-movie template. On the plus side, I have to commend the director for the attention to detail, and the scale of the whole project, and it was good to feel the intensity from both sides. At the end of the day, it's just worth a one-watch, and I can't see myself going back to it at a later date. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Roland Emmerich, who also brought you, Joey, in 1985, Hollywood Monster, Moon 44, Universal Soldier, Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla, The Patriot, The Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC, 2012, Anonymous, White House Down, Stonewall and Independence Day: Resurgence, which was awful. Although I wasn't a fan of the film, Emmerich struggled to get funding for the project, so he had to raise the $100million budget himself, which makes it one of the most expensive independent films of all time. That proves how passionate he was about the project, and he was happy that it made a profit, even though it wasn't any way near the profits that the major players in Hollywood make. It also explains why it didn't have a massive distribution budget, and why it wasn't released in many theatres. With that in mind, it's a great achievement by the director, and he was lucky to get a decent cast on board.<br/><br/>Budget: $100million
Worldwide Gross: $126million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Drama, History, War
Cast: Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Luke Kleintank, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Keenan Johnson, Nick Jonas, Etsushi Tokokawa, Jake Weber, Darren Criss and Jake Manley. 4/10"

I've said before I'm not a fan of War films but top quality productions like Dunkirk , 1917, and the great Australian movie Danger Close : The Battle of Long Tan I really enjoyed and they're easy to praise for their great script and production values but Midway is nowhere near the standard of those films.<br/><br/>In my opinion ""Midway "" a modern remake of the 1976 film starring Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda ,James Coburn and Glenn Ford has probably superior special effects but I didn't engage with this retelling at all probably because I knew the outcome but more because the script was so poor. As an example the wife of Dick Best played by Ed Skrein when told her man is possibly shot down in battle says emotionally that she has to powder her nose some more"" and the same Ed Skrein ( I'm sure he was channeling the late John WAYNE) when rallying his men says something along the lines of ""the wagons are circling and we'll shoot em down one by one "" There's something so predictable about scripts in
most not all American War movies.
The Hollywood Studios wouldn't touch Midway
* Roland Emmerich Director of Independence Day, 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow couldn't interest Hollywood studios in the US$100 million on for the project .Director Roland Emmerich would even take trips to Beijing to meet with potential Chinese financiers. In the end, the production received close to US$24 million from Chinese investors including Starlight Group, which funds Emmerich's company Centropolis .
It will be interesting to see if the Chinese investors get their investment returned?
So far the estimated budget for Midway was USD 100,000,000 so far Worldwide it's made a total of $123.3 million so it's possibly a modest box office success but certainly not a critical success.<br/><br/>For those who like American War Films or that genre in general the visual effects are outstanding but the script and some of the performances are "" B""grade in my estimation. I don't enjoy electronic War games and felt I'd been playing one for 2 hours as it's mainly battle scenes throughout and while it's a fitting tribute to the brave men who fought in this horrific battle and those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbour it's all been done before and adds no new perspective but that's just my opinion."

","Midway is a good historical retelling of events and engages with excellent visuals, but the characters fail to connect and evoke.<br/><br/>The characterization's mostly one note thin and the acting mostly ranges from so so to half-hearted, amidst the impressive action sequences. It's missing that fire or inspirational speech."

","Yes, mostly accurate but such a great film that shows the heroism and sacrifice of everyone on all sides of a brutal war. The cast is an excellent ensemble group. I give a lot of credit to Roland Emmerich for bringing this film to life. It is tough to remake a classic film with such emotion."

","Wasn't expecting much but it's alot better than the reviews are saying. Best air battles I've seen for a ww2 movie, the cgi is pretty smooth and it's 100x better than pearl harbour. Reminds me of the old ww2 flying games on xbox and play station. Better than' Dunkirk' as well."

I swear, movie studios should be forbidden to make 'recreations' of actual historical events.<br/><br/>Here's an outstanding recommendation for you: watch a documentary on the battle of Midway. Even better, read a good book on the subject. Read a book - what a concept. Remember: the person who does not read is just as worse off as the person who *cannot* read,"

Watch the HBO series Pacific instead !"

","Wow, what great special effects...kind of..
Lots of good scenes, props, effects, script is more or less alright,
Love the attention to historical detail
What ruins this for me are the actors who are mostly acting or overreacting super below average. someone you'd see on tv or who never made it to tv.
And the editing work is weak, you'll spot it right away..
anyways, I know its Midway, I'm supposed to be patriotic, but this crap just doesnt cut it. Re-watch Pearl Harbor instead."

But on the other hand, it is just too confusing and not straight enough (without knowlegde) and is way to fast in changing scenes and battles, to be a really good blockbuster.<br/><br/>So it´s neither of both."
"goodtime-336-74081","6","1","3","24 January 2020"," Well that was a major disappointment!
","After all the hype I was expecting more, much more from this movie. All round poor acting but none more so than from Ed Skein. I found his constant selfie-like pouting fish face expression very annoying, his ""American"" accent appallimg and his acting in general barely average. Woody Harrelson was not up to scratch playing the Admiral and unconvincing in the role. The direction was iffy, the storyline tried to pack way too much into the movie and the CGI was over-done. I found Midway to be a major disappointment."

","Bunch of good actors couldn't save this movie from poor casting. sad thing that they could have done much better if the actors were on right roles. still it is worth watching it to remember the war and herors... and be aware of Japan worshiping the old time war criminals (look for Yasukuni shrine)"
"Darwinskid","Null","1","3","26 December 2019"," Pretty Hollywood, but solid enough.
","Not a 10/10 flick, but despite the flaws in the cohesion of the occasionally highly stylized dialog of the screenplay it manages to find an okay balance between newer and older war cinema. The acting is pretty good, not a weak link in the cast was felt by me personally. The effects(while pretty cartoon-ish in parts) don't distract from the mission statement of any battle sequence, and the build-up to each action set piece is adequate.<br/><br/>It won't go down in history among the best of war cinema, but its worth a watch."
"centaur-71725","4","1","3","12 December 2019"," Dissapointed
","I was looking forward to the movie for a long time, but did not enjoy it as much as I was hoping.<br/><br/>While it was historically fairly accurate - could not believe they actually showed one of the causes of the War was cutting promised fuel to Japan, and while there were some very good scenes, the movie was uninspiring.<br/><br/>I think that the movie tried to cover too much and ended up being more general than personal. I did not connect to any individual character, which was disappointing.<br/><br/>I like connecting with at least one character and actually caring about what happens to them, did not happen."
"awdboosted95","3","1","3","10 December 2019"," VERY poor writing and poorly directed, NO tension - a HUGE disappointment
","Being a war movie fan and seeing the preview to this movie I was very excited to watch it, but was extremely let down once I did. I knew it was a bomb within about the first 3 minutes sadly, I really feel like I watched a different movie than most of the other reviewers here.<br/><br/>So the main problem is definitely the writing IMO. I see some saying it is historically accurate, and they covered a lot of ground. I am not an expert on history, but I have a feeling they are right about this, and the problem is likely they tried to cover TOO MUCH of the war, which actually leads into problem number 2 below. The trouble here was poorly written dialogue, and a story that jumps all over the place so much that no tension builds and you have no chance to get invested into anything, including the characters (so add poor character development to the list of failures here).<br/><br/>The Directing is the main other issue, you constantly jump from scene to scene, again so rapidly that you really have no chance to be invested in anything, and no tension builds. I remember one part of the movie in particular, it was right in the midst of a good war scene, then seconds later we were in someone's kitchen I mean WTF? Let the scenes and story develop some for Pete's sake before jumping to the next bit! Somewhere around 40 mins left, we finally got about 15 mins in a row without jumping around, it stayed focused on what was happening in that part of the war, and it was the best 15 mins of the movie, but no where near enough to save it.<br/><br/>I see many in negative reviews mentioning overuse of CGI, I really didn't find it to be much of an issue at all, and even if it was, it would still be the least of its issues<br/><br/>Of course comparisons to ""Pearl Harbor"" are inevitable, IMO that is just a much more enjoyable version of this movie overall, while not perfect it doesn't have the same HUGE glaring issues this one does."
"petermariani342","6","1","3","8 December 2019"," Did we all watch the same movie?
","There was a lot of stuff in this movie that was great. The special effects were up to standard with what we've become accustomed to in 2019. And I agree with the general consensus that it is historically accurate, atleast to my knowledge. However it seemed like they tried to squeeze in too much leading up to the battle. None of the acting is terribly bad, but none of it is terribly good either. Ed Skrein's accent asked as Dick Best is over the top at some points and can be slightly distracting. The writing is not believable in the slightest and feels very ""Hollywood."" Overall I was entertained by this movie but I wouldn't give it a second watch."
"GalaxyJoe","6","1","3","17 November 2019"," Too much, but not enough.
","The film's title was Midway. Too much time was spent on the attack of Pearl Harbor, the battle of the Coral Sea and Doolittle's Raiders. It did not leave enough time exploring the battle of Midway.<br/><br/>Much of the drama of Midway was replaced by CGI. Which was wonderful to look at, but so much was missing. This should have been so much better.<br/><br/>Mildly worth watching if you don't get too hung up on what's not in the movie and just enjoy what is."
"micglou","7","1","3","17 November 2019"," Visually stunning, solid cast, but...
","Seen in theater yesterday, I was entertained. Visually this movie is stunning, great effects, excellent CGI. Not a moment explosions or situations seemed uncanny. Cast is very solid with Patrick Wilson and Ed Skrein in the most important roles doing a very solid job. Story also solid to a certain point, but nothing special.<br/><br/>BUT! This movie has a very high grade of propaganda playing of the US navy and army as nothing but almost angelic heroes and Japan being the devil. But my biggest complaint is when the movie ends en they do a recap about what happened after this battle... the atrocious way the US ended this war with Japan isn't even a footnote, it's all about hallelujah-ing the US soldiers and how they eventually killed a couple of Japanese big wigs that were involved in this war later in the war... really shame on the producers to make it seem like it never happened."
"chandaravuth","8","1","3","16 November 2019"," Good one, but CGI is suck!

"kmoore17110","9","1","3","13 November 2019"," If this movie spurs people into reading the history, it's done it's job
","Historical films are always difficult to pull off, because history doesn't always fit into a nice Hollywood mold. This is a time period I've always been fascinated by, and Midway is a battle I've read extensively about over the years. This is a moment when the world as we know it would look very different if this battle had another outcome. So for me, it was important that the story be told accurately, as it is a pivotal point in the Second World War.<br/><br/>Did they do that? Yes. The characters they show -- Best, McCluskey, Nimitz, Halsey, Doolittle, Yamamoto, Nagumo, Yamaguchi, Layton, Rocheford, et al, are all real. Unlike other Hollywood historical films (like Pearl Harbor), they didn't mung it up with fake characters and story in order to give some star screen time.<br/><br/>Is the story accurate? Fundamentally yes. While there was some very minor conflation of supporting events, mostly for time, everything that unfolded is true, and I don't think there is anything shown that flat out did not happen (again like in Pearl Harbor).<br/><br/>I thought the CGI work overall was excellent. It added to the story in the right way, and it was amazing to see them bring the Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown back to life. It was incredible to see those classic Dauntless's, Devastators, Mitchells, Zeros, Kates, and Marauders in the air again.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie. See it for the history, the story, and for the appreciation of the Greatest Generation. One thing that is undeniable, is that these guys had balls the size of coconuts."
"maudibjr","6","1","3","13 November 2019"," Decent historically but a lot of cheese
","The movie is pretty decent from an historical perspective and the battle scenes are well done. There is a refreshing lack of romantic subplot as well as the emphesis that intelligence played.
The CGI comes and goes, and is distractingly terrible in some spots. The acting is generally not great and clunky and lead actor's contrived accent is downright grating. Woody harrloson is the bright spot.
The movie also touches on the Doolittle raid, which is only tangentaly related to the battle, mostly the aftermath , the scenes in China seem to be added purely for the Chinese financial backing."

"marketingninja-amazon","9","1","3","11 November 2019"," Terrific Movie!!! The Critical Reviews Aren't Warranted.
","I've been reading about the Battle of Midway for nearly 50 years and thoroughly enjoyed the movie Midway (2019). I honestly can't think of how to make a better Battle of Midway movie with a running time under 2.5 hours. Any film on the engagement needs to address Pearl Harbor, Doolittle's Raid, and the code breakers to put the battle in context. That's a broad time frame with many participants and locations, which makes this subject difficult to cover in the constraints of a movie. Following the Enterprise Air Group was an adept choice by the writer, Wes Tooke. My congratulations to Director Roland Emmerich and his team. Midway (2019) honored the men on both sides and treated them with the respect they deserve. I've seen most war movies and Midway (2019) is in my top 10.<br/><br/>Considering it's Not a Documentary, it is Remarkably Accurate
My favorite comment about historical accuracy is from retired Rear Adm. Sam Cox, the director of the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC). ""I'm glad they did a movie about real heroes and not comic book heroes. Despite some of the 'Hollywood' aspects, this is still the most realistic movie about naval combat ever made and does real credit to the courage and sacrifice of those who fought in the battle on both sides."" Personally, the story of how VS-6 pilot Willie West died about two weeks before the battle was another detail in the fabric of the engagement that was new to me.<br/><br/>The Critical Reviews Mention the Over-the-Top CGI
The over-the-top CGI is often compared to Star Wars and I understand. The Zeros strafing Pearl Harbor remind me of the alien air attack on Area 51 in Independence Day. And, Lt. Best's attack on the Hiryu harkens to Lando Calrissian's ""YEE-HAA!"" while flying out of the exploding Death Star in Return of the Jedi. I hope someone figures out how to display proper WWII flight and crash dynamics with CGI during my lifetime. In the meantime, I'll suspend disbelief and enjoy the current state of the art. It's far better than the patchwork live-action in Midway (1976). On the flip side, the trailers made it clear that this would be the visual look of the movie. If you can't handle the 'gamified' CGI, you should skip Midway (2019).<br/><br/>The Critical Reviews also Mention the Lack of Exposition/Cheesy Dialogue
The lack of exposition is likened to hard-charging characters in a Sgt Rock comic or a Clive Cussler novel. As an aside, I'm not a fan of either. But to see period examples of this type of square-jawed dialogue, simply read the letters and diaries of the men who fought at Midway. This style of discourse was typical. And anyone who has served in the military has both stood beside and reported to wanna-be Sgt Rock's. I graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1982, and at the time, 'rock' was a positive nickname for a person with an exemplary military bearing. They exist in peacetime; they exist in wartime. It's just part of human nature. And the movie does a yeoman job of showing the transition of Ed Skrein as Lt Dick Best from a 'rock' to a responsible leader shouldering the bond of other men's lives.<br/><br/>Does the Movie Need a ""Heel""?
To counter this one-dimensional aspect of men at war, Midway (2019) could have added a 'heel' on the American side. Someone akin to the character of Capt Herbert Sobol or 1st Lt Norman Dike from Band of Brothers. And real-life 'heels' existed at the Battle of Midway. Two obvious candidates are Stanhope Ring and Marc Mitscher with their infamous 'Flight to Nowhere'. However, weaving in the Hornet Air Group story arc would have extended the running time by at least 40 minutes and further muddied the existing story arcs.<br/><br/>For Your Grandfather or Someone Aligned with the Aviators of Midway
The unenthusiastic critics struggle with a conflict of values. On the one hand, they point to the men portrayed in the movie as members of 'The Greatest Generation.' Yet they have a tough time perceiving their words and actions as authentic. The critics can't believe this full measure of devotion has a place in today's more complex world where the dividing line between good and evil is blurred. But it's these critics' belief in moral relativism and situational ethics that create their skewed view. One critic noted that this was a movie to see with your grandfather. I'd broaden that audience to anyone who has values aligned with the Midway men who stopped an existential threat to freedom and liberty. This movie shows that 'Freedom isn't free.' A return to those values would enable a subsequent generation to address today's existential threats and become just as great.<br/><br/>My View
I hope this movie succeeds and encourages someone else like Spielberg and Hanks to produce a mini-series for the Battle of Midway. There are at least a dozen Americans who weren't mentioned in Midway (2019) but are candidates to be interpreted in a miniseries on the battle."
"vato7959","9","1","3","10 November 2019"," Great visual movie Very disrespectful to Navy to cast Woody as Chester Nimitz
","The movie is a must to see in the theater. What a wild ride to be Dick Best's wing man.<br/><br/>The Pearl Harbor scenes are one for the ages. One word review on this movies visual effects. WOW<br/><br/>It is a very modern adaptation of the story but a warning to the casting director or producer of this movie. Don't ever go into a bar in San Diego and announce you cast this movie.<br/><br/>I know the target audience has no sense of history but they should not have cast a bunch of Hollywood misfits as great American heroes.<br/><br/>Chester Nimitz is on the Mount Rushmore of great American military leaders.<br/><br/>George Washington, William Sherman, Dwight Eisenhower and Chester Nimitz.<br/><br/>Here is a great idea, cast Johnny Depp or James Franco in a biography of John Wayne. The young audience won't know the difference."
"DOGSLEDDER54","6","1","3","10 November 2019"," Good but not as Good as the original
","Good overall retelling of the battle of Midway, with a few reservations. Woody Harrelson doesn't seem forceful enough as Chester Nimitz, and the character of Dick Best is hampered by either a speech impediment or is speaking some strange dialect. The movie includes all of the details in the background story and events leading up to the battle, and includes some great action scenes, but fails to have the zing of the original. Overall a good effort but the story is seen through a slightly duller lens and leaves me wondering why the original needed to be remade."

"oldchummer","4","1","4","13 March 2020"," Messy and somewhat distasteful
","You literally could've made 3-4 movies out of the plot (which feels disjointed and way too condensed). They cover Pearl Harbor, The Doolittle Raids, and lastly the Midway battle, all of which could easily be movies on their own, but are treated more as historical footnotes instead of being given the attention and care those events need. Not to mention it's not wholly necessary to focus too much on the Japanese military, which they also don't develop much, as it really drags down the overall pacing and would've benefitted from mainly focusing on one side's perspective. The acting lacks passion and comes across very bland, which is insulting, as these were all real American heroes whom all deserve better. The cgi is very lame and distracting, the pacing was horrid, and worst of all the script was very lacking. This felt more like a made for TV movie than an actual professionally made wide theatrically released movie. Worst of all it tried to paint some of the horrific things the Japanese military did as more matter of fact/honorable as opposed to being legitimately evil acts they carried out (such as slaughtering thousands of Americans and Chinese). This movie was incredibly distasteful."

","Theres too much unnecessary cringey scene. Especially nick jonas and his scene. His character and acting is rubbish."
"kenstallings-65346","10","1","4","8 February 2020"," Got the essential details correct
","This movie is outstanding, and is a very accurate depiction of the actual events of this period of the war. Even actions that some might term over the top, such as the heroic feat of Bruno Gaido, were portrayed spot on accurate, to include the precise orientation of the Douglas SBD Dauntless that he used to fire on the enemy bomber that was attempting to crash into the Enterprise. The field promotion by Admiral William Halsey is likewise totally true.<br/><br/>The movie breaks new ground by telling personal stories of the pilots and gunners who actually performed the selfless aerial attacks, something that the 1970's era movie inadequately did. Though, by focusing on the interaction of just one bomber squadron, the movie did omit reference to Norman ""Dusty"" Kleiss, who made the critical hit that sank the Kaga.<br/><br/>The other pilot with multiple hits on a carrier, carried out at Coral Sea and then at Midway against the Kaga, was Clarence Dickinson. He was portrayed quite accurately in the movie, complete with his North Carolina accent. The personal interactions between Dickinson and Dick Best are portrayed very well, showing the small, and tightly knit community of Naval pilots in the early months of the war.<br/><br/>Still, Dick Best was an excellent choice to be the main character focus in this film, and as outlandish as the actions portrayed may appear, they are very much in keeping with the actual history of the battle, and the extraordinary airmanship skills of Best. Best was the only pilot in Naval history to record two critical hits on an aircraft carrier on the same day -- a feat that will likely never be equaled. Best sank both the Akagi and then the Hiryu, just as portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>Beyond the intensely personal portrayals, this movie was able to effectively leverage the best of modern computer graphics, to portray a very up close glimpse of the incredible danger of flying the torpedo and dive bombing attacks on naval ships.<br/><br/>The realism of having to dive to extremely low altitude to score hits is likewise accurately portrayed. Without the special effects available today, it is doubtful that the details of these attacks could have been faithfully replicated, but in this movie, they were.<br/><br/>The intelligence back story, so critical to the success of the Midway mission, and the fateful decisions, are all packaged quite well. This is the definitive movie to understand the Battle of Midway, and it is hard to see another movie equaling it."

The CGI looks so fake and often It used to manufacture very unrealistic action/war sequences. As of matter of fact, the writing isn't just subpar, it's terrible. Cringeworthy.<br/><br/>That said I didnt turn it off. Its about as average to slightly below average of a blockbuster-type action flick as you're likely to find, but Im still a sucker for lots of action, explosions, heroism, and usually one to push-aside exact historical or visual accuracy.<br/><br/>All the characters are under-developed. There's too many. The wives are completely ignored, though shown and introduced(why bother if your gonna drop them all like a bomb). So go ahead and make your list of the 10 people that will live and 10ppl that will die, and it will probably be accurate. There's nothing new about this, or old. Nothing stands out. It might be better than Pearl Harbor actually, though inferior aesthetically. I'd pass unless you are just bored And an action junkie- I was."

","Through much of this, my title was going to be Now THAT'S a War Movie, but they stumbled at the end and lost a couple of rating stars in the process. This movie is almost the direct opposite of Midway (1976), an embarrassing soap opera which nonetheless eventually gets around to telling a slam bang story of the battle. In contrast, the lead up to the Midway showdown here was done handsomely and efficiently through a few characters. Unfortunately, once they got there the narrative got rather tangled and the CGI, to that point comfortably restrained, became comically, unbelievably overdone.
So I was very excited going into the final stretch and then pretty much disappointed. On the casting side Skrein was the rather animated and odd looking but an eventually effective star as ace Enterprise pilot. Evans was okay as the tense McClusky, although without much depth. Moore is always good and fit well as Skrein's wife, and Toyokawa as Yamamoto was exceptional. Harrelson as Nimitz was just poor casting but Quaid as Halsey was almost believable. Eckhardt as Doolittle was a better fit if a good half foot taller than his character.
So I would say very well done in many aspects. partly spoiled by overdoing the key moments in the climactic battle."

","Subtle filmmaking is not something you expect from the man behind Godzilla, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow and in the spirit of keeping true to form, director Roland Emmerich ensures Midway is best when its spectacle is taking centre stage as it attempts to shine a spotlight on the famed WW2 battle.<br/><br/>Already the subject of many a feature film and documentary, the battle that shaped the outcome of the great war is loaded with plotlines, battles within battles and more real life hero's than an Avengers film and Emmerich at times struggles with the nuances that are required when you're telling such a convoluted and incendiary tale but with his heart in the right place and with a constantly moving pace, Midway is a perfectly watchable effort that may not hold up to scrutiny but provides great entertainment value as it's occurring before our eyes.<br/><br/>Filled with one of the most recognisable low A to B-grade group of actors that one could hope to assemble in today's climate, with the rent a bad boy Ed Skrein leading the charge around the likes of Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Luke Evans and the should've stayed at home token female Mandy Moore, Midway does feel like one of those awkwardly budgeted Hollywood event films that co-collaboration with Chinese film investors has seen it gather up $70-$80 million of funds to produce some slightly above game-like graphics in its set pieces but thanks to the true story as its foundation, it's hard to ever hate or be disinterested in proceedings even if Wes Tooke's cheese laden script work attempts to derail things whenever the aerial battles are not front and centre.<br/><br/>Lucky for the film, Emmerich's action flair often gets Midway up and about as we follow Skrein and his fellow pilots across a selection of daring battles in the Pacific and while we don't often care too much for the cardboard cut-out characters that Tooke and Emmerich have brought to life, we understand the heroism and daring of these men that risked their lives in often horribly outnumbered underdog battles.<br/><br/>As a piece of big screen spectacle, the sky-bound action and thrilling sea battles that form a large portion of Midway's runtime make sure that you feel as though you're getting your monies worth with the simplistic storytelling and more old-fashioned approach to the story by Emmerich likely to please those that found the likes of Dunkirk and 1917 to technically focused to be fist-pumping inspiring.<br/><br/>It's a shame however that Midway didn't attempt to fine tune its quieter moments to build more emotional investment in its array of participants and figures as had it refined it storytelling and approached its material in a more considered manner, it's likely this watchable but forgettable examination of history defining moments would've been the hit it so easily could've been.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A typical Emmerich like affair, Midway is sure to please those seeking a surface deep look at the renowned WW2 battle that includes some thrilling action moments but Midway's lack strong emotion or character building holds back its chances of being something genuinely special.<br/><br/>3 heroic deck-hands out of 5"

I was hoping in this day and age this movie was about to put the record straight about the reasons Japan went to war with the US, it started to touch on these aspects right at the beginning then unforgivably threw it all away to rush straight to the action. The war started way before Pearl Harbour and too many times the uneducated cite this as the only reason the US took action on Japan, like that nation had just woke up one day and said, 'hey, let's go bomb Pearl Harbour, it looks like a fun thing to do'. :-(
Actors were great as you would expect being the veterans they are but some cringeworthy dialogue does creep in here and there, the victors do write history after all. Why they needed to cover the Dolittle raid is beyond me, that was done excellently in another movie with great detail, it was almost a 'let's list all the great things we did in the war', conquests abound, I can imagine Trump giving his seal of approval as this being one of those times he speaks of when 'America was great'. For some it seems, maybe not the boot polisher down in Mississippi ;-)

","I saw the trailer for this war movie a few times, I knew from the cast and it being directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, White House Down) that I wasn't going to miss it at the cinema. Basically, a few years before the start of World War II, at a state function on Tokyo, the US and Japanese positions in the Pacific Ocean are discussed. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) quietly informs intelligence officer Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson) that they will take action if their oil supplies are threatened. On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese strike at Pearl Harbor. The attack leads the US to enter World War II. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) assumes command of the badly damaged US Pacific Fleet following a shake-up. Layton speaks with Nimitz over his failure to convince Washington of the impending attack on Pearl Harbor. Nimitz tells him to stick to his guns in the next battle with Washington so a repeat surprise attack can be avoided. In April 1942, following the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese turn their attention to the Coral Sea. Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown, from the Orange Wednesday adverts) and his cryptology team have been intercepting messages concerning the Japanese and their next planned attacks. Layton disagrees with Nimitz, who believes the next target to be in the Aleutians, believing the intended target to be Midway Atoll. After meeting with Rochefort, Nimitz instructs the team to find a way to definitively prove that the next target is Midway. Cryptologists working for Rochefort intercept Japanese communications concerning water shortages and thus confirm that it is Midway next. In preparation for an ambush of the Japanese fleet, Nimitz has carriers Hornet and Enterprise recalled from the Coral Sea and demands that the damaged Yorktown be made ready for combat operations within 72 hours. On June 4, the Japanese launch an air attack against Midway. Initial attempted aircraft strikes fail, and no carriers are damaged. Nautilus, a US submarine, successfully locates and attacks an enemy carrier but the torpedo misses its target. Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) gorders the Arashi to keep the submarine pinned down so that the carriers can escape. Meanwhile, US carrier planes are launched to destroy the Japanese carriers, but it is discovered they have moved from their last known location. Upon spotting the Arashi, the Commander of the Air Group (CAG) of the Enterprise, C. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans) has his planes follow the course of the Japanese destroyer, which is rushing back to the main Japanese fleet. Meanwhile, Admiral Nagumo learns of the presence of the US fleet and orders his men to rearm his planes for the anti-ship attack. US carrier-based planes abruptly appear, and Japanese planes combined with evasive manoeuvres initially keeps the carriers safe. However, Enterprise squadron commanders C. Wade McClusky and Richard 'Dick' Halsey Best (Ed Skrein) successfully lead their planes through the anti-aircraft fire and destroy the Japanese carriers Kaga and Akagi, and squadrons from the Yorktown destroy the Soryu. Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano), commanding the Hiryu, attempts to salvage the battle by rallying the remaining Japanese aircraft for an assault against the US carriers. The Japanese locate the Yorktown, bombing and disabling the carrier. Returning to the Enterprise, Best is told that about half of his squadron is either missing or destroyed. Informed that there is a surviving Japanese carrier, Best rallies what pilots he can and sets off to attack the Hiryu. The Japanese fail to stop the attack, and Best scores a critical hit that destroys the Hiryu. Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber), informed of the destruction of the last Japanese carrier, decides to withdraw rather than press his luck. Informed of the loss of his carriers in battle, Admiral Yamamoto orders his fleet to withdraw from the battle, thus bringing the Battle of Midway to a close. In Pearl Harbor, Rochefort intercepts the Japanese order to withdraw and tells Layton, who then informs Nimitz and his staff of Yamamoto's decision to withdraw. Following the US victory in the Battle of Midway, the final text reveals the fates of various participants, as well as Japanese reprisals after the battle. Also starring Mandy Moore as Ann Best, Dennis Quaid as William 'Bull' Halsey, Aaron Eckhart as Jimmy Doolittle, Nick Jonas as Bruno Gaido, Alexander Ludwig as Roy Pearce, Luke Kleintank as Clarence Dickinson, Darren Criss as Eugene Lindsey and Geoffrey Blake as John Ford. Wilson is very good as a naval intelligence officer, Harrelson chews the scenery well, and there are good performances from Skrein, Evans and Quaid. As you would expect from the director, the film is loaded with special effects as planes, ships and submarines blow things up, it covers the Battle of the Coral Sea and obviously the titular Battle of Midway well enough, it is perhaps more style over substance in terms of story, but you cannot deny for spectacle it is an immersive Second World War action drama. Worth watching!"

Although the CGI was excellent and the rawness of battle was felt through the lens of the pilot giving great appreciation for the valor and heroism of those who faced the hellfire of the Japanese navy, there was so much wanting. First the acting was subpar with little to no character development and writing which was all together poor and hollow especially in light of the fine group actors chosen for the roles. I constantly asked why is there so much strife between the CO and the main character? When did Washington fail to listen to the Layton the main intelligence officer when he warned of Japans intent to attack Pearl leading to a sleeping US on Dec. 7th? Not to mention, the heroes who are supposed to inspire instead gave speeches which were full of weakness and about as exciting as a T-ball game. Another weakness was the story line. The continuity of story was poorly edited and was instead a broken mishmash of dog fights and Mandy Moore crying. We are given no background into Dolittle and his Raiders, or the battles at Coral Sea. But my biggest complaint is, in the end the worst of hollywood found its way as Emmerich felt it necessary to be an apologist for the Japanese and in the most insidious way. He chose to portray one of the most evil aggressors in world history as Honorable as the commanders of the Japanese carriers go down with their ships. He blamed the US and Dolittle for the suffering of the Chinese in retribution for the Dolittle raid as Dolittle says ""this is because of us"" somehow feeling blame. I doubt a red blooded American such as Dolittle would feel any remorse and properly blame the true perpetrator of evil and say F the vile Japanese.

But why is Emmerich warming up this material for the cinema right now? Political calculus? Quite conceivable."

They really shone.

","Roland Emmerich recreates the Battle of Midway in this updated war epic. World War 2 enthusiasts will enjoy the dogfights and battle scenes. The big cast do a decent job with their respective roles but few leave a memorable impact.<br/><br/>Perhaps the standout is Ed Skrein who plays real life war hero Dick Best. Skrein plays it like a self assured matinee idol from the 1940s, but at least his character has a personality. Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson round out the cast as the seasoned officers. Harrelson's fake Nimitz hair looks absolutely absurd.<br/><br/>Although the action scenes are reasonably well done, the visual effects don't look as polished as they did in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. Don't worry, this is a better movie than Pearl Harbor but that movie has way better CGI.<br/><br/>The film has modest ambition as a throwback to the ensemble war epics of classical Hollywood with a deliberate patriotic vibe. It mostly succeeds but sometimes feels too safe riding on nostalgia."

","I have to be honest: I started with the very wrong assumption that this movie would be another Pearl Harbor disaster, full of historical inaccuracies and made up stories just to keep us entertained. For months I was stuck with that opinion until I made the jump yesterday night and decided to buy and watch this movie on YouTube where it was on sale.<br/><br/>And I have to admit I was wrong all along. This movie is a gem. Roland Emerich didn't take any liberties with what actually happened that day and the months between the attack on Pearl Harbor and the decisive blow out over Midway. I just wished some other big moments of the Pacific War like the Dolittle Raid on Tokyo and the Coral Sea battle would have been more developed.<br/><br/>The cast general performance is also on point. It's still entertaining without being overplayed unlike Pearl Harbor when everything was made to keep the melodrama going over the need of remaining accurate about the historical facts.<br/><br/>So I definitely recommend to watch this movie. If you're making the same mistake of considering it as another Pearl Harbor, you are really missing up something. 9/10"

","The ability to shoot war scenes is still there, but the consciousness of shooting has been unable to keep up with the progress of technology (the technology has not changed substantially).

","Except of some creative liberties taken on the aerial dogfighting and strafing, I would say this film is pretty faithful.

"kindlydr","10","0","3","24 April 2020"," MIDWAY 2019 GOES ALL THE WAY WITH REALISM, TRUE-TO-LIFE PACIFIC WARTIME DRAMA
","In 1945, I, a 7 year old boy, was astonished seeing a huge photo of the atomic bomb mushroom cloud over Hiroshima printed on the front page of the Chicago Herald. Kids my age were on the streets flying nice models of Navy Wildcat fighters and Japanese Zeros made of paper with coins in their noses. Ever since that time I've wanted to learn what World War II was really like, Pacific and European. Only in the past few years have I discovered how incrediby crucial and miraculous the outcome of the Battle of Midway was. Twenty years in the Navy taught me a lot about ships, planes, guns and bombs, but it never came home to me so completely as it did over the past hour when I rented this film for viewing on our 46 inch TV and watched it, transfixed for over two hours. I've read nearly every article, seen the last (1976) and most unsatisfactory Midway movie, watched every TV documentary, and listened to all the War College expert lectures I could find. Spare me the specious criticisms of other writers about poor scriptwriting. I've seen all the wartime films of blood, gore, mayhem and sudden death. This film's opening scenes of the start of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor were as horrifying and believeable, given over as it was to not only the famous bombings of the moored battleships, but also showed the Japanese fighters machinegunning civilians in the streets, the plane-to-plane bloody, deadly encounters between Japanese fighters and arriving American aircraft, their pilots astonished at the unbelieveable scene in the skies over the sunny Hawaiian waters. Search if you will for paintings by knowledgable and skilled artists of the air-to-surface actions of June 4th thru 6th of 1944, and you have no more than the blink of an eye's view of how it really happened. It is more to be wondered at when one considers that only 2 motion picture photographers took any film footage of the actual aerial attacks and dogfights, and John Ford's footage shot on East Midway Island, although processed into a short film, covered very little of importance. The special effects of all attack scenes were outstandingly rendered by the battalions of historian-artists who made it totally unnecessary to try to fool this film's audience by substituting existing postwar ships for Depression-era-built vessels of the 1941 Navy. Neither did the producers try to make do with tank models of miniaturized Japanese war vessels, or poorly disguise full sized outdated American warcraft. Considerable research of the structures that were shown in the process of being bombed must have been made over a very long period. Much of the violent battle scenery seems to have been designed for viewing in three dimensions, and it seems dozens of large fragments of planes and ships are blown directly at the movie viewer! Casting was excellent, for the famous characters Admiral Chester W Nimitz, and William F. Halsey. My admiration of Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Admiral Nimitz is especially high. He has come far from the shy, self-conscious barkeep at Cheers. A few things were missed which were important, I feel. Nobody showed the incident when the Thatch Weave tactic was used for the first time in combat very successfully to defeat Zeros attempting to shoot down slower, less maneuverable American fighter pilot, and being blown out of the sky by superior American pilots in inferior aircraft. Also, - - not an important point - - I'm not sure the Japanese began attacking around 7:30 in the morning, while crewmen were setting up chairs for Sunday church services. I've always read, and been told, that they began just as buglers began sounding morning colors and National ensigns were rising on the flagstaffs of ships in the harbor. To summarize: I expect that MIDWAY 2019 will win many, many awards for outstanding special effects in years to come, and that this film will be a must-see at the US military academies, and a hot item for World War II veterans, their families and their decendants."

Dick Best is his name, because calling him Best Dick would be too obvious. Anyway, the first attack starts and it's so much green screen that I thought it was Star Wars.

","Sadly, not even the fine ensemble cast which included Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, and Aaron Eckhart could save this bombastic, overblown, overloud film.<br/><br/>While the movie appears to be historically accurate with regard to the main events leading up to and including the Battle of Midway, what spoilt it for me were the usual heroic tropes that Hollywood movies of this type can't resist including. You know the ones: the loud-mouthed, boastful, overconfident jock who inevitably matures over the course of the film to be a real 'stand up guy'; or the man who suffers a failure of nerve, only to rise to the occasion after the obligatory morale-boosting speech. These, and other recurrent themes plague big budget movies of this sort, and come straight out of Hollywood's giant book of cinema clichÃ©s.<br/><br/>Compared to 1917, the excellent World War I film directed by Sam Mendes, Midway will almost certainly be forgotten once it disappears from your local megaplex- only to return year after year on our television screens to mark the date of the actual Battle of Midway.<br/><br/>If you have a real interest in the events covered by this film, I recommend searching online for documentaries about the Battle of Midway, where you will get the facts without the bombastic grandstanding, and overblown heroics"

This movie has an absolute TONNE of CGI, and it's the kind of CGI where you can actually see that it's clearly CGI. I actually laughed at the begining of the movie, where they showed a bunch of CGI guys running on the deck of a ship, and I was like ""Humans don't run like that!"". You could SO CLEARLY see that it's CGI, like why didn't they just get a real ship to run on? According to the wikipedia page, they actually did shoot some scenes on a real battleship, so why was it deemed necessary to show fake CGI guys running on a ship? It is confusing and hilarious at the same time.<br/><br/>Appart from that, Ed Skrein's fake american accent really made my ears bleed through the entire movie... I don't get why he couldn't just talk normally... I'd rather listen to justin beaver music on loop, than listen to another second of Ed Skrein's fake accent in this movie<br/><br/>I liked the fact that they atleast ATTEMPTED to show the battles from the perspective of the Japanese. The scenes are few and far between, but they tried showing a different perspective at least.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie has way too much CGI and not enough of the Japanese's perspective, but it's an OK movie if you want to watch a war-film for 2hours. 6.5/10"

","Not surprisingly, all the 'veterans' have sung this films high praises which means that although some of them are discerning, ultimately they all crave the U.S 'kick ass' formula whether they admit it or not.
The crux of the battle cane down to the Japanese admirals decision to either rearm his carrier fleet or immediately send them out with their bomber loads- a giant gamble given the U.S carrier force finally came out of hiding to try and intercept the Japanese battle group.
Ultimately luck resided with the U.S who were able to inflict crippling damage on the flagship Japanese carrier group immediately giving the U.S the strategic initiative whilst the Japanese would remain unprepared for a major decisive engagement until Leyte Gulf.
Whether this movie reflects that luck, not U.S tactical brilliance was responsible remains to be seen, but as we've seen many times before the U.S military has no problem bending the truth, ethics, or morality If it serves their greater good."

Roland Emmerich once again drags a movie into oblivion. I was surprised to see that this movie was averaging a 6.9 rating, but it has Chinese investors. So most likely the services of a Chinese review farm was hired to give this shockingly bad movie all these ten star reviews."

"kjproulx","5","0","2","12 December 2019"," Exciting Moments in an Otherwise Mixed Bag
","Movies that make me unsure if I really liked it or not don't come around all that often, but Midway will be the film that fits that description for me when looking back on 2019's film offerings. If you've seen movies like 2012 or Independence Day, you should know what to expect from a Roland Emmerich directorial outing. That said, this movie feels like clash in management. Written by first-time feature writer Wes Tooke, it definitely shows that he needs to grow into his talent a little longer. Although filled with exciting moments and some great actors, here's why I believe Midway isn't really worth your time overall.<br/><br/>After the attack on Pearl Harbour, Midway follows a group of U.S. soldiers as they formulate a plan to attack Midway. While this premise does make for some exciting battle sequences, it's undercut by side plots that feel slightly unnecessary to the overall arc of this movie. I understand that it was trying to cover all the bases during the events of this piece of history, but there is a specific portion of the film that feels rushed on top of having nearly nothing to do with the overall premise, so I was scratching my head on why it was even included in the first place. Other than that, this movie is fairly focused for the most part.<br/><br/>I think the biggest weakness of this film, however, is the fact that I truly do not buy that Ed Skrein is a leading man. I've enjoyed him as secondary characters or as a villain in movies like Deadpool, but for the lengthy screentime he gets here, I don't believe his performance held this movie together very well. I'm usually in full support of actors breaking out with large roles, but I'm just not sure he is one to carry the weight of powerhouses like Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, Luke Evans, or Patrick Wilson. The entire secondary cast outshined him throughout the entire film and I really did think that was a detriment to the movie as a whole, which is a shame since he does have potential.<br/><br/>Now, I don't want to make people believe that this film is a pile of trash because it's not, but the most enjoyable aspect of this movie for me was also a mixed bag. Midway's strongest suit is that it doesn't hold back on the action. From the Pearl Harbour attack to the final act of the movie, there is a significant chunk of this film that's dedicated to action, and most of it is well-done in many regards, but it's far too artificial to buy into most of the time. Much like Roland Emmerich's recent movies, this film heavily relies on CGI, but I just don't think the team who worked on this movie truly delivered on what the budget was. A lot of this movie looks and feels fake, which really took me out of the battle scenes. With that said, aside from feeling artificial, it is well-filmed nonetheless.<br/><br/>In the end, Midway isn't going to be remembered as one of the year's best films by any means, nor as one of Roland Emmerich's better efforts, but it may please some action junkies or fans of the war genre. Other than that, it's pretty standard fare with some questionable lead acting, although it does feature some exciting moments. This movie is a fine watch in retrospect, but nothing really worth recommending and nothing I'll ever have the desire to watch again. Again, some viewers may get a kick out of the exciting elements, but it just wasn't enough for me."

"kenbkfs","8","0","1","29 November 2019"," From a student of war history
","From my perspective and study of the Battle of Midway, this movie is very accurate in many of its portrayals of events. Having studied the maps of Pearl Harbor myself, I can see how the movie crew got this as accurate as possible.<br/><br/>The intelligence reports and suppositions of the intelligence officers were very much questioned by their superiors because the information was based on ""new technologies"" for gathering and studying the information. Thank God, Admiral Nimitz listened to the reports and acted upon them.<br/><br/>Having only witnessed the battle from the brief films of John Ford, I can only imagine (as did the screenwriters) the scope and horror of the battle.<br/><br/>My only question about the movie is, Why did most of the male cast members in major roles have the same jaw-clenching expression on their faces? To me, the only distraction in a very accurate depiction of the events leading up to and the Battle of Midway."
"redwards-81247","7","0","1","27 November 2019"," Very well done .....
","This film was very well done and the two hours went by so fast. No fake love interest in this movie or any person of color getting a cameo or being a token was represented. The only negative, the pilots did not go from carrier to Hawaii as often as it was shown. These pilots were at sea for 3/4 of the war, not going back home and hitting the officers club every other week as portrayed. Overall, the film is very good. This should be shown to all high school students so that they know and understand what WWII is about. The schools hardly teach this any longer."
"dyak43","5","0","4","24 November 2019"," Good script spoiled by terrible casting & acting
","Woody Boyd cannot be Admiral Nimitz. And Skreil was pathetic/awful/disaster as a ""cocky"" kid from NJ. Go back to fantasies and comic books where authenticity is not expected.<br/><br/>Other than that, good story, and pretty accurate historically (omitted a few important things). Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, and Midway were about the aircraft carriers and the power that they would have later, and this is the first time a movie tied it all together.<br/><br/>Would love to see a redo with the casting executives from Band of Brothers in charge. Maybe Hanks directing the conversation shots. If that happens my rating goes from 5 to 9."

","I found this movie hard to follow. The editing was confusing to me jumping between multiple locations without it being clear who is who and how it all fit together. It felt to me that there were critical scenes missing to make the film work. It didn't help that for me many actors looked very similar and I often struggled figuring out who is who and what their roles were. The acting also felt off to me - there were too many missed opportunities for some strong dialogue, which was replaced with dialogue that I did not find very engaging."

","MIDWAY REVIEW<br/><br/>The US is caught on the back foot after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>The Japanese are better equipped; the American fighter planes are creaky crates, and their torpedoes have all the destructive power of conkers.<br/><br/>But this macho war film argues the US had one thing in its favour: its men.<br/><br/>All the most enormous, jutting, chiselled chins in Hollywood are called up to do their duty, and armed with lines of dialogue that sink like depth charges.<br/><br/>In fairness, the priorities in this account of the Battle of Midway are the admittedly impressive aerial battle sequences, which are great, featuring numerous gut-churning plunges as the US pilots dive-bomb the enemy ships.<br/><br/>Of course there is the usual cowboy / reckless flyboy who saves ther day and Woody Harrelson dons a silver wig and an expression of noble fortitude as Admiral Chester Nimitz.<br/><br/>Every tired war movie cliche is unearthed in a film that brings nothing new but will no doubt please fans of men in uniform yelling at explosions.<br/><br/>In essance very long, very drawn out, the historical accuracy forgotten, acting ropey in places, confusing at times but well made up for by the scenes of the destruction of Pearl Harbour, the true cost of war and the aerial battles.<br/><br/>Dont waste your time and money in the cineam for this outing, wait for it to come on TV or streaming.<br/><br/>Rating 6 out of 10"

"tonyluh","6","0","2","18 November 2019"," Visual effects are great but plot is a tad out of focus!
","There is too much Pearl Harbor, Dolittle Tokyo bombing mission, etc. The whole thing should be on Midway and the intricacies of Japan's military strategy and US counter measures. They should also cast someone else for Admiral Nimitz's role because Woody Harrelson is, albeit a great actor, just not convincing in the Nimitz role. Japan's failure is not only attributable to our code breakers, according to history, and that failure should be expounded in more detail in this movie. Anyways, it was still entertaining because nowadays visual effects are so real and the big screen just enhances everything. I give it 6 stars but it certainly could have been better made..."
"THines01","5","0","3","18 November 2019"," It's ""ok""
","I understand some writers, directors, and actors take liberties when making historical representations, and I'm OK with how most of this movie was done. The part that bothered me was the super-obvious CGI. There were parts where CGI was not necessary, but used anyway, like the scene where sailors are exercising on-deck and it looks ""cartoonish"". There were several times where I felt they were going to go completely CG and remove the actors during speaking parts. Luckily, I did not detect any of that.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was decent for a Hollywood representation of sea battles. If you're not a history buff, you'll probably need to do a little study to understand some of the more significant contributions from some of the people represented in the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was superb -- even the parts that were sensationalized."
"petrified-50485","5","0","4","12 November 2019"," Historically accurate, the special effects need plenty of editing!!!!!!
","I wish they could combine the 1976 Midway Movie with this one and then you'd have a great movie. Some of the special effects in this movie ( like the ships and dogfights) were really good,but many were ridiculous. The 1976 Midway movie and Tora Tora Tora used actual aircraft from the period and even with the WW2 footage scenes the attacks seemed more realistic than the 2019 movie. I thought Woody Harrelson was great as Chester Nimitz, He kind of looked like him. The Japanese acting was good also. I liked the 1976 movie better. It seemed more real. Tora Tora Tora will always be the best war movie. I wish they'd make a movie about the battle of the Atlantic off America's east coast. It's almost criminal they haven't made a movie about that . Can't ever show the Germans winning with this Hollywood."

","Midway was a really great movie and I enjoyed every minute of it but to my dismay, there was only one African-American sailor in the movie and you only see the back of his head briefly!

"rockman182","6","0","2","10 November 2019"," Midway (2019)
","Say what you will about Roland Emmerich, he knows how to make a large scale action film, especially if its a disaster movie. The plot and story may not always be up to par with the popcorn action scenes are almost always there. That's kind of what I expected with Midway, although the backdrop for this film is more fact based as it covers the infamous battle of Midway. The film is very long and the story is so dull. There's very little emotional value behind the characters and there's just too many packed in.<br/><br/>The film is based on the World War II Battle at Midway between American and Japanese soldiers. The event was a result of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor six months prior. The film follows key soldiers involved in the aerial and naval warfare that ultimately led to victory for the American Forces. The film has a plethora of actors in roles throughout the film, with Mandy Moore being the only notable female character?<br/><br/>There's a large ensemble cast at hand here. You see actors and then they disappear. A lot of them don't have good development and are there for their star power. Not sure if it was because the presentation of the story was dull or if the plot and characters just feel convoluted but I found myself checking the clock. Granted the wartime action is great to look at; something that never lets you down in Emmerich films is the action set pieces and its no different here.<br/><br/>I did like that Emmerich also focuses on the Japanese soldiers and not just as faceless enemies. There's humanity to the characters which was a good touch, despite the American soldiers being very generic themselves. I wasn't expecting a whole lot so its not like I was let down by this. You just kind of know what you are getting yourself into with films like these. Maybe the film needed a little cheese and relationship drama like that of Pearl Harbor because that film was infinitely more entertaining. This is a by the numbers, going through the motions film, with pretty action sequences.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"arthur_tafero","7","0","2","10 November 2019"," Much Better Than Average WW 2 film - Midway 2019
","This film comes about 40 years after the original made in the late 1970s, which obviously suffered from far less dramatic special effects. In addition to much better special effects, the lead actors other than Henry Fonda from the original, all do a better job in this one. The actor portraying Flyer Best does a pretty good job of hamming it up and projecting just about every stereotype you have ever seen in a WW 2 flyboy film. However, despite this over the top approach, the carefully edited and directed film is superior to the original in those areas as well. One criticism I did have about the storyline however, was the Doolittle sequence, which really only skimmed the surface of what could have been a far more meaningful few scenes depicting how the Chinese got him out of the country and the terrible losses they suffered under the Japanese, whom they hate to this day. This is precisely why the Chinese investors of this film will turn a very nice profit. Showing the film all over China to people who still hate the Japanese is money in the bank. I predict the film will be a big hit in China, and one of the biggest grossers of the year in China as well."

There is the cocky pilot and the guy with the mustache that is his boss. There is other guy with a mustache that is cool and that is about it. The end battle has no emotional impact because there was no character development.<br/><br/>It was ok.

","America is drawn into a fog of war at sea with Japan.<br/><br/>Midway tries to recount the history of Midway but unless you already know it you wouldn't pick up on the morsels of details that it provides. By trying to cover all the events from 1941 it really gives itself too much to do. Perhaps it should have picked up where Pearl Harbour (2001) left off: after the Doolittle raid. The Battle of the Coral Sea is barely mentioned yet it was far more crucial to the events at Midway as it evened up the odds.<br/><br/>We learn a little of the information gathering, almost none of the strategy and lots about the heroics of the pilots. The audience is still left in the fog of war."
"galahad58-1","6","0","4","9 November 2019"," Not A Remake of Midway
","Before folks start comparing this film to the very good Charlton Heston version - note that this is not a remake of that movie. While it portrays some of the events, this film focuses mostly on one fighter pilot where the 70's film focused on the planning and the senior officers.<br/><br/>Visually the film is outstanding. It looks great and has fantastic air and sea scenes.<br/><br/>Story-wise the film is a bit of a mess. The dialog is not the greatest, but it does not kill the film. The screenplay keeps the film a star or two above the pitiful Pearl Harbor, but it is too weak to propel this film into the Saving Private Ryan arena.<br/><br/>Emmerick was not the right choice for director. He is mostly a visual director who does not have the storytelling talent needed to tell this historically important event properly. Nor is he known to pull the talent out of an actor to receive the strong performances that these historical figures needed. An example of that is the lead - it is a very weak performance that takes away from the film at times. Mandy Moore is also a non-essential role and her input was not inspiring in any way. Dennis Quaid and Patrick Wilson are the sole reasons to watch the film and they keep it interesting."
