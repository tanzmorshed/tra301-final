","The best one of the original trilogy it's non stop thrills and twists and amazing gripping story only gets better with every scene, Matt Damon was great again, Maybe in my opinion there could of been more action but that's just me but apart from that it's a very intelligent gripping film and should not be missed."

","Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.<br/><br/>This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.<br/><br/>It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. <br/><br/>It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) ""This isn't some newspaper story, this is real"" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>The pacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it.<br/><br/>With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its peak."
"jaredmobarak","8","206","279","4 August 2007"," He just drove off the roofThe Bourne Ultimatum
","I have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me. Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window. With that said, the Bourne series has been fantastic. Doug Liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly. This is not the sci-fi absurdity that was Bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less). There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out. With director Paul Greengrass taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair. The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. Greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment, The Bourne Ultimatum. In what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy, the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.<br/><br/>Once again, Bourne is brought into the minds of the CIA by false pretenses. Someone has leaked information about the Treadstone upgrade called Blackbriar and once Bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story, he is assumed to be the mole. Only Pamela Landy, she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy, knows that he can't be the one. Bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace. It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them. What ends up transpiring is that Bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer. The film, then, becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends, or if Bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.<br/><br/>In what is probably the simplest storyline of the series, with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story, it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression. This is not a detriment at all, however, as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot. Admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight, between Bourne and the CIA's second asset, alone. The chase jumping through windows in Madrid is cool on its own, but when they finally meet up, we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see. Also, rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films, we instead get around three small scale road races, just as intense, but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.<br/><br/>After five years of waiting, we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling. By the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him. No one could have done it better than Matt Damon. He has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences, but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him. Joan Allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job, but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how Brian Cox's character, from the first two films, took matters into his own hands. Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from David Strathairn. Like Cox, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision. With as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the Blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country, you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing. Even the little guys do a wonderful job, like Paddy Considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything, Albert Finney as a man from Bourne's past and possibly key to his origin, and Edgar Ramirez as one of the CIA's operatives sent to take Bourne out. Ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by Clive Owen (Identity), Karl Urban, and Martin Csokas (Supremacy). He doesn't talk much, if at all, but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in Domino.<br/><br/>In the end, one has to applaud Paul Greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them. His skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as Tony Scott, but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts. Rather than feel like over- production, his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action. Let's also credit cinematographer Oliver Wood, who shot all three Bourne films. He was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them."
"windcriesmary","10","693","992","3 August 2007"," Perhaps One of the Greatest Motion Picture Trilogies of our Time
","I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.<br/><br/>From the moment that the opening title appeared, I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. However for me, that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense.<br/><br/>I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and altogether, an unforgettable trilogy."

","The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After a thrilling set of two, we get the final installment. Here's my take:<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything. He has been running for too long. This time, it ends.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer. Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date. He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.<br/><br/>There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense. The reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way) or cheering on. (or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping. The audience was loving it.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package. All of the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how summer movie thrillers should be done. I love the Bourne trilogy."

I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).<br/><br/>I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one.<br/><br/>Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!"

","Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne movies, I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>However it was a very thrilling experience and I didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films.

Ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne.

","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the ""man behind the curtain"" is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent).<br/><br/>Like the second entry in the series, I wished Paul Greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. However, that being said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there.<br/><br/>With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. Still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the ""Identity"" and the ""Supremacy"", this ""Ultimatum"" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it."
"simonparker1990","10","214","315","16 August 2007"," 007 had better watch out, Bourne's about!
","When the Bourne Identity arrived five years ago I have to confess that I didn't think much of it. At the time I was eleven years old, so perhaps I was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. Two years ago when the Bourne Supremacy arrived I thought it was a better movie than Identity but still didn't think it was as good as I expected it to be judging by the trailers. Over the past two years I had been told numerous times that the Bourne movies were amazing, many a time I had to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies. Until two months ago I couldn't have given a damn about the Bourne Ultimatum, I really had no intentions of watching it. But then I decided to go back and re-watch the first two before I came to any abrupt decisions. So I went out and bought both the original movies. And what a surprise it was to me when I was gripped by them. Identity I found the superior of the two, but Supremacy isn't far behind. They're both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that I have watched numerous times since I bought them. Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum. And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint! <br/><br/>Matt Damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the Bourne movies, I'd seen him in the Talented Mr Ripley, but I never thought much of him in general. However, it appears he was born to play Bourne (pardon the pun). Throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see Matt Damon at his very best, even better than he was in The Departed and I thought he was one of the best things in The Departed. You really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. Matt Damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable. The supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding. Joan Allen was one of my favourite things in Bourne Supremacy, here she excels herself. Her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie. Julia Stiles turns up again as Nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character. Julia Stiles is a very underrated actress and I think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets. David Strathairn is a newcomer to this series as Noah Vosen, he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. He's definitely the nastiest character we've met, and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty. Strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. Special mention must also go to Albert Finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, I will not say anything about the character, that's best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The Bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. But running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline. This storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie. As I watched Supremacy the night before I saw Ultimatum it was nice because I could notice certain little parts. That very final scene in Supremacy, in New York, a lot more important that I ever imagined at the time. Won't spoil it for people but I recommend checking up on Supremacy before you see Ultimatum. Unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see Ultimatum purely because of the action sequences. This is the part where I should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that my favourite parts of the Bourne series as a whole are the car chases. The mini car chase in Identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time. Well the action in Ultimatum has to be the best of the Bourne series. In fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in Moscow. So in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups, all very violent and shockingly brutal. A bike chase that is absolutely amazing, many foot chases which are even more amazing, a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable, and oh so much more! But the highlight for me has to be the scene in Waterloo station, won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped.<br/><br/>So any flaws for the movie? In my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the Bourne series or have not seen the previous two then I wouldn't recommend Ultimatum for you. The movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top. The Bourne Ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. As a James Bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that Ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the Bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that. While Bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the Bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal."
"jmbartle","8","157","238","6 August 2007"," Ultimatum is Easily the Best Bourne
","Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really didn't even notice it.<br/><br/>You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!"

Right..moving on.As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all mesh in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. I have always been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more exciting for me.<br/><br/>If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become attached and be a part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might, just MIGHT, have the edge when comparing the trilogy."
"joestank15","9","68","104","3 August 2007"," Would ""High Octane"" be a Cliché here?
","The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA's latest program ""Blackbriar"" to make super assassins like himself.<br/><br/>I was so psyched for this one that I watched it's predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I recall and Supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops, slight lacking in action and suspense.<br/><br/>Hoo boy, does Ultimatum have suspense! Even when you know Bourne will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it. It's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those $150 million giant robots did in Transformers.<br/><br/>Chalk it up to Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like CIA headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the action in Ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring, with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (I'll never look at those the same way again) and an electric fan (Don't ask). The music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over.<br/><br/>The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character ""Nicky"" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. This longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in Supremacy, but just works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br/><br/>I am reminded of a scene in ""Goldeneye"" (the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond film) in which Sean Bean's character asks James if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed. Bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources. Albeit, resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of anything.<br/><br/>Sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the CIA, Interpol, and the police nearly ANYWHERE he goes, that Bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br/><br/>If you have a pulse and love action movies, than Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action film to come out this year. Of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. It kind of drags a touch near the end, but I almost feel tempted to overlook that. This is the first ""3"" movie this summer to at least match, if not exceed, the original and that is saying something.<br/><br/>A-"
"lucasaq-1","10","104","164","3 August 2007"," Fantastic Conclusion
","The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.<br/><br/>The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They aren't his target. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever."
"sackjigler","9","83","134","2 August 2007"," Amazing Ending To A Great Trilogy
","Im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you. This movie is awesome. From beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. The fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. He is this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy CIA agent out to kill Bourne. This is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. The ending is left open for sequels and I sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad. Excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.<br/><br/>P.S. The shaky cam did not hurt any of the action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action."
"janos451","8","154","268","27 July 2007"," Ultimate 'Bourne'
","First and foremost, speaking as no fan of the genre, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a breathtaking, virtuoso, superb action movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super-hero stuff.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the film carries a complex, important point, about crime-fighters turning into criminals themselves. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or the Executive Branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights, none is necessary.<br/><br/>So, the latest in the ""Bourne"" series, in the hands of Paul Greengrass (of the 2004 ""Bourne Supremacy"" and last year's ""United 93""), is a significant achievement, perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre.<br/><br/>""Breathtaking"" above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer seemingly holds his breath, pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless, globe-trotting, utterly suspenseful action. There is no letup, no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>Oliver Wood's in-your-face cinematography is making the best of Tony Gilroy's screenplay from Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (which doesn't stack up well against the ""Bourne Identity,"" written a decade earlier).<br/><br/>Matt Damon is once again the inevitable, irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest of fantasy CIA agents, this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity, his past, and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine. Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow, the always-marvelous David Strathairn is the nasty top agency official, pitched against Bourne in trying to hide some illegal ""take-no-prisoners"" policies and brutal procedures.<br/><br/>Joan Allen plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn's Bad One. And, there is Julia Stiles as the agent once again coming to Bourne's aid; a combination of Greengrass' direction and Stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character, her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue.<br/><br/>So good is ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit, this time stretched to ridiculous excesses, as Bourne defies constraints of geography, time, gravity... and physics in general. (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? Why not - it looks great.) <br/><br/>All this ""real-world"" magic - leaping from country to country in seconds, to arrive at some unknown location exactly as, when, and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities. And yet, only a clueless pedant would allow ""facts"" interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy."
"fwomp","8","4","4","13 January 2008"," Action!
","Not being much of a Matt Damon fan, I rarely look forward to any of his films. There are exceptions, of course, most notably his surprisingly great performance in THE GOOD SHEPHERD. But even within The Good Shepherd, Damon's emotional range isn't challenged, which is why the part was perfect for him considering who he was portraying.<br/><br/>Part of that issue spills over into this series where we see a super-spy with little-to-no emotions that might help audiences ""feel"" anything for Jason Bourne. But THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM and its predecessors aren't about character, they're about action, and director Greengrass knows action very well. If you think these stories have ANYTHING to do with character, you are seriously deluded. We never understand the motivations behind any of the prime or secondary characters. This is glaringly obvious when Jason and a CIA ""asset"" sent out to eliminate him battle and, eventually, come to some sort of understanding.<br/><br/>But, like I said, these stories aren't character pieces but adrenaline pumping action sequences designed as a thrill ride. And on that level expectations are well-met.<br/><br/>Running from city to city, this is basically one long chase scene where the CIA learns that Bourne has resurfaced and several key officers within ""The Agency"" don't want him to discover a covert operation that hearkens back to Bourne's uber-secret beginnings.<br/><br/>David Strathairn (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) and Scott Glenn (FREEDOM WRITERS) star as two powerful but ultimately despicable Agency higher-ups who's attempts to snare Jason Bourne are continually foiled by Bourne and someone within their own department.<br/><br/>Female leads Joan Allen (THE ICE STORM) and Julia Stiles (THE OMEN, 2006) pull in okay performances; Allen as the sympathetic CIA agent who wants to know why her superiors are so enamored with killing off Jason Bourne, and Stiles as the former love interest who reemerges to initially help Jason but only puts herself in danger and must be saved by Bourne. Although that was a bit confusing (i.e., their relationship history), the rooftop chase through Tangier is flat-out amazing.<br/><br/>This is one of those film series' where you need to be in the mood for such things. If you want thoughtful, look elsewhere. But if you want heart-pounding action, you're in for a treat."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","89","153","4 October 2007"," A trilogy that stays true to the story
","In order to fully appreciate 'The Bourne Ultimatum', one must have to  have seen 'The Bourne Identity' and 'The Bourne Supremacy'. Like it's  prequel's, it is slick, action packed, suspenseful and has an engaging  screenplay. I particularly loved the chase scenes shot in Tangier.  Director Greengrass just keeps the right pace without making it boring  or too fast to follow. A fine ending to a trilogy, I preferred it over  the overrated 'Lord of the Rings: The Return of The King' and the  abysmal 'X-Men: The Last Stand'. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' has done  justice to the first two films.   Cinematography deserves special mention, whether it's the shaky camera  or the zoom-lens, it certainly adds to the 'fun' of the ride supported  by brilliant background score. The dialogues and characters are very  well written. This is especially a plus because character development  seems to be lacking in action films of today. Damon again looks the  part and his acting is fantastic as he completely owns the role.  Supporting cast that boasts of talented names like Joan Allen, Paddy  Considine, Albert Finney and David Straitharn all stand out.  A brilliant conclusion, it makes the whole trilogy stand out.  Filmmakers (especially that guy who made 'X-Men: The Last stand')  should learn how to make a trilogy interesting and intelligent. 'The  Bourne Ultimatum' is an intelligent, slick, well-paced action film that  respects the trilogy."

","How sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be. As soon as a few critics say something new is good (ie - ""Shake-Cam""), everyone jumps on the bandwagon, as if they are devoid of independent thought. This was not a good movie, it was a dreadful movie. 1) Plot? - What plot? Bourne was chased from here to there, from beginning to end. That's the plot. Don't look for anything deeper than this. 2) Cinematography? - Do me a favor! Any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job (I am not exaggerating here). This film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work. The ridiculous shaking of EVERY (I really do mean every) scene will cause dizziness and nausea. 3) Believable? - Oh yes definitely. This is a masterpiece of credibility. I loved scenes about Bourne being chased by (local) police through the winding market streets of Tangier. - I've BEEN to Tangier. Even the guides can't navigate their way through those streets but Bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse. Greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples. 4) Editing? - I don't know what the editor was on when he did this film but I want some! - Every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds. I felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the ""scenes"" flashing by. 5) Directing? - Hmmm. This is an interesting aspect. The film appears to have actually NOT had any directing. More a case of Greengrass throwing a copy of the script (all two pages) at the cameramen and told to ""shoot a few scenes whilst drunk"". - ""Don't worry boys, we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room"". The editor should be tarred, feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6) Not one but TWO senior CIA operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood Jason Bourne. - Putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't a traitor. Talk about stupid nincompoops. (Whilst the evil male CIA members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor). (well, all men are evil, aren't they? - Except for SNAGS of course). Yes, this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity. 7) When the you-know-what finally hits the fan, good triumphs over evil (just like it always does, eh?) and the would-be assassin gets the drop on Jason Bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger (Yeah - right...) - at that very moment, the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger. - How did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath? Wonders will never cease 8) Don't worry, there's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts. Well, we can't have nasty, politically incorrect, CIA operatives going round shooting people, can we? How lovely to see a true to life P.C. film of the Noughties. -------------The Bourne Ultimatum is utter rubbish."

","""That the spy will fabricate his information is a mere commonplace. But in the sphere of political and revolutionary action, relying partly on violence, the professional spy has every facility to fabricate the very facts themselves, and will spread the double evil of emulation in one direction, and of panic, hasty legislation, unreflecting hate, on the other. However, this is an imperfect world . . . .""<br/><br/>Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent<br/><br/>Here's my ultimatum: Find a better spy thriller this year or agree with me (not a natural instinct for discerning readers) that Bourne Ultimatum is one cracker-jack adventure, not exceeded by even the estimable Live Free or Die Hard. Paul Greengrass solidifies his rep as a director who can helm intelligent action and keep the audience enthralled for hours.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne for three years has been tracking himself because amnesia was a part of his training as a super sleuth for the CIA and he wants to know who the hell he is. On his path to self knowledge lie countless bodies, dispatched with an admirable efficiency, albeit fantastic at times. But the genius of this film is to make me a believer in that supremacy, so good is Damon at projecting smarts and physical superiority.<br/><br/>Part of the fun is tracking the world with him from Turin to Tangiers to Waterloo Station, a favorite spot of mine where the Thames and the Eye converge on the passages of every traveler in London. Bourne navigates despite the CIA's best attempts to stop him; he guides a reporter through the station with cell phones, a tour de force sequence of technology aiding intelligence. It's athletic, scary, and exhilarating, as if Bourne were guiding us through the labyrinth of the very movie itself.<br/><br/>Bourne Ultimatum touches lightly on the current challenges of government-sanctioned rendition and torture. When Damon asks an antagonist/operative to look at what they have become, assassins who don't know why they assassinate, and when assistant director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) discloses that his unit may murder at will, Congress's subpoenas can be seen waiting for Cheney and his covert crew. The film manages to strike a pose even while neocons and struggling Dems enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>You can bet the resolution is another compressed denouement with a heavy dose of the incredible. So be it. It's summer, and I had just sat through J Lo's boring El Cantante. I needed to travel light, and Jason was just the right companion. <br/><br/>Yes, he finds out his real name, but he'll always be Bourne to us."

","Users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.<br/><br/>From the first, BU is just a chase film. We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot, character development, or boring old reality.<br/><br/>If you haven't see the other two Bourne films, you're pretty lost. If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on United 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on Bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He gets blown up. He clears tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he SURVIVES. He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension. So he drives off a building? So what? He'll survive. Yawn.<br/><br/>There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. I've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet.<br/><br/>Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds out his true identity. So what? It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes.<br/><br/>The 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! I'd better end now before the slide continues.<br/><br/>I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's a loud, tedious series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br/><br/>The idea that it 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is utter crap. Casino Royale blows it out of the water."

","I have one request that I know will fall upon deaf Hollywood ears: Stop at The Bourne Ultimatum. Please. Stop screwing up wonderful trilogies, movies series with an overkill part IV. This series doesn't need it. The Bourne series has a wonderful, realistic, suspenseful and near-perfect storyline that began with Bourne floating in the ocean and ending with this movie. Though part 2, or Supremacy, wasn't bad, hardly at all, it was nothing compared to the thrilling conclusion of the trilogy. Bourne's still railing over the loss of Marie (in Supremacy) while getting closer to unraveling his sordid past. We take up his journey across the globe and learn new secrets and clues along with him. All the while, the film's action packed, but with a brain, or, a well-scripted plot. Again, we have Joan Allen, one of my all time favorite actresses outshining the rest of the cast. I loved the cinematography, I loved the dialogue and the fight scenes were top notch, and as I mentioned previously with part 1, or Identity, it's awesome to see a true action movie without obvious CGI-scenes. I loved how they took the time to make a true spy thriller with real scenes in which I believed the characters to be in real danger. Okay, now the bad: you'll sure have to shut off the suspension of disbelief momentarily in certain scenes. Such as when Bourne is being chased on the roofs while chasing someone on the ground he's trying to protect and happens to keep up marvelously with her and when he exits a multistory car crash drop and gets out very little shaken and barely stirred. Overall, extremely recommended as the end-credit song that appears in all three movies: Moby's Extreme Ways. A fitting song and one of my favorites.a"

","The Bourne Ultimatum is the worse of the franchise. It is a shame that Ludlum's last Bourne novel has been transformed to a motion picture that has as much clarity as a bug being squished on a cars windshield. The plot is perhaps the thinnest of any of the Bourne movies, and the audience is at best bored with the whole experience. But the most annoying, madding, is the cinematography by Wood, is like a film being filmed by the Road Runner on Crack, jumpy, blurry, and headache inducing. The film may have been worth viewing, if the audience could see what was going on. But with the shaky cam of this debacle being bad enough, but even the action scenes were filmed way to close in for anyone to follow what was going on in this picture. See this if you must, but bring your aspirin."

Matt Damon certainly played a lot of character in a wonderful way. But I think Matt Damon's Jason Bourne come to mind is mentioned. Although the movie you feel sad inside that action on it. Matt Damon's Bourne character and it gives you in a great way. Bourne character to the injustice and shows the loneliness of the characters is very nice. Cool the quality of each other every film, but this film deserves to be told that the end was the best of them slipped."

","Simon Ross, a reporter with UK newspaper The Guardian writes a couple of articles on the mystery of Treadstone and Jason Bourne  he has not definite answers but the detail suggests that he has a source deep within the programme. CIA Deputy Director Vosen wants to silence this source as it could compromise his black ops units around the world. Meanwhile Jason Bourne, last seen in Russia, also wants to discover Simon Ross's source. The race is on  Bourne trying to learn more of his past, the CIA trying to close the door forever.<br/><br/>At the time of writing IMDb users have placed this film as #54 in the list of best all-time films and the sheer volume of praise for it is overwhelming. Now, on one hand, this film doesn't really deserve all this but I can understand why it has been the recipient of all of it because it has been a roundly terrible summer for blockbusters, trilogies especially. Thus when one that is enjoyable and effective came along it was no surprise that it stood out from the crowd. For this is what Bourne Ultimatum is. It is not brilliant nor ""one of the greatest films ever made"" but it is effective and thrilling to the point where I was happy to ignore the weaknesses.<br/><br/>And I disagree with others who suggest there are no weaknesses here because I maintain that the film (and the trilogy) is built on a very obvious narrative that offers few surprises but does offer plenty of opportunity for action. It is this action where the film excels and it is credit to Greengrass and his cinematographer for producing a film that feels urgent from the very start and most of the way through. I appreciate that some will dislike the constantly moving camera just as they did in Supremacy but for me it is the making of the film as it draws the audience so close into the action that the specific motivations for it become secondary. This means we can have an intense action scene in Turin where the majority of it does not relate to the bigger picture in regards the narrative. However I did find that the narrative could have done with a focus here and there as it doesn't explore the characters as much as I was hoping and the ""conclusion"" of the film is weak. The globe-trotting aspect of the film is a bonus as well and you can see why many compare Bourne to Bond. However this isn't just a cosmetic title on the screen  the film really uses the locations to good effect and is all the better for it.<br/><br/>The action is beautifully done though. The intensity and excitement of the action drives us forward; it does not need a pumping soundtrack or loads of obvious CGI, the camera does some of the work and the viewers do the rest. Witness the car chase in New York  nothing we have not seen before in terms of location but delivered with a documentary style that makes it feel all the more exciting. Another high is the fist fight between Bourne and Desh  almost silent and hard to follow but it is the proximity of the action that does the job.<br/><br/>Within this style the cast mostly pitch their performances to be clipped and urgent. Damon does sterling work as the invincible action man even if the material leaves him a little exposed. There is only so many times that I can see him climbing out of impossible wrecks without losing touch with him as a character. It is disappointing that we did not get to see Damon have to work his acting muscles more though  the ""revelation"" that Bourne volunteered for all he had done is badly handled and just brushed over  nowhere near the impact that it should have had that our ""hero"" is a baddie himself, and not because of the programme. Stiles is so-so but fills the role. Strathairn, Glenn and Allen are all good in their various CIA roles  nothing surprising but they do it effectively. Considine and Finney are both good presences. It isn't really an actors' film but everyone does the basics well enough.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a very effective and enjoyable action movie that benefits from an urgency and intimacy that comes from Greengrass' direction and total delivery. Far from the model of perfection that some have claimed but easily one of the best films of the summer (although for 2007 that is not necessarily a great recommendation)."

In the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they've seen (or of the summer, year, etc.) They say it's an excellent conclusion. WTF!!!!!!!!!?????? What has been concluded (besides the fact that Bourne can ride motorcycles, shoot, and fight better than anyone else he comes across)? What do you learn about Bourne's character in this movie?????????Absolutely f****** nothing!!!!!!! Okay, there's a lot of action, but what's so great about the action in this movie?? I don't like the cinematography and film editing. The shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used TOO much and they get old fast (I didn't mind them in Supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess) and made me quite dizzy. I was quickly wishing I had saved my $$$ for something else.<br/><br/>This movie has no plot. All this movie is is a 115 minute chase seen. Bourne, who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the movie, is a perfectionist at everything he attempts. There is absolutely no character development in this movie, you know nothing about anyone, and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment. Some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense. ???????????!!!!!!!! What writing???? What suspense??? There's no suspense. Bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does, I don't think he has anything to worry about. If this is the best movie of the year 2007 I may just quit watching movies entirely!!!! <br/><br/>Many people have also said that Matt Damon's performance in this movie is one of the best (if not the best) of his career. What performance?? How many lines did he have in this movie??? I have some respect for Damon because he has been in movies that I liked and has played different kinds of characters, but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next, someone who chooses different types of roles. Not someone who plays the same roles over and over again (which Damon doesn't do, but an example of someone who does is Vin Diesel).<br/><br/>Anyways, this movie was a BIG disappointment to me. I do not recommend this movie but I do recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I most definitely recommend reading the three books (which are much different then the movies)."

","'THE_BOURNE_ULTIMATUM' was_directed_by_Paul_Greengrass_and_stars Matt_Damon, ​David_Strathairn_and_Julia_Stiles. ​Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues his international quest to uncover his true identity. From Russia to Europe to northern Africa to the United States, he must stay one step ahead of those who would capture or kill him before he has a chance to discover the truth.<br/><br/>I didn't like Identity. I liked Supremacy. I adored every second of Ultimaum. This is easily the peak of the trilogy(and allegedly franchise as a whole). It encapsulates the good from both movies and improves drastically on the flaws I had with them films. No Marie Kreutz from Identity. Easily the Bourne franchise's best villain and no contest the best action. Greengrass is the only current director who can use hand held cam effectively and he perfected that craft with Ultimatum. He was working there with Supremacy but ironed out all the chinks with Ultimatum. This is easily the best movie in the trilogy and maybe even one of the best action movies in recent memory. <br/><br/>Where do I begin in complimenting this movie. I guess the story would be a great place to start, and what a brilliant story it is. Gilroy, Nofil and Burns have made a spectacular story that is gripping and enthralling from beginning to end. It is interesting and I would argue the best story of the three, even though Supremacy is technically the better thriller(for me). I've heard many people refer to this franchise as the 'Smart Bond' but I've never believed them until now. One small sequence in this movie(and a ridiculously clever way to intertwine Supremacy and Ultimatum) changed my entire outlook on this nickname and made me believe it. It is the thinking man's Bond. Not that I don't love Bond, it's just Mert Dermon is smarter than it. I defy anyone to tell me that the ending of this movie is not perfect. It is exhilarating, it ends on a cliffhanger but also complete finish, it's smart, it's engaging; it's the perfect way to end this trilogy.<br/><br/>Mert Dermon is spectacular in his role as Jason Bourne. The arc he experiences over the course of the trilogy is brilliant character development and Damon sells every single scene of it. It is probably his best performance, purely because of what he managed to do to the character.<br/><br/>David Strathairn was great as Noah Vosen and provided a great mental foil for Bond. On the subject of Vosen, the villains in this movie are by far the best out of any Bourne film. They are smart, interesting and most importantly have a purpose. As much as I enjoyed Supremacy, Yuri Gretkov had little to no relation to Bourne and that made his character so much weaker. The villains in this movie, however, make sense and that instantly gives them an edge over the 'competition'.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles plays a much larger role in this movie than the previous one and does it very well. She is filling in for Marie Kreutz and I actually prefer her to Kreutz. I also love how they don't try to force some love story between the her and Bourne. This is the maturity and evolution we need in film. Not every woman should be treated as merely a sex object or as a relationship starter for the masculine lead character. They can be interesting without the need for forced romance. Take notes Hollywood, take notes.<br/><br/>Joan Allen plays a much smaller role in this movie for me but I still admired her performance just as much as in Supremacy. She holds her own against other character and provides a useful ally for Bourne.<br/><br/>I have said it once, I've said it twice, I'll say it again; Paul Greengrass is the only man alive who should be allowed to use hand held camera. He uses it to add realism to the sequences and make them arguably more intense. He doesn't use it to obscure an actor's face and their movements so we can paint a picture of what is happening in our minds. It's truly admirable that he is the only living human that can do something that should be so simple.<br/><br/>Leading on from the action, this movie is full of it. Two sequences stick out for me and both are excellent. The police chase sequence is probably one of the best action set pieces of the 2000s, and I don't say that lightly. Greengrass' use of hand held cam(I refuse to refer to it as shaky cam in this instance) helps sell the realism and urgency of the action. It doesn't feel well rehearsed(even though it is) and that makes it seem so much more grounded and real. Greengrass cleaned up his act with action and hand held cam and perfected the craft of it since Supremacy. Very, very impressive. Very enjoyable to behold.<br/><br/>I love the score of this movie. It is utterly fantastic and spectacular and I adore it.<br/><br/>My main and only issue with this movie was that I never felt Bourne was in any immediate danger. I never doubted he'd escape or survive. They basically make him a god and that made the film lose stakes. Not that it takes away from the action, when the action gets going; you don't pay attention to this, but if you take a step back, you realise that there was 0% chance he'd lose any fight. I know that losing would be out of character but I would prefer to see some sort of weakness that he had to overcome.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Ultimatum is a very enjoyable and widely accessible action/thriller. I don't think seeing the first two films is required to like this movie but it is recommended. I definitely recommend you watch Ultimatum, and specifically recommend you watch the trilogy back-to-back. I'll rate The Bourne Ultimatum 9 'COME ALONEs' out of 10. Please see it; it is awesome!"

Her moxie is prominent as Pam has to contend with the new CIA director, Noah Vosen, and his quest to eliminate Jason Bourne once and for all; she refuses to stand aside and let Vosen kill the only known link to Treadstone (and now Blackbriar). Julia Stiles' Nicky is finally showcased as she joins the globetrotting Bourne on his quest and she proves herself a valuable ally and subsequently a threat to the hush-hush nature of Treadstone, Blackbriar and the CIA. <br/><br/>Playing Noah Vosen is the commanding David Straithairn who brings a quick to action quality that is contrast to the methodical predecessors before him. Vosen's regime is more dedicated to the ""shoot first, ask questions later"" motto as he and his team work speedily to eliminate anyone who could help Jason Bourne on his mission. This proves to be the downfall of Vosen by the film's end because of Jason Bourne's methodical prowess and Pam Landy's equally stealthy tactics; using her position of being a member of the CIA to get information that Bourne needs and passing it to him.<br/><br/>A thrilling conclusion to the trilogy that begged the question ""Who is Jason Bourne?"" and giving us the answer in this heart-pounding finale."

","The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.<br/><br/>First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.<br/><br/>If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by MattDamon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.<br/><br/>I won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.<br/><br/>It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard.<br/><br/>Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others"
"Desertman84","10","5","6","8 November 2011"," The Bourne Ultimatum Is The Best Among The Bourne Trilogy
","The Bourne Ultimatum is a spy film directed by Paul Greengrass that was loosely based on the Robert Ludlum novel of the same title.This film is the third in the Bourne film series, being preceded by The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy. Matt Damon reprises his role as the former CIA assassin and psychogenic amnesiac Jason Bourne. It also stars Julia Stiles,David Strathairn,Scott Glenn,Édgar Ramírez,Albert Finney,Joan Allen,Joey Ansah and Colin Stinton.The script was written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns, George Nolfi and an uncredited Tom Stoppard.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum picks up the storyline from the previous film,The Bourne Supremacy and continues the saga of Jason Bourne after he escapes from authorities in Moscow.He is once again brought out of hiding, this time inadvertently by London-based reporter Simon Ross who is trying to unveil Operation Blackbriar--an upgrade to Project Treadstone--in a series of newspaper columns. He sets up a meeting with Ross and realizes instantly they're being scanned. Information from the reporter stirs a new set of memories, and Bourne must finally, ultimately, uncover his dark past whilst dodging the CIA's best efforts in trying to eradicate him.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum surpasses the first two in the Bourne trilogy namely:The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy.It is an intelligent, finely tuned non-stop thrill ride of a spy thriller.It was great film, exhilarating and neatly crafted, the kind of picture to the point that it may look 20 or 30 years from now. Also,brilliant performances from the cast needs to be mentioned especially from Damon,Allen,Strathairn and Finney.<br/><br/>Overall,The Bourne Ultimatum is faster, grittier and more brutal as compared to the first two films in the series."
"cdstock","1","64","123","3 August 2007"," The Ultimate disappointment
","This movie should have had Dramamine available at the door. This was the most disturbingly incorrectly filmed movie I can remember. It should have been filmed during an earthquake so maybe the motion could have canceled out some of the totally unnecessary camera movement. This ranks right up there with the Blair Witch Project for filming techniques that should never ever be incorporated into a motion picture. I think Paul G did not understand that the motion in motion picture means the pictures move not the camera. I was so unbelievably aggravated with the motion that I couldn't get into the movie or the characters. Paul G's interpretation of celluloid will never be seen by my eyes again. I should have known to stay away when I learned they brought him on again from the second installment of this supposed trilogy. The whole experience is ruined by the filming and directing of this movie. Make sure you are motion sickness proofed before viewing."
"stinkslikesexinhere","7","31","55","4 August 2007"," Great movie, but needed a different director I'd say.
","I watched both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing this in the theater. I'd been waiting for this since before they started filming. I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers below- <br/><br/>Overall it was good, but it also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and Supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama. This movie felt choppy at times. The plot-building down-times were slightly too drawn out. That caused the following action to feel too frenetic.<br/><br/>Camera: Speaking of frenetic, the trademark Greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me. I know its has been talked/whined about to nausea on the message board, but it doesn't mean it's not relevant. All the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted. The ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie. It is a cheap, student director trick to make the film feel unsettled. I'd expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids, but not in this classy, adult, action series. Too much extreme close-up also. Do some framing. Get some interesting shots. Constant close-up feels like lazy directing to me.<br/><br/>Story: The story was VERY confusing at first. They thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go. Gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know you've missed some crucial information. Felt rushed or compressed for time reasons. After you catch up however the story is quite good. It's enjoyable following leads along with Bourne. HOWEVER, I did NOT care for the whole last scene of Supremacy (Landy/Bourne on the phone) being in the middle of Ultimatum thing. It basically makes the movie a half-prequel. I thought that was awkward.<br/><br/>Cast/Characters: The star of the movie is the action. Obviously there are only two originals left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Them teaming up was kind of odd to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to protect to and confide in. Unless I completely missed something, they never even tell you why they teamed up. The other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet. This felt like Gilroy/Greengrass/whoever wanting to not leave open ends. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy.. Those scenes were phenomenal. These assassins are as uninteresting as Castel (the first fella Bourne fights in Identity). The cast in general has degraded as the the series went on. Clive Owen was practically an afterthought. That's a measure of strength for that first cast. The second, they basically trade Chris Cooper for Joan Allen.... Not exactly equal. This one trades Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to be named later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, or Albert Finney, but they're not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series. Aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long, the acting was right on.<br/><br/>As a whole, it was successful. Felt like they wanted to get the series over with though. If they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts, eliminated Scott Glenn's part entirely, zoomed out, and taken the camera away from the seizure victim, it would have been perfect.<br/><br/>ENDING SPOILER<br/><br/>I don't see why they leave Bourne alive at the end. It was my understanding this was the conclusion. They clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless. I thought that was going to be it. A full circle type of ending. I did like Nicky reacting to the news report though.<br/><br/>SPOILER SPECIFICS WARNING - QUOTE FROM MOVIE BELOW -<br/><br/>Bourne's last line at the end ""Look at this.. Look at what they make you give."" quoting the first assassin he killed, I loved that. The final scene was great. (Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} that shot at Bourne. Why would he do that? Just out for vengeance? If he was angry enough to murder, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she faxes his top secret file? That didn't make sense.)"
"pooh_bear138","1","42","78","21 August 2007"," Couldn't get over the direction/camera work
","I loved the first film, the second one less so and this was my least favourite by far.<br/><br/>From the point of view of plot, it was very much a re-run of the second film. The only twist was the end which I won't give away.<br/><br/>What utterly spoiled it for me was the endless ""shaky-cam"" which others have commented on. I see comments on the message board that this is somehow ""real"". It is not. It is a so-called documentary style, only because the scenes in documentaries cannot be rehearsed and so the cameraman cannot predict what is happening and keep the scene in his field of view. This is obviously not the case in a feature film. It is therefor merely a ploy, a false technique to *give the impression"" of reality and is therefore even more unreal.<br/><br/>The best direction and camera-work is that which you do not notice. This was so in-your-face ""look at my direction"" that I had to look away for large sections of the film.. On the big screen it is overwhelming and the eye and brain search in vain for reference points to hold on to.<br/><br/>Sorry - but I just hated it."
"madhurmerchant","8","50","95","13 August 2007"," Great film, believable fight sequences, terrible camera work
","Towards the beginning of the movie there is a scene where two men meet in a restaurant. This particular scene must have been around 5-7 minutes into the movie and already I had noticed and started getting annoyed with the excessive shakiness of the camera and the ""artsy"" behind-the-shoulder shots. The two men were simply sitting in a restaurant and talking but the camera was shaking so much that you would think they were in the middle of an earthquake. It was ridiculous and I felt that it completely detracted from what should otherwise have been an intense and revealing conversation. I have never in my life ever had the urge to leave the theater during a movie till tonight when I saw ultimatum. I then remembered the 9 dollars I had spent and decided to wait it out. I am definitely glad that I stayed because the movie, apart from the camera issues, was brilliant. Matt Damon is supremely believable as Jason Bourne. For some reason more so in this movie than the previous ones.<br/><br/>The beautiful action scenes were again marred by shoddy camera work. I was immediately reminded of the camera work during the action sequences in Batman Begins. The fact that I was sitting towards the front of the movie theater only made things worse as my eyes struggled to stay focused on the action for more than half a second at a time. As someone else on this board suggested, it was almost like a strobe light effect. I really think it was a lazy and stupid decision to use the Shakycam so extensively. Just like any other flourish or trick, it should be used sparingly so that it subtly enhances a certain aspect of the movie. In this case, regretfully, it took away from the movie rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>Aside from the camera issues, the movie was very solid on many levels and easily a great addition to the series. All in all I don't regret spending the 9 bucks and I suppose that should say it all."

","This is going to be short, for many reasons.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to explain how this movie left me, other then completely disappointed. There were no highlights, no heart pounding moments that left you gasping. Identity brought us a story of a man. A man intent on finding information, finding out who he was. And the action came secondly. This first installment is my number two movie of all time. The only movie to beat it, is raiders of the lost ark, and only because i have lived with this movie since i was young. Suprem was a stylized action thriller that brought us a few more morsels of information. A fantastic follow up to the Bourne legacy. Which brings us the the anticlimactic Ultimatum. Nothing new under the sun here boys and girls, lets just add as many chase scenes as we can and hope that nobody notices that we have no script. And the only new bit of information we get here is that ""Web"" and Nicky may have had something between them in the past. Of course he volunteered for the program, what kind of halfgoated attempt to surprise us was that? Alright, so now i'm only ranting, sorry about that. But please can't you all realize Hollywood is treating us like we're idiots, and the worst part about it is most people still eat it up. Demand More From Your Movies!!!<br/><br/>Fin."

","The last instalment of the Bourne series, this time it is in morocco, Spain, the states, and Germany. This great series comes to an end where Bourne gets his final clues which lead him back home to the states in New York, where his trail ends. But before that, he must fight off more and more agents which keep a relentless pursuit on his tail. But now he has more help from a girl who he has met a few times before, a girl named Niki Parsons. A woman who is also a CIA agent yet works with the deep covert operations division for which Bourne was trained in. They both become a good team when they land in Morocco, but another assassin is hot on the trail, a man named Desh. Just as tough and fully equipped as Bourne is when they meet face to face in a legendary hand to hand combat scene ever done. This scene was in a word, ultimate, using hand skills and body skills that wowed the crowd. And when Desh is erased, Bourne finally makes his way back home to see his prize, the facility which trained him to be the most dangerous man on the planet. And when he gets there, he gets a very big wake up call. One of the most brilliant pieces of espionage thrillers to date. This is a must for Ludlum fans like myself. You will not be disappointed."
"yfguitarist","1","21","37","4 August 2007"," Best camera-work since The Blair Witch Project
","I've tried, 3 times, to like these movies, but I just can't. One of the main reasons people love these movies is because Jason Bourne is a badass! And he doesn't take no for an answer! If you like Rambo/Arnold/Bond movies and don't care about story or plot holes or logistics, you'll probably love this movie (not that there's anything wrong with that). But it's so full of clichés and absurdity I couldn't help but cringe and fall asleep (literally, and I rarely fall asleep during movies, especially not action thrillers). The biggest groan from me came when Bourne looks at the blood on his hands and acts sad for all the people he's killed, in a pathetic, clichéd attempt at a three-dimensional character. <br/><br/>Why is it so hard to get a camera man that can keep the camera from shaking for more than 2 seconds? Even when Bourne is buying a newspaper, there are 20 cuts, zooms, and shakes! <br/><br/>The action and story takes suspension of disbelief to a whole new level. What a waste of time...The only reason it gets a star is for the scene where Bourne steals a cop car while the man who is after him distracts the police by shooting at him."
"crako1","7","19","33","5 August 2007"," Great Movie - but ENOUGH with the Shaky Cam!
","This is exactly the movie we wanted - lots of action, with Bourne 2-3 steps ahead of his adversaries at every turn. It answered most of the questions from the first two in the series, but left plenty of room in case they want to make an ongoing series of Bourne films.<br/><br/>But, good grief, what's with the shaky cam? I mean, it was a great day when they invented the steady cam, as it allowed the director to control what scenes are steady and what scenes are chaotic. But this movie uses 'shaky cam chaos' to illustrate how intelligence analysts sitting at their desks are working really hard. These aren't action scenes - for these scenes we need the actors to act, not to be blurry.<br/><br/>So here's the deal: Directors can use shaky cam for fight scenes, car chases, explosions and any kind of stunt. Stationary people, sitting at desks? No! People sitting at a table arguing? No! Really, a great movie - a 9, except for the ridiculous overuse of shaky cam. STOP THE MADNESS."
"zterrell","1","41","83","5 August 2007"," Ruined by the camera....again
","Okay, so the plot of the last Bourne was good -- who could see what was going on, unless you wanted to count the pock marks on the actor's faces. Paul filmed this one even worse. Why waste money on action sequences that no one can see? I despise film critics for encouraging this form of film degradation. They call it inspiring and cutting edge.. but it is crappy and amateurish, readily more disturbing than having a two-year-old sitting behind you and kicking the seat for the entire two hours. I've yet to meet anyone who liked the way either of these movies were filmed. I own the first Bourne and would loved to have had them all...but not if they are not even watchable. You'd do as well to catch the audio and listen to this on tape."
"stewardia","3","35","70","8 August 2007"," What can I say? It sucked.
","The first two Bourne movies did so many things right - excellent locations, acting, engaging characters, imaginative action.<br/><br/>Supremacy had many surprises. What was the last movie you saw that had a car chase through the narrow alleys of a coastal town in India? An on-foot pursuit through Berlin or ended with an over the top car chase in MOSCOW? But in Ultimatum we get few if any surprises. In Supremacy we learned that Abbott and Conklin were corrupt and used CIA money for their own gain. Abbott's downfall in Supremacy was a nice bit of acting and was developed very well. What do we learn about Landy in Ultimatum? ""This is not what I signed up for""? Next to nothing! The Noah Vosen character just shouts orders and looks incompetent. What an embarrassing role.<br/><br/>We learn nothing about Jason Bourne that we didn't know from the other two except maybe he was an old boyfriend of Nikki.<br/><br/>Beyond a couple of nicely shot scenes in London and Morocco, this movie is a tired failure and an utterly disappointing end to what was a successful series."
"acts755","1","35","70","3 August 2007"," Another Addition to the Summer of Bad Trilogies
","To begin, I want you all to know that I was excited to see this movie. I loved the first two Bourne movies and thought they got better as the stories carried on. With that said I would like to inform you that the third movie is about Jason Bourne, I know this is surprising but really guys. It is. ""This is Jason Bourne."" When sitting through the first half hour of this movie, I wouldn't be shocked if I heard that line repeated 20+ times. Holy redundancy! Okay. We get it. Jason Bourne is one guy you don't want to mess with. He shouldn't be chased or thought about unless you want your brain to spontaneously combust.<br/><br/>After the brilliantly creative writing in the first half hour, comes Paul Greengrass' idea to recreate the hand-held camera-work that makes it seem like you are in the middle of the action, as in the Bourne Supremacy, which I liked. Although, this time Greengrass put on his silly glasses and drank a 40 of whiskey then storyboarded all the shots for the movie or maybe Greengrass just told the camera operators to do the Riverdance while shooting the scenes. It's hard to tell what he was thinking but this lasts throughout the movie and becomes very sickening. Most of the time I felt like I couldn't even see what was happening on the screen.<br/><br/>Once I grabbed my doggy bag from the concessions area, I noticed the 3rd worst part of the movie. That is when Pamela Landy and Noah duke it out in the most annoying feud of people on the same team ever. If you want to watch two eight-year-old Nazis bicker with each other about toys or Jason Bourne, then enjoy. In case you forgot, Julia Stiles has a role in this movie. Wait. Not really. She starts to have a role in the movie and then her agent must have called her to start shooting for The Omen 2. I forgot how she is so busy with all the parts she has been taking lately and how it's good to have completely meaningless characters in movies. If you liked the resourcefulness of Bourne in the first 2 movies, you can throw that in the dumpster with this movie. A few examples are when he is riding a dirt bike away from the police, hits a curb with his front tire and the bike jumps onto a ledge five feet in the air or when he is playing bumper cars with a police car in rush hour traffic, then gets the car flipped onto a median that came from who knows where. While going probably 70+ mph and still sliding on the median, he grabs onto the seat belt holding onto dear life and ends up walking out of the crash with a few minor flesh wounds.<br/><br/>So in summary the movie is kind of like this: Good? Who could tell? It's like watching French fries crackle along with a spew of hot bubbles in the back of a McDonald's. Do the actors act? Again, you got me. Does it make sense? Ask the scriptwriters, they'd probably know. Does it give you a headache? Hmm, about the size of Rose O'Donnell's waist line. The Bourne Ultimatum is the Blair Witch Project meets Speed meets Matrix Revolutions meets the dumbest CIA and NSA agents ever. Truthfully, I would rather eat a bowl of steaming crap while watching Home Alone 3 and Super Mario Brothers at the same time."
"spacebug-3","1","25","48","6 October 2007"," I want to hit the director with a tripod.
","In every shot of this film the camera was jiggling around. Every shot! With the possible exception of a scene borrowed from the previous film.<br/><br/>On top of this, there were a lot of shots which were not very well focused. Since cameras automatically focus these days, they must have gone to quite an effort to film in this style.<br/><br/>In the action sequences, each camera shot lasts maybe 2 seconds maximum. The upshot is that every time there is an action shot you get half a second of out-of-focusness, then the shot gets brought into focus but the cameraman is jumping about (they must have got very fit filming this) so you get a vague impression of a person moving, and then on to the next shot - and it's out of focus again. Most of the major action sequences did not spend enough time looking at important events to let the audience realise what was happening. Very hard to follow! In a good film the audience should be totally absorbed in the story, at no point should they be aware of what the cameraman is doing. This film, you have to make an effort to get past the camera-work to figure out what is happening.<br/><br/>If the director had used a more traditional filming method my rating would be about 5 stars higher. The plot seemed to follow on along the same line as the previous films, Matt Damon got to hit people: good solid action movie stuff."
"alighthall2000","2","24","46","4 September 2007"," The Ultimate Atrocity
","What a bunch of fanboys. This film at 8.5? Incredible. I did give it two stars, 1) it did make it to theaters, 2) it did end. Finally. If you love the first two Bourne movies then see this one. Otherwise please stay away! <br/><br/>1. Monkey-cam. The incessant jerking of the camera is so annoying that I wasn't distracted by other moviegoers talking loudly. I guess the director felt it could cover up uninteresting chase sequences, lack of dialog, and create a false sense of suspense. Utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>2. The story is simply a rehash of Bourne 2. Once again, the CIA crosses swords with Bourne. Bourne runs around looking for the originators of Treadstone so he can know who he really is. They even throw in a new gal-pal for him to look heroic for. Nothing new here. Even the techniques he uses are old. Gee, never saw that whole ""look at 'em through a window while I talk to them routine"" before. There is no story or plot here. Its just Bourne being chased around the world(again) and finally, finally realizing that(surprise) he volunteered to be a brainwashed assassin!<br/><br/>3. Boring! When about 90% of the movie consists of chase and capture scenes, fight and flight, and the outcomes of all fights, chases, and surveillances are predetermined (hint: Bourne wins again) where is the suspense or drama? There is none. We know that Bourne can take on four armed men single-handedly. We know he is impervious to any serious injury. Without any meaningful dialog, or any real plot, this makes it hard to care about the main character at all. <br/><br/>4. It must be nice to...... -globe-trot and never be identified even though I don't wear any disguises -know intimately the layouts of any city or building I am in -be able to drive off a building and walk away -crash through a window and have no cuts or scratches to show for it -somehow remember enough of my training to kick ass but can't remember anything else worthwhile<br/><br/>Well, it could go on but why bother.

","The trend to use hand held cameras and deliberately keep the image in constant motion is a total annoyance, and the death knell of this movie. Any close up or emotional shot is so jittery, that it is practically unwatchable. Even the close up of items that the audience should read are done in 'shaky cam' mode. It's brutally bad work, overall. I do not need to be nauseated in my seat. Gawd, I miss stable tripods and smooth camera work. If this goes on, I can see why the movie industry is dropping audience support. One cannot focus on characters or story when the image is painful to the eye.

","This is an excellently written, well-plotted film, expertly acted.... and filmed by a 2 yr old monkey with a camera mounted on his head, who also suffers from arthritis and epilepsy.<br/><br/>Pros: Matt Damon turns in another expert acting job as Jason Bourne, the federal hit-man with no memories of his deeds or his origin. The fight scenes are amazingly well done (at least...I think they were) and Damon's portrayal of the capable, highly intelligent, yet befuddled Bourne is amazing to see (when you can).<br/><br/>David Straithairn shows up as a new character and his level of acting has never been better. Julia Stiles is at her best in this film. Joan Allen, Scott Glenn, and Albert Finney also show up and provide amazing stellar performances.<br/><br/>The plot is extremely well-laid out and the writing captures both the modern world and the HIGHLY imaginative view of espionage, CIA, and the NSA that Ludlum invents for Bourne. In short, perhaps the only danger in this film is that some people may actually come away believing the CIA and NSA actually have all these godlike abilities due to the talented writing.<br/><br/>Cons: I'm not joking about the monkey. This is, with the possible exception of Blair Witch Project, the worst filmed movie I have EVER seen. Every film I've ever seen was filmed better than this one from major motion pictures, indys, car commercials, local used car ads, porn, and things filmed by my dad on vacations.<br/><br/>When The Rock came out, I was particularly hard on Michael Bay for having the ""shakycam"" effect placed on every car chase to ""up"" the action level. Sadly, Bay still thinks this works and it becomes the only negative aspect of many other films like Transformers. If I cant see the action because you've made it into a blur, it doesn't have the same effect on me. This is not realism.<br/><br/>In this film, director Paul Greengrass takes this to a new level. We don't have the ""wandering realistic"" camera only in chases and fight scenes, now we have it throughout the entire film. Even in close ups of people you'd like people to see (like the ever attractive Julia Stiles), you cant see her for any more than a second or two because the camera has bounced all over the damn place as if its on a yo-yo or a pendulum.<br/><br/>A discussion between two characters, with no action value at all, in a quiet cafe, is filmed as if someone has handed the camera to a small child. This child was told to just ""hold the camera and point it at those two guys"" and meanwhile he's sucking on a lollipop and running around the table.<br/><br/>I have seen POV porn films that were filmed with more artistic integrity than this...and I HATE those things because of this very thing: You cant see anything. The first 30 minutes of the film were so painful for me to watch that I nearly left the theatre.....which would have been a shame, because whats happening in the film is so good.<br/><br/>My advice: Wait until it comes out on video and listen to the dialog from the kitchen. Its an amazing script."

I suppose Bourne Ultimata will continue to be made while people continue to view them, the moral is there for the taking avoid this genre and give quality a chance, some hope!That's like asking people to believe that Fast Food is bad for you, when, obviously millions of people like it, so, it must be good for you."

","I cannot understand why this average action film (and bellow average, if you consider film making in general) got such high marks! It's true I'm not an action films fan, but take this: Ronin is noted 7.1 and Nikita 7.5, only to take 2 masterpieces of the genre! I found it duller than the others of the series. The continuous chase and short cuts editing are the only techniques used at such an extent and so repetitive that I got bored from minute 2. Matt Damon is a fine and intelligent actor (see leading role in ""Good Will Hunting"", when he won also an Oscar for screenplay), but he had no chance of showing it in this movie."

","1 Hour and 56 minutes long. With a 1 hour and 50 minute chase scene. A foot chase, car chase, and a motorcycle chase. That is the whole movie. And then there is the camera work, I have seen better done by dear old dad with his Super 8 Bell & Howell at home. Yes, there is some acting, about six minutes worth. Remember Albert Finney, well that is the highlight of the film as far as true acting is concerned. To bad it is for only the tail end of the movie.

","The characters were not likable, the story was unnecessarily complicated by jumping all over the world constantly, there was a hand held camera for a good third of the film making action sequences boring blurs, and finally it had Matt Damon as the central character, his sour melancholy expression never changes (therefore there is no tension when he is genuinely in the state of mind which could support such an expression). It is hard to find the positives in this film. I will say that the action that can be made out is worth the watch but compared to the characters and plot of both Casino Royale and Die hard 4.0 this movie is definitely inferior. Keep your expectations low and it shouldn't be to painful."

Very disappointing, the director of photography Oliver Wood needs to go back to school and get a clue. Not everyone is a MTV junkie that is suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder.

","After being a huge fan of the first movie I rushed to see the second one. It was terrific despite being marred by too much hand-held camera work. I was hoping that installment #3 would keep the momentum of the plot while getting a better grip on the camera. Sadly, no. The plot pretty much evaporated and was entirely replaced with pointless action scenes which might have been exciting had they not looked like they'd been shot by a drunken epileptic. I spent over half of the movie with my hands over my eyes because the blurred and shaky images gave me extreme motion sickness. I spent a good portion of the movie plotting an exit strategy from the packed theater in case I should actually have to throw up.<br/><br/>From listening to it, I don't think I really missed that much. Nothing terribly earth shattering was revealed in this movie and it was pretty much one scene after another of Bourne having to kick someone's butt. Normally, this would not be a problem for an action movie- I don't expect high art in this kind of film- but I do expect to SEE and ENJOY the work the actors and stunt men went to in order to film the action scenes. The camera work here is so bad that all you can really see (if your stomach can bear it) is a big blur. What a waste of great action talent! One fight scene in particular (one which ends in a shower stall)was probably choreographed wonderfully, but I guess we'll never know for sure.<br/><br/>This was a sad and forgettable (as soon as possible preferably)end to what could have been an incredible trilogy. I recommend you skip this one and see instead ""The Shooter"" with Mark Wahlberg. It has a similar plot, lots of action and you can actually watch it without hurling."

The camera work reminds me of the Blair Witch Project; the screen is constantly shaking even on still scenes. When you have the misfortune to watch what should have been a great action scene, you can see nothing due to the viewing angle wildly waving around what you so fervently wish you could have seen. I actually had to look away from the screen on numerous occasions, I eventually settled on staring at my finger so I could at least see the movie in the background without my eyes hurting from vainly attempting to track the wobbling Bourne. Don't bother watching this unless they release a new version with camera work that at least doesn't give seizures to those who do not have epilepsy."

","The Bourne Ultimatum is the movie that should not have been made. Like most trilogies, it was made because the first two movies were such a success. I loved the first two, but hated this one. Now I must admit that the blood pumping action and good acting will be enough to distraction most viewers from the absolutely horrid storyline. This storyline was just an add on to the original story line. The original storyline that actually made some sort of sense ended with the Bourne Supremacy. The Bourne Ultimatum story line was just concocted to try to put together a third movie to make money. <br/><br/>The one thing that really bothers me about this movie is that Bourne is so supposed to be some sort of super spy that knows how to evade detection. He goes to unbelievable lengths to not be found and he never once thinks of changing his appearance! But other people with far less training immediately change their appearance to avoid detection. It is so inconsistent with the super spy character they are trying to make Bourne into that it flashes like a giant neon sign DUMB! DUMB! DUMB!. There are many other stupid thing that this supposed ""Super Spy"" does during is this movie that is so inconsistent with his super intelligent character that it makes you want to scream at the screen ""You Idiot!"".<br/><br/>The other thing that I hate about this movie is, the filmography of the chase and action scenes. They made it look like the camera men were mounted on galloping horses during chase scenes. This is just an old trick to try to make a chase scene appear more dramatic. All it did for me is make me sea sick. When you make a home movie, everybody complains if the camera shakes to much, but Hollywood camera men get paid millions to intentional shake the camera! Very unprofessional looking. This is not to mention that the rapid flash frame changes during action sequences that made think I was watching a low budget Japanese Anime cartoon. These cheap attempts at dramatization are totally unnecessary and were just added to distract you for realizing how bad the storyline stinks.<br/><br/>The bottom line here is that if you up are for a blood pumping action flick, this one will suite your needs. Just take a clothes pen to hold your nose so you won't smell how bad the storyline stinks."

","Some of the stunts are sensational and the movie never lets up from the moment it starts. However after about half-an-hour the restive hand-held camera-work and rapid fire editing become very wearing and you just long for a long lingering shot and some peace and quiet. Relentless hand-held camera filming just makes you feel nauseous after a while and adds nothing to the movie.The plot is really quite old-hat, somewhat reminiscent of many older movies with the so-called government good guys up to no good. Despite this, Bourne 3 is a cracking film with never a dull moment. The soundtrack is really good; Matt Damon is excellent as usual and Julia Stiles is gorgeous."

","It starts of very slowly, not showing that it will differ from the previous two instalments in the franchise, but when Bourne enters the London train terminal, all hell breaks out. <br/><br/>There is a short break in Madrid, and then the chase in Tangiers starts. For me, this is the best action scene in movie history. There have been many rooftop chases in movie history, but this one is truly incredible. Its simplicity, power, speed, suspense is unparallelled. The shaking camera, which a lot of people point out as the weak spot of the movie shows its true meaning in this scene, and i think it, alongside the incredible movie score, is its strong point. Of course, the screenplay, acting, directing, sound, picture, and not to forget the best stunts ever seen in a motion picture make this movie truly the best. <br/><br/>This movie is not more than a compilation of three huge action scenes put together with breaks in between, but that is why this movie is so brilliant."

","If you've watched the first two 'Bourne' movies, you'd enter the theater expecting to see thrilling and frenetic hide-and-seek games between the CIA and Jason Bourne - a game where CIA is always dumbfounded by Bourne's evasive skillsI walked into the movie hall with the same expectation along with hundreds of other Bourne fans and what we got was way better than we expected! To say in one line - Bourne Ultimatum is a superbly directed movie What I have always loved about Bourne movies is the simplicity  no high tech gadgetry, fancy looking objects/cars and distracting beauties which is also the fact why I don't prefer the Bond moviesWell back to Mr. 'IceCool' Bourne nowhere's the plot.<br/><br/>Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), a reporter has written an article about Jason Bourne (do I need to say who's playing Jason Bourne  'course Matt Damon) in a British newspaper, which, Jason reads and hence wants to meet Simon Ross to find his Simon's) source. This would help Jason know who he really is and the people behind his making  the making of the identity of Jason BourneCIA Deputy Directory, Noah Vosen (David Straithairn) and his team are after Simon Ross when Simon mentions the word ""BlackBriar"" while talking to his boss on cell phone. Jason and Simon meet at one of the busiest stations in London  Waterloo (one of my favorite scenes in the movie). CIA catches Bourne helping Ross on CCTVNoah Vosen calls upon the Bourne specialist  Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to their team for hunting down Bourne. and thus ensues a thrilling chase between CIA and Jason Bourne. <br/><br/>As always, the movie cuts back and forth between CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia and some remote corners of Europe and North Africa where Bourne is hidingrather running around for clues. The chases are well directed and entertaining. The one in Tangiers, Morocco is some chase as we are reminded of the super human skills and amazing fitness of one Mr Jason Bourne. Helping Jason Bourne this time is a CIA agent - Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles)The ending scene from Bourne Supremacy is linked up quite brilliantly in Bourne Ultimatum where Jason Bourne calls Pamela Landy. At the end of the call, she tells Jason Bourne, his real name and birth date. Only in Bourne Ultimatum do we realize what she said was not what she really meant in Bourne Supremacy! Believe me when you get it, you will be more than startledI won't spoil it by writing the 'startling' thing watch the movie for it. I am sure Bourne fans would come out of the theater, dazed and amazed. Just a recommendation  Watch ""Bourne Supremacy"" again before this one. It will add more to the entertainment factor. Rating 8.5/10 As for me, I am planning to see it one more time at least and also can't wait to lay my hands on the DVD Box set release of ""The Jason Bourne Collection"".<br/><br/>Till then! <br/><br/>Extreme ways are back again<br/><br/>Extreme places I didn't know<br/><br/>I broke everything new again<br/><br/>Everything that I'd owned<br/><br/>I threw it out the windows, came along<br/><br/>Extreme ways I know move apart<br/><br/>The colors of my sea<br/><br/>Perfect color me<br/><br/>---Extreme Ways - Moby (Sound track - Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, Bourne Ultimatum)"

","This is the first review i write on IMDb, but i just had to say how utterly disappointed i was with this movie's camera work. The shaky camera in each and every scene ruined the movie completely. I simply couldn't bare to watch the movie to the end, even though I'm a fan of action movies and Matt Damon, that's how much the camera ""work"" ruined the film. I have seen this shaking camera effect in another movie before (forgot the name), and it had the same effect: making it unwatchable.<br/><br/>What is the point of the shaky-cam when the viewers cant see what is going on in the action scenes and are distracted during the dialogues? What on earth makes the film makers decide to shake the camera at all, and in the Bourne case so excessively? Are they trying to hide the fact that they used some cheap effects or bad fight choreography? I don't know, cause I cant see! What a waste of a good film. Hope this hype about shaky-cam is soon over before it ruins more good movies."

Jason needs to use a computer - the camera is over his shoulder looking at what he is typing. But the god-d*mn camera pans to the left, then right and a little up and down.

","This movie has everything except good directing. Paul Greengrass, the director, mistakes (lots of) camera motion for action. He turned a great concept - the third in a series, with great actors, into a blurry, stomach-sickening, not-so-thrilling, roller-coaster ride. It is as if he did not trust his excellent cast to act and preferred instead to have the camera operators create the action - often during scenes that begged for a still camera.<br/><br/>This is really a shame, it reduced a potentially great movie into an OK film, but it succeeds marginally despite the direction and camera work, certainly not because of it. He is lucky that lots of kids like the motion or this film would not have been a success at the box office. If Greengrass continues down this road, I predict he will find early retirement on his agenda.<br/><br/>Watch it on a small screen if you are subject to motion sickness."

","The character of Jason Bourne and the previous two movies gave me high hopes that this too would be a film I'd enjoy watching. Boy was I wrong! Reasons? Here goes: <br/><br/>#1.The dialogue. On Bourne's side it was OK but the CIA Deputy director kept asking for the assassin to be sent in every 3 lines. The rest of the time he was barking at his staff. In an effort to make him seem a power crazed man they ended up making him sound repetitive. Maybe it was David Strathairn's take on the character, maybe the director kept shouting at him for more anger and hysteria. God knows. I'd have imagined him as a cold and calculated man, truly convinced that what he was doing was for the greater good but it's easy for me to tinker once I've seen the finished product. And what's with this obsession of having every bit of information blown up on screen 1? I must have heard that line at least 3 times.<br/><br/>#2. The extras. I couldn't help but notice most of the staff in that CIA war-room weren't doing much. You had your basic *guy-at-the-computer* guy and few others around him plus you *girl-with-the-files* girl all of them hunched over keypads. Every once in a while after a hysteric order from their chief they'd look up. Thrilling.<br/><br/>#3. The shaking camera. Some people think it's cinematic art. I agree but I still got a bit nauseous. <br/><br/>#4. The advertisements. All the bad but efficient guys had a Motorola. Hmmm. And the car that took the most hits and kept going was a Dacia Logan.

Try it, try listening to people talking (or not talking like Bourne's latest love connection). A total lack of effort went into the stuff that people are supposed to expel from their mouths.<br/><br/>Bourne himself is some kind of super human being. He can fall 20 feet backward and get up, Terminator style, and continue on with his mission. If he is so omnipotent, how can his character progress? Oh, by pursuing his past. Right, that will be a hoot to watch.<br/><br/>The music is completely inappropriate and monotonous. Here's a clue stick: if you are looping the same stuff for most of the movie then yank all of it out and throw it in the trash. This is supposed to be a spy movie. You know, intrigue? Suspense? Well, if there was any of that, it could stand on its own without ""suspense music"". It reminded me of the stuff ESPN plays when they show basketball highlights -- absurd and harmful to the main task.<br/><br/>Damon is the only redeeming actor. In other words, given how horrendous the script is, he was the only one to somehow break free from its considerable suction.<br/><br/>This movie belongs in the IMDb Bottom 250 for its dialog and shaky cam.

"BBB","2","14","26","14 August 2007"," So bad that five people walked out of the theater
","The Bourne Ultimatum is only the third movie I've ever walked out on in my life and, in fact, four other people in the small, weekday matinée audience walked out before I did.<br/><br/>The movie begins with an endless series of the same cookie-cutter sequences we've seen in the first two movies. Intelligence agency suits being briefed while an aide runs after them, watching them as they pace and recite clichéd lines like ""We need cameras, people"", ""Tap his line, people"", ""Why aren't we following him, people."" You could edit these scenes interchangeably between all 3 movies and not tell which scenes belong to which film.<br/><br/>One of the first major plot devices is that this post-9/11, super-CIA agency, which can apparently tap into any security camera in the world, is caught off guard by Bourne's use of an obscure, cutting-edge piece of technology known as the ""prepaid phone"". The mega-intelligence agency with unlimited funds and a license to kill is confounded by this! It would be one thing if Vosen, the CIA mastermind character, snapped his fingers and said ""Damn, of course, he's using an untraceable phone"" but the guy practically double-takes and says ""a prepaid what??"" as if the audience is to believe this is some incredibly ingenious spy trick. And of course, this comes after Bourne foils their wiretapping of the London newspaper by calling the reporter on another reporter's phone. Guess the security budget didn't allow them to tap the whole office? OK, so the rave reviews for this movie never claimed it was a *clever* thriller, I say to myself. It's being billed as the best action movie in years, maybe I should take it as that.<br/><br/>A blurry view of an assassination and close-quarters combat scenes shot so tightly, in such dark shadows, with such choppy editing and shaky filming that you can't even see what's going on. I guess the audience is meant to fill in the scenes with their imagination rather than actually seeing the Jason character put down the brilliantly choreographed fight moves that made the first two movies enjoyable? If these are the action elements of the movie, it just does not work as an action movie.<br/><br/>By the time Jason got to Madrid and more of the numerous cell phone call scenes played out, I predicted what was coming next. Jason yells ""No no it's a trap"", the bomb goes off, Jason hits the deck, and rather than meeting with his contact and learning the truth of his identity, which of course would end the movie early, we move on to the next unoriginal spy movie sequence. One flat, boring, car explosion later, this predictable scene had played out exactly as I saw it coming. I grabbed my hat and became person #5 to walk out of the theater.<br/><br/>Some might argue that I missed a dynamite second half of the movie, that the action or the plot became better in the following hour. Whether that's true or not, it could not possibly make up for the first hour. And the audience shouldn't have to pay for it by being forced to sit through the repetitive, intelligence-insulting, meat grinder movie-making of The Bourne Ultimatum's first half. The fact that this movie has been so highly rated by so many baffles me as much as a prepaid cell baffles Noah Vosen and the CIA."
"rmax304823","2","6","9","6 September 2008"," The Dregs.
","Great cast -- Matt Damon, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, David Strathairn -- wasted in this commercial piece of egregious offal.<br/><br/>The original in this franchise, ""The Bourne Identity"", was a fascinating and brutal action movie with a genuine engine behind the plot. Just who IS Jason Bourne? Well, as it turns out, Bourne (Damon) is a failed CIA assassin who, having failed in an illegal enterprise and having become an amnesic, is a loose cannon that the CIA must destroy. (It's not the CIA, of course. It's some internal cabal. It's the INS or the IRS or the ABC or CNN or STD.) Lots of high-tech stuff and a good deal of splendidly realized action. Damon not only escapes from the agents of his former employer, he solves the question that has driven him.<br/><br/>The sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"", was a partial-birth abortion not only written to cash in on the commercial success of the original but directed in an unspeakably ill-conceived manner.<br/><br/>This one is, if possible, worse than the previous installment. The MGM is still trying to kill Matt Damon but for no good reason. ""As far as I'm concerned, he's still a risk,"" intones Scott Glenn, bad guy. There have been a hundred movies in the past two decades in which an entire regiment of evildoers pursues one action superhero who outwits and out-muscles them at every turn. Everybody has seen one or another version of ""Rambo"".<br/><br/>This is an insult to the presumed intelligence of the American people. Near the beginning, there is a wide-angled aerial shot of the Arch of Triumph in the center of Paris, one of the city's three or four immediately recognizable landmarks. Then a caption inform us of the location -- ""Paris."" Not only that, but ""Paris, France."" Just so you don't get confused and think it's a postcard of Paris, New Jersey, or Las Vegas (NEVADA).<br/><br/>There is a superabundance of action. People beat the crap out of one another. If that's what you're looking for, you'll find it here, pointless though it is. The score, however, is a copy of the effective original.<br/><br/>I can't for the life of me understand why the director decided to follow the model set by the sequel, instead of that of the original, which was better in all respects.<br/><br/>Every shot in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" seems to use a hand-held camera. And the camera wobbles all over the place as if held by a man suffering from a volcanic hangover. When Bourne first meets a possible friend in a café, near the opening, the shots are done in reverse angle, meaning when Damon speaks we watch him over the other guy's shoulder, and when the other guy speaks we look over Damon's shoulder. But here the camera roves and meanders. I've seen more professional camera work in home videos by high school kids. At one point the image of the other speakers blocks out all of Damon's face but his nose and mouth. In a later shot, the camera sinks so low and moves so excessively laterally that, instead of an over-the-shoulder shot, the image we see is a behind-the-neck shot because Damon's face is entirely obscured. Let me repeat that. A conversation is taking place between two men and the screen is filled with the shivering image of the back of one of their heads. I mean that literally.<br/><br/>I couldn't finish watching this. I was in fear for the well-being of my visual cortex, not to mention my frontal lobes. But the user ratings are high enough to suggest that this is satisfying somebody's appetite for something. I won't try to guess what appetite that is, but can I ask one question? Guys, did you see the original? You know, ""The Bourne Identity""?"

Actually when we were watching the Bourne Ultimatum last week, we were quite amused by predicting the plot and guessing how certain scenes from Conspiracy Theory were almost copied into Bourne Ultimatum... <br/><br/>OK, Bourne ULtimatum comes with more special effects in line with nowadays cinema, has more depth because it has the opportunity to tell the story over 3 movies, and certainly is superior in directing, editing and camera work. On the contrary the interpretation of the character of Jerry Fletcher by Mel Gibson, is at least equal as strong to Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, maybe even slightly superior towards the end.<br/><br/>Maybe others have noticed the same, and maybe there is a logical explanation behind the resemblance, I'm glad to find out because so far I couldn't find any articles about it.<br/><br/>Bottomline is that both are excellent movies and talk about how far a government can go in the interests of national security."

This was the first clue as to whether the third installment of this series would return to it's superior beginnings (The Bourne Identity) or continue in the ridiculously over the top style of the Bourne Supremacy. When the editing of a movie takes center stage over story, acting, and every other element, this is what you get; a relentless roller coaster ride that defies common sense, emotion, wonder or anything else, because it's moving so fast all you can do is hang on and wait until it's over. For adrenal junkies this is just the ticket to pound you into submission. Don't expect anything else and you may enjoy this film more. I own Bourne Identity, and have watched it many times, and each time it is enjoyable. That is not the case with either the Bourne Supremacy or Ultimatum. Once was more than enough. Cutting a film so that no shot lasts more than 1/2 second may get your heart pounding, but it does little else.

","The Bourne Ultimatum concludes the trilogy that started with Bourne Identity in which a man (Jason, the eponymous Bourne), shot and left for dead in the sea, found himself unable to remember who he was, and so started a quest to find and recover his lost identity, as well as to discover his own past and attempt to remedy the wrong done. Thus began a thrilling series which featured relentless action and frenetic chase scenes that covered three continents and which, once started, never let go of you as a viewer. <br/><br/>The Bournd Ultimatum is to my mind the best of three, it features some of the best action sequences seen, for example, the tight, well-paced, and supremely well-done scene at the Waterloo station. It brings a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy that leaves you exalted, but still somewhat saddened at the journey he had to undertake, his discovery and the cost to him. If I want to nit-pick, I'd say that the Tangier chase and fight scenes went on just a little too long, and the relationship between Nicky and Jason was never fully explained. The Bourne Supremacy is I think the weakest of the three, primarily because of the sheer illogicality of the plot - if Abbott (Brian Cox) had a secret so grave that he would kill his own man and himself over it, then surely he would have killed Jason Bourne when he have the chance to do so in the first film. It does, however, feature the best car chase sequence (the Moscow one) I have ever seen. Many people have complained about the shaky camera technique, but apart from a couple of moments which I found irritating in Bourne Supremacy, it had worked pretty well in general, especially in the Waterloo scene as it heightened the confusion, agitation and tension of the moment. <br/><br/>If we want to see the point of the film, it is what Jason Bourne said to the Paz who asked him why Bourne didn't shoot him when he can - ""Look at us. Look at what they make you give."", echoing the same words said by the dying Professor in Bourne Identity (a rather nice link back to the first film). He was asking Paz to reflect on what he has given (his whole life, his own judgement, and above all, his humanity) for the cause he has undertaken, the unquestioned surrender of his self to a higher power to be used as it so wished, and implicit in it a question if this is the right thing to do. Bourne himself discovered the limits of how far he can sacrifice his humanity when, at the assassination attempt of Wombosi, he was faced with having to kill the children (since there must be no survivors who can bear witness to Wombosi's killing). This, he decided, he would not give, and is what ultimately saved him as a person even if his hesitation nearly cost him his life.<br/><br/>Some may read the film as a very specific (and I think, very parochial) attack on the CIA, however, I would see this as of more general relevance to someone in the service of any organisation (perhaps a governmental or secret service one on one side, or a terrorist organisation on the other) that demands certain sacrifice of their humanity for what they do. Read the terrible events in the news that occurred regularly all over the world (perhaps another bombing in Iraq, or Burmese soldiers killing monks) and wondered perhaps if the ones who perpetrated the dreadful deeds at the behest of their organisation would just reflect on this - ""Look at what they make you give""? <br/><br/>The film also questions whether any organisation, given untrammelled power, would exercise their power in a responsible way. And if you are prepared to give your all to that organisation, would your trust be abused?<br/><br/>But let's not get too carried away with philosophising. This film is, ultimately, an action-packed entertaining film, and as such, it is a great success. It is a fitting end to the Bourne stories, but, do I want another one? Well, perhaps yes. There is the risk any new film may ruin what is a near-perfect series, but I think these three will stand on their own as a discrete trilogy, and anything else will be a bonus."

","I loved this movie...EXCEPT, the camera work. I get that the shaky hand held stuff is supposed to add to the action. But COME ON. The whole freaking movie?? You couldn't even tell what was going on in the fight and car chase scenes. It got old FAST. A really good movie becomes hard to watch. Too bad. I would rave about the movie if it weren't for the motion sickness induced by the camera work. I have two words to the producers of this movie: STEADY CAM. And one more word: Moderation. The story was good, the action was good (of what you could make out from all that shaky cam crap) The acting was good. It leaves you wanting more. (story, not shaky cam) Have I said how much I hated the camera work? It was like Blair Witch with fights and guns. If you can look beyond that it is really enjoyable. Maybe I won't feel the need to puke watching it on DVD when it comes out."

","The Jason Bourne films with Matt Damon in them succeed where the current James Bond films fail. While Daniel Craig's sociopath Bond wallows in self loathing and psychopathy, the emotional sub plot in the Jason Bourne films are direct, focused and sensible.<br/><br/>It makes sense for a man that has lost his memory to desperately try and figure out who he is, even without highly trained assassins dogging his every move. Throughout the series, he attempts to make amends for his nefarious espionage past and in doing so, blazes a path toward redemption. Having read two of the originals books this series is based upon, I can say that the Jason Bourne character is actually better fleshed out in the films and no doubt intellectual actor Matt Damon had a lot to do with that. This is an excellent action espionage series of films."

","The Bourne Identity (2002) was a great introduction to the series. Then came The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and it wasn't as good as the first one, not unusual for a sequel. Then came The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) as part of a trilogy. Due to my let down from the sequel, I really expected this third installment to be even worse. Well, I was very wrong. So wrong in fact, that this one was the best of them all! It was refreshing to see some back-story details that complimented the first two films. This one was perfect, and a perfect 10/10 from me!"
"SquigglyCrunch","8","2","2","24 October 2016"," Best of the Original Trilogy
","The Bourne Ultimatum follows Jason Bourne as he sets out to uncover the last of the memories he lost, and is ultimately pursued, yet again, by the CIA. <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. After the first two, which upon a re-watch weren't exactly the classics I thought they were, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is great in this movie. He really steps it up a notch from the last two movies, and makes what should have been his finale as Bourne something to remember. The rest of the performances are pretty great as well. They aren't amazing, but this is by far the best acted movie of the original trilogy. <br/><br/>The story itself is interesting and fun. It's simple enough to understand pretty easily, but it's complicated enough for it to be clear that there was a fair bit of effort put in. <br/><br/>Jason Bourne's character is much more fun to watch in this movie. He knows what he's doing, he's well-rehearsed, and it's just awesome to see how he knows exactly what to do, whether it's hand-to-hand combat or hiding someone in a crowd of people. It's all very cool, and despite the fact that I'm pretty sure I knew the outcome of the whole film, it was an intense movie to watch. <br/><br/>The action scenes were pretty intense, and a lot of fun to watch. There was a lot of shaky cam, yet again, which got on my nerves, but the good choreography shines through well enough to make them both engaging and fast-paced. <br/><br/>As for things I didn't like, the cameraman doesn't know how to hold his equipment still. Right from the get-go scenes that would be better off not shaky are, like conferences and the such. They aren't intense, so stop moving the camera so much. It was actually kind of nauseating to watch, but after the first little bit I got used to it. It's not unbearable, but it was kind of frustrating. <br/><br/>Another thing is that the movie is much of the same. It follows something of a formula: something happens, CIA gets excited, Jason Bourne comes and goes, CIA gets mad and tries again. That's basically the entire movie recycled a couple times. While it isn't really a bad thing, it's still noticeable enough to be bothersome. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the Bourne Ultimatum. It has it's share of flaws, but they're minuscule enough not to hinder the movie too much. In the end I would recommend this movie."
"Semisonic","9","2","2","27 August 2016"," Jason Bourne's highest point
","How many movie trilogies do you know that don't go south towards the end? The answer is, even aside of the spy movie genre there aren't too many, and all of them are classics. Now, Matt Damon & Co made that list one item longer.<br/><br/>True, there's not that big of a competition in this genre, for the spy film franchises that take themselves seriously and live long enough are so rare that you could count them by one hand's fingers. There's James Bond, there's Ethan Hunt, and there's another JB now. But Mission Impossible has long transcended that line beyond which the laws of reality don't apply. As for James Bond, it's a phoenix that can only live on by burning up at the end of its every incarnation, and Spectre was a perfect example of such pyre. Yet, Jason Bourne managed to walk that line between carnal ashes and mythification and do it with flying colors.<br/><br/>The first group of people we should thank for that remarkable achievement is the screenwriters. The spy thrillers are only as good as their story, and when the story bends under scrutiny, the whole movie goes down. In that aspect, the Jason Bourne trilogy was played brilliantly, with enough loose ends to keep us involved throughout the three-act story and with enough wit to tie them up in a single convergence point towards the finale. The second film might have dragged a bit and has gone over the top a few times (the unbelievable yellow taxi car chase being one of them), but it was worth the amazing two-point transition into the third film that not just redefined the meaning of the second film's ending but also gave us a new angle to look at the main character at. Such things don't happen occasionally, that's an intentional masterpiece, something I simply can't help admiring.<br/><br/>And of course there's Matt Damon. Now, in 2016, we know him as a big star. And of course he was already a star in 2002, for his role in Good Will Hunting was not to ignore. Yet it seems that it's Jason Bourne that really made Mr Damon who he is today, a solid all-round performer who's able to bring a deep emotional charge into a whirlwind of action.<br/><br/>Speaking of action, it alone could earn the JB trilogy a place among the titans of the genre. The fight scenes and the chases are what make these movies hold their viewers at the edge of the seat, and no shaky camera or rapid cuts could deprive them of the sense of true realism that such action monsters as Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious tend to lack these days. Even though Mr Bourne manages to dispatch his opponents without seemingly breaking a sweat (and definitely without breaking anything more vital), he still looks and feels like a human being who's not deathproof but simply trained enough to outplay it.<br/><br/>Even though the producers' greed made them try to capitalize on the JB success (which they failed at, it seems) and release a totally disposable spin-off movie, it doesn't at all reduce the trilogy's value, making The Bourne Ultimatum a Skyfall of its franchise, but without the disgrace of Spectre. The phoenix didn't burn down, it just flew away to its own lost paradise. Off the grid, exactly where Jason Bourne had wished to stay."

","To some, shaky-cam has become synonymous with low quality. But not the way Paul Greengrass does is. The director doesn't just do shaky-cam--he masters it. Every single movement is perfected and deliberate so that during fight scenes, we still know exactly what's happening all while getting the feeling that we're involved.<br/><br/>The pacing is pretty much perfect in the third installment of the spy-thriller series. We pick up weeks after the events of its predecessor, and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still trying to figure out his forgotten past. The secret CIA program which was once called Operation Treadstone is essentially the same, except operating under the name of Blackbriar.<br/><br/>Dipping and dodging different assassins, Bourne is one step closer to finding out how he became an important piece in all this. But this time, there's more desperation. More urgency. He knows he could be dead at any moment and possibly should have been dead already. But he's not and he doesn't know how much longer he can cheat death. We feel it too. We want him to find everything out before he gets killed.<br/><br/>It's this energy that runs all through The Bourne Ultimatum that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.<br/><br/>Bourne's character depth doesn't really progress anywhere from the last film, but we don't really feel like it needs to. He doesn't say much, but we can read his thoughts much of the time.<br/><br/>In the end, we're relieved, but not necessarily satisfied. There is still more to be found out. Although in the moment, we aren't aware that there will be more sequels to come. We just hope that there are.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 95"
"secondtake","8","2","2","17 July 2014"," A solid spy vs spy plot, intense acting, but mostly just stellar stellar filmmaking!
","The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)<br/><br/>The best of the big three Bourne movies. A have a soft spot for the first one because it was ""first"" and it brought out the basic ideas fresh and with some grit and invention (as in the opening scenes). By comparison the plot here, the narrative, is actually more of the same, another spy movie.<br/><br/>But so incredibly well done it's riveting. There are fight scenes and car chases, plenty and then some, but there is a lot of really intelligent pursuit on another level, on foot, not only of Bourne but of a couple of his accomplices. The camera then becomes a player, and the action, though fast, is absolutely vivid and discernible. There's no exaggerating the power of this kind of chase, as if you are there, first in London and then in Tangiers.<br/><br/>It helps slightly if you've seen the first two movies, because a lot of the movie is out to ""explain"" the mystery of this creation, this killing machine named Jason Bourne. Of course, this is a machine with a conscience, and his struggle for memory, and for self, is the soul of the movie. In this third installment he has some help, and some unexplained old feelings with, a woman in a pale echo of the first movie with Marie (who is mentioned many times here). And this helps give the movie feeling.<br/><br/>There is a ton written about these movies, and about Robert Ludlum's three books that are the core of the plots here (for deviations, see the internet). Note there is no fourth book, and the fourth ""Bourne"" movie—""Legacy""— is a decent wannabe without Damon and also without Bourne (as a character). The efforts of original director (Doug Liman) for ""The Bourne Identity"" aren't to be underestimated, but it is partly his cameraman, Oliver Wood, who makes the movie delirious and rich. And when the director was changed to Paul Greengrass for the 2nd and 3rd movies, Wood was retained, and he helps (along with the actors) give the movies coherence. <br/><br/>Greengrass earns his own kudos, though, for after doing a creditable but routine (and extremely kinetic) 2nd movie, pulls off this bit of movie-making masterwork. It's really something to study. It's a Hollywood piece of crap on some levels, of course, with lots of effects and a plot that isn't going to win awards for creativity. But it's so well done, and with enough touches of genuine human intensity, it works. It really works. See it even if you doubt it. And if you like this kind of movie, then you've already seen it.<br/><br/>So see it again. I did. It holds up great the second time."

","He now has a name, an identity, some memories and a a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but still, they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built. Now he wants some explanation, and to get ride of the people how made him what he is. Yeah, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he 's here with a vengeance.<br/><br/>OK, this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world, but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like every Hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's, ""The Bourne Suprematy"" is a super-heroes story. Jason Bourne is a Captain-America project-like, who's gone completely wrong. In the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one. He now fights against what he considers like evil, after a person close to him has been killed (his girlfriend in ""Suprematy"") by them. That's all a part of the super-hero story, including a character with (realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible) super powers.<br/><br/>And the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world (there's no frontiers in the Bourne's movies, characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of ""24"", an American enemy, who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him. Funny how ""mad patriots"" are now the N.1 enemies of paranoiac Hollywood's stories.<br/><br/>Beside all those interesting thematics, the movie isn't flawless : the feminine character of Nickie Parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes. But all that doesn't really matter, for ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is an action movie. And the action scenes are rather impressive.<br/><br/>Everyone here is talking about the ""Waterloo scene"" and the ""Tanger pursuit"" and everyone's right. I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tanger, that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of Tsui Hark. Visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on American's contemporary thematics : ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick."

","That's rightI said it! I would like to have ½ the money back that I spent on my admission ticket for the Bourne Ult. I was only able to see ½ the action scenesand that is the reason for seeing Bourne anything! Why does the new wave of directors in Hollywood assume that we want to be dragged along after a bouncing, jiggling cameraman? I THINK the action scenes and stunts must have been outstanding, but who really knows? I have heard it said so many times, that this new way of filming action sequences is to give the viewer the feeling that they are in the movie, running or riding with the action hero. Word to the wisewhen I am running, I can still see where I am running!!! When I am driving, I can still see where I am driving!!! This film was without a doubt the worst of the new wave of action movies in delivering scenes that simply could not be made out at all. What a waste of Matt Damon and any of the other men involved in these scenes. Advice to the directorif you are going to continue with slop like thisjust animate it and save some of the money spent on actor's salaries. The whole point of seeing the Bourne movies is to see Matt Damon kick some butt! Some of these stunts and action scenes were so bad, I turned to my sister and said, ""Let me know who wins, will yaI think Uncle Wally filmed this at the last reunion."" (C'mon we all have the one uncle who insists on using the video cam and leaves us all with a nauseating, bouncing, jarring film of just the top of people's heads!) Sorry to admit, I am nearly 40 and grew up in the BIG action movie erathe Rambos, Lethal Weapons, Die Hards, etc. If they could make amazing actions scenes, in which you knew that the actor was still in the scene, then why not now? The directors knew how to squeeze every last ounce of action out of their actors back then and they knew how to share it with the audience.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film lives up to the Bourne collection: Matt Damon is excellent, Julie Stiles is lovely (although their conversations consist mostly of sentences left hanging without managing to be intriguing) and of course, Joan Allenfantastic! Great continuation of the story and plot. I look forward to part 4 if there will be one, and can only hope that another director will make it."

","OK, I know I'm swimming against the current here. Everyone seems to love the trilogy but I have really struggled. I'm not averse to action thrillers. I have the ability to switch off and enjoy the ride but ... with Bourne I found that remarkably difficult. The film takes itself very seriously. This is, for me, presented as a 'thinking man's' film. Bourne is a man with a conscience and a mission. He is serious and deadly. Yet repeatedly I find my intelligence being insulted by silly little things and I became more and more frustrated through the film. Julia Stiles' reluctance to speak for example or the fact that the asset at the end of the film suddenly seemed to forget his hard-wired training and probably went home to re-evaluate his life following Bourne's little speech.

I was anxious to see the third - this one - but delayed my viewing because I had heard this film was very anti-American. However, I finally got around to seeing it, deciding to make up my own mind.<br/><br/>Frankly, I didn't find the politics much more Liberal than the other two, so that didn't bother me.....but overall, it just wasn't that good a movie. Looking at some of the other reviews here, I guess I am not alone. I agree with all those who said watching this film can give you a headache. The director here upped the amount of scenes with the hand-held camera and shook it horizontally and vertically during all the action scenes. It ridiculous; literally hard on the eyes....and I normally can put up it, but there were a few times I had to look away for a few seconds to give my eyes a rest, and that took away from the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The other two things that disappointed me was there was really nothing new regarding the story except for the ending. The rest of it was the same things I had seen in the first two films. Worse, the credibility in the action scenes was zero. As usual, Hollywood takes things to excess. Now, Bourne isn't just a great fighter and survivor: he's Superman and Rambo rolled into one! He eludes not one but several entire city police forces after him, both on the run manually or in vehicles (car or motorbike). That part is a real insult to anyone's intelligence. It makes the film look dumb.<br/><br/>Two other leading characters also were stupid and annoying. We get the usual PC woman-is-better-than man angle with Joan Allen's character more honest, compassion and smart than the cliché corrupt male government worker, played by the moronic-voiced David Strathairn.<br/><br/>With Liberal icons like Straithairn, Allen, Matt Damon and Julia Stiles I expected more propaganda, although it was there more than you think, just more subtly. For instance, the American flag was always prominently shown in a negative way in the film and the TV networks getting a couple of plugs each were CNN and MSNBC. There was no Fox News shown. Gosh, what a shock! Overall, they should have added 20 minutes to the last film and had Bourne find his true identity there.....thereby not wasting everyone's time with this headache-producer."

The books were great and the movies should have been winners. The first film was a major success and set the stage for the series. Then what happened? Some goose went and put Greengrass in charge of the next two films. What we got was fast editing and someone shaking a camera (I was told by a friend that the camera was in a blender). I found during the film that I was expending so much effort trying to adjust to the shaking camera and fast editing and was not able to enjoy some of the action scenes. If you have seen The Bill on TV then you will be aware that a hand-held camera can be used if it is done well. But Greengrass seems determined to be remembered as the person who shook the hand-held camera more than anyone else. What can I say, anyone but Greengrass.

Then when Jason Bourne is sitting completely still on a couch opposite another character and the camera is shaking all over the place just for the sake of shaking, I started to laugh out loud.<br/><br/>This is a sad example of a movie that is so stylized that the camera work is distracting. I do like hand-held work when it is done well (i.e. Children of Men). But I do not like it when it is does to the point that: 1) I can't always tell what is going on, 2) I get distracted by it and pulled out of the story because I am well aware a camera is capturing all of it, and 3) Even in still, calm moments the camera is shaking all over the place.<br/><br/>I'm being generous when I give this a 6. I give it a 6 only because Matt Damon is superb as Jason Bourne and the story/writing is good. Also, there are two action sequences that have good suspense and fantastic stunts/fight scenes despite the poor camera work  the train station & the chase involving Julia Stiles.

There were too many plot holes, many of them huge, to make suspension of disbelief possible and the over-the-top stunts and ""Superman"" quality of the protagonist were just boringly predictably. <br/><br/>This move really came across as a James Bond try hard - the big difference being that that franchise is over-the-top in a humorous and tongue-in-cheek way - not taking itself far too seriously like this movie.

This film on it's own doesn't bear well to scrutiny as a stand-alone movie.<br/><br/>Once again we're following spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, still looking 12 years old in certain scenes). He seems to be having flashbacks about who he really is (come on, be honest - do we really care?) and the memories seem to be coming back in floods.<br/><br/>Such is the premise of the film and what I laughingly refer as ""the plot"" is wafer thin.<br/><br/>Anyway the CIA are wandering around the world,waving guns in the street without ever getting shot by the local police forces (I think the scene of them getting arrested in Turin should have turned into a shoot-out as they'd already been told shots were fired). A case of Hollywood saying we (Americans) rule the world and can do what we like anywhere on the planet.<br/><br/>Get stuffed, you'd be killed by the local police if there were even an iota of realism in this film. Especially in London.<br/><br/>Anyway, Bourne happily roves around the world (never being caught at any borders, despite the fact the CIA are looking for him. And just HOW did he even get into America?), a passport of his is noticed as he enters Morocco (HOW? The agent very clearly says it had NEVER been on the grid so how did they catch it?).<br/><br/>He is even stupid enough to contact the CIA and mental enough to enter the building (how DID he manage that, by the way?) to rob some documents to allow him to work out the final bits in his identity mystery.<br/><br/>The film rolls from action sequence to lull to action sequence . The music is the main factor in keeping suspense and interest.<br/><br/>Generally the film is quite bad. Best avoided I think, hopefully it will be the last Bourne film."

","When Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) contacts the British reporter of The Guardian Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) that is researching the Operation Blackbriar that superseded the Project Treadstone to find out a clue to lead to his true identity, he is chased by CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), who wants to eliminate him. Jason is chased in Moscow, Paris, Madrid, London and Tangier, and while fighting to survive, he is supported by Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).<br/><br/>""The Bourne Ultimatum"" completes the trilogy of the Bourne saga to find out his own identity with golden key, with an above average conclusion. However, this movie is totally overrated since it does not deserve to be in IMDb Top 250. Most of the breathless action scenes are frantic, but awfully cut and edited like in a video clip; the sequences last a few seconds only, making very difficult to follow what is happening. It is also funny to see the efficiency and the apparatuses used by CIA in blockbuster movies, absolutely contradictory with reality. Anyway cinema is fiction and action movies must be liars and exaggerated to work. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Ultimato Bourne"" (""The Bourne Ultimatum"")"

For me there was about ten minutes of gripping dialogue, all between Bourne and Pam Landry, well written yes, did it move the action you bet, was anyone running, well in the background they were going berserk, but the dialogue just took a nice leisurely pace and was stunning.

","Along with the rest of the fans, I loved this movie. I wouldn't say it's the best of the three, but it's right up there. The one distracting factor was the way they shot most of the scenes. While critics give high accolades for the hand-held camera shoots, I found it a bit nauseous and it actually took away from the film...for me. Likewise the way David Webb just shot the masked man was disturbing. I didn't quite understand if he was going to lose his identity because of voluntary brainwashing, or if by killing people assigned to him, eventually he chose to become one of his identities.

It's nowhere near good enough to be anywhere near the top-250.<br/><br/>It's an exciting action-movie with a half-way coherent plot, which is rare enough in itself. But it's far from perfect. The assassins Bourne runs from are faceless and therefore not particularly scary or threatening.<br/><br/>The basic plot about Blackbriar is not fleshed out enough; not explained well enough; we don't hear how it came about in the first place. Was it illegal or government-authorized? The plot reminded way too much of the second movie's plot; culminating in the exact same thing, with a confrontation with a bad guy played by an elderly British actor. Finney even looked almost exactly like Cox, sans the beard.

"Galina_movie_fan","9","10","19","12 August 2007"," The Long and Winding Road Home
","The third movie in the series of the CIA amnesiac super agent, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is as dynamic, fast-moving, filled with the first class chase sequences, and never-stopping tension as the first two movies. All three movies make a very exiting trilogy and also manage to tell something very important on the subject of the honorable goals that not always justify the means. This time, Jason Bourne is set to find out how, when, and where it all started for him. He wants to remember all, he wants to know what the flashbacks that keep coming back mean and by doing so, he once again becomes a danger to CIA. The agency made him a part of a special top-secret program ""Blackbriar"" which had created a perfect killing machine, a super assassin out of him. Now, he presents an imminent danger for CIA's director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) who had approved the program and for Noah Vosen (David Strathairn, excellent as usual), the chief of department's division of top secret operations. Vosen does not hate Bourne personally. He knows that Bourne is as a treat for the agency and has to be eliminated and he would use all possible high-tech devices and techniques as well as ruthless manipulation to trace him see him dead. Bourne also has allies inside CIA, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (grown up Julia Stiles has just a few words in the script but the close ups of her face that changed emotions and feelings so vividly made her character compelling and memorable.) <br/><br/>A lot has been said about Paul Greengrass's (""United 93,"" ""Bourne Supremacy"") directing and his use of fast cuts and an unsteady camera. I found his approach competent, appropriate and fully justified. In the film packed with suspense and thrills, at least two chase scenes are perfect and breathtaking. The long scene in London Waterloo station where Bourne tries to make a contact with a reporter for The Guardian, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is a masterwork. Bourne knows that Ross has been watched by the CIA high-tech specialists in NYC office and has been followed by the operatives at the station while an excellent sniper is waiting somewhere for a signal to terminate the reporter. Bourne controls the situation by trying to get the information from Ross and to protect him. Another scene takes place in Tangier as Bourne attempts to talk to a man from his flashbacks who has knowledge of his past before he ever became Jason Bourne. Bringing the action to Tangier, reminds me the old movie ""Pepe Le Moko"" (1937) directed by Julien Duvivier where the main character stuck forever in the suffocating maze of narrow streets of Tangier. It also made me think that Bourne movies are not just high adrenalin thrillers/mystery/spy flicks but they are first of all about longing for home, the quest for returning to the roots, searching for and understanding one's real identity and as such they are more interesting, deeper, and poignant than just a well done action flick. Maybe the movies would not have made me think so had another actor played Jason Bourne. Matt Damon, the actor with a lot of charisma and high intelligence is perfect for a role of a thinking superman that wants to know who and what is behind his super abilities."
"MLDinTN","6","6","10","10 September 2008"," Plot makes sense but still not that engaging
","I have not been real impressed by the previous Bourne movies, and this one was no exception. The best part of the movie was that the plot actually made sense this time and could be followed. Most of the action is car chasing scenes. And there are a few and they are shot very well. They look realistic. Bourne also gets to engage in hand combat with another asset and that was some fight. Nicky Parsons shows up again and is involved a little with the plot then just gets on a bus and leaves. What was the point in that? Bourne goes from Europe to America searching for his identity and what happened to him. He finds out some surprising answers and gets revenge on those in charge.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It wasn't anything great, but I'm sure if you liked the other Bourne movies, you will want to see this."
"ForeShow","4","6","10","11 January 2008"," Disappointing
","Well, apparently I'm in the minority here, but I thought this film was about as deep as a kiddie pool. The plot and storyline were flimsy at best. The only thing that made the movie watchable was the action scenes--which were annoying because of the unsteady cameras. <br/><br/>Right after watching the film, I was somewhat satisfied, then the next day, after pondering the film, I realized that I didn't like it at all. The only thing of substance that happens in the whole movie, is when Bourne tricks the CIA official out of his office, then steals the information inside his personal vault. Otherwise, the rest of the movie involves the CIA trying to kill Bourne unsuccessfully. <br/><br/>I was hoping there might actually be a storyline here, but alas, the filmmakers were piggybacking off the success of the first two films, and really didn't even need to make this one. Undoubtedly, they made great money, because of the Bourne name, but this film shouldn't have been made. Once again, Very Very weak storyline. Furthermore, very little character development."
"im_veritas_photo","6","6","10","26 December 2007"," My Ultimatum: Don't Ever Make Me Watch a Paul-Greengrass-Directed Film Again!
","I do like Matt Damon in most of his films, and as the lead actor in the three Bourne Films. The supporting actors are uniformly fine. The music is also fine, although I did get just a bit tired of the same themes repeated in all three movies... And the ""new"" cover of Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" theme at the end of The Bourne Ultimatum is definitely inferior to the original. Unlike the original, the vocalist (hard to believe it's really Moby) cannot hit or hold a correct note pitch, ever. Why does Hollywood always try to ""improve"" things? If it ain't broke, guys, leave it be!<br/><br/>But here's my big, related, question: What did poor Doug Liman do to anger Universal so much as to drop him, after The Bourne Identity, in favor of Paul Greengrass as Director? This move was, in my opinion, a horribly big mistake. Others have pointed out Greengrass' gratuitous ""camera-shake"" style of ""creating energy"". For example, just try to watch his ""Bloody Sunday""; it's just bloody awful! Greengass' style just creates motion sickness for me.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity, directed by Limon, has great energy; he did it just right. But Supremacy and Ultimatum went right over the pseudo-documentary, camera-jiggling, jangling-noise, blurry-take edge into pools of deep nausea.<br/><br/>More aggravation: The sound mix, especially during the protracted, over-long Tangier chase-and-fight scene, contains bits and bites of ""vendor shouting"" repeated ad infinitum, ad nauseum. Nothing makes me more angry than this lazy, unprofessional approach to ""movie-craft,"" or rather lack of it. Anyone with any sense of professionalism could have avoided this; these repeated sounds, once noted, become extremely intrusive.<br/><br/>Notice: This ends my watching anything directed by Greengrass, forever.<br/><br/>Watching the Bonus Features just made me even more angry. Watching them makes it obvious that the amount of equipment and the number of people have grown, for this third-in-the-trilogy film, to absurd proportions. For example: A traveling horde of movie-making people and tons of equipment transported from London to Paris via the Eurostar train produced a final Paris sequence so short, in the final cut, that we know it was merely a fine but useless junket for them, a gratuitous expense representing the worst kind of waste imaginable.<br/><br/>The ""Bourne Franchise,"" as the director and others like to call it, became a bloated pork-pig beyond their wildest, most greedy desires. Usually, success breeds success, but The Bourne Ultimatum became a poor, overdone failure as the crew partied all over Europe and North Africa.<br/><br/>Six out of ten. I would have bought the DVD, just to have all three, but they'll never see my money now."
"vic-229","2","6","10","27 October 2007"," Imagery was nauseating
","As the continuation of the series, this was an interesting end to the trilogy. But watching it was almost impossible in many instances. The constant camera movement (do we really stand and wobble from side to side as we watch people?), the interminable over-close ups (do we really want to see the pores, pimples and moles of the actors?), and the nearly blurred cuts made the viewing range from nauseating to simply unwatchable. Those annoying techniques were so over-done that I had to close my eyes for many scenes just to be able to concentrate on the plot. My adult children had to do the same things. I looked around the audience and found similar reactions. The misuse of both cinematography and editing was so egregious that they completely displaced the plot with those extremely bad techniques. Director and editor and cinematographer note: IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR LAME TECHNIQUES, ITS ABOUT THE STORY! This is possibly the worst of all the attempts at misusing these techniques. Sometimes breaking the rules of cinematography and editing heightens the telling of the story. In this case it is the story, and a horrible one at that. As one of my instructors once said, if you become aware of the cinematography, the story becomes secondary. And it should never be so. Too bad. I really like the first two and hope if they do a fourth, there will be more sane filming and editing. By the way, if I want to take a roller coaster ride, I'll go to one of the parks that offer them. In a theater I want to WATCH a movie. Not get nauseated by it."

","Matt Damon makes a welcome return as Jason Bourne, the amnesia-plagued secret agent, while Joan Allen returns as Pam Landy, the CIA Director with a conscience; and Julia Stiles as NIcky Parsons, the former Treadstone aide. It's a good story, although I felt the attempt to knit it to the previous movie (The Bourne Supremacy)was a bit feeble. After the issues of his forgotten past coming back to haunt him with a vengeance(Supremacy), Bourne decides its time to get it sorted once and for all, which is where Ultimatum takes us. And it's a good ride. Predictably, someone doesn't want him to find out. Landy gets dragged into the effort to hunt Bourne down, but becomes suspicious of the motives behind the hunt. Meanwhile Nicky Parsons is aiding Bourne, and it appears that she has a romantic interest in Bourne, but sadly, the plot doesn't explore this. Good story, great acting from a superb team, BUT, what happened to the photography?? It was fine until the action scenes, then it went to custard. Too much close-ups in the fights and chase scenes, made it very difficult to see just what was going on, and made my head spin, even sitting in the back row! And what was the point about the very obvious usage of a hand camera jerking along? We knew there was action. Maybe the thought of using a hand-held would add to the scene.It did not. I really enjoyed this movie, but the photography left me cold, with a headache."

","OK, so I've enjoyed the Bourne books and now all three of the movies. Matt Damon is Bourne and he makes James Bond look like a sissy! Good story and action. All things that should make a great movie, but the lousy camera shaking is for the frigging birds! <br/><br/>I'm not sure why Greengrass thinks this is a good effect because it makes this movie so very hard to follow! I mean, he even has the camera moving when the actors are sitting at a table talking! The fight sequences are so hard to follow because he zooms in on the actors so tight you cannot follow who is who and you only know that Jason Bourne will win because he's the hero and he has to win! You cannot follow because the close proximity of the camera work doubled with the shaking and frenetic style! <br/><br/>The director took a great story that I would seriously award a 10 and and made me knock 3 points off because of his first year film school style of cinematography!"

Plain and simple Paul Greengrass ruined what looked (at least through all the shaking) like good movies. He's the Uwe Boll of Spy/Action movies.

","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" had a real chance at being something big, something to end what had began as the most admirable motion picture saga in years. ""The Bourne Identity"" blew our minds far enough to the point that we were going back to the theater again and again to experience that same excitement once more. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" promised just as much, and even delivered a good roller-coaster ride of a sequel, albeit a little inferior to it's high riding predecessor. Sadly, ""The Bounre Ultimatum"" falls completely flat from hitting anywhere near what the first two films had landed themselves. This film is has all the excitement of a snail race. Why? Well, let's see, it managed to screw itself up in more ways than one. It over blew it with the filming tactics, and the writing was disgusting! I will explain.<br/><br/>First off, the film begins with some dreadfully unexplainable way of taking place before the last film ended. Why the writers did this, I have but to know, anyway, Jason Bourne is still on the lamb. You'd think that after all these years he'd be okay to an extent...but wait a minute...it's only been two years since the first one, and about six weeks since the second installment...somehow before the second film ended??? Anyway, there is more conspiracy and intrigue that has Bourne as angry as a caged cobra, and he's fighting mad! Before we can digest a single up-to-date detail of what's going on, a useless story line appears, of a man who's been onto Bourne for years, following the story. The man is brought to Bourne for a quick instant before meeting his own death. Somebody was feeding him information, and somebody wasn't going to let him live...the pointlessness goes on, as does the ridiculous shaky camera-work. Soon enough, the extraneous character of Nicky is introduced this thrice time around, the film falls apart.<br/><br/>Despite the bad opening sequences, I was enjoying myself with the usual Bourne action stunts, and the always determined Matt Damon in the role. What's more, is that the first twenty minutes of the film is entirely DRENCHED in the memory of Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente from B.I. & B.S.), giving us the notion that she might get a little more justice than before. Alas, the joy is short-lived when that lousy, disgusting, horrid actress Julia Stiles rears her ugly fat face into the film, and the character Nicky is supposed to be some resurrected position of the new Marie Helena Kreutz. That was when the film lost my admiration completely. It became the first film all over again, with many instances mirroring the first film on many levels. It is the same thing, with David Stathairn practically mimicking Chris Cooper, and that wretched Julia Stiles posing as a reminder of how wonderful Franka Potente was. Heck, that's all this movie is, a reminder how terrific the first film was, never mind the second. Joan Allens performance is a saving grace, but she can't manage to do it without a little help...and she has none, not even from Matt Damon. Everyone else runs, jumps, punches, types, speaks etc. like little miniatures programmed to function like the dangerous characters in the first two films. It's just dreadful. This is not fun or exciting for the fans. Fans more so feel the way I feel, that it is the writers and producers slapping us on the face. Do they think that we won't catch the stupid rehashing of ""Identity""?<br/><br/>Some people obviously find that take a refreshing, ironic stir, but I for one can't stand it! Theyshould scrap this garbage with the intentions of making another, more innovative climax to what should have been a great trilogy."

Not only will your concessions fall all over the floor, but the concessions you already digested will want to come out. This is an action-packed, seat-vibrating thriller.<br/><br/>My first two sentences were complete dramatizations of what would really happen, but I have to write a review. No critic sits and types: The film is good and leaves. No. They have to not only write what they think of the film and the plot outline, but also write a bunch of fluff sentences to fill in space. I do that as well. Although this movie is good, I don't know if I can think of a bunch of words to describe my opinion and the film itself, so I put in unnecessary sentences like the first two to make it longer. In other words, the film is extremely convoluted (as are all 'Bourne' movies), so I don't think words would be able to completely summarize if it's good or bad and what it's all about. I'll try my best<br/><br/>Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is close to death again. There Yeah, there's more. He's still trying to run away, be left alone; but, unfortunately, that can't happen. There is always someone that takes him out of his peace and almost (perhaps) goads him to come out of hiding. This time a newspaper gets him out.<br/><br/>An interesting article by London-based reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) catches his attention about something called ""Operation Black Briar"", formerly known as ""Project Treadstone"". If you didn't see the first two films, you will have no clue about any of this.<br/><br/>""Project Treadstone"" was some kind of secret CIA plan (""a kill squad, black on black"", as described by the great Brian Cox in the second installment) run by the people that had formerly hired Jason Bourne as one of them. You know what I'm talking about if you've seen all the films. The project was created to eliminate Jason Bourne. So now it's back once again, but basically with a different name.<br/><br/>As a result to this article, Jason Bourne wants to arrange a meeting with the reporter, but, unfortunately, is being watched by the coordinator of ""Operation Black Briar""- Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). But of course Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), another CIA big shot, has to get involved and basically take over the operation because she also wants information on Bourne.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Bourne continues to have visions about him first being hired by the top dog of the ""Project Treadstone"" kill squad, Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney). The vision gets more and more lucid as the movie continues. The first two had the same aspect.<br/><br/>Along with all the goings-on Bourne is teamed up with former logistics coordinator of ""Project Treadstone"", Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), and gets into a lot of well-choreographed chase sequences and fights, and almost dies You know; typical stuff you see every day.<br/><br/>But, regardless of the film's farfetchedness, it's still fun to watch because not only is there a lot of high-voltage nonsense going on, but the characters play their parts so well and believably we can't stop watching.<br/><br/>And I must compliment Paul Greengrass' direction of this film. The second one was as intriguing and thrilling as this one and was also directed by him. He also did United 93 that also had a lot of fast-paced action. He is qualified. He does a very good job with the camera as well. He may not be the director of photography or the photographer, but I can tell he puts his touch into the film.<br/><br/>Once again, this film is not relaxing. It is exhausting. Fast-paced action and choppy shots could get the squeamish dizzy, so I wouldn't recommend it to all the delicate people out there. Even I had trouble focusing on everything and walked out of the theater very tired and didn't feel like writing this review until a week later. Ha.<br/><br/>Movie directed by Paul Greengrass."

","The Bourne Supremacy was a great film - plot, performances, locales, action, all good - with only one real downfall; director Paul Greengrass seemed to have never heard of a steady-cam, leading to some very iffy camera work, especially during the fight sequences.<br/><br/>Three years on and Greengrass is still ignorant to that simple advancement in movie-making technology. Worse still, his camera-men seemed to constantly be in a state of abject terror, unable as they were to keep the camera still for more than three seconds. Worse *still*, every single over-the-shoulder shot drifted behind an actor's head so that half of the screen was obscured during conversations. It's as if, over the intervening period between Supremacy and Ultimatum, Greengrass has managed to forget what little he used to know about filming.<br/><br/>However, The Bourne Ultimatum *is* a good film. The story is again weaker than Identity, but satisfying and intriguing nonetheless, Matt Damon's performance is rock solid, as are those of the rest of the cast, and the action seemed fantastic (what could be made of it, that is).<br/><br/>It isn't worthy of the mass praise that's been heaped upon it and I would have liked to have seen Doug Liman stay on for the whole trilogy, but it's still a good end to a good trilogy.

Wasn't sure initially as to whether they'd be my cup of tea or not, hence why it took so long to see them, but that was not the case.<br/><br/>'The Bourne Identity' was a very pleasant surprise, giving a fairly well-worn genre a much needed freshness. It had its imperfections, but was a very solid and even very good film with much to recommend and introduced a cast-against-type Matt Damon in one of his best roles. 'The Bourne Supremacy' was an example of a sequel that was every bit as good as its predecessor, maybe lacking its freshness but also made a few improvements along the way. The original Bourne trilogy ends with 'The Bourne Ultimatum', which has been regarded often as the best of the three, cannot disagree.<br/><br/>Some of the hand-held shaky cam is used a little too excessively (epileptics be warned!) and the ending could have been a little less frenetic and confused and had more careful tying things together and explanation.<br/><br/>Visually, on the other hand, a vast majority of the time 'The Bourne Ultimatum' like its predecessors looks slick and stylish with even more breath-taking locations. There were many instances when the hand-held shaky cam did intensify the tense claustrophobia of the atmosphere and intensity to very good effect, never making things incomprehensible.<br/><br/>Like 'The Bourne Supremacy', the music score is even more dynamic, atmosphere enhancing and more layered this time round, while Paul Greengrass' drama-documentary style and background to his directing is used to full advantage. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' has the sharpest, most intelligent and subtle script of the three films, in a way that is just dazzling.<br/><br/>The story never lets go of its grip and never strains credibility or reality. It is a tense adrenaline rush throughout, with the best mix of exciting action, the best of it is absolutely thrilling, and meaty story-telling, with lots of emotion and characterisation meat, that develops Bourne the best of all three films. Paul Greengrass' directing style and his experience in drama-documentary is once again used to full advantage.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has really made the character of Bourne his own, at the time of 'The Bourne Identity' it was very much a cast-against-type role but now it is one of his best. Julia Stiles and particularly Joan Allen are marvellous, as is a suitably malevolent David Strathairn, and while the supporting cast are a little underused they all do uniformly sterling work (one would be very hard pressed to get a bad performance out of Albert Finney for example).<br/><br/>In conclusion, what a conclusion to the Bourne trilogy. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","The Bourne Ultimatum is a 2007 American-German action thriller film directed by Paul Greengrass loosely based on the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum. The screenplay was written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi and based on a screen story of the novel by Gilroy. The Bourne Ultimatum is the third in the Jason Bourne film series, being preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004). The fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to Ultimatum), Jason Bourne, was released in July 2016.<br/><br/>Matt Damon reprises his role as Ludlum's signature character, former CIA assassin and psychogenic amnesiac Jason Bourne. In the film, he continues his search for information about his past before he was part of Operation Treadstone and becomes a target of a similar assassin program."
"zincorbie","3","3","4","27 October 2013"," 3 is too much
","Three stars? Maybe, but the third installment deviated in direction so much that it was distracting. I eagerly anticipated this third in a series I'd come to equate on a level of Bond films. But Greengrass's shaky-cam was ridiculous, amateur, contrived, pretentious and annoying. Pretty much the worst camera direction I've ever seen, and I've seen a zillion films. The boardroom scene, for instance, where the camera's off in a corner and shaking like a leaf while it looks at one eye of a person who's face is blocked by another's shoulder is, well, as I've already said.<br/><br/>Do I hate shaky-cam? Obviously. And second to that I hate choppy quick-frame editing. So what else is in this film? Yup. Fight scenes were once choreographed by real talent like Bruce Lee, now they're faked motions edited into a blur of sound effects and snap shots. It's lame to the point of insulting. This pap has been fed to enough doe-eyed kids that I fear the next generation will positively crave the stuff. Bye-bye realism.<br/><br/>I didn't walk out of the theater, though, there were still all those great locations I'd heard about. But where were they? Oh, the camera is doing close-ups in all the exotic locations they'd spent millions to film in. What an idiotic mess."
"tdoublem13","9","3","4","18 March 2011"," Dramatic and Fitting Conclusion to the Bourne Trilogy
","Another score for the Bourne Trilogy. The previous movies have been good. This movie is better. By far in my opinion the best of the Bourne series. We again see the same continuation and finally the ending point of the Jason Bourne story. And yes, you do finally learn of Bourne's endings in this movie.<br/><br/>As for basic outline of the movie, it is simply an extension of the great style of the other Bourne movies. Less concentration on the ""cliche"" action movie things, like explosions and women and more concentration on the actors and their involvement in the story.<br/><br/>The Bourne series comes to a shocking end that makes this movie a must-see for Bourne junkies and completes a great trilogy. (9/10)"
"GLanoue","9","3","4","4 January 2011"," fast pace, too fast
","Excellent action movie. Pacing was great, but the use of 1990s style hand held camera to create a fake docudrama feel at the beginning was jarring. I know the director wants this to create continuity between the action scenes and slow paced dialogue, but the movie would have been better if the action was subtly highlighted by more static camera angles, I think. Damon as always is highly believable, and as usual in these huge budget action films, the supporting actors are great. There's an ensemble feel to the cast, as well there might be since there is some continuity (Stiles, Allen) with the first. The story was comfortably complex without too many twists, and the action was believable, even when they fight through the incredible amount of pain the protagonists inflict on each other. All in all, a credible effort."
"TonyHurtado","10","3","4","5 December 2010"," The Bourne Ultimatum, best Bourne installment.
","My favorite Bourne movie in the series. The Bourne Ultimatum was awesome, it topped all the other Bourne movies. It has so much action, more action then the other two. This was very fast-paced, I think they probably filled in all the unsolved answers from Supremacy. I hope they didn't answer all the questions because I would very much like Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon make another film. They also brought back actors like Joan Allen and Julia Stiles but they brought in David Strathairn as Noah Vosen.<br/><br/>The plot goes as this, Bourne tries to find a journalist who continues to write stories about Bourne's past including Marie's death. He tries to track him down but the journalist was also wanted by the CIA in New York, so the CIA sees Bourne with him so Bourne is yet again tracked down by the CIA. The only reason Bourne was after the journalist because he wanted answers on who started Bourne's assassin ways. So while looking for answers he also has to deal with CIA.<br/><br/>Now in my Supremacy blog, I said I would discuss the same conversation in both films. At the end of Supremacy there is a conversation between Bourne and Pam, this conversation also happened in the middle of Ultimatum. This conversation was the way that they were able to continue with Ultimatum. So the 1st half of Ultimatum is a quarter of material of Supremacy they wanted to use in Ultimatum instead of Supremacy. So basically the conversation is a lead into Ultimatum. I thought it was a clever move. 5 out of 5 stars again for The Bourne Ultimatum. To leave off if Paul or Damon sees this blog I hope they will listen to a die hard Jason Bourne fan to make another film because I really want to see a fourth film."

"amybarbagli","9","3","4","29 August 2010"," My Opinion On The Bourne Ultimatum
","This is one of the most action filled movies I have ever seen. It has every aspect that I look for in a movie, amazing plot, incredible acting, and the directing was one of the best. There was rarely a moment when I wasn't on the very edge of my seat waiting for another scene full of action. Not only did it have action in it, there were times of sadness, dry humor, and internal conflict. Throughout the film, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is trying to figure out his identity and why people are after him, as in the previous two movies, The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy. As he is doing that, he tries to avenge the death of the one girl he truly cared about, who was introduced in the first Bourne film. With Bourne's wit and constant confrontations with the people after him, he gives the movie a sense of suspense and thrill that I haven't gotten in any other movie I've seen <br/><br/>On the other hand, there were a few faults I picked up on while watching the movie. One of those faults I believe is that a couple of the scenes had no meaning. To me, there was no point in adding them to the movie because they slowed the movie down. Without those scenes, the movie would have absolutely been the best movie I have ever seen. Overall, I believe that the film had the best setup, plot, and acting I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Compared to another action film I have seen, like Gone In 60 Seconds, The Bourne Ultimatum has a better way of keeping the audience engaged in the movie and always wanting to know what's coming up next. Gone In 60 Seconds was a decent movie, if you were to only focus on the cars rather than the acting. There was action in this film but it wasn't as interactive as it was in The Bourne Ultimatum. That movie had me feeling ready to go out and fight as soon as I finished watching the movie. The way both movies ended had a different effect on me than the other did. Gone In 60 Seconds had an ending that I thought was cliché and expected in a movie. What was different in The Bourne Ultimatum was the fact that it closed the whole series perfectly and had me wanting more."

If you are a fan of action films then you haven't seen anything until you've seen all three of the Bourne Trilogy. I've seen The Bourne Trilogy so many times and it still impresses me. It's just an exciting ride watching all these different events take place behind our backs; im talking agents, spys, kingpins...Jason Bourne is the ultimate bad ass!

"eric262003","9","3","4","2 February 2009"," An Improvement From the Previous Bourne Movies
","As a fan of the Bourne franchise, I was a bit let down from the previous outing, ""The Bourne Identity"". Having read the novel, I had high expectations going into the theaters that I was in for a treat. But all my hopes became shattered. But ""The Bourne Supremacy"", released two years later lived up to its name by being more supreme than its predecessor. This movie itself got me interested in the Bourne series. I soon began to realize that director Paul Greengrass and script writer Tony Gilroy and company collaborated to create a new action hero that will appeal to the younger audience in this generation. Much like, Ian Fleming did for James Bond. From the mind of this unusual hero, we know he's done bad things in his life, but because he has amnesia, he doesn't remember exactly what they were. Set in our modern society where even the good can't be trusted, the Jason Bourne character is the definitive answer towards morality.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Ultimatim"" is the third addition to the series based on a novel by Robert Ludlum, is where narration is at its zenith. It's positive message and nail-biting scenes will have you captivated in its almost two hour running time. Once again, Matt Damon is back again and seems more at ease than he was in the other two movies still wondering how or who put him in the predicament that he's in now. This time Bourne is in London and a reporter (Paddy Considine) informs him of an organization called Blackbrier, a more menacing organization than Treadstone that's run by an evil CIA agent (David Stratairn), who wants Bourne dead. Also in pursuit of Bourne is a girl named Pam Lundy (Joan Allen) who has faith, that Bourne is not a threat that the CIA assumes he is. And the city-hopping is off in full swing up to his final destination in New York where he fights off his ex-handlers.<br/><br/>Though not a thinking-movie like ""The Bourne Supremacy"", this movie depends more on action and non-stop chases, for all action fans. And anyone who gets in Bourne's face, will likely get pummeled. Bourne has Blackbeier's henchman after him who seem to expose similar traits as him. But Bourne is more well-versed than them, so that gives him still the upper edge. Very tense scenes on the rooftops of Tangiers to the traffic-laden streets of the Big Apple, the chase reign supreme. <br/><br/>In ""Ultimatum"", in spite of the surreal settings and chase scenes, a surprising element you don't see often in action films is that in this movie the characters are believable. The bad guys depicted here look the part as bigwig corporate monsters trying to bring down their man. This portrayal gives you all the more to support Jason Bourne. Damon was made to play Bourne, he never stops to pose, or takes his role uber-seriously, but understands his character and tries to go through to him. <br/><br/>The supporting cast was excellent, especially the interactions between Stratairn and Allen as the two antagonists from different worlds trying to bring down Bourne. It was nice to see Julia Stiles back as Nicky with more secrets about Bourne. And Scott Glenn is noteworthy in another top official as a CIA director. <br/><br/>The direction by Paul Greengrass was exceptional as brings new light to the Bourne chapter. With the help of screenwriter Tony Gilroy, Greengrass was able to adapt something new to the final chapter where Bourne has to accept what he has done and to accept the consequences. The score by John Powell won't appeal to others, but fits in with the scenes. <br/><br/>Overall a very riveting action film, that's very believable and exciting to watch and never insults its audience. This movie calls for multiple viewings and a satisfying addition to action movie fans. One not to miss."
"g-bodyl","10","3","4","27 November 2008"," The Best Bourne!
","The Bourne Ultimatum is the best Bourne movie. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne who wants to know what happened to him in the past. This time he has to face the CIA, a different kind of CIA. This CIA has directors with unapparent criminal records. Now Bourne has to deal with the ruthless director and his gang while receiving help from former enemies. The movie starts off slow, but it's very interesting trying to see what is going to happen to Bourne. Then the middle to end has action and mind-blowing surprises. My favorite action scene is when Bourne is fleeing the cops by jumping across housetops. The acting is great. Matt Damon does not slow down one beat. The music plays a part in this film. It is nice to listen to music with fast beats during the action scenes. The technical portions are above average. This movie does deserve the 3 technical Oscars. Overall, this closes out a very good, action-packed trilogy. I rate this movie 10/10."
"joe-elliott2","10","3","4","3 November 2008"," Good, all-round Action Flick
","The Bourne Ultimatum picks up after the events of the first 2 films, with Matt Damon, aka. Jason Bourne, tracking down a reporter who has been writing articles about him and he tries to find the man's source. After that, the film returns to the traditional 'Bourne' style, a long chase across a whole continent... Bourne Ultimatum packs more of a punch than its predecessors, the action is more intense and the plot is more developed. Jason Bourne again, is a mythical figure in the eyes of the authorities, 'My God. That's Jason Bourne!' and this time he fights the new assassins across half the globe. The acting is great, Matt Damon, perfect as the amnesiac assassin and the rest of the cast play their roles perfectly. The 'shaky' camera may not be to other people's tastes but it adds extra intensity to the fights. Of course, there is the traditional Bourne wit, the 'if you were in your office we would be talking face-to-face.' the gadgets and of course the action. The thinking-man's James Bond. No additional frivolity, just a simple plot brilliantly portrayed. 10/10"
"EijnarAmadeus","8","3","4","26 September 2007"," Already one of 2007's most accomplished movies
","Picking up right after the Moscow-showdown of Supremacy, this is Bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax. Throughout the tight, 115-min-runtime the movie takes Bourne from Russia to Madrid, Paris, Marocco and ultimately New York. Damon is every inch of the hard-trained killer Robert Ludlum imagined, he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now, and it's the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable, and it's exactly the fine way Damon manages to combine these two polar-opposites of himself that's so breathtaking. In this third, Bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it, Ultimatum delivers such an high-octane performance that you'll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull-offs; just look out for two great car-chases and a fight-scene as realistic as Bond vs. Shaw back in '63. Director Greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get; a true pay-off to Bourne fans and a new breed of spy-thriller standard."

The plot, when compared to other action movies, is solid and even thought-provoking in a way. Although I don't intend to make this movie more than what it is: An intense roller-coaster ride, a thinking man's action movie, and a great way to be entertained.<br/><br/>The only negative point I encountered was the fact that Bourne, in some scenes, seems almost indestructible, even for him. Luckily, this is by no means a large issue, and the film works very well despite of it.<br/><br/>Watch this film, and watch it in a cinema. I can guarantee to any espionage/action film lover that you will be thoroughly entertained."

","Having read many of Robert Ludlum's books, we have been waiting with great anticipation for this film to arrive.

However this movie got it right and was a credit to the screenwriter.<br/><br/>The plot and the acting were excellent. Matt and Julia make a fantastic team and the casting for the whole movie was well done. But we were very disappointed by the filming.

The story keeps the movie-goers anticipating for the next scene and change of events. Every time Bourne losses a lead, you keep looking forward to what he is going to do next. His wits and resourcefulness keeps him alive. In the end, it gave me that deja vu feeling of ""Die Hard"".<br/><br/>I would have given it a higher rating if not for the shaky camera work. It made me almost sick and could have ruined the show. The worst I had was when watching ""The Blair Witch Project"". But this is not an amateur documentary film; use the tripod!!

There is still a coherent story which is far more than just a connective between the action scenes. There's skillful use of sound to stimulate the senses while one's watching, and tight, expert editing.

When the third Bourne film came to town, I was amped.<br/><br/>But, what I was not ready for was 2 hours of the most nauseating camera work I have ever seen. Seriously, this was WAY TOO MUCH. It was ridiculously over shot. Some of the fight scenes looked sooooo great (for the 3 seconds where I could make out what was happening). The chase scenes were almost ballet-beautiful (for the 3 seconds where I could make out what was happening). But all the potentially wonderful things this film had to offer were all drowned in a raging sea, the likes of which brought about a sickness a box of Dramamine would not have quelled. <br/><br/>Where the other films like this?

"jdkraus","8","4","6","8 October 2007"," A nice wrap-up for the Bourne Trilogy
","Like many other people that I know, I really enjoyed ""The Bourne Identity"". When I went and saw ""The Bourne Supremacy"" three years ago, I was disappointed due to the out of control shaky camera and the death of Franka Potente's character. So my feelings for a third movie of The Bourne trilogy were not so high. Now that I've finally saw ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", it was a pretty good comeback and a nice wrap-up of the trilogy.<br/><br/>The film directly picks up off of the events of the last one in Moscow. Bourne (Oscar winner Matt Damon) escapes with his life and begins the crusade of finding his past identity as he deals with some violent flashbacks which could be key as to locating who he really is. The movie really jumps around from a lot of different locations around the world for the first half hour, which really left me confused for a bit.<br/><br/>But after this setback, the story picks up and Bourne once again has to dodge deadly assassins and a ruthless CIA director (Oscar nominee David Strathain) whose sole purpose is to make sure Bourne dies. Meanwhile Pamela Landy (Oscar nominee Joan Allen) soon uncovers the truth of an operation called Blackbriar and becomes Bourne's ally.<br/><br/>I was impressed with this film. It had great suspense, amazing car chases, and plenty of stylish hand-to-hand combat, particularly on Damon's part. The direction by Paul Greengrass, (who directed the previous Bourne), really captures the story as well as the nonstop action. The camera is still hand held like most of his movies but it wasn't out of control to the point that needed some anti-nausea pills.<br/><br/>All the knots are tied in the end, leaving a good close for the trilogy. If you're a Bourne fan, this is the one you should definitely see. To be honest though, I didn't like this one as much as the first since the original is always the hardest one to beat, but I still liked this one nonetheless. 8/10"

","This film is chipper. It follows Jason Bournes hunt for his life while the CIA centre all their forces on his capture. The fierce and deadly determination of the CIA is portrayed with a raw tang that demonstrates how much power the CIA have been given. Matt Damon is very good as Bourne, a charging assassin who is not here to mess around. When the reporter contacts born it is obvious that this guy is out of his depth. The reporter's whining performance is good because he gets across how normal people get drawn into gigantic wars. The director did a sterling job, the camera angles are up-close and swift and this makes the action forceful and jittery. The film is a headlong chase that unveils the truth very cleverly which makes the audience ponder. Anyone who hasn't had a goosey of this film needs to.

"teh_mode","8","4","6","1 October 2007"," Furiously paced action thriller
","Attach a camera to a stampeding bison and convolute his bulrush with a myriad of flaming obstacles. Lend the scene some gritty urbane shades of grey and you might just get a sense of what watching The Bourne Ultimatum is like. It is the third and final instalment of the best Hollywood trilogy since Lord Of The Rings. A cataclysm of chase sequences all brought together through an incredibly well managed story of searching for identity. Jason Bourne is now closer to finding out the truth than ever before. But those who rely on secrets and lies fully intend to make sure he never does. His journey brings him from Moscow (where we left off from Supremacy) to London, Tangiers and finally New York. Our main man has kept himself busy, amid trying to solve the riddle of why so many want him dead.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass may just be the finest director working in Hollywood at the moment. After the admirably harrowing exercise in recreating the brave but doomed lives of those aboard United 93 last year, Greengrass has returned to what brought him mainstream acclaim, with Matt Damon as the man with many names. He is Jason Bourne, a man who pulsates his way through the journey faster than the camera can catch him, dispatching of his enemies in skilfully undetectable panache. He is the anti-James Bond, a man who achieves his goals through relentless determination but secretly just wants to let it all go and get back to being a normal person. Greengrass manages to capture the unclothed torture that occasionally surfaces in Bourne's demeanour during the film. In the few scenes between the break-neck action set-pieces it is almost as if Greegrass has been studying the characters' biorhythms, as the camera learily explores the meaning of a tapping finger, or a nervous twitch of an eye. The faux-documentary style allows for the camera to be as intimate as possible when needs be, and as explosively dynamic too. It is that wonderful mirage of cinematic excursions that lend The Bourne Ultimatum a sense of intimacy and substance. But that is not all that gives the movie its edge. Indeed it has political undertones too, with one brilliant sequence inside Waterloo station exploring the effects of being watched through CCTV. Not so much being watched, but who controls the cameras. Secondly, those who attempt to assassinate Bourne are all under the banner of the CIA, and references aplenty are made to waterboarding, black ops and rendition, as if the movie is questioning the humanity of those methods.<br/><br/>But the real stars of the show are the incredible action chases. Whether it is the roof jumping in Tangiers, or the car chase in New York, The Bourne Ultimatum is never short of being unrelenting. No other director could ever perfect this pace, for anything faster would be overkill, and anything less would diluting the frenetic energy that charges the movie screen. Greengrass is a master at roping his audience in and never letting go of that leverage. He can take the most basic of action sequences like a man running and make it feel like a helicopter exploding. Whether it is too frenetic or not, the one thing that is impossible to feel is boredom. Even the rare tender scenes are utterly compelling in their delivery. This is Matt Damon's finest work. He has always had a fluctuating career in terms of quality, despite being a very bankable star in the process. But his subtle raggedness, and penchant for looking unperturbed in the face of great danger is what makes Bourne seem like the classic no-man. He is an anomaly in terms of James Bond bewitchery, but perfect for the role of Jason Bourne  handsome, rugged and steely eyed. Not a flicker of doubt ever crosses his mind whilst fighting for the truth. And not a flicker of doubt ever crossed mine when reviewing this film."

","The latest high quality adrenalized action franchise is Bourne Identity - Ultimatum. Matt Damon and excellent supporting actors, combine with good writing (based on Robert Ludlum's novels), decent cinematography and directing to produce one of the better action trilogies. Ultimatum is the third installment and is just as good as the previous two. The film does not contain the amount of character development in the first two, so any prospective viewer is encouraged to watch the first two films in sequence before seeing Ultimatum.<br/><br/>In Ultimatum (strangely inappropriate title, since no ultimatum is ever delivered) Bourne gets closer to learning his own identity while his former employers close in around him. Tipped off by a smart investigative journalist, Bourne must stay several steps ahead of the most advanced espionage organizations in the world simply to preserve his own life. He tours most of Europe searching for clues and informants, and leaving the trail of destruction we have grown to expect in his wake.<br/><br/>The following paragraph is not intended as a criticism - the film is entire entertaining. However, I do feel compelled to point a few things out regarding the basics of the premise and the action of the film. There are quite a few aspects of this film which are more than a tad ridiculous. Action audiences must be willing to suspend disbelief for substantial periods of time to be able to watch practically anything in the genre these days, but the silliness even extends into the dramatic elements of the Bourne franchise. The plot exploits American paranoia about intelligence agencies, but almost makes these seemingly omnipresent and omniscient organizations ridiculously vulnerable. Bourne himself, though a consistently compelling character, is not simply capable of surviving any physical damage, but also seems to be able to predict the behavior of several dozen people at the same time - without the assistance of the surveillance equipment being used against him throughout the film.<br/><br/>Damon does a fine job with the lead role. David Strathairn is GREAT!!!!! Joan Allen, Julie Stiles and Albert Finney are also very strong.<br/><br/>The editing is excellent. The film is intensely paced, but doesn't have quite the desperate feeling as the first two. The directing and camera work are fine, but some of the simulated hand-held photography and hyper-speed fight scenes seemed a little weak.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the entire series is highly recommended for action and thriller fans, but I don't recommend walking into this without previous experience with the franchise."

","I loved the action in this movie, and thought the writing and acting were great. I would have given this movie a rating somewhere between 9.0 and 9.5. I end up giving it an 8 however. The camera work looked like it was done by a fourth grader. It bounced around, wasn't in focus, sudden zoom in closeups for no reason and lots of unnecessary ""MTV style"" quick cuts. The steadiest camera work was done from the helicopter. I was very, very disappointed by the camera work.<br/><br/>**mild spoilers** <br/><br/>in the scene where Bourne is talking to Marie's brother, half the screen is taken up by the back of the person's head as they are doing an over the shoulder shot. Worse, the camera kept bouncing around and head/shoulders were seriously out of focus.<br/><br/>in the early scenes in Moscow, the camera is bouncing around so much that I thought I was going to get motion sick.<br/><br/>in the fight scene in the hallway at the train station, the camera is moving so much, that nothing is in focus. It's very difficult to tell what is going on, other than that some people are moving and that the walls appear to be white.<br/><br/>Seriously, the camera work looked like the worst from ""America's Funniest Home Videos"".

","This is the final of 3 movies based on the books by Robert Ludlum. It lays out how Jason Bourne became a spy as he backtracks and finds out more information through different sources. The end lays it all out for the viewer (and Bourne) in an interesting twist.<br/><br/>Compared to Bourne Supremacy, I think this film was good. They cut down on the dizzy camera cutting in the fights (although there was still quick cutting in these scenes). I personally also liked that they brought back Nikki Parsons and involved Pam Landy because it was an illustration of how wrong everything was that had been done to Bourne.<br/><br/>The end they provided (in the final minutes of the film) was very ambiguous. This is nice, although it leaves open room for the studio to go in and create a fourth movie based on their own ideas, rather than those of the book.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was entertaining, and had good twists and turns throughout to keep me involved.

","First things first: with The Bourne Supremacy and now Bourne Ultimatum, director Paul Greengrass has used up his hand-held camera privileges (hereafter referred to as ""fidgetcam"") for the next 10 years. The fidgetcam technique, when used for a realistic work, like Greengrass' own Bloody Sunday, is an effective one. When used in an action film filled with fight scenes and car chases, it makes what could be exciting just a continuously out of focus blur. And out of focus ain't what I paid $9.50 for, okay? Ultimatum is a remarkably silly film and I was giggling within the first five minutes, as I was whipped cinematically between oh, five or fifteen cities. But who got the chance to count with the fidgetcam running at full speed? Which is pretty much all Matt Damon's Jason Bourne does: walk purposefully down hallways and streets, through hotels, parking lots, malls and office buildings. Every so often he'll stop to pummel 3 or 4 people, point a gun or recite 2 lines of dialog before re-starting his endless, fidgety walking tour of the world. Not that the lines in the script are terribly interesting anyway, unless innumerable scenes of people snarling into cell phones, banging away at lap tops magically connected to every camera and phone in the world or David Strathairn and Joan Allen doing snippy, steely-eyed spy routines while shouting ""People"" or ""He's on the move"" push you to the edge of your seat. This film is hardly worth renting much less leaving your home for on a hot summer night."

Then, a completely superior rogue agent who knows every step of his enemies in advance. Who can handle every enemy, no matter their numbers.<br/><br/>The faces of all these protagonists stay mostly emotionless, even in the toughest of situations - this is probably supposed to cast a light of professionalism on them, while it only gave me the feeling of watching a bunch of robots doing their work.

"jag4331","6","7","13","5 September 2007"," Bourne is entertaining but soulless...The film is the same
","Fans of Robert Ludlum remember Jason Bourne as a tortured character, faced with a shadowy and violent past. While serving in an elite CIA undercover mission, he suffered trauma rendering him without an identity. Throughout the stirring trilogy, he unearthed the various monikers he had used as cover, only one of which was named Jason Bourne. The action-filled books allowed for the type of self-examination and introspection that only occurs when one no longer recognizes the self that was. Fans of the movie version of the Bourne saga might be surprised that the stories ever delved deeper than blood, guns and car chases.<br/><br/>That being said, the movies are plenty entertaining. In the transfer to the big screen, the stories went on a sort of no-carb diet, leaving the scripts with only minimal references to the book's larger and considerably more complex plot. Yet, by not including the devious plot twists, the filmmakers broke the golden rule for a successful franchise: hook the audience to come back. After meeting Bourne (Matt Damon) in ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002, we learn most of what we will ultimately be revealed in ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" Unless most of the movie-going public is satiated with action un-propelled by characters' doubts emotions, it is a bit of a mystery why these movies have been as successful as they have.<br/><br/>But, barring a thorough sociological study, that question must remain a philosophical one. Still, embedded between extended fight scenes, using faster film to emphasize Bourne's inhuman speed, characters hinted at issues for today's world. In fact, Jason Bourne fits the profile of a terrorist. He is dead set on exacting revenge on the organization that left him despaired, disoriented and physically disabled: the Central Intelligence Agency. He is also a ruthless super-killer who seems unstoppable by even the most elite tactical agents. His enemy is a special office within the CIA that deals exclusively with top-secret, high-priority killings, evoking the real-life reports of CIA programs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), the CIA Deputy Director, is installed at the head of this program, code-named Blackbriar. Convinced that everyone is trying to betray him, he ominously muses, ""It ends when we've won."" In fact, at that moment, his coworkers were trying to betray him, so rather than question the irrational, extremist tactics of the CIA, the film justifies them.<br/><br/>Still, if Bourne comes off as the world's most potent terrorist, the CIA appears as the most powerful terrorist network. They have surveillance anywhere they wish, and there is little institutional compunction for civilian lives, nor even for those considered friends. Throughout ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" Bourne suffers debilitating flashbacks of sleep deprivation and simulated drowning, known as water-boarding  the CIA was responsible for Bourne's torture, before he suffered the head trauma.<br/><br/>Given this sense of moral disorientation, the film verges on a powerful critique of the military underworld, one that is largely unknown to the general public. Instead, the film offers us a lone, grounded character in a swirling world of deceit. The film's Jason Bourne, in sharp contrast to the one in Ludlum's novels, comes off as the only sure thing in an uncertain world. The audience cheers for him to bash in equally merciless and anonymous foes, most of whom are CIA employees, and to avenge his battle wounds, which may have been self-inflicted. What exactly are we cheering for? Ultimately, the hit men he fights are born of the same mold as he  lethal robots that kill without questioning. Is the joke on us, for siding with a monster, innocent though Bourne seems? Possibly, the movie turns the mirror on ourselves  as we fund the CIA to pursue indiscernible enemies, do we even care who does the dirty work? In the film's last breath, after what seemed like endless, and superfluous, double-crossing and truth-revealing, there is a brilliant burst of potential. In the final scenes, without giving away the ending, the filmmakers took a leap at the type of vague finale that shocked, and frustrated, audiences of ""The French Connection."" Yet, as this movie is marketed for an audience raised on endless action franchises and television, the producers could not resist teasing for a fourth installment  this reviewer is likely to be Bored."

","As those who have read the books and seen the prior films already know, there is zero relation between the the plots in the two genres. This Bourne is no exception, but here it is taken to the extreme. There is no plot whatsoever! Instead, we get two hours of really, really excellent chase sequences. While the trendy, shaky, hand-held, fast-cut camera work gets to be a bit much after a while, the non-stop action makes up for it. This is one of those 'suspend disbelief', 'indestructible superhero', 'the CIA is all-powerful' films, but it's a delicious summer confection nonetheless. It has nowhere near the nuance or thoughtfulness quotient of something like Scorcese's The Departed, but it's nevertheless a real crowd pleaser.

Yes, the plot of TV movie hidden away on US Fiver at three in the morning. But, no, the greatest action trilogy ever made!!!!!!!!! You are kidding me! The action was so repetitive - Bourne puts himself close up to his chasers and then as the technical wizardry of tracking him (my computer takes longer to start up than these people can trace a phone!) gets closer he outwits them, before we have a physical chase involving bikes, cars, and on foot, from which Bourne escapes to catch a plane or train to another fabulous location where the same thing is done all over again. Of course, the camera shakes (oh, so original), and the cutting is manic (oh so original), while Matt Damon out acts IKEA Knightley with B&Q Damon - a face so wooden that makes watching paint dry interesting! A word for Julia Stiles who acts her head off without any reward. The critics have lauded this derivative heap of junk (see Tom Cruise in MI whatever, John Frankenheimer's 'French Connection', or Peter Yates' 'Bullitt') because Paul Greengrass has apparently reinvented the spy movie - I must have missed that as I counted up the clichés and repeat shots!

","There has been a new fad in movies such as Mission Impossible 3, Ocean's 12, and other big hits. Do you know what I'm talking about? I mean the style of filming that makes you think that the film had such a low budget that they couldn't even afford a tripod.<br/><br/>During the close-up scenes the screen wobbles and during the action scenes, the irregular camera motion mixed with the fast editing makes the scene unintelligible.<br/><br/>The only way that someone can capture everything that is going on is by loading up on a dozen Starbucks Venti Crapa-Frapas and sneaking in a couple boxes of Red Bull to keep their brain working as fast as the images that are flying by on screen.<br/><br/>Myself as well as several of my friends and relatives have discussed this filming technique to extreme measures, and we feel that it should be banned for the following reasons: 1: This type of filming induces dizzy spells and vomiting. I do NOT want to have to take a Dramamine before going to the movies: I am there to be entertained, not nauseated.<br/><br/>2: When the movie ends, I wan't to be able to have some sort of grasp of who kicked who's buttocks in this scene or that.<br/><br/>3: Halfway through the movie, when I need to take my regular bathroom break, I would appreciate being able to walk to the bathroom without looking drunk or sick.<br/><br/>and finally 4: It's cheating.

","When the most memorable thing you remember coming out of a movie is that you were annoyed by the camera work, you know there is a problem. Proper shaky camera work can convey a sense of chaos and action (see the Gladiator for its proper use), but here, it just distracts and confuses. During the action scenes, it obscures what is going on (especially if you're sitting relatively close to the screen). During a quiet moment, it completely takes you out of the movie. Try this experiment. Sit down across from anyone at a cafe or restaurant. Notice how much jitter there is around their face and head...right none! Now watch Matt Damon have a conversation with Julia Stiles...that's right, I didn't say Jason Bourne, because the camera is so shaky, that you think you're watching Matt Damon's home movies filmed on an antique camera by his uncle with Parkinson's disease.<br/><br/>Now that the big one is out of the way, let's critique the movie. The camera-work aside, this is an enjoyable movie featuring everyone's favorite amnesiac superspy. It delivers on over the top action with a modicum of cerebral superspy stuff. It has a few nods to previous movies, prominently highlighting the last line of the second movie. The hand to hand fight scenes are phenomenal. I really enjoy the Arnis based combat (obscured by the camera-work as it is). I just wish they would teach the actors real gun handling. (Watch Collateral for some good handling.) <br/><br/>The Bourne Identity sounded the death knell for James Bond, by raising the bar to unreachable heights. Unfortunately, the Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum both failed to reach that bar. Instead the producers decided that they would simply try to one up other movies. Transporter 1 and 2? We can be crazier with driving. Casino Royale? we got that covered. Unfortunately, Bourne is at his best when doing his cerebral, superspy shtick, and there just wasn't enough of it. The best scene in the movie happens in the first twenty minutes. The rest of the movie, while good, just doesn't live up to its promise.<br/><br/>I hope they bring Bourne out for a fourth movie, but do us all a favor, and fire Greengrass before he destroys the franchise.<br/><br/>Slight spoiler below: <br/><br/>There's also two continuity/sequencing issues, where you're not sure whether they're in London or New York.

Bourne still wants to find out who he truly is and who made him into what he is now.<br/><br/>Being a third part in a series means the film doesn't have to ""waste"" time on explaining new characters and their place in the story and that's why it can let itself start of the easy way - full throttle action. And it does this well. In fact, it never lets go of the throttle, it just keeps rolling on and doesn't allow itself to take a breather.

Personally I will be waiting for a trilogy release that I assume will be coming sometime in the future - these films belong together and deserve to be watched back-to-back as one long running feature.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 dirty little secrets"
"mattrochman","7","5","9","8 September 2007"," The camera man was drunk
","A plethora of trilogies have emerged in recent years, signifying a shift in decision-making of Hollywood producers: they are abandoning risky, yet original and creative scripts for pathetic dime-a-dozen scripts and plots ... and sequels... that they are guaranteed to at least get their money back on.<br/><br/>The ""Bourne"" trilogy is an exception to that rule in many respects because it abandons so many of the devices and plot formulas commonly found in films of this genre. First there is the gun. Go back and watch all the films and you'll find that Bourne almost never carries a gun (and interestingly gets rid of guns that he wrestles of his enemies). He's a hand-to-hand combat man and a master of creating a diversion. I like that aspect.<br/><br/>Second is the intelligent plotting. While there are some double-crosses running through the film, they don't become the dominant focus. Some films tend to throw in 500 double crosses in the hope of creating an intelligent and powerful plot, but end up in a puzzling web of contradictions with many turns that simply don't make sense at all. Not the case with Bourne.<br/><br/>Third is the creation of suspense without shooting or fighting. This is exemplified particularly well in Waterloo station sequence in this film - where the viewer is on the edge of their seat without one shot fired and very little hand-to-hand combat. It was all evasion and diversion which was thoroughly engaging.<br/><br/>Finally, the inventiveness of the hero. For instance, in this film, he's pursued through Daniel's office in Madrid and all we see is him pick up a fan and a few random objects before he disappears. Is he going to pull a Magyver? build a helicopter and fly out of there? Nope - I won't spoil it, but it's that sort of subtle inventiveness that makes the actions sequences all the more intelligent.<br/><br/>But there was a major problem i had with both Supremacy and Ultimatum: the camera work. A lot of shots, especially action sequences, were extremely confusing. No doubt that the director of photography thought he was breaking new ground with lots of hand-held, close-up camera work. But i thought that it made the action sequences difficult to follow and even in some of the CIA station scenes, they seemed to zooming in and out with hand-held cameras, but it didn't seem to lift the intensity of the scene. In fact, it simply became annoying after a while. <br/><br/>I looked up the biography of director Paul Greengrass and found that he's a big fan of the hand-held camera shots. Well good for him! Unfortunately, it was appropriate for this film and it became too messy and irritating at times. Liman, who directed the first one, new how to vary the camera during the fight scenes to perfection. And furthermore, the first one - identity - was one of the greatest spy films of all time and certainly the best of the trilogy. The change of directors wasn't a good idea in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>In the last two Bourne films, it looked at times like the cameraman was drunk, rather than dynamic and creative. It ruined many explosive entertaining fights and stand offs they we'd been waiting for. IT loses marks for that I'm afraid. <br/><br/>Otherwise terrific watch and if the first one entertained, but like many others you thought the second one was OK without being anything special, i highly recommend the seeing this one. Great watch, good plot, the first half of the film is actually magnificent (but it does fall away a bit in the second half) and all round entertainment to wind up one of the best trilogy series of the last 15 years."
"TheEdge-4","7","5","9","17 August 2007"," Bourne Again: The Return of the Shaky Cam
","Jason Bourne is back in what may prove to be the final film in the Bourne Franchise. If so, what a way to go out. Unlike many of this summer's three-quels, this film delivers the goods. This is a 115 minute roller-coaster ride that barely lets up from start to finish. However, in a world of leaden imitations, this unfortunately isn't quite the 24 carat gold classic that the two previous films were. Don't get me wrong, this is still one of the best films I have seen this year and most films would kill to be this good. Unfortunately both ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (especially the latter) set the barrier so high that unfortunately this film doesn't quite measure up in comparison.<br/><br/>First the good stuff. Matt Damon is great as usual and it is good to see that Julia Stiles is given more to do this time round. Her character especially is an appealing mix of ability and vulnerability. Whilst she doesn't get as good a scene as the one in the previous film where Bourne threatened to kill her, the hints that she may have had a relationship with Bourne that he now doesn't remember is an interesting twist and it is a shame that her character drops out of the film over halfway through. The great Joan Allen gives good support and David Strathairn makes a good replacement for Brian Cox as the man to hate. However most of the kudos should go to Paul Greengrass and his editor Christopher Rouse. Greengrass has become a great director since Universal took a chance on him to direct ""The Bourne Supremacy"". His so-called ""shaky cam"" style which has been criticised by many on this site is the reason why this film works so well. The Waterloo station scene in particular should become a masterclass study in editing (in addition, the fight scene between Bourne and the CIA ""asset"" in a small room in Tangier is a terrific piece of action editing that ought to win Christopher Rouse an Oscar if there is any justice in this world, reminiscent though it is of the fight scene between Bourne and one of his German contemporaries in the previous film - which Rouse helped to edit). Even though there are a few flaws in this film, they are down to the script and not to Paul Greengrass's direction which is arguably better here than in the previous film (he was also criminally robbed of an Oscar for ""United 93"" earlier this year - as good as ""The Departed"" was, Scorsese's Oscar was a compensation prize for his earlier work where he really should have won).<br/><br/>So why is this film only 23½ carat gold grade? Mainly because of the script. I yield to no one in my respect and admiration of Tony Gilroy who has written a number of great films over the years aside from the Bourne films but there are a few flaws here that stick out like a sore thumb. Since other hands are involved here as well (Scott Burns and George Nolfi), I am prepared to give Gilroy the benefit of the doubt and trust he wasn't responsible (since Nolfi wrote ""Timeline"", ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""The Sentinel"", guess who my money is on). So what's the problem? Well for a start, the Simon Ross character is meant to be a security correspondent with The Guardian newspaper and yet makes the mistake of mentioning the word ""Blackbriar"" on the telephone. Surely a security correspondent at The Guardian whose job consists of studying the Security Services and their methods would be aware of the ability of the National Security Agency to harvest key words from all the telephone conversations that take place around the world. Are Guardian journalists really that stupid? (well, okay, perhaps they are) Of course, the problem for the film is that without the NSA and the CIA latching onto Ross at the start of the film, there would be no way of them finding Bourne. Another problem is the way in which Bourne happens to discover he is the subject of an article by Ross by coincidentally picking up a copy of The Guardian and reading it. Pretty unlikely (especially as Bourne hardly strikes me as the sort of person who would read The Guardian anyway) but without Bourne reading the article, he would have no reason to contact Ross and start the plot rolling. This sort of lazy writing to cut plot corners affects a film where credibility and believability are important (more so than a Bond film where you can readily suspend your disbelief given the usually fantastic nature of the plots). Also the plot timeline is a bit confusing because it follows immediately after Bourne's car chase in Moscow at the end of the last film, seemingly forgetting about the final telephone conversation between Bourne and Pamela Landy which came after that (although this is explained later on in the film, it was a bit confusing at first). My last complaint is the updated version of Extreme Ways over the closing titles. It's awful and if Moby isn't responsible, he should sue. The original version is a classic and this bastardized version is the aural equivalent of painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa (if we don't complain now, who knows what we'll get to hear next? Madonna singing the theme tune to a Bond film?)<br/><br/>Still, small gripes for a film that still manages to beat the opposition hands down (including, dare I say it, ""Casino Royale""). Perhaps better to finish the franchise there though rather than risk ruining it with a fourth film."

I don't know who was behind it all, but the camera did not sit still for the entire movie. I mean, even when they were sitting at desks and chatting, it was like the person filming the scene was in a giant vat of Jell-O.<br/><br/>I mean, jiggling the camera for the ""Guy on the go"" effect has its merits, and the quick cut-scenes to literally shower the viewer with information, again, wonderful when used correctly...

","Action movies don't do much for me, they bore me and I find most of them way too stupid to believe. However, this movie had saying ""Wow"" at the end. Never have I seen an action movie that is so fast paced, relentless and believable. The acting from everyone was great (especially Matt Damon as Jason Bourne), the fight scenes were realistic and the direction from Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) was brilliant.<br/><br/>Following straight from the events of The Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne is still trying to find out who he is while evading assassins sent from the CIA as well as a government agent hell-bent on killing Bourne.<br/><br/>As said before, The Bourne Ultimatum is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish and is a very satisfying conclusion to an awesome trilogy. The main issue I had with the movie was the camera-work. The whole movie was just shaky and by the halfway mark it was getting annoying and it was a really distracting thing. I think Greengrass needs to steady up with the camera and only use the ""shaky-cam"" technique during fight scenes and not throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Aside from that The Bourne Ultimatum is an amazing action movie and one of the best this year.<br/><br/>4/5"

","I just saw this movie tonight and sadly I think the cameraman was an advanced epileptic. The camera-work beyond SUCKED!!! I sat in the middle of a 250-300 seat theater and after about 30 minutes of trying to get my eyes to focus for more than a millisecond (even during quiet scenes of conversation), I had a raging headache. It was simply impossible to follow the action and it was not just annoying; it ruined the movie. It would have been really nice for Universal Pictures and the audience if after reading the script, taking the time to meticulously choreograph the action, chase, and fight scenes, and paying all those nice people lots of money to act it out if Paul Greengrass had thought to actually have had it filmed professionally instead of having a drunken chimp wave a second-hand video camera in the vague direction of the action. What a waste of time and effort. It makes no difference how good the action is, how good the script is, how good the acting is, etc. if you are unable to follow what the hell is happening on the screen! Don't go see this. Wait till it comes out on video and then just listen to the audio when you rent it."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","7","6 August 2007"," Sequel! Sequel!
","Notice is served right from the first shots: the hand-held camera is here to stay, like it or not. But this second time around (for Paul Greengrass) is much better. For us mere mortals, the images are confusing enough and a simpler plot line wouldn't hurt. In Bourne Ultimatum, that is what we get: the protagonist following one lead after another, in a continuing pursuit of a final answer  the standard formula for a thriller. The beauty is in the execution. It's no accident that movie critics unanimously give Paul Greengrass something akin to a standing ovation.<br/><br/>So you know the game; now to the players. In this third installment, the reinforcement in the star pool comprises three. Screen tough guy Scott Glenn plays the chief villain, the CIA big shot behind an illegal project to develop human killing machines. His dirty work is done through a ruthless bureau chief, played by David Strathairn whose talents are not really challenged here. In an almost cameo appearance is Albert Finney whom we first see in a few snapshots (literally) until his appearance in the final minutes. The two regular ladies, cool CIA agents, both take on a different role, switching from Bourne's adversaries to his allies. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) answers to her conscience when she smells a rat and becomes a whistle blower at the risk of her own safety. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) runs an even bigger risk (about one second from being fatally shot) to become ""the woman behind the man"", accompanying him and helping him through his quest.<br/><br/>In my IMDb users comments on ""Bourne supremacy"", I suggested that without the romance dimension, it became far less engaging than ""Bourne identity"", and further suggested that Stiles' role may be developed towards that direction in the third installment. Do we get this in ""Bourne ultimatum""? Yes and no. While Nicky Parsons is by Bourne's side throughout the middle section of the movie, the feeling between them is handled subtly, and appropriately so, as they are two professional secret agents on the run for their lives. It's only when asked why she helped him that Nicky reveals just a glimpse of her feeling, saying that with him, her job (of being his adversary earlier) has been very difficult. Then with a faint smile (one of the only two times Stiles did in this movie, which is most unfortunate as she has such a beautiful smile), she asks if he remembers anything between them. The romance element is left at that, plus her comforting hand on his in a later scene when he is distressed by the memory of all the killings he did. Maybe more in the next one, if they make one.<br/><br/>With the plot line relatively simple and the romance angle somewhat undeveloped, Bourne Ultimatum's main focus is still the action sequences. While the action takes place in a half-dozen cities, there are three key locations  London, Tangier and New York  which essentially structure the movie into three movements, not unlike that in a concerto. Out of the relentless parade of one exciting action sequence after another, two particularly brilliant ones stand out. At the beginning of the movie Bourne arranges a rendezvous with a journalist (a vital source to allow the quest to continue) at the crowded Waterloo station in London, amidst CIA sharp shooters with clear orders to kill. At the mid-point of the movie, after Bourne linked up with Nicky in Madrid, they followed a trail to Tangier for another source, but are themselves in turn pursued by more CIA killers. Rather than risking failure to do justice to these two and other superb sequences, let me just say, again, that it is no accident that film critics have unanimously hailed Greengrass as the best action director around today.<br/><br/>The ""thinking audience"" will also find satisfaction in this movie, in Matt Demon's memorable portrayal of a complex character in a dark and somber struggle with the devil within.<br/><br/>Finally, the clever ending montage is worth mentioning. It starts with a camera that keeps cutting back and forth between Nicky in a café watching the news on TV about the apprehension of the villains in the Bourne case and Bourne's body (continuing from an earlier sequence when he jumped into the river after being fired at) motionless under water. As the cutting back and forth continues, we can clearly see the concern on Nicky's face, until it came over in the news that after three days of underwater searching, Bourne's body was still not found. As we see a smile spread on Stiles' lovely face (the second one), the camera cuts back one more time to the hitherto stationary body, which suddenly came to live and swam away. ""Sequel, sequel"", you can almost hear the voice inside you clamour."

","The abysmal cinematography spoiled what should have been a 10 star movie for our entire group. We were unanimously annoyed with the latest fad of jerky photography, zooming in and out on the characters and poorly framed scenes. As irritating as it is on the small screen in TV shows such as '24', that's nothing compared to the nausea it evokes when magnified for the movie theater. Does a typical audience really want to be continually reminded that this is just a movie? How many of the viewers were actually able to appreciate the amazing stunts? What a waste! <br/><br/>Despite the inclination to leave 5 minutes into the movie, we stuck it out and yes, the acting and story line were amazing. I'm not sure we could sit through it again, particularly on the big screen, without a heavy dose of Dramamine, but Matt Damon, Julia Stiles and Joan Allen were worth seeing it at least once. We might have liked David Strathairn as well, if most of his scenes hadn't made us feel like we were watching '24' reruns.<br/><br/>Our vote would be 10 for the writing and acting, and 0 for the directing and cinematography.

That ranks as one of my favorite comments, up there with ""This is what happens when your mother owns a production company"" for Dungeons and Dragons and ""We get it!"" for Snow Falling on Cedars. Sure the camera work is abominable--I would have had to leave the theater if this was on a large screen. The best video commentary is Milos Forman on Amadeus-- you can see his concern in making the story clear-- he worried that viewers would not understand the character walking thought the snow-- yes-- movies must be clear. Hitchcock knew to never hide stuff from the audience and that is all that passes for plot in this movie. People running to bad camera work and muddled storytelling do not make a great film-- it makes pretentious crap. As a technical worker I am also appalled by all the improbabilities-- his hands bleeding in one scene and Palmolive-smooth from then on. The way the phones and gizmos work was also pretty fanciful. I would like to think that the women that put all the secret documents into the FAX machine had them upside down-- all that got sent was the blank backs of the documents. And we all know about Hitchcock's McGuffin, but would the bad guys really keep every single incriminating thing in a handy set of files? After hanging around the mob and biker gangs I assure you that nobody, I mean nobody, acts the way these people do. Monologuing- they made fun of it in the Incredibles, I mean how can you have yet another boring chase if Jason Bourne does not call the antagonist and tell him he is in his office? Why not just run around downrange at the drunken redneck shooting academy? That is suspenseful too. And every time someone really has the jump on Jason, they go all squishy-- the girl in Tangier's, the women lead, and most unbelievably, the hit-man at the end. Yeah, the mob hit-men I knew always stopped and questioned their role in the universe when their mark made a sagacious comment. Oh, and Jason always tries to save the bad people's life, in real life he would kill everyone he comes across including the janitors, the children, and 20 or 30 other innocent people.

Paddy Considine was fine but he usually is in all his roles but he was killed very quickly into the film so not much of a chance to show the good public on his acting abilities.

","I waited with anticipation for the third Bourne movie to come out. I had enjoyed the other two and was hoping that the Bourne Ultimatum would be at least as good. It was mostly good. Questions about Bourne's life got answered. It was another great adventure for Jason Bourne. Pamela Landy again played an understanding CIA supervisor who kept giving Bourne the benefit of the doubt. I liked her character. Her role was smart and professional in spite of the fact that her superiors seem to have nothing but ""Get Bourne"" on their minds. She ended up doing the right thing even at the risk of her career. The personal connection with Nicky Parson was a good twist. I can see using her as a transition into a fourth movie if they decide to make one. Matt Damon is believable as Jason Bourne. You feel that he can take any challenge, be it physical or intellectual and come out on top. Nothing seems to be able to stop him if he decides to do something. He knows exactly what to do an any situation. I also like the fact that Bourne has a heart and a human side. I like action movies and with the Bourne Ultimatum you get a lot of it. But I like to actually see the action. The use of the ""shaky camera"" was a negative for me. If fact, it became irritating. Too often the action scenes happened in a blur. I tried to follow the bits and pieces of action but it was an effort. Maybe they have lost sight of the fact that movies are a visual media. For example in Madrid, Bourne fights another operative. It seemed like the fight went on forever. You see lots of movement and snippets of of action by the camera and the actors, but it's mostly a blur. I actually got tired of Bourne and the other agent hitting each other. I thought, ""Enough Already!"" The Bourne Ultimatum is definitely an action movie and I'll probably go back and see this movie while it's still in the theaters."
"macktan894","10","5","10","13 August 2007"," Ultimatum features Jason Bourne, professional agent
","This rates up there with Godfather in terms of successful 2 & 3-part movies. Their success has a lot to do with Matt Damon and both directors, Doug Liman (Identity) and Greengrass (sequels). While each movie can no doubt stand on its own, I can't imagine why anyone would want to see one without knowing the others. To appreciate Jason Bourne's full character arc, you have to start with the full amnesiac Jason, who Damon probably plays as David Webb--respectful, smiling at times, boyish--until he's put under pressure and Bourne takes over.<br/><br/>Anyone seeing this movie cannot be late. The opening sequence in Moscow is thrilling and beautifully filmed. The pulsating Bourne music that accompanies him trudging the the snow, the camera focusing on his feet, is to die for. Those who know Supremacy well, immediately realize that we are being shown what happened after he confessed his misdeeds to Neski's daughter and left her apartment. He had been shot earlier by a KGB agent, whom he probably killed in a devastating car crash. The Moscow police are still after him, and Bourne must elude them. While this opening scene is not as incredible as the bridge/train chase scene in Supremacy, it is almost as intense. A perfect way to get you charged for this film.<br/><br/>I happened to like the first half of this movie better than the last half. The scenes shot in Waterloo where he is trying to help a naive reporter who's been caught up in drama he doesn't understand is the perfect stage for a highly trained professional like Jason Bourne. This is his business. If you are ever caught up in a situation with Bourne, you'd be really stupid not to follow his advice. His instincts are always spot on.<br/><br/>We also see a hollow man. His scenes with Nicky contrast sharply with those in which we've seen him with Marie. He picks up on Nicky's hint that perhaps they had a thing at one time, but Jason is still grieving Marie. And he now accepts that anyone associated with him is a target. Compare the scene in Identity in which he sat in a restaurant with Marie wondering why he would have a gun, multiple passports, and so much money in a safe deposit box to the scene with Nicky in the cafe where he is practically speechless and emotionless. Later, Nicky learns from Bourne that she'll have to run. She dyes her own hair and cuts it, too. Bourne once did that for Marie himself, after which they fell in love. Bourne simply escorts Nicky to a bus stop and sees her off.<br/><br/>I wish Straitharn and Scott Glenn had switched roles. Glenn would have been a better villain against Bourne. He's a real hardass. Straitharn plays his role like he's a bookkeeper.<br/><br/>I liked the Desh fight scene only because it showed Bourne as a professional at work, committed to destroying his adversary because it's his business. He doesn't recoil in horror after killing him, as he did in killing scenes in Supremacy. He's resigned himself to who he is as Jason Bourne, what he's forced to do to survive. And in the scene where he looks through Neil Daniels' burnt belongings, that big watch on his wrist, he looks like a g-man, investigating the evidence as he's been trained to do. He takes command wordlessly and imposes his authority instantly. This Bourne characterization is brilliantly played by Matt Damon, a character transformation as brilliant as Al Pacino in Godfather.<br/><br/>Yes, you really have to see all of them to appreciate one of them fully."

","I loved the movie for the story line but the action parts left me feeling sick to my stomach and with a headache. It was so fast and jerky that I had to look away during the action parts. My husband and I both sat there looking at each other in disbelief that the action portions were so poorly done. We came to the conclusion that the filming of the action scenes in such jerky flashes(almost as if they picked out a bunch of scenes clipped them out, threw them onto the floor picked them up and pieced them back together again at random)was just a cheap way of filming and less work for the actors and perhaps no need for extras. Other than that the storyline was great and we hope that when they make the next Bourne movie they will fire the person who did the filming and do a better job on the action scenes."

","After reading all the glowing reviews and having loved the first two Bournes, I was eager to see this film. And, of course, with Matt Damon as the star, how could it be anything but great? But the reviewers must lack any kind of discrimination because the film was a bore. And it didn't even star Matt Damon. It starred the camera, which was a complete ham throughout: bobbing, weaving, leaping, panning, jumping, spinning, doing everything but capturing real action. The fight scenes were what I call ""Tarzan and the Snake"" shots. (In 1981's ""Tarzan, The Ape Man"" we don't actually see our loin-clothed hero battle a snake, just some quick still shots.) Damon was, as usual, strong, but the story, when you could see it, was nothing but all the chase scenes you've seen in a hundred films from ""Bullitt"" to every Bond. Stiles, Allen, Strahairn, Finney et al were wasted, the apartment-jumping chase scene (borrowed from the last MI) was hilariously unlikely (doesn't anybody live in that neighborhood?). Pity, the first two Bournes were tight, exciting, believable. This was a string of clichés lensed by a cameraman on too much caffeine by producers who had the arrogance to think that today's reviewers are so film-illiterate that they would fall for lots of fast-moving shots but very little real action. And damned if they weren't right."

","For ruining a perfectly good film because you couldn't afford a flippin' TRIPOD! The movie was fast (more like a blur), action packed (I guess, couldn't see much because of the camera-work), and suspenseful (that it was). I recommend waiting for a much smaller screen, and if you get the time, drop ol' Paul an email and tell him where to stick his hand-held.<br/><br/>For the record, the only resemblance it bears to the novel is the character and the title, so if you need another Bourne fix, read the book.

The producers should be scathed for allowing the camera work. Bourne Supremacy wasn't near this bad, so if the hand-held camera action bothered you in Supremacy, don't even see this one.

This is simpler and because it is not a cartoon and chase-oriented rather than battle-oriented it grabs better.<br/><br/>Both are made by untalented men advised by brilliant producers. In this case, its Doug Liman, who has made study of how the eye can be diced. What he's done is take the standard camera techniques for excitement and toned them up a bit.<br/><br/>The model is Tony Scott. In fact, the Scott model is followed so stringently, we have that teletype effect and sound when we are told where the action has moved to. Can we finally get rid of that, please? Its as disruptive as that business of the red line moving across a map used to be.<br/><br/>The camera is otherwise inherently cinematic and ""there."" By there, I mean even in the quiet segments, we are reminded that it is a hand-held camera. The interesting thing is that you can see that a machine is putting those jiggles in as no cameraman could be that random. Its not a human eye but a robot one pretending to be so.<br/><br/>But you probably won't notice that. You'll notice, as I did, that when the fights happen, you see flashes as the participants would, When you run, you see irrelevant motion as a runner and someone following him would, and taking cues from that amazing section at the beginning of ""Casino Royale."" <br/><br/>So why did I like ""Transformers"" better? You'll laugh when I tell you. Because the story is more intelligent, and elements of it relevant to the cinematic adventure. Here's an example: the concept in Transformers is that we have a hyperactive, flitting eye. So we are prepared for this by being shown a robot with the same hyperactive vision disorder (and we see things through its eyes).<br/><br/>That's not the case here. The story is one of recovered memory, of bits coming together to make sense. The cinematic basis is the opposite. Oh, there's some cinematic memory, the type of stuff from ""Manchurin Candidate,"" (with the ""memory"" film incongruously striped with use and faded by exposure). That's old model, and it fits the story such as it is.<br/><br/>The new cinematic vision is merely bolted on, the way that car chase was bolted on in ""French Connection."" That was about as exciting in its day. Go and watch that movie today and see how bad it is, and you'll see what we'll be thinking about this in 35 years. But it IS a rush if you see it now.<br/><br/>Scott Glenn does a good job. Everyone else is a prop.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

To be a really good film, some element of believability needs to exist in context - in this there were moments which were just plain ridiculous. For example -when Bourne gets into the CIA guys office when the CIA guy is in a car supposedly going to meet him. DUH - was Bourne invisible or something to be able to just walk into the CIA HQ and up to the Deputy Directors office without being challenged?? And how did he know where the safe was in that office? Why, he just walked into the 'empty' building opposite, found himself the perfect 'empty' office overlooking the CIA guys office and watched him open the safe and somehow even knew that it was a voice code that opened it.<br/><br/>Far too many of these kind of blatant, lazy 'solutions' to situations that conveniently kept Bourne one step ahead of the bad guys in order to keep the film jogging along until it could wind itself up.

","I love the Bourne series, books and films, and so it was with great expectations that I went to see Ultimatum, the latest in the series. Imagine my extreme disappointment when I discovered this great story had apparently been shot on a Handycam by a cameraman with a nervous twitch!! Why is it that some directors (often quite decent directors!)feel they have to resort to the very amateurish appearing ""live cam"" approach. Don't get me wrong this method has it's place, usually as a crutch for tired TV shows in an attempt to make it look as if there is more going on than there actually is, but when you have such an action packed script and great actors, like in the Bourne Ultimatum, why go there? A pet hate? perhaps, but I do find this particularly annoying during still (i.e a normal conversation around a table) or heartfelt (when an actor or actress is expressing some inner feelings) moments and the camera goes twitching and wandering off subject as if being held by a bored child desperate to go wee wee! Completely unnecessary and detrimental to this good (could have been great!) movie. Rant over. On to the movie itself; As I have already intimated the Bourne Ultimatum is an action packed romp with a great cast, some excellent understated acting and a fairly credible story to tie all the action together and could have been one of greatest action flicks of all time, a strong 9/10 - it's such a shame about the desperate direction hence only 6/10 from me."

If that's the way action movies are going to be done now, I'm giving them up. A few witty lines and a lot of blurred movement and you walk out with a head ache and confusion.

","From the first few minutes of this film and until the sorry end one thought dominated every other. A question, 'why can't the camera stop shaking?' How much coffee did the camera operator have? Did he have Parkinson's? Was there and earthquake? Why, after having paid good money to see a movie, am I compelled to close my eyes to relieve my nausea? This film was very deliberately made to look like it was shot by a hyper-active twelve year-old with a brand new camcorder and a fascination with zooming. Regrettably its becoming a fad in movies today. I'm not against a hand held camera, its just another color on the cinematographers palette. But a one color painting? I'm not against intentional camera shaking. It has been used to great effect in Star Trek, for example, to simulate a hit from the Klingons. With Bourne Ultimatum, whatever chase or shooting or car crash on the screen was in direct proportion to the spinning and jerking and zooming of the camera. More action = more blurry shakes.<br/><br/>BU was like one of those irritating shows that has music in every scene from start to finish. Why is that done? To create a sense of drama where the visuals and acting have failed to do so.<br/><br/>Apparently Paul Greengrass was insecure about his ability as a director and resorted to this cheap gimmick in order to give the movie a kind of first person reality feel. It was either insecurity or pretentiousness that would explain his ignorance or contempt for all of the conventions and innovations of movie making, like steadicam. Sitting in the theater I found myself thinking, not about the movie but about the director, 'what is he trying to do?, why doesn't he respect his audience?' From the back rows of the stadium seating I looked down at the couple of hundred other people there. They had paid to be there like me and I could see them all, transfixed, looking at the screen above them when I had an uncomfortable thought about what suckers we all are.<br/><br/>OK apart from the tremor-cam I give this movie five stars as part three of a trilogy. If you liked Bourne 1 & 2 then you might like this one. Its like eating yesterdays leftover pizza. Its the same thing but not fresh and its cold. There is no ""warmth"" to this movie. No romance and not a single likable person and not a single smile until the very end. As a stand alone movie it falls completely flat. We don't find out anything about what Bourne thinks or feels until fully three fourths into the film. All we know is that Matt Damon is having some bad flashbacks and he is going to find out why and beat the crap out of anyone that gets in his way. <br/><br/>Also, before the movie starts we are told to turn off our cell phones, evidently so we can devote the next two hours to watching people talk on their cell phones. Yes,in this flick, there is a lot of cell phones and LED screens and the video game feel is unmistakable. My advice, stay home and play a video game or read a comic, but if you must see this movie, take some Dramamine before."

To be fair, I never saw the 2nd film in this series, but it seems to not be an issue as the relevant plot developments are mentioned like 3 or 4 times in this film (ad nauseam). I didn't really care about the characters. <br/><br/>The negative complaints about this film are dominated by complaints about the shaky camera work during some action sequences. Though it makes it harder to understand exactly what's happening, I accepted it. But now that I look back, I think that the camera was shaken just to make the scene feel more exciting than it actually was. I suspect that the people who think that these action sequences are good are those who either a) like overstimulation (e.g., loud music at clubs) or possibly b) really like the realistic feel that they add. The realism is, I guess, a selling point of the Bourne films.<br/><br/>Here's what I liked about this film: The first full-scale action sequence was cool and novel. I really thought the film was going to take off at that point.<br/><br/>The second major sequence had its moments, but I wound up fantasizing about how it could be better.<br/><br/>There were very tiny, clever things that Bourne did which I thought were cool.<br/><br/>Toward the end of this film I thought about leaving.

Maybe if Bourne walked for 10 seconds that was a new scene. Each camera shot was one or two seconds max. It was MTV style direction. Total headache inducing cinematography. There was virtually no plot at all. I was bored. This is a good movie to go see at a drive in because you can talk throughout the whole second half of the movie and not miss a thing.

"Kevin_Maness","6","6","14","11 August 2007"," Not all that great, actually
","The Bourne Ultimatum, like the other 2 movies in the so-called trilogy, promises to be three things, and fulfilling any of the three promises would make it a satisfactory moviefulfilling all three could make it great. It promises to be a political thriller, a psychological drama, and a pure action movie. Unfortunately, the Bourne films, especially this one, fail to deliver on all three promises. The first two are obviousthe politics of the movie are way too vague to support a plot (ooooh, there are shadowy conspiracies running amok in the higher echelons of the security establishmentso original), and the Bourne character is so underdeveloped (and the amnesia plot so hackneyed) that I don't see how anyone could care about these movies as psychological dramas. That leaves action.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum comes closest to delivering when it comes to its promise to be a good action flick. There are fight scenes, chases, explosions, near-death experiences, and tense confrontations. But I have a problem with the way the action sequences in the Ultimatum are filmed (this has been true of all three Bourne movies): the fight sequences are so fast and chaotic, that you really can't tell what's happeningyou take it on faith that Jason Bourne is kicking the bad guy's ass, and when the bad guy's on the ground when things settle down, you figure you must have been right. I guess it's kind of like the Psycho shower scene on crystal meth. And maybe that's the point. Hitchcock would have liked to have shown more actual violence, gore, bloodshed, and nudity, but he knew he could never get that kind of scene past the censors, so he got creative, and since Hitchcock was a genius, his creativity produced a murder sequence that is probably better than anything more gory and explicitly violent could have been. I have a feeling that the action sequences in Bourne have been shot and edited in this hyper-fast, frenetic style, in part, to secure the valuable PG-13 rating. After all, what's Bourne supposed to be good at? Inflicting unthinkable injuries on people in a very short time. If we really got to see this clearly, it would be gross. It would not be PG-13 fare. Plus, Matt Damon would have to know how to fight really well, or the filmmakers would have to get even more clever with stunt doubles. Instead, we get fight scenes in a blender and chase scenes shot so close that we don't know whose car we're seeing, what direction we're going in, or who's crashing into whom.<br/><br/>OK, so, what's the problem? After all, I love Hitchcock, and I think the impressionistic shower scene was brilliant. So why do I dislike the action sequences in Bourne movies? Well, when I see an action film, I guess I've grown accustomed to seeing the action. My complaint about Batman Begins was the same: this guy trained to be a bad-ass fighter, and now whenever I see a fight scene it's too sliced up and dark for me to get a good look at him using those hard-won skills. Give me Jet Li or Michelle Yeoh...or even Bruce Willis...anydayI'm paying $10.50 for my action, so I'd like to see it please.<br/><br/>There will be more Bourne movies. But I think I've paid to see my last one."
"aimless-46","2","5","11","8 September 2007"," For Those Still Debating Paying To See This
","Occasionally a film will come along that will leave me feeling totally disconnected from the movie-viewing (or at least the theatre-going) public. This was certainly the case with ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), whose popularity with viewing audiences and critics made me feel like I had grown up in some other culture and never learned the language of films. Because my disconnect was so total I have spent a bit of time reading reviews and comments, trying to pin down the reasons for my ""somewhat"" contrarian reaction. I say ""somewhat"" not because of my degree of disconnect but because I am not alone in these feelings, a fair number of viewers have had negative reactions as extreme as my own.<br/><br/>So for the benefit of those who are thinking about viewing the film here are a few points that may help you predict your reaction.<br/><br/>1. Have you seen the first two films? ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is the third film in a popular trilogy based on a series of popular books. I had neither seen the first two films nor read the books. This is a bandwagon I had avoided (my attendance at the third film was almost accidental-I had some time to kill one afternoon and it was the film that was closest to starting when I arrived at the ticket window). I had avoided them despite being a huge Julia Stiles fan, mostly because I dislike Matt Damon almost as much as Titanic Leo. But my reaction to Damon's performance was unexpectedly positive in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" so that turned out to be a non-factor. You probably will enjoy the film more if you know about the franchise and the background of the story. Not so much because it is all that hard of a mental exercise to follow the rather simplistic storyline but because of the second factor I am about to discuss.<br/><br/>2. Can you identify with the Jason Bourne character? I think this was a key reason for my own disconnect. Presumably most of those who who buy a ticket bring a ready-made identification with them, carried over from the first two films. If you don't already have it, don't expect it to happen during film three. At no point did I like, admire, or identify with this character; but I might have had I met him in the earlier films. <br/><br/>3. Can you suspend disbelief during action/conspiracy films that do not feature characters with superpowers or supernatural intervention, where a character exhibits implausible physical prowess? For me personally the Bourne franchise was doomed because of my inability or stubborn refusal to accept silly action sequences that have no credibility. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" reminded me a lot of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" without that film's element of humor. And while this exercise in excess is sometimes tolerable in obvious parody films like ""Ultraviolet"" or maybe not (insert ""Electra"" here), it just puts me to sleep when it is supposed to be taken seriously. My guess is that if you enjoyed Ronin"" (1998), ""The Ipcress File"" (1965), and ""Enemy of the State"" (1998); you will find the ""Bourne"" movies generally moronic.<br/><br/>4. Do you feel like a displaced person during your occasional visit to your local mega- multi-plex? Outside of some college towns you have to look long and hard to find anyone but wiggers and drones standing in line for Hollywood's latest saturation booked products. I'm not talking about the occasional family film or chick flick, but rather the standard dumbed-down blockbuster (both those that do well at the box office and those that tank). If so you have probably formed the same sort of theories about the sub-group of society that represent the target audience for this stuff and there is no need for me to elaborate. <br/><br/>5. Are you a big fan of computer generated sequences, fast editing, and production techniques that call attention to themselves? Most of the critical comments about ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" at least mention its reliance on ""unsteady cam"" filming and flurry editing. Like ""The Blair Witch"" stuff, these techniques are deliberately employed to create a subconscious disorientation in viewers; it is not the result of poor cinematography or cheap post-production work. Unfortunately they are done to such excess that they quickly call attention to themselves which tends to undermine any impact they might have had on the subconscious. Also, they are lazy ways to stage and to film action sequences, making most of this stuff on the authenticity level of ""Electra"". Unlike ""The Third Man"" and ""East of Eden"", where odd camera angles reinforce off- kilter ""moments"" in the story, the pervasive use of this stuff means that there are no normal scenes with which it can be contrasted.<br/><br/>Hopefully these five points will help you to determine in advance whether you should hit the theatre for this production. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","=== The Good Things First ===<br/><br/>Some compare Jason Bourne (his real name is revealed in the movie) with 007, and some even find the ""Bourne-approach"" better. I agree with both. From my perspective, Matt Damon is perhaps the perfect actor for his role. Stunnning Julia Stiles (Nicky) is the perfect Field Logistics Operative and Joan Allen (Landy) is the perfect CIA Senior Operative. I wouldn't trade these three actors for the world.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the perfect choice because he is good looking yet isn't buffed up by steroids. He looks and behaves intelligent in all three episodes. He behaves like an average guy when possible and certainly isn't a womanizing sleaze-ball like many other hero's. He doesn't need much words to explain things, yet it's clear what he means.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles. In the first episode the crew gave her some remarkable make up. In later episodes she looked increasingly average. Too bad. She's pretty anyway, but the way they did the make up the first time gave Nicky a special flair. In episode 2 the ""woman part"" was gone somewhat. And in part three - Ultimatum - she just looks like a girl. She should have looked like a responsible young woman - not girl. <br/><br/>Joan Allen gives us the impression that she's a rock solid, slightly old fashioned mature woman. She's the perfect choice for her role (Landy).<br/><br/>Another good aspect is that no ridiculous gadgets are used. No laser beams,spaceships, time machines or anything. In fact, the CIA Directors actually need to explain the use of their funds to a political hearing committee! Standard 9 mm pistols are used, along with bottles, pens, towels, a simple rifle (with scope), rented safe houses and fixed-income cars without a built-in flux capacitor.<br/><br/>Also, no annoying exaggerated love scenes occur and standard Hollywood techniques like ""let a guy die otherwise the story becomes too complex"" are not used as well. I highly value that.<br/><br/>=== The Bad Stuff in General ===<br/><br/>The good guys are still up for a fair fight. Hollywood needs to learn that a fictive hero like Jason Bourne shouldn't engage fair battles. Let him back-shoot for the love of God! For some reason Hollywood doesn't like that. Hollywood producers and directors are known for their lack of social courage. I'd bet that if Jason back-stabs a murdering traitor, no audience is going to be bothered by that. In fact, it would have made Jason Bourne even more of a professional: a multi-million dollar trained assassin.<br/><br/>Also, in general, in all three episodes I didn't like the lenses and filtering.<br/><br/>=== The Bad Stuff in Specific ===<br/><br/>Shaky camera. Way too shaky this time. The Shaky camera technique is often used for two purposes: 1) To give the movie an extra level of realism. 2) To hide incompetence.<br/><br/>The latter, was too obvious. To me it's clear that Matt Damon can't fight whatsoever. So they hide it with an extremely shaky camera. The solution is simple, rent an expert and guide him throughout the making of the movie. The rest is up to the camera team and editing. This movie has the potential to become the most interesting spy movie, and also to become the most interesting close combat movie as well. The latter was neglected, although close combat is a very important aspect of all three episodes.<br/><br/>Here's another thing that bothers me: Bourne is a bad actor I feel - although his appearance shows tons of potential. The best example of bad acting is to be seen in episode one (Identity) where he sits on a bench in the park in Switserland: ""Ich wil schlafen (I want to sleep)"". This type of acting is typical Matt Damon. I believe the director could have directed Matt better. But I do have to say in part three - Ultimatum - this was a little better hidden. But it was especially hidden because of too much camera shaking.<br/><br/>=== Verdict ===<br/><br/>The shaky-cam has too much impact, therefore I rate this movie 5 out of 10 stars. A most promising idea was ruined by the camera job."

","I was sleeping during half of this movie and still try to find out from which point it would be good to pay attention.

It is sad that this should not even be mentioned for a movie ""made in Hollywood"". I like the cast despite the fact that they do not seem to act with each other...only everybody plays with them self.I like the music...very cool.

","Hmmmm. . . why don't any of the cars involved in the car crashes have air bags? That's just a niggling little detail, but the movie is full of improbabilities and inconsistencies. It added nothing to what we had already seen and the first two installments did it better. I quickly became bored with the unimaginative chase scenes where you can't even tell what's going on. Same with the fight scenes. It is essentially the same plot as the first two movies. Maybe in the fourth installment Bourne will go after somebody that's even higher up in the food chain. There is no real attempt at character development here. The movie is aimed for those people who like hearing dramatic music leading up to car chases or fist fights. Obviously this is what a lot of people like, judging from the comments here, but I found the movie simply tedious after a while. I can not understand why it has received such high praise from critics."

","OK, I know how much people generally love this movie, already voted into the Top 250... But it's predictable in that it doesn't deviate from the standard way movies like these and James Bond films do. That's not to say the action in between isn't bad, it just feels unnecessary and bland because we are already 99% sure how it's going to end. And we're right.<br/><br/>Even still, trying to enjoy it anyways is hard. Someone, and I think literally, went insane in the editing room. What is the average shot time? Can't be more than about 1 & 1/2 seconds. Warning, this movie is likely to induce headaches for those of us old enough to remember when films weren't afraid to move slowly, or at least at jogging pace. Without so many cuts it would be much easier to appreciate the story and the locales. But maybe nobody really cares about those types of things anymore. I don't mean to be a killjoy, although this movie deserves it."
"danielwill","6","5","11","5 August 2007"," Exciting, but lacked characters and a real conclusion
","I really enjoyed the first two films, but this one was pointless.<br/><br/>First, the good news: Joan Allen proved once again she can say more in a single subtle look than many actors can say in an entire performance. You literally could see what she was thinking.<br/><br/>The chases and stunts were sensational. This series always comes up with things you haven't seen before. If all you want are stunning chase scenes, then this movie will be enough for you.<br/><br/>If you want characters, motivation or explanation, then this will feel futile.<br/><br/>Were are the characters? Bourne was--Bourne. We've seen him before, twice, and in those films we learned a little more about him each time.<br/><br/>This movie, should have explained not just what happened (since we basically knew) but WHY. Why did Jason agree to do this (or not). What motivated him? What was his relationship with these people before? Clearly he had his reasons, but we don't learn what they were! You know as much going into this film as you know after. So it turns into a loud, busy, pointless exercise.<br/><br/>And frankly, Bourne is now becoming almost a super-hero in his ability to survive virtually everything.<br/><br/>The endless use of jumpy hand-held, the closeups, the flash cuts all got tedious. Without the constant ""Stomp"" drumming that passed for a score it might have just seemed like a busy music video.<br/><br/>Casino Royale was brilliant because it made Bond, formerly a machine, into a real person. The Bourne Ultimatum does the exact opposite, changing Bourne from a person into to a machine."

","Taking a look at the IMDb ratings for the Bourne movies,I was surprised to find that unlike ""tradition"" with most franchises,that it was not the first,but the third which had the best ratings in the series,which led to me getting ready for the ultimatum on the series.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Leaning that newspaper reporter Simon Ross is doing stories about the secret CIA project which turned him into a deadly assassin,Jason Bourne decides to step out of the shadows and arrange a meeting with Ross. Believing Bourne to be Ross's informer,CIA Director Ezra Kramer keeps a close watch on Ross's contacts.Kramer sends his team up,when he gets details on Ross meeting Bourne. Ignoring requests for calm for CIA Deputy Pam Landy,Kramer orders his team to shoot Bourne and Ross at first sight. Seeing Ross fall to the ground dead,Bourne decides that he must now fully uncover the truth behind his secret past. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Following an unlucky path of ""struggle"" which has become an unofficial tradition of the films,the original screenplay by returning writer Tony Gilroy was rushed to completion so that Gilroy could go and make his directing debut,which led to Matt Damon (who did not speak to Gilroy for years after) to call his script unreadable"" and a potential ""career-ender"" for Gilroy. Picking up the pieces left by Gilroy,the screenplay Scott Z. Burns/ George Nolfi and Gilroy impressively overcomes the production problems to deliver a fitting coda to the trilogy. Sending Bourne back on the run,the writers build a firm coalition between the action crunch of the second and the tense espionage of the first.<br/><br/>Cleverly linking the films together with an unannounced flashback,the writers peel Bourne's past open with splinted flashbacks which fuel Bourne's heightened espionage wits to counter the scrutiny that the CIA are putting him under. Smashing through windows to the action set-pieces,the writers show a remarkable skill in pace,where every small encounter with a spy or assassin progresses to a rough hand to hand combat scene or an edge of the seat chase.Whilst the action is allowed to dazzle,the writers keep everything strongly rooted to the mission,as each turn Bourne takes to uncover his past presses the CIA to take extreme measures.<br/><br/>For what was his final in the series for 9 years,director Paul Greengrass lands the action scenes with a mighty thump,setting off bone crunching fight scenes where Greengrass keeps a good distance so that the viewer can cleanly see each knock out move,to Greengrass and cinematographer Oliver Wood firing up the vehicle chase scenes with gliding tracking shots and razor sharp edits capturing Bourne's ultimate chaos. Returning to the brittle anxiety of Identity,Greengrass and Wood brilliantly use space to web an atmosphere of mistrust,with eye-catching (shot on location) espionage chases in London & Tangiers being filled with a mood of intense doubt from every sway the camera takes to spot a spy/assassin waiting on the side-lines.<br/><br/>Taking over from Tomas Arana, Scott Glenn gives his take on Ezra Kramer a great tobacco chewing ruggedness,whilst returning ""Bourne Girls"" (!) Julia Stiles and Joan Allen give the title a touch of refined elegance as Nicky Parsons and Pam Landy.Trying to protect Paddy Considine's wet behind the ears reporter Simon Ross as future 007 crossover Albert Finney's Dr. Albert Hirsch grows in the background,Matt Damon gives an excellent performance as Bourne,thanks to Damon keeping the drive for Bourne's past to be uncovered at the center of all the action and spying thrills,as Bourne looks on his legacy."
"Screen_Blitz","10","2","3","31 July 2016"," Paul Greengrass grants Jason Bourne with the finest treatment yet
","Paul Greengrass concludes the trilogy with the most portrayal of our action hero Jason Bourne yet. After being introduced to the titular character in 2002, audiences everywhere experienced a major game changer for Matt Damon as he demonstrated a high-octane performance. The first installment introduced the CIA agent with an intense character study of a man with a loss memory and trying to recover his past that made him the gun- totting assassin he is. The sequel continued the story with more hyperkinetic action and thrills. Paul Greengrass however, ignited the real deal in this third installment. Concluding with some explosive action sequences while balancing a polished narrative heft, this film achieves the rare accolade of improving on both it's first and second predecessor -- something -- it is difficult to point out any aspect this doesn't improve on. So this film follows Jason Bourne who's once again stripped away from his peaceful life, to search for CIA official Neal Daniels (played by Colin Stinton) who happens to be in possession of valuable information that holds secrets to his past. During his mission, Bourne must also dodge vicious assassins appointed by Operation Treadstone director Noah Visen (played by David Straithairn) to hunt him down despite the orders of CIA Deputy director Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) who suggest them leave him be. This all comes down to a mission that defines the very person Jason Bourne. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass continues his immersive style congruent to what we brought in 'Bourne Supremacy', only much better. From the energetic camera-work, the compelling action sequences, an intriguing storyline, and his overall covered direction all come together to conclude the film trilogy with a bang. The film opens with a tense action scene with Jasom Bourne on a train, and following this is a suspenseful airport scene where he comes face- to-face with British journalist Simin Ross (played by Paddy Considine) in an operation that quickly sets the story in motion. The sequence is both tension-filled and shot very beautifully but this is only the beginning. The story continues through an extraordinary journey of visceral character developments, realistic hand-to-hand combat (shot with slightly better camera-work than in the previous film), and a plot with interesting nuances about the characters including Julia Kate who's character is now granted a more prominent role than in the previous entries. By the end, it all comes down to Jason Bourne discovering the true meaning of his past and how he became the ruthless CIA agent we know him for. Is there anything the story leaves unexplored? Maybe, but hardly anything crucial is left abandoned here. And the result is something truly fascinating.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatim is a spectacular conclusion to the Bourne trilogy, and this is all thanks to both the compelling performance by lead Matt Damon as well as Paul Greengrass's stunning directorial efforts. This is easily one of the best action films of it's decade, it not only places Greengrass in the front ranks of action filmmakers but also leaves a landmark on the action flick genre."

","The third installment serves as an attempted conclusion to an ongoing series yet suffers by falling into a similar routine of the previous two film.

A new set of spies seeks to cover up the evil government assassin program when a witness to Bourne's inception leaks information to a reporter, an interestingly prescient scenario. Bourne is still plagued by memories of how he was tortured to mold him into a superhuman, so he contacts the reporter only to discover, the agents are tracking their moves.<br/><br/>Ultimatum establishes the signature Bourne chase scene that was so successful the last two films. Matt Damon runs and ducks and occasionally throws explosive stuff behind him to distract and hinder the authorities in their relentless pursuit. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) pops back up and she has fully converted to Bourne's side despite still working for the spy agency.

","The Bourne Ultimatum is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very well done third Installment, which can't be easy to do, it had two films to compare itself to and managed to make itself just as good, if not better, than its predecessors, it's certainly the most intense, it's an action packed film that will keep you at the edge of your seat literally until the credits come up. The only thing I think this film is missing that is very evident in both Identity and Supremacy is slower, dialogue based scenes, Matt Damon had some great moments with Franka Potente in the first film, and plenty with Julia Stiles in the second, but this movie never really takes much time to slow down and just develop Jason Bourne's character some more, it certainly could have done with it. The highlight of the movie is of course Matt Damon who dosen't seem one bit tired of playing Jason Bourne, he is just as much dedicated here as he ever was previously, he clearly loves playing the character and does so with pure charisma, and I hope to see him portray Bourne some more in the future. An action packed thrill ride that goes by very fast, the Bourne Ultimatum is a delight and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. <br/><br/>A former CIA hit man suffering with amnesia joins forces with a reporter in order to uncover the truth about his past. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Matt Damon"

","If I had to choose one of these films I would definitely choose this one as my favorite. I didn't choose this one because the action is great. I didn't choose this one because the chase scenes are pretty damn good. I chose this one because Julia Stiles plays a much bigger role in this one than the other two together. I have a crush on Julia Stiles, sue me.<br/><br/>Let's get my favorite scenes out of the way. The first scene I like is the train station scene. I like how Jason Bourne tries to help Simon Ross, a journalist. Simon Ross is writing a newspaper article about Bourne, Treadstone, and Blackbriar. The CIA tries to take out Simon Ross and, despite the help of Jason Bourne, succeeds.<br/><br/>My next favorite scene is when Jason and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) take a trip to Tangier. Jason and Nicky get separated and an assassin is sent after both of them because they were trying to get information from Neal Daniels. The assassin, Desh Bouksani, kills Daniels and thinks he kills Bourne. Bourne realizes that he and Nicky are now in danger and chases after Desh to save Nicky. The best part of Bourne chasing after Desh is his running along the rooftops of Tangier and getting into a fist fight with Desh.<br/><br/>The next favorite scene is Jason being chased across New York City. At one point he drives off the roof of a parking structure, which begins the chase. He steals a police car and is chased by another assassin named Paz. Paz forces Jason into a barricade and they both crashes. They both survive the crash and Jason aims a gun at Paz, but doesn't pull the trigger. Later Paz asks Jason why he didn't pull the trigger. Jason doesn't answer, but he asks Paz if he even knows why Paz is supposed kill him.<br/><br/>I suggest watching all of these movies. I give this 10 stars out of 10."
"p-stepien","6","2","3","2 January 2011"," A admirable if vastly imperfect finale
","After what transpires in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" Jason Bourne is a wanted man by the C.I.A., even more so that a British journalist for ""The Guardian"" is starting to dig into his history and also seems to have gained access to highly confidential data concerning the Blackfriar operation, the second phase of Treadstone, which created our title hero. Jason Bourne soon traverses to London to contact the journalist, where he is forced to do his best to save the unsuspecting man's life...<br/><br/>A much better outing than ""The Bourne Supremacy"" the final act at least succeeds where the second part failed: the action. The long Tangers fight sequence or the Waterloo train station escape, where Bourne tries to lead the journalist out of danger, are extremely well done and very well worth the watch, as suspenseful and intriguingly executed scenes.<br/><br/>Nonetheless the last part suffers from the same weaknesses as its predecessor - the script is nowhere as tight as would be required for this movie to be called a success. In the most part it is nowhere as poorly scripted as ""The Bounce Supremacy"", but several scenes stick out like a sore thumb. For example when Bourne breaks into the C.I.A. to steal Blackfriar documents only to inform the department director that he is now in his office, even though this had no sense and meant Bourne lost valuable minutes to escape. Suicidal on Bourne's part? An attack of cockiness? Or just the scriptwriter thinking that this would be a cool idea? I'm quite certain it is the latter. I'm not sure if the end effect is cool, but it certainly shows Bourne as being irresponsible and prone to stupidity. Which totally misses the gist of the character...<br/><br/>Also some of the direction is off and several subplots are never properly dealt with. I am unaware whether this happened in the editing room or whether this is just an inherent flaw of the script. Nonetheless there are several pieces of the puzzle which are left hanging in a very hack-job fashion. For instance suggestions of a deeper relationship between Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles, the only character apart from Bourne to be in all three parts) and our hero are never expanded on. Or we have countless suggestions that Bourne was recruited partly against his will to the Treadstone project, but in the end it turns out he did everything of his own free will. But than why did he have contradictory flashbacks? Or what's with the notes in the Treadstone report, which also seem to negate this option?<br/><br/>All in all I very much applaud the action in the final outing, but really the more you think about the movie the more imperfect and flawed it becomes. In the end it is a shame that only the first part managed to keep a relatively coherent and sensible script..."
"harrycloke","7","2","3","4 September 2010"," Great fun
","A typical criticism of the Bourne series is that it is all style over substance; flashy and fast-paced but lacking in heart. Were any tears shed at the departure of Bourne's love interest Marie (Franke Potente)? Do any viewers have even a vague interest the relationship that is hinted at between Bourne and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles)? I would go as far as to question whether the primary Bourne audience has much concern for the character of Jason Bourne and the truth behind his identity. This is a series of films so slick and disinterested that they often seem to hold you at arm's length whilst you take in the absurdity of what's occurring on screen. Luckily, to make up for this Bourne assaults your senses in such bombastic fashion as to make such concerns irrelevant. Every roller-coaster is built to make money, but if it's built well, it's also a damn fun thrill ride, even if it fails to live on in our memory for too long.<br/><br/>Ultimatum actually serves as something of a prequel/sequel to Supremacy as the concluding scene of the second instalment is repeated and expanded upon somewhere in the middle of this film. But, we open where the action in Supremacy ended, with our favourite amnesiacally-challenged superspy mid-chase (of course) as he attempts to avoid the Moscow police. Still plagued by flashbacks of an abstruse, curious past, Bourne now seeks answers from those who made him the man he is. At the same time the CIA are once again after Bourne believing him to be the man responsible for leaking important information regarding off-the-books taskforce Blackbriar to the British press. Plot summary be damned, the story primarily serves as an excuse for director Greengrass to execute a game of cat and mouse between Bourne and those who seek him across beautifully photographed locations in Europe and New York.<br/><br/>There are two major points of contention with this film: the camera-work and Matt Damon's performance. Supremacy and Ultimatum are labelled by some viewers as nauseating, headache-inducing due to Greengrass' insistence on 'shakey-cam' where the camera unrepentently nods and wobbles up and down instead of staying fixed and focus. It's not as effective here as it was when Greengrass utilised it during Bloody Sunday, United 93 or even the later Green Zone as those films often play with a kind of documentary realism absent from the clearly absurd Bourne.<br/><br/>Indeed if one looks too closely at Ultimatum it can affect adversely one's enjoyment of the film. At one stage, distracted by the frantic editing at witness in the film I began counting the length of every shot. Soon I became distracted by the camera-work and noticing its erratic path began to get that headache-feeling that everybody refers to when mentioning these films. Eventually though I gave up fighting the film and enjoyed it for what it is – a knock-about action jaunt that's fun so long as you roll with the editing techniques and the unpredictable nature of the camera. It is best just to let these things wash over you so as to not disturb your enjoyment of the film. Indeed, at times the camera can add a degree of intensity that would not be present in a steady-cam shot and can make the action-scenes even more forceful. It is an effective tool for ramping up the tension.<br/><br/>It has also been said that Matt Damon's performance is too one dimensional – that although he has the body of an action man doll, he also displays about as much emotion as those plastic features can. Although I don't agree with those on the other end of the spectrum who declare this a supreme, masterful performance, there's much about Damon's adept measured performance to recommend. He brings an intensity to the character which is necessary to drive the plot forward and carries off the various chase and fight scenes with aplomb. It's a good action performance in a role which is perhaps is non-too-demanding (at least in an emotional sense) and thus never fails to reach the kind of levels of, say, Bruce Willis in Die Hard.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a success because it plays to its strengths and delivers thrills and suspense, some might say despite the deviant camera-work. There's a technical brilliance underlying the tightly choreographed chase scenes (and one could argue this film is one long chase) that leaves you sometimes in awe. There is no doubting the kind of influence that Greengrass' directorial style and this series of films in particular have had on the way action films are presented to their audience. Quick edits and wild camera movements are now the blight of a good number of camera movements. Whatever you think of this legacy, it's a testament to Greengrass' ability that he was first to recognise the potential of this style and remains perhaps still the only one to fulfil it."

","I loved ""The Bourne Identity"" and enjoyed ""The Bourne Supremacy"" quite a bit, so I was looking forward to watching ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". Unfortunately this film is very difficult to watch due to the shaking camera and the flashing, sub-second scenes. I ended up closing my eyes and just listening to quite a bit of this movie in order to make it through to the end. <br/><br/>From what I did see, this movie could have been entertaining, though they might as well have put a Superman cape on Jason Bourne at times. That's part of the fun, though. I found it a little silly that Bourne was able to easily break into CIA headquarters and steal confidential material from a safe. (The building security folks must have been on lunch break.) It also seemed odd that he would call the CIA folks and let them know he was standing in their office, but it made for a more dramatic exit, I guess. These are very minor quibbles though, as I really don't want or expect realistic action in a movie like this.<br/><br/>Overall, I rated this move a 5/10. It could easily have received a 9/10 rating from me if I could have watched it all. Get rid of the gimmicky camera work (bouncing camera, sub-second scenes, and full screen shots of the back of someone's head and 1/3 of another person's face) and this movie would be very good."

","Well, first of all I like spy stories. So, I like the Bourne trilogy. Now, with this in mind, it's impossible for me to choose which is the best but for sure *not* this. A lot of things are cut and copied from the second, and overall in this one Bourne do things literally impossible (ok, it's a spy story, but not a comic!). Another thing I can't accept is that, like the second (same director Greengrass) the camera is unstable to show critic moments: at the end you feel like if you've played Doom for too much time with your eyes going up and down. Great directors can give the same without using this poor trick. So, this is (now) 126 in the IMDb Top 250, near Yojimbo, Per qualche dollaro in più and The sixth sense. If you like action movies with no brain watch this trilogy, if you like *great* movies stay away."

","Having not seen the films before (and not being able to stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see it for AS Film Studies. <br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a film with Damon in it could be enjoyable. <br/><br/>Fast fight scenes, crazy motorbike chases and BIG explosions were what threw you out of your seat in TBU. The near-misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, several things really grated my cheese.<br/><br/>Firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. Although Damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of Bourne. He crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something! Very unrealistic.<br/><br/>And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. We were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Fair enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching Damon and Stiles holding a conversation, but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently!<br/><br/>But all in all TBU is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. But I didn't think it was the best film of the year, despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.<br/><br/>8/10."
"NDanger","6","8","21","4 August 2007"," Why film it this way?
","Just saw the third chapter of the 'Bourne' franchise and I must say I was disappointed. Paul Greengrass needs to understand that the use of the Steadycam worked very well in United 93, a hypothetical documentary (I refrain from calling it a mock-umentary), it's use is NOT optimal with this subject. The action scenes are way to shaky, even the excessive close-ups are shaky. I noted this same problem when he directed the 2nd film of this series. This is an ACTION picture, I need to be able to make out what action is happening, not just that action is happening. The first director, Doug Liman, did a far better job of filming action scenes. In addition to that, there are a number of plot issues that I'll not outline in detail, but are notable enough for me to go ""What? they're just now figuring out she lied?"" or ""How did he get in there?"" Also, are supposed to have any character depth? Aside from Bourne having some flashbacks, where we mostly see the top of Jason's head, no one has or shows much emotion. There is some possible spots where some humanity could show, but we never get there. So, if the focus is supposed to be ""Who Am I...Really?"" and we are supposed to care, then this isn't that film."

","The super spy is Bourne.<br/><br/>With nothing else to live for, Jason Bourne seeks the final answers to the fractured memories and ghost recollections about what was done to him.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a rare third act for a film series; it isn't overblown, it doesn't contrive or skew to ""enhance"" the story outside of its themes for a bigger showdown. This is an effective conclusion that not only ties up the loose ends that our hero has been suffering, but also maintains a fantastic consistency with its previous films.<br/><br/>Something very few third parts ever manage.<br/><br/>Bourne Supremacy director Paul Greengrass returns to direct Matt Damon, and by 2007 the two men are well versed in what works and what doesn't. Especially for the Bourne films, and they deliver a roller-coaster urban thrill ride of action. Bouncing off the foundations of Bourne Supremacy, Ultimatum strikes it rich with its two leading ladies Julia Stiles and Joan Allen. Allen playing Pamela Landy, the only surviving official who has first hand knowledge of Bourne's skills and the only one prepared to help the situation, does an excellent job filling the sympathetic gap left by Brian Cox and making a layered character who answers much of the franchise's questions. In the antagonist role, asides from the half-dozen different super agents sent after Bourne, is David Strathairn, who doesn't rise too much farther than Chris Cooper did in Identity, but is a good fit in the role as a merciless official hunting down Bourne.<br/><br/>The role of a total schmuck who Bourne continuously runs rings around with spectacular fashion and incredible ease, more like. The film is as enjoyable and rewarding as it is thrilling and suspenseful!<br/><br/>We see Bourne in full super spy mode in this film, he is in control and cold as ice. There are pivotal scenes that show how Bourne has tried reconciliation, he's tried to let go of what he's done in the past but he cannot shake the memories that are resurfacing. What we get is a conclusion with Bourne on the warpath. An action movie through-and-through. The film opens with a fantastic scenario in London; where Bourne via phone is navigating someone else through a crowd to not be seen by officials. That should be really hard to film, but Greengrass nails it; you know exactly what's happening, the spaces involved and line of sight. It is followed by the chase in Morocco, a chase and fight sequence that was so incredible that it influenced the Bond franchise for a decade at least, as well as other movies in the genre. Granted there's more shaky-cam in the fight sequence again, but the steadier cinematography for the initial rooftop chase and incredible tension before that makes me go easier on it.<br/><br/>It is a tremendous movie and ties both the moodier Identity and the white-knuckled Supremacy together and actually builds on and improves them, delivering a hugely satisfying conclusion for Bourne in the process."

The acting, the direction, the action, the thrill, the sheer sense of intrigue that is carried throughout the film, everything is just excellent.

It is simply majestic. But this time around, it is just... magical. Right from the very first frame (The Universal Logo), the music is absolutely breathtaking.

","This review contains spoilers The Bourne Ultimatum is a fast paced drama about Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) who is an elite killer in search of answers about his own identity and why or how he has become what he is. While in search of these answers he finds himself up against the CIA and many assassins just like himself. He finds himself in a place where he cannot trust people possibly even himself. As the truth about his choice to join Treadstone is revealed he then must somehow come to terms with that choice. Prior to Ultimatum we had Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy. As the third piece of the Bourne series this is the first glimpse we have at the idea Jason choose his own path. He struggles with accepting himself and forgiving himself for all the awful things that he has done. This really does pose a question to the audience about morals and philosophies. Each person viewing the film has likely found themselves in search of who they are or questioning decisions and choices that they have made. The setting is one I dare say none of the audience has been in, but yet the message is there and takes them in for a very intense ride of self-knowledge. There are not just external conflicts in this film but there is the much bigger internal conflict that Jason has with himself. In this nonlinear story, Jason is the main character, the movie moves back and forth in time with flashes as we learn along with Jason about his choices and his past. Each of the cast play an important role in the film. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) becomes an alia in helping Bourne. The role of the corrupt CIA Agent Noah (David Strathairn) is very important in the story. Along with Simon (Paddy Considine) and Paz (Edgar Ramirez). The intense game of cat and mouse are played out like a beautifully choreographed dance. In the scene where Bourne has arranged to meet with Simone in London Waterloo Station the editing is brilliant in the cuts, sound and action. You feel the intenseness of all the parties involved from the CIA, Simon, Paz and Jason. You feel Simons panic and are on edge for him to calm himself so that things will not end bad. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) gives Bourne more information about who he is and what his real name is. She is seen as an alia of sorts by things that she says to Noah. She expresses that she did not sign up for what they are doing. She wants Jason alive. In addition to the actors themselves there is so much to be said about the editing and the sounds that bring this movie to life. The Desh (Joey Ansah) scene with its music and sound are absolutely amazing and who can forget the final scene where Jason has jumped from the building. The lighting, the sound or lack thereof are all perfectly done. As with film the use of symbolism is not absent in The Bourne Ultimatum. The use of water is like a baptism can Bourne be forgiven can he be cleansed of all his past? Can any of use every be rid of our past and understand who we really are?"

Bourne, a former agent, goes in search of answers, in a government agency, but the film has the aura of mystery to the very end. Why Bourne himself inscribed in the government program. The actors do an excellent job, the characters are interesting. But the rhythm and tension are of the highest level. Some of the best I've seen in an action movie. Car chases are among the best I've seen in movies, alongside the pursuits of another modern action classic, Ronin.<br/><br/>I have no words to describe this movie, one of the best action movies I've ever seen."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","11 October 2016"," Intelligent and fast-paced.
","Even though the shaky hand-held camera-work was a little hard to watch, I loved that they used that technique because it worked so well for the tone of this movie. It gave the impression that every angle was someone watching the other characters, so you were conscious of how visible Bourne was at all times. Plus, it added to the chaotic atmosphere. What made this finale better than Supremacy was that there was a definitive conclusion. In Supremacy, and later in Legacy, the story felt a little incomplete. The main goal is for Bourne to escape completely from his old life and the people chasing him, which felt like it was accomplished at the end of Identity, and definitely felt like it happened here in Ultimatum.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie is a bit disappointing in theme and character. Bourne is a character that we can root for because of his skills, but we never get as much emotional access as might be possible. It would be nice if he had a little more personality or showed a little more heart just so that things feel more personal as a viewer. The same is true of the antagonists to a lesser extent. All of them are stone-faced and care too much about their jobs, which isn't terrible, but it does fall a little flat. The serious nature the characters fits with the overall mood, though.<br/><br/>Thematically, there is a bit of an ethical conflict near the end with Bourne discovering how he joined the program. It was great to finally see a character with such violent capabilities consider why he should do what he does. I would have liked there to be more of that, but once again it would have thrown off the mood.<br/><br/>The story progression was a bit of a disappointment because there wasn't a whole lot that happened in the 110 minutes. The scenes were pretty long for the most part, but this did nothing to stop the rapid-fire pace that the movie flowed at. The chase scenes in London and Morocco move so quickly that you don't even notice how long they actually take. As a result, the story is largely action driven, but it's all purposeful action. The chases and fight scenes get chaotic at some points, but not as bad as in Supremacy. It's all hand-to-hand combat this time, with minimal gun fights. But most of the action is chase scenes on foot and in cars. Most notably, there is a great tracking sequence in a London train station in which Bourne and the CIA match wits.<br/><br/>If you liked either of the first two Bourne movies, definitely watch this. The story is not as good as that of Identity, but the technical execution is at top-notch in this conclusion. If every movie were crafted the way this one is, I would never watch movies, but Paul Greengrass molds the style of his directing to the style of the movie. The action is very engaging, not the type that lets you just turn your brain off, and contains minimal invincibility issues. The revelations at the end may not be staggering, but they ought to be satisfying. Overall Rating: 8.3/10."
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","1","8 September 2016"," The action genre at its finest
","One may have anticipated a drop in quality upon the release of Paul Greengrass' trilogy-capper The Bourne Ultimatum back in 2007. After all, the first two movies made no real effort to cover up the fact that they are ultimately the same movie, and Ultimatum is no different, again sending Matt Damon's haggard, amnesiac super agent on the run from serious-looking CIA agents and emotionless ""assets"" across a variety of countries at breakneck speed. However, the Bourne trilogy does what trilogies rarely do and gets progressively better which each movie, and this third instalment has learned from the franchise's previous mistakes.<br/><br/>Greengrass goes for all-out action here, barely stopping to catch its breath as the film squeezes tension out of the most ordinary of places and situations, and delivering set-pieces that dwarf anything that came before. There's no doubting that Bourne will make it out of this film alive, and no matter how dire the situations the superhuman find himself in as shady CIA heads Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) and the returning Pam Landy (Joan Allen) track him down using every conceivable piece of spy equipment at their disposal, you know he will somehow find a way to smash his way out. What makes Ultimatum so miraculous is how Greengrass manages to still keep things grounded, whether it's watching Bourne pummel an assassin with a leather-bound book or causing carnage on the streets of New York.<br/><br/>When it does pause for breath, Greengrass thankfully seems eager to wrap up the story of how Bourne came to be the unstoppable badass he is, and uncover the organisation known as Treadstone, the secret agency that have been hunting him down ever since he was picked up by a fishing boat with bullet holes in his back. It's a revelation without any revelations, as anyone with half a brain could fit the puzzle together from the events of the previous films, so the film doesn't spend too much time dwelling on it, cutting straight to the chase when the voice plaguing Bourne's dreams manifests itself in the form of Albert Finney. <br/><br/>Of the plot, there is little to write about. Bourne tracks down journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who has taken to writing pieces on the former agent's exploits and a program known as Blackbriar. Bourne's presence naturally attracts the attention of Vosen et al, and the rest you can guess. It's the simplest of McGuffin's, one that exists for the sole purpose of transporting Bourne around the globe and assaulting the senses with exhilarating action, and the experience is all the better for it. Damon is so good here that he doesn't need much dialogue to create a credible and sympathetic hero, as he manages to capture the spirit of Jason Bourne with his fists and looks of panic more than words ever could. While you may still need a barf bag on hand during some of the more frantic moments, The Bourne Ultimatum is an example of the action genre at its finest, one that will leave you scratching your head as to why the studio felt the need to add the Jeremy Renner-starring spin-off and the recent fourth instalment, Jason Bourne, to the story."

"reed52","10","1","1","7 February 2015"," Hunting for his past memories and identity
","The movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007) is an action/thriller that was directed by Paul Greengrass and written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns, and George Nolfi. The Bourne Ultimatum film is based from a 1991 novel by American Author Robert Ludlum. The film is the third part of a trilogy series so to completely understand the details of this film and what is taking place you must see the two prior movies: Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy. The main character of the film is Matt Damon as Jason Bourne who is an ex CIA agent who has lost his memory and identity and is now being sought by the CIA for an operation gone badly. David Strathairn as Noah Vosen and Joan Allen as Pam Landy are the CIA characters who are heading up the pursuit to get Jason. Their fear is that Jason will remember who he is and his knowledge of the secret operation – Treadstone. The underlying theme in this movie Jason realizes very early in the previous films, which carried over to this one, is that one must be careful things or people may not seem as they are. As one line from the movie states and showed to be very true, ""It is funny how different things look, depending on where you sit."" (The Bourne Ultimatum, 2007) <br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a ""mind-blowing action"" (Ebert, 2007) film that takes you behind the scenes of the CIA black-op and some of their secret operations. This series picks up right where the last film left off with Jason wounded from a Russian assassin and running from the Moscow police. Paddy Considine as Simon Ross is the character of a British journalist who is investigating the secrets of Operation Treadstone and Jason's past when he is provided with lead about ""Operation Blackbriar"". So what was ""Blackbriar"" and it's significant to Jason? These simple words promote a series of intense scenes of Jason trying to figure out what this means and how to protect Simon.<br/><br/>The camera angles in this film will put you in Jason's shoes as he is being watched and sought after, as a target of the CIA, while he is hunting for his past memories and identity. The fast pace on your seat chases provide some impressive special effects with Jason jumping from building to building, through windows while fighting off numerous guys at one time to the remarkable car chase with one scene showing him driving off the roof of a building backwards. The film then takes a shift and provides a look into the CIA headquarters in the U.S. and how they have been watching Jason the whole time through surveillance camera. The motion blurred background camera shot with Jason walking intensely towards the camera with a gun is known for one of the best effects.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie along with the additional Bourne series films. I believe Robert Ebert sums up the movie the best, ""The movie is complete as itself. You sit there, and the action assaults you, and using words to re-create it would be futile. What actually happens to Jason Bourne is essentially immaterial. What matters is that something must happen, so he can run away from it or towards it."" (Ebert, 2007)"
"OllieSuave-007","10","1","1","7 February 2015"," An high tension and fast-energy close to the Bourne trilogy!
","This is a high tension and fast-energy close (as of now) to the Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon. He returns as Jason Bourne once more, still having memory problems and determined to get to the bottom of the issue in what his real identity is and who is responsible for the operations. With the help of London-based reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who is trying to unveil Operation Blackbriar (an upgrade to Project Treadstone), and former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), Bourne gets that much closer to uncover his dark past.<br/><br/>The film picks up about six weeks where the events of The Bourne Supremacy left off. Like the previous two films, the movie starts off with a fast pace as Bourne visit's the brother of his girlfriend Marie, leading to Simon Ross trying to uncover the secrets of Operation Blackbriar, as the sinister plans of Blackbriar lead operative Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) to take him and Bourne down unfold. This results in another thrilling and suspenseful cat and mouse chase between the assassins and Bourne, giving the audience an edge-of-your-seat ride that is, what I think, contains some of the best actions scenes in cinema - from Bourne attempting to avoid the Blackbriar assassins to him trying to protect others under their target.<br/><br/>Back in the fray is CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who is against Vosen's mission to terminate Bourne. Her trying to vindicate Bourne adds onto the story's suspense and it makes you wonder where her actions will lead to under the watchful eye of Vosen and his associates.<br/><br/>Much intrigue is generated as the secrets of the CIA operation begin to unravel and Jason gaining more steam in unlocking his memory, creating a mind-numbing sense of mystery.<br/><br/>The acting is great; Matt Damon continues to deliver as Jason Bourne, quick in action and dramatic, and Joan Allen gave another commanding performance as Pamela Landy, committed to solving the investigation but sympathetic to Jason's dilemma. I also liked Julia Stiles' role as Parson, who has a larger and more significant role in the movie. In addition, all the actors who played the villains were sinister and well-played.<br/><br/>Hands down to the film-making team for their stunning work on the visual and special effects, stunts, screenplay, music, sound and direction on this film, as well as the first two. It's probably the most well-balanced, exciting and captivating action trilogy I have ever seen. Highly recommended! <br/><br/>Grade A"

","It's a tall order for a third movie to live up to what's come before it, but THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM does just that. I love how they play with the narrative; that most of the movie happens during the last few minutes of SUPREMACY. And even though we're constantly teased with the origin story of Jason Bourne, they actually deliver it, to a degree. <br/><br/>This is a hell of an action movie. The fight scenes are brutal, the pacing's relentless (Greengrass just doesn't let up) and the constant motion gets to be a high after a while. The final car chase is beyond absurd, but you're so pumped at that point that it kinda fits. Really the only negative I can think of is the idea put forth that Bourne and Nikki were ever in a relationship . . . but that's got nothing on the rest of the movie. It fires on all cylinders. <br/><br/>8/10"
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","1","22 March 2014"," The vision
","This was for me an improvement over the second at least in the sense that we finally ask how much Bourne was himself culpable of.<br/><br/>The idea of opposing wits is thus brought to its conclusion. On one hand you have the CIA operatives with their screens, eyes, wires, satellite imagery and systems essentially guiding a film. In it is of course Bourne attempting to wrestle control of that narrative from the inside as means of finding self. Oh he is as usual an action hero, adept fighter and shooter when the moment requires it, but his exceptional skill is a superb cognitive clarity.<br/><br/>So we have the film in similarly lightning-speed perceptions of things that we have to surf if we want to come out on top of the story and not lost in the whirl and this opens up an interesting and more broadly cinematic dimension of the work.<br/><br/>The thing I feel is worth scrutinizing most closely here is the vision itself. Now I don't doubt viewer claims of nausea and what not, the film is a relentless barrage of impressions, but let's not discard the whole right away. <br/><br/>Visual cognition is as much as the body something that you can train and cultivate, it can be stolid or agile. In related jargon there's something called constancy, it refers to the ability to stay tethered to a sense. I may be able to maintain e.g. a constancy of time, an inner sense of its passage. Okay, fun experiment time on how this appears in an awareness of space, look out from the window of a speeding vehicle, does the moving landscape 'drag back' your sight or do you maintain stability? In yoga there are exercises where you have to balance on one leg, do it right now and you'll see it's much easier with eyes open. With eyes closed I can no longer 'lean against' my visual field for balance, there being able to balance involves - surprise - finding my bearings from inside, embodying.<br/><br/>So what happens in film is that I lean on the images, actively attempting to see and center. In a static or slow tracking shot my eyes have room to traverse the image, picking my paths and points of rest. The fundamental difference with a film like this is that it has been designed with the paths already 'seen', in other words the camera is the eye and the image is 'seeing'. Confusion arises when you try to re- orient each time, of course it's going to be exhausting. So if you relax in your own self the film does all the seeing. It's not only perfectly intelligible, you begin to notice some pretty great rapid-eye craft. So a different kind of art that assumes you are the body and wholly trust the 'seeing' to be done for you.<br/><br/>Surprise, this doesn't come from the American visual tradition which focused on clarity in ordered space, cultivated in the western. It were the Soviets who first dismantled the continuity of perceptions and world and constructed the latter solely in the eye, the Soviets in the brief time before Stalin had them essentially film westerns. It was their way of asserting that reality was no fixed stage but a space you could construct to have psychology, the only intelligent interpretation of Marxism I know.<br/><br/>Here it becomes about the uncertainty of perceptions, the inability to reach out to a stable world and balance as a broader anxiety about the extents of certainty. So a film about manipulable and constructed reality and seeing where all the seeing is constructed for you and to disorient.<br/><br/>Unless if, like Bourne, you surf on the visual debris, in which case the film reveals itself to have only physical extremes to offer. Indicative for me that the filmmakers were clueless of the potential is that here we have a film where the eye supplies the space and scenes of memory are boxed separately.<br/><br/>So for me this is only fruitful as gymnastics of perception, it's otherwise mechanic. But ride it just the same, train the eye in the new spacetime, our whole visual imagination is headed in that direction. There will of course good and bad films in this mode, the point is to be able to navigate them as freely as before. Hollywood will tend to push it to loud extremes like here, but just imagine the possibilities for a while."
"caionneach","7","1","1","27 February 2008"," Bourne a tragic figure, a victim of his own patriotism.
","This was a very good action move, and I enjoyed it immensely. I also recommend it. At times it seems the Bourne character is a bit too cartoonish, for he can never do any wrong, his reflexes are so cat like that he rarely takes a punch. If he comes up hobbling it's because he jumped to a landing that was a bit of an extension for him and it was concrete too. He allegedly is seeking for who he really is and why he is Jason Bourne. So he is angry at someone, something, a nameless institution that is seeking to end the threat that he poses. So he is seeking revenge for why he is Jason Bourne. And here the sub text of the movie seems to impugn the patriotism of government agencies charged with the security of the United States. Someone made him the way he is and he wants to get even. That should play nicely in the editorial page of the NY Times, but the movie doesn't force Bourne to face himself, that HE is the one who volunteered to become the monster that he so despises. The movie mentions this possibility but does not develop it further in the dialog and just lets it go.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Bourne is a highly trained, sophisticated weapon, and he has those incredible skills because he made a choice and volunteered. The hesitancy which caused him to fail in the Wombosi mission resulted in his getting shot and getting amnesia. In a word, Bourne's psychological system re-booted, and while his self identity as Bourne was not part of his start up files in his consciousness' master boot record, his finely honed skills and senses in hand-to-hand combat and espionage were, and much to his surprise. Wouldn't be much of a movie without that, now would it! The new Bourne with a conscience, is amazed at his ability. He is a killer and he is ashamed. Perhaps a sequel will show Bourne confronting himself rather than the CIA."

Greengrass decided to open a ""cat and mice"" game, where intellects are put under pressure and Bourne must challenge alone all of them who are seeking for him. The movie is in a constant run, whereas it is in cars, bikes, over the roofs of houses. Traps, set ups. We can't even start to breath when the game is on.<br/><br/>The ""steadicam"" use couldn't be more accurate. It gives a sense of company to the movie; we are always running, always present while escaping. His semi-shots, out-of screens and artful photography are details I myself enjoy pretty much.<br/><br/>Morocco, Belgium, France, Rusia. You won't have a breath, I repeat. The film doesn't stops and has great use of it's elements, and it's nice to see how the wolves operate on their constant hunt, with their intelligence edge, superior technology and fearful bureaucracy. It delivers with a high sense of realism.<br/><br/>This is a movie of intelligence, thrilling essence and utter energy."

","I was expecting a rehash of film 1 & 2- the usual international locales, car chases, fights & indestructible Bourne tries to get info. - nothing too deep, so I was pleased it exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Nice to see a film where they don't throw the main stars into a romance just because they happen to be male & female! Chase & fight scenes: I found them too fast too watch/follow for my taste - but at the same time -I could respect that the speed, editing & camera work were more aimed at making you feel like you were there and how quickly it all happens (instead of a John Woo-like slo-mo so you can appreciate the grace and skill of each blow) and I did like how they incorporated ""on the spot"" improvisational fighting with whatever they could grab (book, candlestick, etc.) It made it seem much more realistic and showed the brutality of it.<br/><br/>Mostly though I like how the film made you consider larger issues of national security, torture, assassination, civil rights, freedom and personal choice.<br/><br/>Can the US really monitor anyone anywhere in the world that fast (through cameras, satellites, passport RFIDs, cell phone locating, monitoring all phone conversations for keywords). (We already know they're allowed do it without warrants under the current administration) Can they really just kill anyone they want anywhere? Shoot a British citizen in a train station? Are assassination and torture justified for our ""security"" or just easier? Is blind obedience and following orders worth it/ I don't want to give too much away but I enjoyed the parts that touched on personal choice and the responsibility/moral issues of killing."

","The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.<br/><br/>The director and star (Damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. How they got around that? The action scenes, for once, but they did another thing too, which I can't reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, than you'll notice it! Funnily enough I read, that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)"

","This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality, perhaps they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.<br/><br/>There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.<br/><br/>The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series."

Its all about the action.<br/><br/>The feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well. A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist does this to great effect.

","My wife and I both enjoyed the first Bourne movies, enough so that we bought the DVDs. I really liked the soundtrack for The Bourne Supremacy, enough that I bought that at full retail at Borders.<br/><br/>So we were very, very disappointed at watching the movie last night. Paul Greengrass, who directed United 93 (excellent, difficult film) used and used and used the shaky camera technique as well as cuts so fast that you couldn't tell what was going on.<br/><br/>I felt the movie was basically a rehash of the second movie, something that wasn't helped by them using the same songs from the second album. Right down to the Moby song over final credits.<br/><br/>Rent it in a few months. Or just watch the second movie again - you'll enjoy it much more than you will this."
"kgprophet","6","10","30","3 August 2007"," Motion Sickness - Wait for DVD
","I am joining another reviewer here and will only see a Paul Greengrass film on a small screen. I previously complained about the shaky cam in my review of Bourne Supremacy, but could not condemn the film since everything else was done very well. This time, the shaky cam is now doing more to inject tense feelings into what could be a thin story. I sat in the fourth row, and had to frequently look away or down to keep my stomach from fluttering. I eventually had to walk out to relieve the nausea, only returning later by sitting in the very back of the theatre. Greengrass said he wanted to make essentially a smart popcorn film, and he has. He may even have come up with some clever enough scenes to dare and shoot them on a tripod once in a while. I'm afraid what he is really doing is ratcheting up his camera-work (that looks like it was done by a 5 year-old), thinking that it is necessary to outdo the previous film. <br/><br/>There is a great deal of evidence why; much time is taken to merely go over old material covered in the first two movies, the new CIA bad guys are like the old CIA bad guys, and NSA surveillance scenes are a dime a dozen nowadays. So it is only Bourne and his lightning fast action scenes that make this film worthwhile. I was thoroughly enjoying the intelligence they put into the set pieces, extending their potential and increasing the adrenaline. Also winning honors is the under-rated Joan Allen. Her intensity energises the screen, and provides a voice for the audience - rooting for her to save Jason and other colleagues from elimination. <br/><br/>Greengrass delivers on the popcorn part for sure, but gets an 'F' for over-using an over-rated camera technique. Instead of giving this film a thumbs down, however, I am recommending that you watch it only on a smaller screen."
"Danusha_Goska","4","4","9","31 August 2008"," Golly, But This Movie Takes Itself Seriously
","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" was a chore to get through. It took itself so darn seriously. The problem was, largely, its style. Greengrass treated it as if it were a serious, high-minded documentary about human trafficking. The cameras are hand-held and the shots are shaky. The color palette is murky green-gray and bruise blue. The dialogue scenes are weighty and portentous.<br/><br/>This is all very silly. The Bourne trilogy is completely implausible. Jason Bourne defies all the odds in ways that just aren't believable. That's okay; no one needs a spy movie to be believable. But the contrast between the self-serious style and the implausible, silly plot is painful. This final entry in the Bourne trilogy consists of one long, pointless chase scene. When Jason finally discovers the truth he's been seeking, it is a truth that has been painfully obvious all along. There are no big truths here, so why not direct this film with some style, some panache, some *fun*? <br/><br/>I must say that the one star review by irivlin says almost everything I want to say about ""The Bourne Ultimatum"""

Is it so hard to get a decent camera guy? Why use your hyperactive 2 year old kid for the task? Or buy a tripod, for God's sake! This is an insult to the senses of every paying moviegoer.

"inhometherapist","6","4","9","5 August 2007"," Weakest of the three films
","True fans of the Bourne movies will be very disappointed in this film. The fight scenes which are so enjoyable from the first two films are not even viewable due to the ""shaking camera"" technique. All you see is quick movement and a blur leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Also, Matt Damon is noticeably heavier and with a deeper voice which is distracting to the viewer. I think the fight scenes were shot closer up with the shaking camera technique to compensate for his heavier appearance and possible lack of agility. The first hour and twenty minutes of this film is honestly boring and barely keeps the viewer's interest. Also, Jason Bourne is so robotic. The existential dilemma of who he is and his search for humanity is just phoned in to the office in this third picture. His character is at his best in The Bourne Identity. The Bourne Supremacy is almost as good as the first. However, with each subsequent film his character becomes less human and more robotic. I don't think he smiled one time in the entire film. I think everyone is so excited that there is a third movie and is caught up in the Bourne Mania. However, I think history will judge me correct in my opinion that this is the weakest of the three movies. The first picture will always be the best one."

","The Bourne Ultimatum is easily one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. The action, the thrills and excitement easily surpass Identity and Supremacy as does Greengrass's ability to deliver a good plot that is thick on detail and uncompromisingly superior to both predecessors. Paul Greengrass (United 93) has out-done himself in creating a hard hitting action thriller that places both Greengrass and Damon in a dominant position that ponders the question- Should they do another Bourne? And with the over-whelming success of Ultimatum why shouldn't they continue.<br/><br/>The choreography is unmistakably class as is the brutal and explosive action scenes that'l keep you on the edge. The acting is searing and certainly gripping. Ultimatum is a thrill ride so riveting and bold that it should be cast as the best action thriller of the past decade and immediately called upon as one of the greats of cinematic history."
"RJBurke1942","7","3","6","29 December 2007"," Where we are frenetically borne along with Jason once again
","There's two thing's going for this latest chapter in the Bourne saga: it has one of best fight scenes ever filmed, between Bourne (Matt Damon) and Desh Boukansi (Joey Ansah) within the confined spaces of a cramped apartment in Tangiers. As a martial artist myself, I know just how easy it is to get hurt, even when playing around  so, the time taking to choreograph that whole sequence must have been meticulous and lengthy. It's worth seeing this film for that alone.<br/><br/>The other thing in its favour is the spectacular chase sequence in New York City with Bourne in a stolen NYPD cruiser being hunted down by a succession of CIA agents all intent on the shoot-to-kill order from the Top Bad Guy Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Just how much damage can a cruiser take? Be amazed and awed as you watch  particularly a very clever action shot as mangled cars zoom completely over cameras (which must have been two fixed and remotely operated units) positioned directly in the line of crash. And, prior to that sequence, we see Bourne take a flying leap backwards, in a car, from the top of a car park, to land onto... Ah, ha  you thought I was going to say 'water' or 'balloons', or such like. See the movie...<br/><br/>And then wonder just how a superhuman like Bourne can survive so many potentially fatal situations. This guy is totally, I mean, totally unbreakable. Oooops, sorry, that's been done already by Bruce Willis in Unbreakable (2000).<br/><br/>Well, then, try to understand how a guy can be fluent in so many languages, apparently so quickly: Russian, German, French, Spanish, Italian and who knows what else, while still trying to find out who he is. I guess he's been around a lot...<br/><br/>Which must be true, because he seems to know every little alley, street corner kiosk, parking lot, train station layout, and a plethora of other aspects about just about every major city in the northern hemisphere. And, that in turn means this Bourne guy must be loaded with an inexhaustible supply of money and/or credit cards to which he has constant access...from where and from whom?<br/><br/>And, he never sleeps. Even when traveling...<br/><br/>The thing that stops this movie from descending into comic book chaos is the presence of director Greengrass and the quality of the production. It's very well made, as a film; the editing is sharp, quick (almost too quick sometimes) but ferociously exciting. So much so, while the fight scenes are very good, I'm sure there's cranked up speed to parts that are done at a more leisurely pace.<br/><br/>The story is merely a continuation of Bourne's need to uncover his past. Which he does, by the time the credits start to roll  leaving open, of course, another sequel.<br/><br/>I just all hope it's not called Bourne Again. Recommended."
"mervmatthews","9","3","6","29 August 2007"," Exciting all the way, yes, but oh those hand-held camera shots!!!!
","Despite all the comments in 'Supremacy' reviews about the amateur cameraman they used for all the wobbly hand-held shots, they went and used him again in 'Ultimatum', the idiots. At times you couldn't see what the action was supposed to be. Will they never learn? I guess the technique is trendy and is meant to convey frantic action, but it sure was overdone, the man must have thought he was hosing the garden. If he had tried to hold the camera as steady as possible, then it would have looked shaky enough. Anyone who has taken home movies will know the result. There was of course the obligatory car chase, and the bits that could be seen through all the camera-shake were certainly spectacular. Anyway, it's a great film, thoroughly recommended, and I hope there will be a further episode. Will Nicky be Jason's new love I wonder?"
"rothx16","7","3","6","28 August 2007"," not my favorite of the 3
","I preferred it when Bourne was thinking, not just the martial arts hero, so I liked the 1st the best when he has to use his wits & schemes with Franke Potente to learn about his past. Why she had to be killed I don't understand since the books are nothing at all like the films. So my favorite part of this installment was when he was with the British reporter, working their way through the train station despite the cameras & surveillance teams; it shows Bourne as the thinking über-spy, not just hand-to-hand combat killer. Non-stop action, sure, but that's most of what happens, so it's both the good & bad. He has money, but from where? He never eats, sleeps, or uses the toilet yet he's always freshly shaved. Maybe he IS a robot; T2 anyone?? The guy in Tangiers just about kicks Bourne's ass. And no matter the amount of fighting or wrecking cars, all Bourne ever gets is a brief limp and a couple of scrapes? Not very damn likely! And all the complaints about the ""Blair-witch-esque"" hand-held camera are spot on; you really can't see a lot of the action; it's just a blurry mess, wasted. Compare that to the scenes where all he has is a pen or a towel or a rolled-up magazine: great improvisation, another use of the thinking Bourne, not so much the serious, angry, take on the world Bourne we have this time around. Here he's no longer vulnerable, but feared; no longer loved, no longer human, no longer deserving of our sympathy since we learn he was a volunteer killer, which shows us that maybe the people who made him this way are not entirely to blame but they didn't go anywhere with that line of thought."
"JayHarbath","5","3","6","27 August 2007"," Made my physically ill.
","The filming was awful beyond words. The poor cinematography caused a bad case of motion sickness. They couldn't hold the camera still for love or money. They also had way too many scenes that were poorly focused, adding to the problem. It may be one thing to jerk it around during chase scenes, but when someone is just sitting around talking, the herky, jerky, gratuitous camera motion is very annoying. I would expect better for a major motion picture. I know the ""hand held"" cinematography is in vogue right now, but it just looks amateurish when taken to this ridiculous level. High school students could have photographed a film easier to watch."

","The Bourne Ultimatum packs a punch - to say it in as few words as possible.<br/><br/>Picking up right where its predecessor left off, we once again find ourselves following the story of Jason Bourne, a former government trained killing machine who, suffering from amnesia, is on a mission to discover his past - specifically, what led him to become what he is. Little time is wasted until we see Bourne's supreme display of combat abilities taking down his enemies effortlessly. The combination of a progressive story line and intense action sequences succeed in tying loose ends together - and leaving more to be desired.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's performance is excellent once again.<br/><br/>I personally was never really a fan of the Bourne series. But I can say confidently that that is no longer the case. The Bourne Ultimatum is hands down the best movie of 2007."
"blackburnj-1","9","3","6","20 August 2007"," Greengrass is now established as one of the world's finest and most important directors
","Jason Bourne has single-handedly outrun hundreds of policemen, killed tens of assassins and changed the nature of the spy thriller. It is a simple fact that if ""The Bourne Identity"" had not been made then ""Casino Royale would not have been made, and the latter was hailed as a great reinvention of the Bond franchise and raised the bar for ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", released the following summer. This was just a little bit more pressure on the team behind the Bourne films as they had to take the twisted plot from the first two movies and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion for the enormous number of fans across the world and provide a tense and satisfying spy thriller.<br/><br/>In a summer of deeply disappointing ""threequels"", ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" reigns supreme. Thanks, largely, to the work of director Paul Greengrass, the films holds the audience from the first frame to the last although, as always, there has to be a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, (but surely that is what the cinema allows you to do?). Every action scene is gripping and adrenaline pumping. Whether it's a game of cat and mouse at Waterloo station or a chase on the rooftops of Tangiers or a relentless car chase through the streets of New York, the film never drops the baton and it is completely fulfilling. Matt Damon, who has shown his range and ability in recent years, especially with Scorsese's ""The Departed"", delivers his best performance to date and is electric on screen. He is ably assisted by David Strathairn, Julia Stiles (who gives her best performance of the series), Joan Allen, Albert Finney and Paddy Considine who hold the film together completely and together make one of the best ensembles of the year so far.<br/><br/>Having gained an Oscar nomination for his direction of ""United 93"", in my opinion the best film of 2006, Greengrass has now, with the addition of ""Ultimatum"", established himself as one of the world's finest and most important film directors working today. In this film he continues with the hand-held camera style that made his 9/11 drama so effective but he is also a storyteller and is not afraid of moments of stillness. He delves into his characters minds with silence or a stare and creates intrigue seemingly effortlessly. But this is also a political film and subtleties, and not-too-subtleties, lie under the frenetic game of international tag, making their presence known but not enveloping the film. Greengrass controls his film well providing the perfect cocktail to produce a gripping film with brains and this will surely ensure that his name is thrown into the ring come Oscar time, though it will be surprising if the Academy vote for him or his film in enough numbers to get nominations, let alone victories.<br/><br/>Powerful, tense, gripping, this film has put some quality into what has been a very bleak summer and has once again raised the bar for Bond. Greengrass has established himself as a top director and Damon as a top actor and this film is certainly one of the best of the year, though it is doubtful whether it will gain the awards it deserves."

","This summer is a series of trilogies for Matt Damon. After the dismal and regurgitated ""Ocean's 13"" that came out a few weeks ago as a weak attempt to squeeze one last drip from the cash-cow that had lost all of its glory before the end credits of the second one; I wondered what the assumed end of the Bourne series would have in store.<br/><br/>I caught the film earlier this afternoon at a CinePlex with high expectations. Overall, it was worth the money and a good, if different, finale to the Bourne saga that has gone through two directors, numerous stunts, and thousands of hand-held cameras on its way to becoming the definitive contemporary ""spy film franchise."" From the opening-scene, where we get a glimpse of a still-on-the-run Jason Bourne avoiding capture yet again, its clear that the production is telling us that this is a very different film from the previous two. And it is.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Ultimatum"" continues to explore the titular character, an amnesiac assassin who knows nothing about why so many people want to silence him concerning secrets that he isn't even aware of. While the first film focused on discovering WHAT Jason Bourne is, and the second presents the question of WHO he is, this one is definitely about HOW Jason Bourne is what he is.<br/><br/>**************** The plot revolves around a new version of the Black Ops. assassination-program that Bourne was involved in prior to the first film, now dubbed ""Black Briar."" When a journalist bites off more than he can chew while searching for the cause of so much damage over the past two prequels and ends up forcing the masterminds behind the operation to eliminate anyone that can compromise the mission, they target the one surviving Treadstone agent, Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>What follows is, on the surface, a basic rehash of the first two films. Governments agents desperately strive to trap an unstoppable, highly-trained professional agent while the secrets he uncovers actually force some of those pursuing him to wonder what the purpose of their targeting him truly is. Although, thankfully, this is only in the peripheral as the plot charges forward at a neck-breaking pace. And enough of the plot from the other movies is alluded to or even stated that it makes the film accessible to those unfamiliar with those before it.<br/><br/>The action sequences are honestly few and far between but, when they do occur, are exhilarating. This is because the director has made the wise decision to distance the film from non-stop action and instead chooses to focus on suspense and thrills in its place for the majority of the film. Because of this, I can honestly say that the film keeps you not only glued to your seat, but breathlessly so.<br/><br/>As Matt Damon has said in interviews, he is retiring himself from the franchise after this one - and its clear that he is obviously struggling to find depth in the character anymore. He still puts up a strong and honest effort, though its noticeably difficult to maintain interest in a character who exists only as a force of nature on a quest to discover his past - made even less interesting by the fact that he is now after the only piece of the Jason Bourne puzzle that has yet to be uncovered. The supporting cast, while effective, are more or less simply there as either ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" when everything is said and done.<br/><br/>When we eventually do get to the bottom of the last three films, roughly around ten minutes before the end credits; its interesting, but somewhat disappointing. All the hidden secret reveals are the fundamental things that we were led to assume in the first film. Nothing more, nothing less - buts its all about the ride in this movie and not so much the destination, so most can be forgiven.<br/><br/>Overall, despite some of the obvious complaints that are a given when finishing a series such as this, it is a fitting end. In tone with the previous entries to the series, we are taken on a fast and furious ride that never lets up, until it eventually does for the final time and reminds us that the mystery has been solved. And, in keeping with its theme, we realize that all of the answers aren't handed to us on a silver platter, but offered as something to think about and make your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Its also interesting to note that the film ends in a very similar fashion to the opening of the first film; taking us full-circle. Its been a great ride.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth the price of admission and much more. Worth a look even for the novice fan."

","Paul Greengrass has stepped into the director's shoes for this third installment of the Jason Bourne identity crisis and in doing so has created nearly two hours of tension that would make Robert Ludlum proud! This is an example of how Hollywood can shine when it integrates all of the components of an 'action suspense thriller' by capitalizing on finding the best contributors available - actors, producers, cameramen, stunt men, script (Tony Gilroy, George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns), composer of music (John Powell), editors - everyone of the hundreds required to pull off this superlative film. It is as fine as any thriller can be and reflects the intensity of concentration and understatement and respect for the viewers' intellect that crowned his excellent UNITED 93 and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. The result is a polished movie that remains compelling form the opening frame to the final credits.<br/><br/>For those who have read or watched Ludlum's Bourne trilogy the story line is at core very simple: Jason Bourne has lost his memory and struggles through terrifying confrontations with all governments and potential assassins, endures relentless chases, and defies the machinations of the world's intelligence sources to discover his true identity. The rest of the novels and films are the how.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has come into his own as an electrifying screen presence as Jason Bourne: his acting is keen and his ability to hold our concern through impossible situations would be difficult to duplicate by other actors of this genre. The supporting cast includes such superb actors as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Paddy Considine, Daniel Brühl, Joey Ansah and a very large cast of others. The pacing and use of Intelligence techniques is extraordinary and is beautifully captured by the cinematography of DP Oliver Wood and finessed by the editing of Christopher Rouse.<br/><br/>One aspect of this film that is the most frightening is to observe just how invasive the Intelligence portions of our government can be: there seemingly are no secrets about even the most personal aspects of our lives that cannot be flashed on multiscreens in the war room of the CIA and associated organizations. Perhaps this film will be a red flag to alert public attention as to how our right to privacy has been so visibly raped by the government in the name of security - a factor that makes watching this excellent movie even more terrifying!

Although an action hero, he always seems to avoid cliché and formula in the role. Cleverly, because the essence of the story is the search for his ""identity"", it is also a search for his soul. So although the action sequences are frequently quite brutal, he never succumbs to the Schwarzenegger ""automaton"" style of action hero.<br/><br/>Although awash with surveillance gadgetry, the story eschews hi tech killing methods, and is far the better for it. The thrill is in the chase. David Strathairn, who has a gargantuan list of film acting credits behind him, is tremendous as the maverick Deputy CIA Chief,Noah Vosen. Joan Allen,as his nemesis Pamela Landy, is superb as his nemesis, and proves that there is a place for women over 50 in modern movies. By contrast, Julia Stiles as erstwhile love interest Nicky Parsons, has a curiously underwritten, functional role.<br/><br/>Not cerebral, but visceral entertainment. Much cleverer than the Mision Impossible franchise. and a for once plausible cross Atlantic contrast to James Bond."
"SdwOne","9","3","6","19 August 2007"," Bourne is definitely the new Bond!
","Geez... I just saw this movie last night, and it's been a long, LONG while since I've been totally griped by a film for 2 ('ish) hours.<br/><br/>From the get go this movie is in overdrive. But don't worry It's far from your usual mindless romp of an action movie. It's intelligent, sharp, efficient, and the way it has a docu-dramatized feel to it, makes it gritty and believable.<br/><br/>I saw the first film, long, long ago and I thought it was a kool movie. I didn't actually get around to see the second one, but from what I hear, Ultimatum appears to be the best out of the three and believe me, this could well be the best film of 2007.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is excellent as the lead and I'm sure the obvious comparisons between him and the new Bond man (Daniel Craig) will continue to be made. In my opinion, both actors play the role of new, contemporary gritty, tough guy well. But to me, Matt has the edge. I suppose it's his (slightly) younger age. And the obvious lack of those legendary Bond clichés of suave women, megalomaniacs, and the deeply entrenched upper class echelons of the British MI6 and of course those ridiculous gadgets (I mean, that ""invisible"" car in Die Another Day, was just plain nuts).<br/><br/>No Matt Damon is like a slimmed down, ""pure"" version of contemporary Bond.<br/><br/>Asides from the power and energy of Matt however, don't be fooled into thinking that means the rest of the films' characters are weak. Far from it. I'll admit there isn't much of a Human touch in the film, as signified by the cold, professional divide between the characters, especially between Bourne and his female sidekick played by Julia Stiles (but to be honest, I think Stiles was probably DEAD in this film anyway, so perhaps sparking ANY relationship with her character was a non-starter!). Sure, there was the odd crack and fragility in Bourne, but this is a gritty film It feels ""real"". And as we know, in the real world, people usually are quite cold and distant, especially in this day and age.<br/><br/>No The other characters were great and all complemented the film well. From the deadly, terminator like assassins assigned to take Bourne out, to the shadowy scheming CIA special operatives planning strategies and tactics in front of an array satellite feeds and virtual computer screens.<br/><br/>The War, if indeed there is a war between Bourne and Bond, is far from over. The new Bond is definitely going in the right direction in comparison to its predecessors. Dare I say, Bond is becoming more ""Bourne"" like, so it remains to be seen who wins out in the end.<br/><br/>Casino Royale was good. Definitely the best Bond film to come out in a long, LONG time. But given the open-ended ending of Ultimatum, its creators may well be planning to take Bond on and believe me, they've fired a pretty damaging salvo into the Bond franchise with this one.<br/><br/>Bourne IS the new Bond!"
"come2whereimfrom","8","3","6","19 August 2007"," Bourne again.
","Firmly blowing my theory that there's never been a good trilogy as the third in any franchise is never as good as its predecessors (e.g. Godfather, Back to the Future, Matrix, Star Wars etc (and before you start I'm not including the likes of The Lord of the Rings as I see that as a whole)) this Greengrass directed final instalment in the Bourne series is a top notch thriller. Starting off exactly where the second one ends Matt Damon reprise his role as the amnesia suffering super spy and it is business as usual as he runs from the C.I.A. always trying to find the answer to who he is and why he's a expertly trained killing machine. As with Greengrass's other work Bourne Supremacy and United 93 the camera work is stunning, it's claustrophobic and always feels very real which in a film like this just adds to the tension and urgency. Although not a huge fan of Damon you cant take it away from him that he was born (excuse the pun) to play this part and in doing so has opened up many a pub based conversation on which JB would win in a fight, Jack Bauer, James Bond or Jason Bourne and on the evidence of the rooftop chase and subsequent close quarter hand to hand fight about halfway through this movie I'd put my money on Bourne. As superbly directed as it is I feel I have to extend a nod to the editor because half of the films appeal is in the way it is cut together, so as much as this is Greengrass's film it equally belongs to Christopher Rouse and together they are a brilliant team. Set all over the world from Russia to Britain and wrapping up with a spectacular car chase through New York it is edge of your seat stuff as you hurtle closer to Bourne's actual identity and the dramatic conclusion to what started with the first film. There's also a neat little trick that brings them full circle which you'll get when you see it. At just under two hours this is a blockbuster that actually delivers and will undoubtedly be the hit of the summer and rightly so. All I need to know now is where do I sign up to be a spy?"

","What's become a spy-film franchise big enough to be compared to the Bond series (there's a link on the Orange homepage asking 'who's better: Bourne or Bond'?) is now onto its third film. For those who, like me, found 'The Bourne Supremacy' an inferior film to 'The Bourne Identity' (mangled and meandering plot; the lack of surprise and sense of mystery that the first film had; Paul Greengrass' frantic direction, suited to gritty documentaries like 'Bloody Sunday', but maybe not to a Hollywood action film), the good news is that 'Ultimatum' is a better film, though still not as good as the first. Greengrass' zingy, constantly-moving camera-work, deployed to add a 'gritty' edge to the fight scenes in 'Supremacy', is again present, though here it seems to be used often as not to cover up improbabilities such as Bourne jumping, superhero-style, improbably long distances from roof to roof. Damon remains tight-lipped and pretty much expressionless throughout, playing the role of assassin to perfection but skimping on the softer, vulnerable side that would allow us some emotional engagement with him which is rather lacking in the film (something brought out more in his relationship with Franka Potente's character in the first film and the beginning of the second). It's pretty much action all the way - one long adrenaline trip, frequently driven by John Powell's insistent repeated theme in the orchestral score. To accommodate this, the plot is stripped down and simple (basically: Bourne goes after baddies; Bourne fights baddies; Bourne goes after more baddies in search of who he really/originally was, and how he became the assassin Jason Bourne). There are numerous set-pieces: dodging a shooter in Waterloo station; scooter and roof-top chase in Tangier (the most extended, and perhaps the best, of all of them); and finally, climactic action in New York. Also, you got appearances by good, respected actors: David Strathairn, the mellifluous voice intact from 'Good Night and Good Luck', but the role very different; Scott Glenn; Joan Allen; Julia Stiles (thankfully not turning into the love interest here, though playing a fairly major role); and, to trump them all, Albert Finney, who really doesn't have that much to do but provides a suitably serious cameo. In the end, you may wonder whether it adds up to more than the sum of parts - the answer is probably no, but it's an entertaining enough summer blockbuster and it'll keep you suitably occupied for a couple of hours in the cinema."

","Third in the series this film is pure motion from beginning to end. The plot is the same as the first two, Bourne looks for his past while the people who know it try to kill him. Not very original. Like the recent Harry Potter film the narrative is as bare bones as you can get, only more so since we really don't learn anything until the final moments, otherwise its pure action as Bourne goes from Moscow to London to Madrid to Morocco to New York. Give them points for making it just compelling enough to keep you following along for two hours, but take a few away from the lack of anything meaningful happening. Yes, the set pieces are fantastic but there really isn't anything to hold them together other than an idea, which is not really a plot. What is it about this series, they've done the opposite of most movie series in that as its gone on they've made them less and less complicated and removed the narrative almost altogether. (The next film will be Bourne running for two hours and we watch as he randomly assaults passers by.) I enjoyed it but was getting hungry for a real meal about half way in.

I was surprised that this film was produced by someone as rich as Frank Marshall, because the camera effects are what made this film believable. 1. point:- For most of the film a hand-cam was used, creating a realistic effect. 2. The music was used astonishingly well, stopping and start depending on the tension, tempo or action. 3. This film lacked nothing, it had psychological, personal, tonnes of action and most definitely matched up to 'The Bounre Identity' and 'The Bourne Supremacy; which rarely do the Trilogies manage.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays the role off Jason Bourne astonishingly well, I strongly feel they really don't need a fourth film."

","If this film is the best action thriller in a while and yet it gets only a 7/10 grade says something about the films which premiered this year, one of the less interesting I remember in the history of cinema, and especially of the big American studios. That this film is the third in a trilogy is not surprising, because most if we shall remember anything at all it may be some sequel or third film in a trilogy like this one. I may be wrong, it's only August, but I am afraid that I am not mistaken.<br/><br/>To its credit The Bourne Ultimatum has everything an action thriller needs, has a credible pretext, a likable hero, pace, logic, and keeps the viewer interested all the way. Director Paul Greengrass who made us dizzy in the previous installment with the fast under-second takes is combining now short and long takes and the result is in very well filmed set of action scenes that despite the lack of spectacular and expensive effects bring some sense into the action and uses in a wonderful manner the urban settings familiar to many. Logic holes and hard to believe details are not missing completely, but at least the action is simple enough to be followed, complex enough to be interesting, and also has the righteous spin of the Hollywood movies to please the more conventional viewers. Matt Damon is sensitive and efficient and makes us care about him to the point where we would hope he meets some more consistent feminine counter-part. Don't lose hope for him however, as the quasi-open ending leaves some hopes that if BU will be doing well in the box-office this may not be the last film in the series."
"phantomtristan","10","3","6","8 August 2007"," One of the best action/thrillers to come out in a long time...
","Jason Bourne has returned to the big screen for the ending of the successful Bourne Trilogyor is it the endmaybe I shouldn't use the word 'trilogy'. It is the so-called end and the filmmakers bring a large measure of closure to everything, but still leaving it open for a sequel. I mean who are we kidding, this is Hollywood. AnywayThe Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best action thrillers to come out in years. It does not disappoint and maintains the level of originality the other two. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, Bourne Supremacy) assembles the film with a masterful craftsmanship, and builds the chase/action scenes with an almost Hitchcockian suspense. He effectively uses his signature ""shaky camera"" shots, but only to portray the utter chaos the characters are going through. The story follows Bourne on a quest for answers that spans the globe, staring in Russia and ending in New York. Matt Damon plays Bourne again, terrifyingly calm as always, but this time a little more hardened from the death of his girlfriend in the second film. The supporting cast all do superb jobs, especially Julia Stiles who has a bigger role. Veteran actor Albert Finney joins the cast and despite his small amount of screen time makes a big impression as the lead doctor of the Treadstone program. Joan Allen is wonderful again as Pamela Landey the operations director from the second one. John Powell's produces another wonderful score containing traces of the main themes. It compliments the suspense building scenes so well I can not imagine what it would be like without it. Overall an amazingly crafted thriller, and seriously one of the best in yearsyes years. My only complaint was that I wished towards the end when you find out all the answers of Jason's past through flashback, I wanted to see more about his past. But it is a small complaint compared with the rest of the film. It ends the, okay I am going to use it, Trilogy very well and left me quite satisfied."

With Jason having confessed his sins to the Nevskis' orphaned daughter, and then escaping from the Moscow police after some kind of suppressed memory flashback.<br/><br/>Then, six weeks later, he reads about himself and something code-named ""Blackbriar"" in a London scandal rag. Right away, he knows the CIA will probably have the reporter who wrote the story under surveillance, and slips the guy an unmonitored cellphone bought at an open-air vending booth! <br/><br/>That the reporter gets killed anyway is due more to the latter panicking than anything else. But, Jason manages to confiscate the reporter's little black book and finds the probable source of the story in Madrid.<br/><br/>It's there that he meets CIA cyber-nerd Nikki Parsons, yet again!!!<br/><br/>And, here, we get a somewhat startling revelation. She and Jason might have had a thing going, back in his original identity. Whoa! Makes me almost sad they didn't get to actively rekindle it. Yet, the pain of Marie Kreutz's death is obviously still too recent to get over. Tastefully done, on the writers' part.<br/><br/>After that, comes the much-talked about Moroccan roof chase and the NYC car chase.

","The movie starts out on a semi-promising note, but quickly goes downhill. Acting was sub-standard and static, the fight choreography, while impressive, was impossible to enjoy because of the spastic camera work.

I found the movie to be one of the largest disappointments to ever cross my eyes since Star Wars Episode 1.<br/><br/>Now, the camera work. It would seem that the production crew spend so much money paying for flights and accommodations in cool locations that they didn't have enough money left over to rent tripods for the cameras. Long-zoom shots taken from the shoulder, and what can best be described as an epileptic fit during the action scenes did nothing for the movie, except make it so I didn't want to eat any more popcorn for fear of spewing it out onto the floor.<br/><br/>The story line was so poorly constructed that I was nearly out of my mind with boredom. Because of the horrible acting, I had no connection with the characters on screen, so even when I was supposed to be gripping my seat in anticipation, I was yawning, and trying to stay awake.<br/><br/>Waiting to see this movie on network TV is your best bet at enjoying it.

","This has been one heck of a summer for Action films, and trilogies, some good, some not so good. Live Free or Die Hard still stands out as the best action film I have seen in years and yet now The Bourne Ultimatum comes along and once again blows me through the back of the theater. If you've followed this series from the first installment then you can understand the absolute desire to closure in the series but still keep that element of mystery and that is precisely what the Bourne film makers did including Paul Greengrass, who has this distinct and often talked about format for his films that really works for a film like Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum. He took over from Doug Liman (who stayed on board as executive producer for the latter films) and Greengrass flawlessly and perfectly picked up the story without missing a beat and followed through all the continuity, all the mystery and then packed a wallop with this final installment. His sporadic and crazed filming style (the constant shaking of the camera) works really well for Bourne because it's that kind of hectic and crazy action and it's not overdone to the point where you're desperately trying to see what's going on. Greengrass knows how to send the story in the direction he wants and then to unfold brilliant action scenes when necessary.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is just down right brilliant as the quiet, intense, depressive Jason Bourne who has had everything taken from him and is now getting closer to ever to figuring out his identity. Bourne's brilliance is as top notch as ever and he's honed his skills beyond what they originally taught him so he's even more himself. Damon embraces that so well and performs this role with no ego, he's not Matt Damon impressing us all as Bourne, he IS Bourne and he is perfect at it pulling off the fighting, the killing, the eluding and still a very sympathetic character. Joan Allen returns from Supremacy as Pamela Landy, the anti-heroine for Bourne who wants to help him find his identity and uncover the truth of project Treadstone. Allen is appropriately intense for this role, and a great female lead to Damon's intense male role. I might even say she would do well in a bigger role but still her performance is great. Julia Stiles also returns as logistics agent Nicky Parsons. While never a big role in any of the three films, she's been a presence and her presence in this new installment opens up a new mystery in the Bourne history. Stiles is a terrific addition to the cast and the only one to return for all three films except Damon. Amazing character actor David Strathairn joins the cast as cold blooded head of the 'new' Treadstone Noah Vosen. Strathairn is an amazing follow up to the character of Alexander Conklin played by Chris Cooper who was an incredible nemesis for Bourne. Straithairn valiantly takes over that role and is amazing. Add in a supporting cast of the amazing Albert Finney (in a sadly very small role), Joey Ansah (in one of the most amazing fight scenes in movie history), and Colin Stinton.<br/><br/>What is the best part of The Bourne Ultimatum? Easy. If the Bourne films have been anything...they've been story driven...one of the best, if not THEE best stories from an action film in history. Amnesia, love, killers, assassins, government agencies, a cover up...all of this has been heaped on in two movies and these films have been so story driven and they have done such an incredible job of doing this story that there isn't anything to do in Ultimatum but wrap everything up. The best part of that is it leaves it wide open for some of the most incredible action scenes, and absolute non stop action that will leave you completely breathless. A car chase that rivals any film, a brutal hand to hand fight that leaves your jaw dropped onto the floor, brilliant roof top escapes and gun fights, and constant chaos everywhere. I will only say one minor flaw was I thought one particular chase went on a little long, it wasn't varied enough to really keep you riveted as long as it continued but it climaxed in a spectacular hand to hand fight so it was all worth while. Ultimatum also continues Bourne's amazing and exotic location shooting while still bringing Bourne home back to the door step of the United States and the C.I.A. The Bourne Ultimatum is an incredible end to the trilogy and I PRAY they change their minds and bring Bourne back for another round because this series has truly only gotten better from one film to the next. 10/10"
"the-movie-guy","8","4","10","2 August 2007"," Matt Damon is Bourne again to kill
","(My Synopsis) After having his memory erased, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is determined to find out who he really is. To do this, Jason must stay one step ahead of the people who turned him into a highly-trained killing machine. Jason doesn't know why he is being hunted, but he is going to find out no matter what it takes. Jason contacts Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), a journalist who has been investigating the Treadstone story for years. Ross has collected secret information about the Treadstone operation and the new operation named Blackbriar, which the U.S. government doesn't want to be revealed to the public. CIA assistant director Noah Vosen (David Strathaim), the new man in charge of Blackbriar, has been trying to stop Jason from finding the truth. Vosen sends a covert team of assassins out to neutralize Jason and Simon and close the chapter on Treadstone.<br/><br/>(My Comment) As the third in a series of Bourne movies, this one does not disappoint. You do not need to see the other two (Identity and Supremacy) to see this one. The globetrotting around the world and suspenseful non-stop action is a real audience pleaser. The evading and outsmarting of his enemies is what makes this spy movie special. The fight scenes and chase sequences are incredible. The new assassins are up to the task of taking on Jason. Damon plays the indestructible Jason Bourne as someone we can root for in finding truth, justice, and the American way. If you like the Bourne movies, you must see this one. However, I must say that the motion from some of the hand held cameras will make you feel a little uneasy. But with all the action that is going on, I don't know how they would film the movie without using them. (Universal Pictures Inc., Run time 1:51, Rated PG-13)(8/10)"
"Quinoa1984","6","5","14","5 August 2007"," it's not simply about the shaky camera that's the problem, in this tense but uneasy third Bourne film
","The Bourne trilogy has amassed a huge following of fans, particularly, it would seem, for the third film. I was a big fan of the first film, and found the second one- the first from director Paul Greengrass- to also work pretty well under the circumstances of a slightly lesser story. This time, with Ultimatum, it comes as something of a slight disappointment. Certain ingredients are still there and cooking well, such as the spectacularly well choreographed chase through the rooftops and windows of the Morroccan city, leading up to a really intense fight between Bourne and an assassin. As well as this there's some other elements added, like secrets and cover-ups within the NSA and CIA and whatnot, meant to bring up the charge of more to ponder about what is really going on with Bourne's original identity. But somehow it also feels a lot of the time like it hasn't been cooked well enough emotionally, or at least with enough ingenuity between the characters.<br/><br/>Matt Damon said recently in an interview that it was a tough and not very good experience working on the film, aside from other personal pressures in his life, because of the erratic shooting schedule and a lack of cohesive directing from Greengrass (they shot the film, much like POTC: At World's End, without a finished script). It makes some sense then to see why it's not Damon's, or Greengrass's, best work by far, even as both try to do what they can. But the problem with the latter (Damon is just much too two-dimensional, if that, as he doesn't express much more than one or more emotions until his final scene with Albert Finney) is the nature of the shooting to the material. It's not that a shaky hand-held camera is always a negative or a cause for nausea, and in fact Greengrass's own United 93, with it shot mostly in hand-held, worked perfectly with the subject matter. This time however there's a lack of consistency: having it hand-held for every scene, even if it's just a shot of characters looking at documents, becomes rote after a while as opposed to naturalistic.<br/><br/>It doesn't detract terribly from the action sequences, since they're still as in the other films very well choreographed in that non-stop chase kind of mode such as the NY chase scenes (which near the laughable as Damon almost becomes a superhero with the amount of damage he sustains with only, at one point, slightly bruised hands after the fight). But because the material itself has its own problems, such as the sort of typical cover-up plot that unfolds (and as there's some double-back crossing with a couple of other principle characters), the style sometimes gets in the way, as if its compensation to add edginess in close-ups. Then again the shaky-hand-held is almost pleasant when compared to the flashback first-person memory scenes, which are shot mostly as if through the eyes of someone on absinthe. The end results from 'Ultimatum' aren't completely grim, but there's not really too much of the unexpected, or a fully controlled approach to elevate it, even to having two more shots (an underwater moment) that follow what could have been a really terrific final shot. Neither the best nor worst of the summer 07 blockbusters"

","Visually incoherent storytelling of the basest sort. Stuck with an action movie script that looks like it was put together in shop class, Paul Greengrass is then hampered by the dullest possible supporting cast and a mandate to pander. The result is like an 80s Bruce Willis movie, only blurry and less amusing.<br/><br/>All three of these Bourne movies fail on just about every level. The action scenes, while for the most part live-action, are trendily overcut and blown out. They end up containing all the visual appeal of weak pc graphics. At least briefly there was a human interest story; now, Damon's the terminator, there's no love, and there's not enough action to make it anything but a bore. The crude device of the turncoat spook boss, and the crutch of the hit man's existential quest: these are as old as spy movies, old and, yes, moldy. This plot is no more extensive than the introductory chapter of a first person shooter game. Less so, in fact. I know more about Raccoon City than I know about this less realized world.<br/><br/>Once again, the occasionally excellent Matt Damon is given nothing to do but run up and down stairs, point a gun, and not smile. It's too bad, and indicative of what else is wrong with most of this type of movie: there's nobody to care about. I liked Franka Potente, but that was for her own virtues, not because of any value these movies sought out in her. And they killed her at the top of the second act. So with ULTIMATUM we yet again enter Bourne's world on the run, are given a minimum of information related to the story and no personal information whatsoever, except what's rehashed from the previous films. There is no new information in this one except the empty scene with Albert Finney at the end, a scene that lacks every sort of power anyway. What a waste; what an unsurprising letdown.<br/><br/>Greengrass may be possessed of more film-making knowledge than anybody right now; his work on ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" stands as superior by any measure. And he does something here that shows remarkable savvy: after each frantically edited fight scene, he pauses the action as a cue for the target audience to applaud. This is generalship and not to be taken lightly. To achieve a sense of claustrophobia he also limits himself to about four shots through the whole thing: over the shoulder close-up on one eye is his favorite. Technically, except for an annoying reliance on a shaky hand-held camera, he is very good. His handicaps here, especially the soon-to-be-dated visuals and the witless screenplay, relegate BOURNE to one-summer obscurity. Nobody will remember this moment. Probably this movie will make lots of money from people who like the way video games look, and allow Greengrass and Damon to make more personal films unhampered. That would be the only possible positive result of ""Bourne Ultimatum."""
"rhyscooper82","2","3","7","26 December 2008"," Fight scenes that make you puke.
","The whole movie was a total let down. I enjoyed the first movie as it was interesting, but this was just a waste of time and money.<br/><br/>The whole movie screamed at me ""WE HAVE A HIGH BUDGET!!""... I don't care. They didn't manage to achieve anything. The whole movie seemed like it was dark and everything, but there was nothing particularly moving about the whole thing. All they did was destroy few things and run around some cities with a few hundred extras.<br/><br/>When I watched the fight scenes, my jaw dropped. Most certainly not in a good way, either. It was some extremely shaky filming and fast cuts. The majority of the time I had no idea what was going on. The fighting itself wasn't too bad, it was like the Vernita Green fight from Kill Bill, but everything was far too shaky and twisted. There were a few shots that I swear were actually upside down. While watching the fight again on YouTube I realized that I wasn't just being picky when I first watched it, it was THAT terrible. It would be the perfect fight to watch if you adore motion sickness.<br/><br/>The whole timing of the guy running around between the extras was pathetic. It was the same crap you see in any spy movie, but it was executed terribly. There was no spark, if you've seen anything like it before you'll know how bad it was done.<br/><br/>My parents were surprised to see my reaction to the movie as I loved action and thriller movies. I went with a group of 40-year-olds, most of them enjoyed it... I was close to shooting myself.<br/><br/>The entire movie was directed, filmed and edited pretty bad.<br/><br/>I can see how some people like it -- they simply never see any dramatic, thriller or action movies.<br/><br/>Watching the trailer on YouTube I barely recognize the movie, which just proves how unmemorable and plainly different the trailer is to the movie. I honestly couldn't look past the shaky camera work - it was just distracting. I might watch this movie again just to make sure that it IS that bad, and I'm not just making diamonds out of coal."

The only upside to watching The Bourne Ultimatum is now I can look forward to the Wayans Brothers tearing this apart in a new spin off, Which will hopefully be entitled wannabe Bond!

"classicalsteve","5","3","7","4 September 2007"," More Car Smashes & Body Brawls at the Price of Story and Character
","The original Star Wars movie of 1977 was a huge breakthrough in visual effects. Simultaneously George Lucas, director and producer, clarified that the visual effects in Star Wars were there to help tell and enhance the story, not the other way around. In other words, the visual effects were there to support the story and were not an end in of itself. And that movies about visual effects with little or no story were badly conceived projects. Unfortunately, a lot of the action movies in recent years appear to be about pure action, as if the story is secondary and only there to support long action sequences.<br/><br/>In the third installment of the Bourne trilogy, The Bourne Ultimatum, the story, characters, motivations, even plot, take don't just take a back seat to endless action sequences. They appear to have been placed in the trunk with only a few moments where the lid was opened a crack to allow the audience to take a peak. If someone were to ask me what this movie is about, I would have to say it's about lots of chases, fist fights, and occasional explosions and gunfire. And about CIA executives that want to kill Bourne and so hire the hit men. Does that really make the story? <br/><br/>More than a few moments were quite unbelievable. When the CIA decide that Bourne is truly a threat and smarter than the rest of them, they hire one guy to take him out. God, these CIA executives just can't quite get him! And when Bourne enters another European city, it seems like he had lived there many years as he navigates the streets like a native. At one point, the assassin has Bourne in his sites! But does he take him out? There was only one moment in the film that had a little bit of a surprise to it, but upon reflection, that didn't even make sense.<br/><br/>For those who have not read the books, The Bourne Ultimatum movie has little to do with the original novel by Robert Ludlum. The original novel contains much more intrigue and plot interest, including a plot to destroy a KGB training facility. It is very unfortunate that audiences are willing to pluck down their hard-earned money and continue to convince movie producers that flash is far more important than substance. Just make a script full of action sequences, forget about story, and it'll make millions.<br/><br/>Even Matt Damon seemed bored at moments with the whole project. At one point, his character stops talking for a long time. He probably made more money on these studio-backed projects than his more interesting independent projects, but he probably needs the studio contract fee to help back his more artistic endeavors.<br/><br/>Overall, a wasted two hours. Yeah, it might have grossed 70 mill in its opening weekend at the box office, but who will be talking about it 20 years from now? This recent studio offering of the Bourne trilogy has been a huge disappointment, and the earlier TV-movie, The Bourne Identity, with Richard Chamberlain, now appears like a far better movie. If you haven't seen the original late 1980's movie, which is available on DVD, check it out. As for the movie in question, I just hope Matt Damon gets out of this alive."

","There were simply too many things I hated about this film for it to be anywhere near the grades people here have given this ridiculous movie.

Also, I am willing to bet that this film has more cuts edited together than any other film in history.This is the sort of film I loath being that it was made in the cutting room and not a clear vision of anyone in particular, usually the director. No one could have had a clue as to the out come of this film until the editor got his hands on it. Not my idea of great film making.<br/><br/>There was a time I would see anything with Matt Damon,because of the smart roles he chose.

"Monotreme02","8","3","7","18 August 2007"," The best action-thriller franchise since the 60's and 70's
","It is fairly simple to put a finger on just what makes this movie in particular and the Bourne trilogy as a whole such superior action films. Just compare The Bourne Ultimatum to another summer action-vigilante extravaganza, Live Free or Die Hard. While the filmmakers clearly had a blast making the latter film, it must be taken with a grain of salt and requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief. And indeed, most of the stunts, action scenes, concepts and characters in that film are so incredibly unbelievable they are borderline parody. But the Bourne movies have this relentless knack of keeping it real  real-world settings, great attention to detail and protocol, on-set action and car chases, and just an overall realistic and totally believable feel to them. Indeed, it is this ultra-realistic, totally believable aspect and tone that makes me appreciate the Bourne series far more than other spy franchises such as Mission: Impossible, Jack Ryan, and, dare I say it  James Bond.<br/><br/>But that's not all that makes the Bourne films unique and sets them apart from most of the other movies in its genre. In most action-adventure films, the sides are very clear and present: The main character is the hero and operates solely for the side of good, while the villains are also clearly outlined. But in the Bourne films, these relations are far less black-and-white. Jason Bourne himself is clearly the protagonist, but obviously doesn't operate for the ""greater good"". He's on a personal crusade, seeking revenge and information, and on the way, breaks all sorts of laws and rules and kills whoever stands in his path. On the other hand, all the various CIA operatives working to catch him, it could be said, are just doing their job. We don't have any super villain masterminds; we just have a bunch of men and women doing their job trying to catch someone who clearly is dangerous and a threat. It is these ambivalent and conflicting motives of the films' characters that make them such a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Specifically on Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and all the technical crew do a stellar job of creating the Bourne world and relaying the realism and believability of the story. Greengrass again utilizes his hyper-realistic documentary style of film-making that featured in all his previous films, most recently United 93. It's disorienting and confusing, but the style serves the film's purposes perfectly. It is also absolutely wonderful to see an action-thriller movie that prominently features on-set, practical stunts and effects, as opposed to using lots of CGI to tweak up the action and to make things easier. And what action sequences this film has! From the first scene Bourne grabs you, and we the audience literally run through the movie right along with him. It's just fascinating to see how Bourne's mind works; how he thinks on the spot, always sees the broader picture, and of course does his fair share of close hand-to-hand combat  those scenes in particular are breathtakingly well choreographed. It is also worth mentioning the insane chase sequences, both on foot and in vehicle, and I'm particularly glad that the film's advertising didn't give too much away of the film's grand finale car chase, which is one of the most thrilling and outstanding action sequences I've seen lately.<br/><br/>One can't review this film without mentioning the cast. In all of its installments the Bourne series was blessed with some fantastic supporting character talent  in the first film we had Chris Cooper and Brian Cox both deliver outstanding work. The Bourne Supremacy added the unexpected but more-than-welcome casting of Joan Allen, one of the most underrated actresses working today. And in this film, we are introduced to characters played by David Strathairn and Albert Finney, with Strathairn in particular delivering absolutely stellar work. But the true star and the one who ties it all together is, of course, Matt Damon. Damon is an actor I have grown to appreciate more and more in recent years, and especially in light of last year's release of The Departed, I am very surprised that Damon only has one acting Oscar nomination. His work on the Bourne films is far subtler as his character does a lot more running and fighting than he does talking. But Damon succeeds in doing what most A-list actors fail to do: He disappears into the character. During most of the film, I forgot that I was watching Matt Damon because I was so engrossed in the action and into his character. This level of disappearance is one that actors such as Tom Cruise are simply unable to do. And for that, I commemorate Damon all the more. Julia Stiles, on the other hand, doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but one would think that a more established or talented actress would be able to do much more with the character than she does. Still, she's not a burden nor a distraction like Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, so her casting is more than forgivable.<br/><br/>Director Greengrass, his crew, Damon and the rest of the cast do an absolutely magnificent job on this film: The story is delivered outstandingly, the action is directed to perfection, and just the whole overall tone and energy of the film is pitch-perfect. Also worth mentioning is composer John Powell, whose percussion-based score more than enhances the pace and adrenaline of the film. In the end, everything comes together to create a brilliant, well-executed and just pitch-perfect action-thriller spy film, and the success and quality of this third installment in the Bourne series undoubtedly seals the trilogy's fate as one of the strongest, unfailing film trilogies in recent years, and probably the best action-thriller movies since the 60's and 70's films like The French Connection or Bullitt."

","Every once in a while, you come across a movie that sucks you in to the point where you forget you're watching a movie. By far the best sequel ever, this film makes you feel what it's like to be on the run and not knowing who to trust. The thing that really got me hooked into the movie was the fact that the villains were just as good as Bourne. In a genre where the protagonist is usually unrealistically better than his enemies, The Bourne Ultimatum gives us a situation where he is not safe at any time and where his enemies constantly find out where he is and what he is doing. Recommended to anyone who wants to see a brilliant spy thriller and has the attention span to sit through, the one flaw in the picture, the blatant overuse of hand-held cameras."
"robinhoodfilms","2","3","7","17 August 2007"," Good film, terrible direction!
","What is wrong with Paul Greengrass? This film has the same frenetic, sloppy feel of its predecessor which considerably takes away from the action. Camera movement can certainly accentuate a moment or scene, but the Greengrass does it, you can't tell what's going on half the time. All the other elements are in place for a good action film, but the director screws it up. I suppose there's a certainly freedom for a director to be able to show up on set with no shot list or storyboards and just be able to instruct his cameraman to just keep the camera moving and get what you can. If two people are fighting and you can't tell who's doing the hitting and who's getting hit...that's bad direction. If there's a car chase and half the time you can't tell who's shooting, crashing or dodging...that's bad direction. I can just imagine the editor being handed the raw footage and thinking ""what the hell am I supposed to do with this""! Well, he probably did the best he could. Fire the director!"

It is my contention that there is none better at choreographing and implementing complex and exciting camera movements and sequences. Rouse's editing is fast paced and spot-on, using point of focus and movement to draw the eye precisely where it needs to go.<br/><br/>Greengrass' visceral visual style added to a solid story and a character that the audience can't help to root for every step of the way makes for a roller-coaster thrill ride - I found myself nearly constantly gripping my plush theater seat, laughing out loud and cheering for Bourne at each of his successes. There were more ""YES!"" moments in this film even than the last, which was icing on the cake of a phenomenal action film. Again, there is simply none better than the Bourne franchise, Rouse, Damon, and of course, the puppet-master himself, Paul Greengrass. My hat goes off to you sir."

"stevetseitz","7","3","7","9 August 2007"," Gritty, dynamic and engrossing
","The ""Jason Bourne"" series of spy movies has been a great showpiece for Matt Damon who coolly cruises through these films like a Tiger Shark waiting for his next victim. He is seemingly always one step ahead of the espionage bureaucrats who seek him and one move faster than the latest ""asset"" assigned to neutralize him.<br/><br/>It is sickening, but not surprising that federal government employees would devote the taxpayer time, effort and dollars to covering their behinds, but as an employee of the federal government I can assure the viewer that it is not that far off base.<br/><br/>While I doubt a rogue agent would alarm them much, I do know that media exposure of their training and methods would draw much ire from the public and heat from their superiors.<br/><br/>Damon was made for the role because he oozes confidence and competence and brings a graveness to his mission as Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>Perhaps a bit too much hand-held made some of the action scenes a tad bit more confusing for the viewer. This, while trying to heighten realism, actually prevents the viewer from suspending his or her disbelief which is a prerequisite for a movie with a super-spy in it.<br/><br/>In other words, if we, the audience, with the ""third person omniscient"" viewpoint can barely follow the action, it becomes unbelievable that Bourne, even with his super spy skills and instincts, could possibly predict the actions of his friends and enemies. The crowed train station scene recalled the brilliant mall set-piece in ""Minority Report"" with Damon in the role of the ""pre-cog"" who could see the future or at least accurately predict the next move of his nemesis. I thought, ""Man, if one of those doors were locked, this scene and this movie would be over by now."""
"Buddy-51","7","3","7","6 August 2007"," impressive film-making, less impressive storytelling
","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" has much in common with this summer's earlier ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" in that both movies are essentially one long chase sequence involving a protagonist whose ingenuity and grace under pressure are surpassed only by his seeming indestructibility.<br/><br/>This is the third, and, we're told, final installment in the Robert Ludlum series about Jason Bourne, the agent programmed by a rogue element of the CIA to be a mindless killing machine. In ""Ultimatum,"" Bourne, who has since long disowned his professional-assassin past, is being hunted down by the Langley operatives who created him in the first place, believing that they risk career-destroying exposure and criminal prosecution if they don't silence their boy permanently.<br/><br/>Acclaimed director Paul Greengrass (""Bloody Sunday,"" ""United 93"") brings his considerable film-making skills to bear on the material, sprinting headlong right out of the starting gate and giving us few moments to catch our breath on the way to the finish line. By employing a jittery hand-held camera throughout, Greengrass intensifies the chaotic nature of many of the scenes and brings a spontaneity and immediacy to the action on screen. In addition, the razor-sharp editing and plethora of locales (the film makes stops in New York, Moscow, London, Paris, Madrid, Tangier and a number of other cities) add greatly to the movie's effectiveness. We're never in any one place for very long, and a mere blink of an eye or lapse of attention at any crucial moment could spell disaster for anyone dutifully trying to follow the plot.<br/><br/>I must say, however, that for all the tremendous movie-making pyrotechnics on display here, the movie suffers a bit from distention and overkill in the long run. After about the first half hour or so of nonstop action, the movie becomes a trifle wearying and redundant. We find ourselves wishing it would actually put the brakes on for a few moments so we could get to know the characters to a greater extent. For almost the entire movie (until the final sequences, that is), Bourne is little more than a nonstop running machine, dodging bullets, karate-chopping bad guys, jumping off rooftops, crashing through windows. All this is very impressive as stunt work and action-figure hoopla, but a little of it goes a very long way after awhile.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has become very comfortable in Bourne's skin over the course of the three movies, but the role doesn't provide him with a great deal to sink his teeth into in terms of genuine acting. David Strathairn, Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Albert Finney also do well in their assorted roles, but like Damon, they are limited by the restrictive nature of the film-making.<br/><br/>Thus, for all its big-name, high-priced talent, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is more a director's picture than an actor's, making Greengrass the default star of the movie when all is said and done. And if we are ultimately left wondering if it may not be just a bit too much of a good thing, well, the goodness itself is treat enough these days, I guess."

You don't need to read another gushing rave review; there's no shortage of those here.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" more than just another action/adventure/spy movie with elements of comic book super-heroism; is that ""Bourne"" is actually quite effective as cutting edge political satire.<br/><br/>The way it subversively/viscerally exposes the morally, ethically and spiritually compromised hypocritical nature of policies like the global invasion of privacy, rendition, torture, dehumanizing/identity raping conditioning (a la The Manchurian Candidate ;-), state sanctioned murder/assassination (and all manner of just plain old evil) speaks volumes about what has been happening for a long time and is still happening now. The denials of involvement from high level officials remain as implausible as ever.<br/><br/>It really should be common sense/ethics 101 that two wrongs don't make a right, that the ends don't justify the means, that the cover up ends up being worse than the crime, that being more evil/ruthless than your evil/ruthless enemies actually means you've already lost your soul, that power corrupts etc etc etc.<br/><br/>This masterpiece works on the mundane level of Hollywood blockbuster entertainment, yet (mostly) avoids the trite cotton candy realms of cliché.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is as good as Hollywood gets. Food for the thrill seeking child in all of us as it also feeds a quest for the meaning/manifestation of human Spirit!<br/><br/>My prediction: Three Oscars...at least!!!<br/><br/>As to the question of a sequel; I say yes. <br/><br/>Without giving anything away I can say that the movie leaves lots of room for a Re-Bourne.

Every action sequence is realistic and awesome to a point where you feel every toss, turn, and deadly punch. The Flow just seems so real and spontaneous that you would think this was a documentary.

","When The Bourne Identity hit the screen in 2002, the Cold War was decidedly over and spy movies had lost their relevance in the post-911 aftermath. The Bourne Identity masterfully resonated with our psyches: here was a man, despite all his abilities, unable to answer a basic question: ""who is my enemy and why are they after me?"" The next installment took a different turn, Doug Liman was replaced by Paul Greengrass, and while Brian Cox was brought back as Ward Abbott, the electric performance of Chris Cooper was missing. The Bourne Ultimatum not surprisingly shares more with the second than the first. Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy with more intense action than ever and Bourne traversing more continents than ever.<br/><br/>However, the writers clearly make an effort to tie all three movies together. In fact, do yourself a favor and watch the Bourne Identity before you watch the Bourne Ultimatum. Many minor details from the first become critical plot elements in the third.<br/><br/>While I can watch the Bourne Identity again and again, I am afraid the Bourne Ultimatum has about the same weight as the Bourne Supremacy.

However, The Bourne Ultimatum is the best in my opinion among the three. Fantastic as it is with Matt Damon giving perhaps the best, the movie is thrilling, so much realistic and engrossing. Stunts and action scenes were executed almost perfectly with awe inspiring sound effects and sound editing which brought Bourne Ultimatum 3 well deserved Oscars.

But his ""mental stunts"" are always reasonable: you understand them, which makes the film much more effective (it would work even with much less action, thanks to intrigue).<br/><br/>By the way, Happy Birthday Joan Allen (great, classy actress, beautiful and elegant). Pamela Landy adds another touch of realism: if you look in the real world, you will see super-professional women just like her. Perhaps Bournes do not exist, but Pam Landys certainly do.<br/><br/>The trademark (and landmark) fight sequences reach their top in the series (one of the aspects imitated by recent Bond films) and Julia Styles' Nikki is there to stare in disbelief as Bourne battles his hardest adversary. The close up on the face of this very fine actress (excellent Desdemona in ""Hamlet 2000"") is much more shocking than, for example, showing the bloody corpse of the deceased killer.<br/><br/>Original and bold plot move, placing the last scene of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" in the middle of ""Ultimatum"" (of course they are the same scene, in spite of minor differences!), thus playing with the viewer's memory.<br/><br/>This time the car chases, another trademark, become self-consciously over the top and almost self-parody, with Bourne getting a police car and taking more risks than ever.<br/><br/>Awesome final confrontation in the buildings of the secret agencies, with Bourne and Landy communicating by subtle hints they are sending each other.<br/><br/>I can't hardly wait to see ""The Bourne Legacy""."

","The Bourne Ultimatum was one of the best movies of 2007. It had tough competition with Spider-man 3 and Pirates 3 which at least to me were big disappointments compared to the Bourne Ultimatum. Matt Damon continues to prove how good of an actor he is in this film. He's the perfect choice as Bourne a highly skilled former CIA assassin who's trying to discover the secret behind his mysterious past. The rest of the supporting cast including Julia Stiles, David Straithan, Edgar Ramirez, Albert Finney, and Joan Allen are all great in their roles. I can't think of one thing I didn't think about this film. The ending fits the film and is a worthy addition to add to the impressive spy trilogy. As long as Matt Damon is up to playing Bourne again I can't see why they couldn't make more. Because all three Bourne movies have been good and is one trilogy that didn't end up being a disappointment. I was very impressed with The Bourne Ultimatum and is now one of the favorite movies. If you haven't seen this film yet then go see it now. You won't regret it."
"Turfseer","6","2","4","19 January 2009"," More cheap shots at the CIA
","Having just watched the Bourne Supremacy recently for a second time, I must confess that I was a bit disappointed in The Bourne Ultimatum, the third installment in the Bourne series. The Ultimatum is basically a continuation of The Supremacy. It has all the good elements of Installment #2 which include a series of memorable chase scenes. The opening chase scene where Bourne (unsuccessfully) attempts to save a British journalist from being assassinated is deftly choreographed as Bourne and his hapless charge try to escape from CIA goons and a shadowy hit-man in Waterloo station in London. The second excellent chase scene is shot in Morocco as Bourne attempts to save a CIA operative played by Julia Stiles. That scene is shot in two parts with Bourne following a CIA hit-man on a motorbike and then later on foot through the winding streets of Tangiers. The chase culminates in a violent fight to the death between Bourne and the hit-man. The final chase scene which packs punch is shot in New York City as Bourne breaks into CIA headquarters and steals incriminating documents from the safe belonging to a high level deputy chief played by David Strathairn and then eluding his pursuers by driving his car off of the roof in a parking garage (it looks like all the Bourne movies must end with the obligatory car chase).<br/><br/>The plot in the Ultimatum is a bit clearer than in the Supremacy. It seems that Operation Treadstone has now been replaced by Operation Blackbriar, which basically represents an escalation and expansion of the malicious and illegal CIA program. This time the stakes have been raised: it's the CIA director and his chief Deputy themselves who have the primary responsibility for the program's operation in contrast to the lone traitor in the CIA's midst, Abbott, who committed suicide at the end of The Supremacy.<br/><br/>If you feel it necessary to criticize the CIA, why not utilize a fair and balanced approach? Unfortunately, the writers of The Bourne Ultimatum stack the deck with comic book villains which suggest that the higher-ups at the CIA are all odious bad guys. Don't they do any good at all? What about the fight against international terrorism? According to the Bourne Ultimatum, the people who give the orders at the CIA have went way beyond their mandatethat the use of torture is common and is used not only on opponents but on their own agents (as evidenced by the brainwashing of David Webbnow Jason Bourne). In the comic book, black and white world of The Bourne Ultimatum, leave it to (a now redeemed) Jason Bourne along with his two leading ladies (Joan Allen and Julia Stiles) to fight the out of control CIA bad guys.<br/><br/>Despite the specious subtext of The Ultimatum, with its juvenile view of the CIA and how it operates, The Bourne Ultimatium is still a slick and well choreographed action flick. I'm downgrading The Ultimatum to a ""6"" as opposed to the ""7"" I gave to The Supremacy. Let's hope that the producers decide to rehabilitate the image of the CIA somewhat in the fourth installment of Jason Bourne. I'm a registered Democrat but I loathe cheap shots."
"Cristi_Ciopron","2","2","4","27 November 2008"," Monotonous, trite
","This movie is quite cryptic, not having much of an interest outside its franchise; and as a matter of fact, it is more like an episode in a series, than like an installment in a franchise; it has not even a relative autonomy. On the other hand, it was made without any idea of the 'Bourne' narrative. It should narrate something. What does it narrate? Look, the newest 'Bond' has an intelligible tale of revenge (not to mention that Craig is matchlessly superior to Damon). But, again, there's no peculiar notion of 'Bourne', and of what 'Bourne' is about here! I'm glad I made it once , I will not see this movie again.<br/><br/>I understand the lack of 'Bond' elements; but I do not excuse the lack of 'Bourne' elements.<br/><br/>Its protagonist is an actor that I very much dislike, and there is like a general like of glamor in this movie (is this the Ludlumian realism?look at the '88 TV adaptation'Bourne' does not require absolutely unglamorous characters). So I did not like any of the actorsnot even the mildly attractive Pam.<br/><br/>Then, it's very poorvery thinonly a rush, a hurry, a runwith not much elseand quite unspectacular action. As it is ,the movie is not suspenseful or funbut quite monotonous.<br/><br/>I know 'Bourne' it's supposed to be fast movingbut so is 'Bond', so is Hitchcockand the results are very different! What is BOURNE ULTIMATUM about? No characters, monotonous and thirdrate action, no meaning, no fun. Truly, one of the most mindless and empty, _uni-dimensional movies. Completely unlikable actors.<br/><br/>Revenge? No, just mindless monotonous fast moving.<br/><br/>It's not only monotonous and insipid; it's astringent as wellso that it misses even the lure of a straight B movie.<br/><br/>'Bourne' is not 'Bond' exactly because it should be so much more psychologicaland here the movie offers nothing, no character is alivesimple agitated puppets! The most importanta 'Bourne' should be humanly very interesting and involvingnot a stupid mindless chase.<br/><br/>The villains, 'Noah', etc., are also as uninteresting and underdeveloped as possible.<br/><br/>The director seems to have had to aimsto evacuate everything 'Bourne'; and to replace it with everything 'unbourne', badly executed.<br/><br/>The only moment is when Noah asks 'Bourne?', and is answered 'No, Dash!'.<br/><br/>This is Bourne without Bourne. It's also very assuming and unfriendly to the audience _un-familiarized with the Bourne story. (But this is the problem with many recent quickly made trilogies or franchiseslike MATRIX, RINGS, WARSthey assume the previous installment is already well knownthey are for fans, not for the general audienceand even BOND took now this path too ).<br/><br/>This 'Bourne' does not try to be something elseit only strives not to be itself.<br/><br/>How comes even the action is so _unenjoyable and dull? There's no suspense, no excitement.<br/><br/>So, it's a nonexistent content, extremely badly narrated. 'Bourne' should be about so many things; this one is about nothing.<br/><br/>No excitement, no verve, no suspenseso, if these directors do not like either 'Bourne' or the '88 TV movie, why do they make these 'adaptations'?"

","I've tried to watch this movie on several occasions and could not make it to the end without dozing off. I acknowledge it has good action sequences but the plot is paper thin. Was there even anything new in terms of the storyline that wasn't previously revealed in the first two Bourne movies? Plus, it's ludicrous the way the head of the black ops division of the CIA ... the freakin' CIA ... refers to Bourne. ""Jesus Christ. That's Jason Bourne."" As if Bourne were a demi-god. Maybe he really is the way he survives an explosion from 10 feet away with hardly a scratch, or walks away from a 4 story car crash from a parking garage and another by wrapping his arm around a safety belt, and swims away after getting, presumably, shot and falling about 50 feet into the East River.<br/><br/>A movie can't just be a string of action sequences, which Ultimatum is. That's what trailers are for."

Bourne travels across Moscow, London and Madrid to try and find answers whilst Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Noah Vosen (David Strahairn) try to track him down. Winner of 3 Oscars, The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best thrillers of recent times with edge of your seat car chases, gun fights and great characters.<br/><br/>The plot is solid with mystery and excitement at every turn with the characters leading the way. It's exciting, enjoyable, interesting and energetic throughout, justifying the genre wonderfully and proving that the genre is not just about special effects, but more about the plot, which makes the film unique.<br/><br/>What makes the film great for me is the work that went in to make it. Hardly any special effects were added, the team use real filming locations in Madrid, Waterloo Station and America, Damon does a lot of his own stunts and all of these factors are fantastic to make the film amazing and even more realistic.<br/><br/>The action and thriller genre gets scrutinized for its lack of realism but this film excels as it is always realistic and doesn't go over the top with special effects and action sequences. It uses the right amount to make it exciting and interesting for viewers.<br/><br/>Damon, Allen, Stiles and the whole cast are fantastic. The locations for the scenes are great, especially the scene at Waterloo Station which is a landmark for the thriller genre.<br/><br/>The ending is unbelievably tense and exciting.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass' fast flowing direction justifies the plot beautifully.<br/><br/>Like the other Bourne films, it's sophisticated, mystifying and energetic but with more intensity. All the films are different but this is probably the best because of its style and energy.<br/><br/>A one of a kind thriller, one of the best trilogies ever made."
"luciengrey24","10","2","4","5 January 2008"," high octane,intelligent action, simply brilliant
","Previously , if asked at the beginning of the year (2007) i would have said without blinking that the Die Hard franchise , was the greatest action franchise they is. But with the release of the last Bourne Installment, that is in great challenge. Jasoon Bourne is easily the best spy/assassin in movie history, he is everything that Jameb Bond can never be. They're is just something about the way his rain switches gears when presented with different situations, and how he gets himself out of them.He is always ten steps ahead of his adversaries, and that is incredible for man that was function on muscle memory and autopilot. He didn't need any gadgets or one liners to be cool.His silence said a lot more than any line he could ever come up with. The Bourne series have completely redefined what an action movie should be,and what we should expect, the same way the John MaClane character changed what an action hero should be like,( prior to the muscle bound days of Arnie and Sly).<br/><br/>It's is clear in the way Bond was revamped in Casino Royale, that they were taking cues from Bourne, and the Mission Impossiple franchise may have also been an inkling that Bond needed to be reinvented. Personally, i would say that Bourne Ultimatum, is the best action movie i have seen in many years, on so many levels. Not only does it have awesome chase scenes, and brilliantly shot and choreographed fight scenes, but it's a highly intelligent movie, that's high octane entertainment. Matt Damon, has established himself as an action star, and i hope to see more collaborations of him and Director Paul Greengrass in the near future."
"alessiovezzani","3","2","4","18 November 2007"," The Bourne trilogy proved one movie too long
","I entered the theatre almost certain of treating myself with two hours of well-written though action-packed spy thriller. I left it over-bored by the constant suspension of disbelief required by the movie to accept even the simplest twists of the story, all relying on coincidence and wild guess instead of necessity - see the Tangiers manhunt to get an idea - and disappointed by the utter irrelevance of the final ""revelation"" which in retrospect deflate the moral quest the entire trilogy is built upon.<br/><br/>So a secret agent needs to be programmed to kill targets at the Agency request? Unbelievable as it is, this only means that he has possibly chosen the wrong career, and the Government has wasted the taxpayers money by recruiting a subject unsuitable for the job. To discover that the agent himself enrolled voluntarily to the conditioning program only depicts Bourne as a weak character, by being first in need of some extra boost to sustain his vocation, then by collapsing guilt-ridden. <br/><br/>Two minor notations. First on style: the frantically fuzzy cinematography may well be urgent and subjective and in the middle of the action, but dispenses the director with accurately staged hunts, crashes and all that in an action movie requires to be choreographed. Throughout the entire ""Bourne Ultimatum"" you have to guess to complete the picture of what's happening on screen beyond simple dynamic effects, and in the end you can't escape fatigue and the feeling of a sloppy production. <br/><br/>Second: Matt Damon. I don't discuss here his acting skills, which for this kind of movie are more than adequate - elsewhere I usually find him wooden - but simply his being physically capable of holding the title of ""sexiest man alive"" recently bestowed on him by ""People"". Not in his prime for some time now, in this last Bourne incarnation the broad, coarse features of his face are more evident than ever, singling him out as a natural candidate for an ""Elephant Man"" remake. He's certainly redefining the concept of sexy, outstretching it to the point where no suspension of disbelief is ever possible."

Once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were feasible, and the fighting was incredible. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>All I really have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and this is no exception. The action, the stakes, the plot. How they do it I will never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies. Because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie, we wouldn't have this one to talk about.<br/><br/>So don't go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not December 11th Bourne comes home to you!"

","From acclaimed film director, Paul Greengrass comes the third installment in Jason Bourne series. Starring Academy Award winner Matt Damon and nominees David Strathairn, Joan Allen and Albert Finney. Great action with an even greater storyline make Bourne one of the most successful sequels in decades.<br/><br/>Matt Damon brings a great sense of vengeance and humanity to his role and engages himself in a character even if he is incredibly reserved. What people tend to forget is that Damon is one of our most underrated and talented actors working in Hollywood today. Turning in great after great performances in The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Departed and Syriana, Damon is on his way to a future acting win to bookend his writing win. His ""Jason Bourne"" is as complex as he is simple and gives us the range of an actor that the audience believes.<br/><br/>Joan Allen is our most overdue, besides Julianne Moore, working actress today without an Oscar. While it isn't the Oscar bait role that every person dreams of, she brings that needed exuberance to a role and balances this film perfectly. Snubbed for The Upside of Anger, fans of Allen will wait for the role that will land at on a Kodak stage. However, her ""Pamela Landy"" is quite an impressive performance nonetheless, and is a likable character that the viewer doesn't mind seeing on screen.<br/><br/>Our supporting players David Strathairn and Albert Finney play their villainous roles effectively and exquisitely. We enjoy their on screen presence and look forward to future work from these veterans but there is no shining when Allen and Damon are this good.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Tony Gilroy, Scott Burns, and George Nolfi is quick, engaging and intoxicating as it keeps the viewer enticed the entire time without giving us a breath. Adapting it from the series was an achievement especially when it's an action story, which can often take away from the storyline. They never lose that character depiction and development. Along with the direction by United 93's director Paul Greengrass with his lovely precision of directing and never losing site of source material, Greengrass is our next big directing icon for generations to come, if not there already.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a great addition to a action, crime genre like Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and Casino Royale. Sound and Cinematography are feasible considerations for Oscar in the upcoming season but it is subtle and can be overshadowed and steamrolled by bigger projects. But audiences can easily enjoy this gem of cinema.<br/><br/>Grade: ****/****"

","If you didn't see the other movies- you might like this one. BUT, If you saw the first Bourne movie you will notice this third addition is a big fat ZERO compared to the first movie.<br/><br/>This is a pathetic addition to what was a fantastic start. Paul Greengrass is the director for the latter two parts of BOURNE Trilogy -the ones that totally SUCK- this movie and the one before it-Bourne Supremacy. I had wondered why the first movie was so GREAT and this third movie and the one before it were so terrible... they changed directors... to PAUL GREENGRASS instead of the original, DOUG LIMAN is what happened.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass is the same idiot that brought you the propaganda piece flight 93.. as if!!<br/><br/>Now he has put the final touches on ruining what was originally a GENIUS movie from Doug Liman.<br/><br/>I found out why Paul ruined the films from his own mouth: (interview)<br/><br/>""Paul Greengrass: Directing a Bourne film is chaos like you've never ever seen, believe me! But the reason for that is the Bourne films are a very interesting collision between a sort of indie mentality, which is where (original director) Doug (Liman) would come from, and the mainstream Hollywood mentality.""<br/><br/>So Paul is obviously the Hollywood Hatchet Man for the Bourne series-his job is to cut out what's good in the footage and put in what's holly-popular and wonder why it isn't any good at the finished product.<br/><br/>You don't get genius by serving up year old leftovers!!!! That's a lesson Hollywood has yet to learn.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity is a great movie. The Bourne Supremacy is utter faux-indie Hollywood shake camera crap. The Bourne Ultimatum is derivative of both films in that it serves up a new plot - but the same footage as before and nothing even slightly representative of having any imagination whatsoever.<br/><br/>I really wonder why they bothered shooting this film. It has so much Bourne footage that we have already seen, Ad Nauseam. How many times do we need to see the same scene of Jason Bourne running around with the CIA on his heels at every corner and some civilian in tow screaming at everything going on around them as Jason kicks their ass. This scene is played over and over and over- like there is nothing else to the story but this scene being repeated.<br/><br/>I can make the next flick- I'll just have Matt Damon run around a building with people chasing him.. that's pretty much the main plot twist in this movie- it's time to run around in a new building. there so much more you can do with this character than play a game of tag!!!!! Maybe they should read the Bourne Books for some ideas??? ;-)<br/><br/>It really and truly sucks to know that certain television episodes of La Femme Nikita are superior to a major Hollywood release with full budget.<br/><br/>PLOT: Bourne is getting closer to uncovering the secret of his training and his past- but we have to watch a whole lot of repetitive scenes of the same stupid chase over and over again with no character development, nothing that wasn't done better in the first movie, and not any interesting characters or situation whatsoever through the entire film. Sure there's some cool action here and there- but its the exact same action as was in the first one- only the first movie did it ten times better.<br/><br/>Go see the Bourne Identity and burn the other two movies in this trilogy of Hollywood excess leading to imbecile releases such as this one and it's ugly brother Bourne Supremacy. Both are infantile in character development and fully unoriginal in cinematography."

Mostly the action involved a shaky camera and some loud noises, cars crashing. Nothing really spectacular.<br/><br/>As far as plot twists go, this was as straightforward as can be.

","Java Man Reviews "" The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007, PG-13). Directed by Paul Greengrass. Written by Tony Gilrooy, Scott Z. Burns & George Nolfi, based upon the Robert Ludlum novel. Starring Matt Damon, Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Joan Allen, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, Edgar Ramirez & Albert Finney. Running Time: 111 minutes <br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Jason Bourne (Damon) is still on the run from the mysterious government agency that turned him into a black-ops killer and now wants to get rid of him. A London investigative reporter (Considine) unintentionally unmasks Bourne, and the two of them embark on the first of several intriguing and complicated chases. But as the CIA pursues Bourne it is really he who is doing the pursuing, trying to find those responsible for turning him into a killing machine. After London he heads for Madrid, Tangier, Paris, Moscow and, finally, to New York City.<br/><br/>Heading up the quest to eliminate Bourne is Noah Vosen (Strathairn), the hiss-worthy G-Man in charge of the CIA's killer spooks. Reluctantly, he must recruit the assistance of Pamela Landy (Allen), an internal investigator who has also been chasing Bourne, but who has developed a professional respect for him and wants him alive. In Tangier, Bourne encounters field op Nicky Parsons (Stiles), who works for Vosen, but has become disillusioned with her boss's methods. She joins Bourne on the run as he continually beats the agency at its own game, outwitting its surveillance systems and besting its top killers.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS <br/><br/>It's a simple formula, but it works: Keep Jason Bourne in a state of perpetual motion. But even though the film is one continuous chase, it still manages to create memorable and believable characters. The credit for that must go to director Greengrass, a Brit whose work is a cut above the current crop of crash-it, blow-it-up action hacks. In addition to the Bourne franchise, he has also directed some of the best docudramas ever put on screen, namely Bloody Sunday (2002) about the troubles in Northern Ireland and United 93 (2006), about the passengers who thwarted terrorists from blowing up our nation's capitol. He keeps things moving fast and keeps us involved; we are in on it, as though joining Bourne on the run.<br/><br/>Damon's performance is first-rate as usual, in what now has become his signature role. Pros Allen and Strathairn provide a revealing contrast between the two sides of the espionage coin (the dedicated pro and the sinister spook). Stiles sparkles as the quiet, smart G-woman who helps Bourne. Later in the film, Finney has a few crucial scenes to wrap up the series. Glen, as the Machiavellian mastermind who heads the CIA, will likely play a major role if a fourth Bourne is mounted.<br/><br/>As for the story, there is no real need for a complicated plot, just a reason for Bourne to be in a given city when Greengrass is ready to stage the next set-up. Spectacular cinematography and involving editing, combined with challenging location work, make this by far the summer's best action flick.<br/><br/>Will there be a fourth Bourne? Though Ludlum has passed on, Ian Fleming's death did not stop James Bond from saving the world for nearly half a century now."

","I was really anxious to see this movie. I had seen first two sequels and the preview made my fingers tingle. How disappointing it was to see the errors in the movie and shaky action filming. It could have been so much better. I got nervous when the cameraman showed signs of Parkinson's disease during a simple interview of the journalist with the CIA officer. I had hoped it was only incidental, but that was in vain. It got worse during each action scene. Why the hell do they film it as if the actors have cameras attached to every part of their body? Doesn't the director know what the effect is on a large movie theater screen? And then the errors: you can't simply start an Audi by pulling the wires loose and start it. It's got an immobiliser. It's the same with the motorcycle in Tangiers (no, not the immobiliser, but the wiring harness is under the frame, he does it just as fast as you and me would stick a key in an ignition key). And then the scene where he phones Pam Landy from the opposite empty building. Come on, he did that in the previous movie. No way, he would be able to get away with that a second time. Not even the CIA is that dumb. Even his comment 'you look tired' was used in the previous one. So, eventually, it was a disappointment. Not a bad movie, but certainly not as good as it could have been with a few simple improvements. Well, hopefully, # 4 will be better."

And I thought, well, to make matters worse, this guy obviously had a couple of beers before starting and might even have been swigging them during the film itself seeing how the camera jolted violently quite frequently, 'bout, say, once every two seconds or so.

It has no tired clichés no dire puns or one liners and it packs the gritty realism that puts James Bond to bed.<br/><br/>The bad guys are also much improved upon in this installment, although I do lament the absence of Brian Cox who is always worth watching no matter what he is in.However David Strathairn is almost as good. I've enjoyed his work in the past in LA Confidential and Goodnight and Good Luck.<br/><br/>I've noticed that many people don't like the up close and personal camreras.

And it also wins the average movie goer's hearts. <br/><br/>To be honest, I had read a couple of reviews of Ultimatum before heading down to see this flick, and I have to say I was a bit skeptical. Especially since the same reviewer had bashed ""At World's End"" and ""Ocean's 13"", both of which in my opinion were classics. But I was equally impressed. This is probably the first movie of the year which fulfills your expectations and more. <br/><br/>Yes, the shaky cameras are back. Yes, the classic hand-to-hand combat moves are back. Yes, the exhilarating chase sequences are back. Yes, Jason Bourne is back. And yes, he does remember now. From start to finish, Ultimatum keeps you at the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>The director has done a fabulous job by the method that he has adopted. He has told the story in a very nice manner, which always keeps the audience pondering what is going to happen next. The story picks up almost from where Supremacy ended. From Moscow, we find Bourne escaping the clutches of the Moscow police and then travel all across Europe and over the Atlantic to New York. The catchy dialogs which have been impressing in supremacy are more gritty this time around, and Bourne becomes a more suave and a much more deadly assassin. As if he wasn't deadly enough in the first place.<br/><br/>The action sequences are obviously very good. Especially the hand-to-hand combat. And of course the fabulous car chase in the heart of NYC towards the end. The shaky camera adds fuel to the action, making it much more realistic in nature.<br/><br/>The acting is once again undoubtedly superb. Matt Damon returns for one last time to reprise his role as Jason Bourne. So does Julia Stiles as the ex-CIA agent Nicky Parsons. We discover a chemistry between these two characters which have been surprisingly absent from the last two movies, suggesting that there might have been a bit more than matches the eye. Joan Allen also makes a comeback as Pamela Landy, the CIA agent who is out for Bourne. We are introduced to CIA deputy director Noah Vosen, played by David Strathairn, as the man out for Bourne's blood. He fills in the shoes of the chief antagonistic character and takes up the place of Brian Cox from the previous two movies. A small but significant role is also given to veteran actor Albert Finney.<br/><br/>The background score along with the soundtrack is also perfect. Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" is fast catching up to my list of Must Listen songs. Something also must be said about the ending. Ironically we find Bourne comes back to the first movie where he kills ""The Professor"", Clive Owen. He says, ""Look at us. Look at what they made you give."" They are the same as of David Webb a.k.a Jason Bourne. It my just as seem that Bourne finally realizes the gravity of the Treadstone project and the Blackbriar program.<br/><br/>This exciting out of the edge thriller certainly deserves a special place in my heart. 9/10 !!!"

","We had to wait twelve years after the Die Hard Trilogy but once again has a great action trilogy been made. To anyone who doesn't believe this movie deserves it's Top 250 spot, think of it this way: The Bourne Ultimatum is a representative of the whole trilogy and as the best of the trilogy, deserves it's spot. I truly believe it's unique for a third installment to be better then the first or second one. In fact I would go so far as saying the first one is the worst of the series, even though I love it to death. Matt Damon gets his chance to shine once again and I'm really happy he's finally getting recognition. He's a great actor and a lot of his films are worth seeing. The Bourne Ultimatum is a must for action movie fans. It's the year's best ( of the action genre) even though I enjoyed the controversial Die Hard 4.0 too. 300 rates better on CGI but both Die Hard 4.0 and 300 are seriously lacking intelligence compared to TBU. I hope they don't do a fourth, the trilogy is too legendary already to ruin with an uninspired and unnecessary sequel.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is Paul Greengrass' best and I really hope it remains in the top 250 even after the hype passes. Overall impression: phenomenal."

"TheBoatStove","10","2","4","12 September 2007"," The Perfect End
","2007 will be remembered as a year of disappointing climaxes to what could have been truly memorable trilogies. Don't get me wrong, Pirates of the Caribbean and Spiderman both had fairly good threequels but they still left a sour taste in the mouths of many who expected films of equal greatness to Spiderman 2 and Curse of the Black Pearl. The Bourne trilogy was the last major trilogy to close and with the sour taste still lingering it would be understandable that the Bourne fan base were cautious as the hype machine progressed. Bourne was always different though, a more realistic approach to spy thrillers that had enough influence to shake the very foundations of the Bond franchise forcing a fresher, grittier look to take centre stage for the 21st film, Casino Royale.<br/><br/>The story of one Jason Bourne began with The Bourne Identity back in 2002 with the tale of an assassin who suffers from amnesia struggling against the agency that nurtured him. In the sequel The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne comes to terms with his past and makes a journey to Russia to apologise to the daughter of the targets in his first mission. The climax to this trilogy sees Bourne attempt to find out who he was before the mysterious Project Treadstone agency made him an assassin. The first two films had some brilliant action sequences like the chase at the end of Supremacy and when Bourne took the fight to Treadstone at the end of Identity but both are outdone by the Waterloo scene near the beginning of this film. It brings together all the elements of the films that people love most into one scene culminating in a scene reminiscent of a fast and frantic game of human chess. It's a scene that will no doubt become a classic over the years.<br/><br/>As Bourne, Matt Damon provides a stellar performance blending his character's coolness under pressure and is frustration perfectly. In his journey he wants again bumps into Nicky as played by Julia Stiles, too much of a coincidence perhaps but still the right side of believable. On the other side we have Pamela Landy played by Joan Allen who seems to be only one not intent of killing Bourne off and keeping Treadstone and subsequently Operation Black Briar a secret. She understands Bourne and the two know this, this leads to another scene of ""I'm watching you"" phone call that without spoiling it, provides the film's twist.<br/><br/>The main fight sequence of the film takes place in Tangier after another thrilling chase sequence in which Bourne and Nicky are avoiding an agent named Desh. When Bourne and Desh finally fight we're treated to a blood thirsty, hard hitting and ultimately brutal fight which sees both men destroy the apartment as they throw each other into tables and book cases. Another staple of a Bourne film are the car chases, Ultimatum is no different with a chase in New York which rips apart a number of cars and ends in a spectacular crash. These sequences are what make the film, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats with Paul Greengrass' trademark shaky cam adding a level of realism and the feeling that we're in the action. The cherry on top that truly made this film a classic in my eyes was the ending which keeps the audience guessing with held breath, the suspense is paramount in this scene resulting in an ending that not only brings the trilogy full circle but leaves the viewer with a sense that they witnessed something special. An ending so undeniably perfect no more sequels are needed.<br/><br/>It's rare in this day and age that a film series keeps its focus for so long and manages to produce quality entertainment from the first frame till the last. The Bourne trilogy is an unforgettable classic of the modern age, a summer blockbuster that doesn't turn to clichés and doesn't patronise its audience. It's hard to find a fault in this film, if you loved the first then you owe it to yourself to discover how it ends because it's a cinema experience to never, ever forget."

","I would like to give ""The Bourne Ultimatium"" a 10 out of 10. But already as it was the case with ""The Bourne Supremacy"", the great Franka Potente from part 1 ""The Bourne Identity"" is more than badly missing.<br/><br/>Franka Potente made part one the success it became. She was and is different from the general line of young actresses modeled and standarized by Hollywood. A real life character and personality. It was a bad mistake to have her killed in part two (Bourne Supremacy) and she should have been with Bourne all throughout that movie too.<br/><br/>Part 3 ""The Bounre Ultimatum"" changes the ending of part 2 by cutting the end in which Bourne is being told his true identity and starts one step earlier in Moscow again. So when they could do that why could they not have ""resurected"" Franka Potente again to make part 3 even better than it is now? Franka Potente would have been the real highlight of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" again and would have taken up the movie one or two levels higher than it stands now.<br/><br/>Is there some kind of conspiracy in Hollywood against Potente because of her personality, independence, great acting ability and naturalness? Obviously this seems to be the case. Or was Matt Damon afraid that Potente might beat him in regard of acting as she did in part 1? The movie is great, but with Franka Potente being in it again it would have been even much greater like was the case with ""The Bourne Identity"""

"Jakethemuss","8","2","4","4 September 2007"," A Testament
","A testament in 2 ways. Firstly, you CAN have an action film with plenty of brains, secondly, you CAN have a 3rd in a trilogy equally as good as the first one, which is the case here. There is no cheesiness, no tired over used clichés, no silly macho heroics, just a damn good action thriller.<br/><br/>This film works similarly to the others in terms of plot and content, but throws new ideas in, as this film trilogy never stops doing. Matt Damon returns as the much hunted Jason Bourne (does this guy get ANY peace?) as he once again finds himself on the run from ruthless CIA agents with ultra high tech gadgets, super advanced computer systems and on call assassins! Yet this is not enough to en capture Bourne, a man who could get from New Zealand to Great Britain using only a toothbrush and a coffee mug.<br/><br/>This film uses shaky hand held camera techniques to help get the audience into the frantic and fast paced nature of the story, not to mention make the frequent action sequences gripping and exciting. The combat and car scenes are so realistic you almost forget your watching a movie. They have a raw, no nonsense feel to them. None of this slo-mo, souped up Matrix malarkey, it isn't needed. Here it is served upfront.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film where you could go to the toilet and miss crucial parts of the story, seeing as everything happens so quick. It is not a film to wind down to or watch while doing something else, as it takes concentration to keep with it. But it is worth a watch, fans of the previous 2 Bourne's will not feel let down or cheated, as what was in the previous films has not gone walkies."
"godamndevil1977","8","2","4","30 August 2007"," ""The toughest target that you have ever tracked""
","Like a lot of film fans, I was super impressed with the first two Bourne pictures. Most of us agree -- they were pretty original and definitely pushed the boundaries for the action-thriller genre. With all this in mind, I had my doubts on how the Bourne team could make a similar impact.<br/><br/>I'm glad to say, I think the Ultimatum is worthy. In its own right it is a great, very fast moving film with some brilliant photography (once you get past the jittery hand-held camera action), stunts & acting (besides Damon, all working solid working actors). As expected you get the panoramic city-scape views that Jason Bourne leads us thru, some brilliantly brutal ""punch ups"" in closer proximity, my favourite being the deadly scuffle with ""Desh"" a north African CIA Assassin.<br/><br/>Looking back at the Ultimatum, I do think the speed of the film left several short gaps, which is where I think fans may draw the Ultimatum as the weaker comparison, for instance; there is very little character development  there were opportunities to shed more light on Nicky & Pamela Landy, come to think of it, the lack of dialogue was largely replaced with facial sighs and physical exhaustion. I would've also liked to have seen Bourne use some downtime on the screen & possible preparations (ala early Bond) for his next skirmish.<br/><br/>With that said, it's not a fly in the ointment, especially as the story does tie up well and gives the viewer a sparkling ending.<br/><br/>~Paul Browne."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Following on from where the last film left off, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to play cat and mouse with those who are tracking him down, desperately struggling to stay one step ahead of them and trying to get his memory back in a build-up to an explosive revenge at the end.<br/><br/>The reviews had been touting this as the best in the series yet but to be honest I couldn't tell much difference between this and the other two, really. United 93 director Paul Greengrass is on hand for directing duties but his hand-held camera style of shooting is better suited to the docu-drama movies he makes rather than big screen adventures like this.<br/><br/>One thing the film doesn't focus too much on is plot, bursting straight into the action movie element and flitting wildly between places, from Russia, to France, to London, to Spain and then onto Morrocco.<br/><br/>To be fair, it would probably be better if you'd read the books first, but fans of the series probably won't find anything to complain with in the final film, which has proved a fine franchise and which Damon has firmly stamped his mark on as his own. ***"

","Not one of the best movies of the year (on the other hand this is the third Bourne and cannot be that original..) but certainly a film dressed with style, not only a popcorn flick. The story analyzes and also criticizes the agency in the controversial age of ""The Patriot Act"". Beside many action/chase scenes some issues of morality are raised, and with style I would say. Think Matt Dillon succeeds in making this movie different from other blockbusters films, both by his excellent acting and by the frenzy he gets the audience to feel. Don't really know now whether Bourne's fans shall keep up with a fourth series but these three installments have made sense for sure."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","4","26 August 2007"," Better and better
","I saw ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002) and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) on television but enjoyed them so much that I was determined to see the 2007 third segment on the big screen where the furious pacing and visceral violence has full impact. So many trilogies fail to live up to the promise of the original movie and the later works too often look as if they've been tacked on to sweat the asset of the franchise (there's much talk of ""the asset"" in this movie), but the Bourne films have got better as they've progressed, are neatly linked by characters and plot, and in the end are satisfyingly symmetrical (we open and close the series with a floating body).<br/><br/>Doug Liman got things off to a commendable start as the original director, but having Paul Greenglass at the helm of the second and third films and Tony Gilroy as a scriptwriter on all three has really paid off. The trade-mark running through streets and over roofs and racing in cars and on bikes (with no regard for traffic rules or laws of gravity) are here again in spades, but most of the locations are new, notably London's Waterloo station (very familiar to me) followed in short order by Madrid, Tangier and New York. The dazzling editing, the insistent score and the 169 stunt performers present an enthralling couple of hours.<br/><br/>I was delighted to see that (like me) Bourne is a ""Guardian"" reader, but sadly my PC does not work as fast as those at the CIA and I doubt that even the Agency has quite such immediate access to such voluminous data bases (if they do, the 'war on terror' should have been a breeze).<br/><br/>This time Blackbriar is added to Treadstone, but things gradually become clearer to Bourne, both in term of his fractured memories and his real enemies. The narrative arc works well as Bourne discovers who are his friends in the Agency and only kills when he really has to do so. As the eponymous ex-CIA black ops agent, Matt Damon exhibits physical and technical resources that are frankly superhuman and the ending could have been stronger, but this is still a thrilling and satisfying piece of cinema."
"Hint523","9","2","4","24 August 2007"," The Bourne Ultimatum
","Going into this movie, all I had heard was how fantastic this movie was, from friends AND critics. I had to put it to the test.<br/><br/>I saw both the past Bourne films. While I enjoyed them, I would hardly call myself a fan. I gave the first a 7/10 and the second a 5/10. But when there is 100% positive reviews for a film, it's a must see.<br/><br/>Bourne is all over the world in this one with a simple goal: to find out who he was. Meanwhile, a new bad guy, the guy from Good Night and Good Luck, is on his tail trying to kill him so that secrets about the CIA are not spilled. Helping him are the two women from the last movie: Joan Allen and Julia Stiles.<br/><br/>The action scenes are constant. This is good, the movie's pace never goes down. But I have one major complaint that almost ruined the movie for me. Paul Greengrass, the director, is not only obsessed with hand-held, but also with extremely close shots during action. Through two of the major fight sequences, I had no idea what was going on because I couldn't see anything. The camera was so close you were confused.<br/><br/>But the fact that the plot is fantastic is what saves the movie. This plot is one of the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Period. So, while the directing is poor, the screenplay and story pull the weight making it a great movie."

(I wouldn't have chosen anyone else for the role) The movie was action packed the entire time and actually even kept up my girlfriend who usually passes out for almost every movie around the middle of it. The best part of the movie was definitely the cinematography which like the first two makes you feel like you are part of the chase and fight scenes. (the fight scene with Desh was probably one of the best I have ever seen in an action movie for both its realism, intensity and cinematography) All I can say is go see it, if you have even the slightest interest in action movies, I promise you will not be disappointed."

","Great story, great dialog, fantastic scenery, but ...<br/><br/>Get a new cameraman! The action scenes were filmed so close that you could NOT see anything happening other than a blur. Truly at least 50% of the action was a blur and could not be seen. The fights could not be appreciated at all because no one could see what was happening.<br/><br/>Who wants to count the nose hairs of the actors when they fight or sit in the back seat of the car in the car chase. Neither vantage point allows one to see or appreciate all of the action.<br/><br/>Viewers want to see all the action from a vantage point that allows them to appreciate the complexity and incredible coordination and timing of the actors and stunt people.<br/><br/>I bought the DVDs of the first two movies and watch them often, but I won't be buying the third, for at least half of all action sequences are a blur! And the parts that are clear are so close you cannot see what is happening! Don't you have fans preview scenes for input? If you rely on professional reviewers, you will only get the boffo comments from those who want their names in print, so they can keep their jobs and increase their fame. They will only jump on the bandwagon and not give you an honest opinion.<br/><br/>I raved about the first two to my family and friends, but this one gets my thumbs down for such poor camera work. Even my wife said, during the movie, that the camera was far too close to the actors to see what was going on. Really, a full 50% of the action was out of focus. Did you enjoy that? Who decided to change the way the story was filmed? Get rid of them and go back to the original format.<br/><br/>Yeah, there needs to be more of these!!! The stories are superb. Matt Damon is fantastic as Jason Bourne, along with a great cast, The dialogue is very well written, clear and complete. The action is phenomenal, when you can see it.

Its the last in the series but before any 'die hard' Bourne fans get depressed over this, take a moment to think about the other dribble that currently occupies Blockbuster territory and consider how lucky we've all been to enjoy what has been a splendid trilogy. The Bourne Ultimatum continues where the other films left off, beginning where Supremacy ended, we're immediately thrown into the centre of the action and it just doesn't stop. If Paul Greengrass fails to earn an Oscar for his efforts we'll surely be comparing his misfortune to that of Martin Scorsese as this film is simply and 'Ultimately' up there with the best."

"ftyl","8","2","4","17 August 2007"," Fitting end to a consistently entertaining trilogy
","I liked both The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004) but I didn't love them. As espionage thrillers they were a welcome antidote to Bond (especially in the wake of 2002's bloated Die Another Day), were competently made and, at the very least, consistently entertaining. It seems to be something bordering on blasphemy to suggest this, but I must admit I preferred the Doug Liman directed Identity over its sequel, helmed by Paul Greengrass. The latter's hand-held camera-work (even in scenes where a properly composed, static shot would be more effective) constantly distracted me from the on screen events. This irritating stylistic choice, coupled with an unnecessary-to-the-plot (though undoubtedly thrilling) car chase in the final act makes Supremacy the weaker film, in my opinion. However, regardless of minor foibles, I enjoyed the two Bourne films thus far and, with this in mind, looked forward to checking out the latest instalment  The Bourne Ultimatum. <br/><br/>Again directed by Paul Greengrass, now with the frankly awe-inspiring United 93 (2006) under his belt, Ultimatum follows on immediately from the events of Supremacy. In fact, the initial action follows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) as he escapes from the aftermath of the car chase which ended the previous film. It is during Bournes' escape from the police in Moscow that the first possible downfall of the film reared its head  flashbacks. Though the gradual reveal of Bournes shattered memories has been an element in each of the previous films, it is such a tired cinematic device that I feared its use, so early in the film, might be a symptom of sequel fatigue. A spy film with a central character suffering from amnesia had been done to death 50 years ago, and is a plot line revisited by countless neo-noir and science fiction stories. Here it frames a tale of revenge on the people who created Bourne; echoing backwards to his indoctrination into the ranks as a mindless assassin. The use of this device, and the generalities of the plot which it fuels, are rather crude, rudimentary and extremely familiar. But this is where the disappointments with The Bourne Ultimatum end.<br/><br/>The plot, in complete disregard of its failings, rockets along  taking us on a globe-trotting adventure from Moscow to Tangiers and, ultimately, New York. An ensemble of new and returning characters populate Bournes headlong sprint from one danger to the next. The acting is almost uniformly excellent; Damon manages to meld death-dealing assassin with world-weary everyman perfectly, Julia Stiles makes the most of a chance to flesh out her returning character and David Strathairn is uncompromising as a heavy-handed section chief. The only minor casting blip comes in the form of the other operatives sent after Bourne  they are particularly nondescript, forgettable and almost indistinguishable from one another. Though this is, quite possibly, deliberate it occasionally feels as though Bourne is fighting and running from the same Terminator-like enemy throughout. The events are essentially the same as the previous outings  the only real difference being that this time instead of running away Bourne is taking the fight to his former bosses. The action, in keeping with the series, is short, sharp and brutal. The choreography and execution of the action scenes is near perfect in this film, building on the lessons learned in the previous outings. The hand-to-hand fighting is not marred by the jump-cutting, speed ramping mistakes of the first film and the central New York car chase is both breathtakingly captured and is at least partially integral to the plot. The most effective sequence though, in my opinion, involves Bournes interaction with a British reporter (Paddy Considine). The latter is guided through the rush hour madness of Waterloo Station in London while Bourne moves around the periphery; eliminating the agents who are stalking them. The sequence is relatively action free but filled with the kind of sustained tension and a palpable sense of danger which action films in general, and Hollywood films in particular, generally find impossible to create. <br/><br/>As the third part of a previously competent and enjoyable trilogy, The Bourne Ultimatum had the deck stacked against it  particularly coming at the end of a summer movie season with so many disappointing second sequels (Shrek 3, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Spiderman 3). Against all odds it truly delivers. I would not hesitate to say that it is the best of the trilogy; likely the best action film I've seen this year and possibly one of the best films of the year thus far. As a film-lover who is more often disappointed than dazzled I am delighted to be able to recommend this film as a triumph of sincere and sustained talent rather than a vacant money-maker, a symbol of studio greed. The Bourne Ultimatum is uncomplicated without seeming shallow, realistically brutal without feeling constrained by its PG-13 certificate, well-acted, impeccably directed and, above all else  it leaves you with that indefinable feeling of post-cinema satisfaction. It's neither the greatest film ever committed to celluloid, nor even the greatest action film but it succeeds far more than it fails and deserves to be seen and appreciated. Enjoy :)<br/><br/>P.S. And yes, for the record, the ubiquitous shaky hand-held camera-work does make an unwelcome return. Though noticeably toned-down it is still consistently distracting, injecting unneeded energy into dialogue scenes and occasionally obfuscating any sense of geography in the action scenes. However, Greengrass pulls off everything else with such panache that he can be forgiven this one, peculiar habit."

","The film editors had to have been on Dramamine. I disliked the shaky camera and the half obscured views. I can understand a partially blocked view if there is a point to it. Like to represent some surreptitious filming but to have the camera view blocked by intervening objects, thus bring to the forefront that the character is being filmed, i.e. that they are actually actors doing a job, seems counterproductive. I would think the goal is to get the audience to forget that they are watching a crafted production and have them suspend disbelief and get involved in the story. The stylized camera work did the opposite. I was constantly reminded that the camera was purposely obscured with blurry objects for no reason but style, like look at this I'm blocking half the shot. Aren't I cleaver? I found it very irritating. This was the weakest of the three Bourne films with the action sequences shot in a way that obscured what was actually happening. I don't like the jittering hand-held camera and extreme close-ups. I think it detracts from the movie. Maybe it makes the cinematography easier since shots don't have to be composed, just move that camera in and most of the filming could be done in a broom closet. ""The DaVinci Code"" sucked for the some reason. Also the 21st century deus ex machina of computers was abundantly evident. A couple of keystrokes can replace intelligent writing easily plus the computers can be fickle and reveal all if needed while being conspicuously absent when suspense is needed. Matt Damon was good in his role, looking serious and troubled, and he was effective in the fight sequences, as far as I could tell. Joan Allen was very good as an intelligent mature woman, rare to see in the bimbo age of movies. David Strathairn, who I typically like, was too much of a cliché for my tastes. A standout was Julie Stiles. She had this tight lipped intelligent look. You could just see the wheels turning as she analyzed each situation I believed she was an intelligence operative who was trained to keep secrets and revealing very little of what she was feeling. She was great. Albert Finney did a competent job in another clichéd role. It seems that in these movies the idealistic, good people are young and the bastardly, manipulators are all old fogies. I would rate this movie as a weak 7 out of 10 on the basis of the strong performance of Ms. Stiles and Mr. Damon and on the basis of a continued compelling story. The camera work downgraded my rating."

","If you like action flicks, and if you've seen the previous Bourne movies, this is a ""don't miss"" show. The action is non-stop, and there's something about Damon's portrayal of the Bourne character that is totally involving. It's hard not to identify with the main character. At several points in the movie there were verbal exclamations from the audience and spotty applause--a sure sign that the involvement was complete. My only complaint with this movie was the filming of the action sequences. Some idiot (the director?) thought the excitement would be increased by stimulating nausea in the audience with jerky camera movement. At many times it feels like the scenes are being filmed by a raw amateur (me for example). The camera work sometimes makes Youtube camera work look expert by comparison. Still... it's worth seeing and is one of the best movies of the year."

","As a fan of Matt Damon and a fan of the Bourne trilogy, I have to say that this is a great ending of a wicked CIA complot. A great ENDING, meaning hopefully they will not make another one. Ultimatum gives you all the answers you've been looking for, all the strings are tied together and everything starts to make sense. Still it has drive, action, and fun, pure adrenaline entertainment. The interactions of Bourne with his enemies are fast and fun to watch. Part of the art of film making within a trilogy, is to make a movie so it is part of series, but can be viewed as an individual film as well, and still make complete sense. I think the Bourne Trilogy does that: My compliments to the chef; extraordinary film making! I still recommend to see all three films in the intended order. If you haven't seen 1 and 2 go rent it. It will make the 10 dollars at the box office exponentially more worth it! Damon shines and the role of Jason Bourne is tailored for him. Enjoy the ride!"
"Aquadreya285","9","2","4","8 August 2007"," Incredible
","By far the most intense and exciting in the series, this movie was a great way to wrap up what has been a remarkable ride. Jason Bourne is a kick ass leading spy who rivals Jack Bauer in his drive to get at the truth using everything he has been taught and making no mistakes. The fear and respect he commands even from those trying to destroy him will give you goosebumps. I loved these movies because Bourne is not your James Bond with his dirty martinis and bed room antics. He is a man, hurt, betrayed and on a mission fueled by the loss of someone he truly loved. The women in this movie are tough as nails and are never the helpless victims that women are often portrayed as in most male audience geared action films. Seriously, see this movie. It makes me want to join the CIA. Although I am not sure that was what they were going for."
"Deckard-16","10","2","4","7 August 2007"," Maybe the BEST action movie ever made!
","This 3rd Bourne is the best of the 3 and I give Identity a 9/10 and SUPREMACY a 10/10.<br/><br/>This movie starts huge and never ever lets up. It is smartly cast, beautifully performed (CAN WE GET SOME Oscar NOMS for Matt Damon and Joan Allen?), breathlessly paced, wonderfully shot/filmed and intelligently scripted and on and on and on.<br/><br/>The Bourne movies have really separated themselves from the rest of pack (save for the last Bond film which wisely echoed a Bourne film), because we care intensely about this deeply complex man. I don't find myself exactly rooting, er, cheering (sorry Aussie film nuts), for him. He has done some very nasty things. Nevertheless Bourne is unequivocally one of the most memorable characters in cinematic history.<br/><br/>And what new superlatives can we use to praise Paul Greengrass? His last 4 films have been BLOODY Sunday, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, last year's best movie UNITED 93 and now this one. Greengrass is at the top of his field by a clear margin. Just when you think movies can't get anymore exciting along comes ULTIMATUM and it is never at the expense of the human drama. The new DIE HARD, TRANSFORMERS and 300 had some amazing set pieces in them but this film's action slays anything in those movies. It is almost too much. <br/><br/>I just hope Oscar finally rewards his work and his movies. ""They"" really missed it last year with 93. BUT then again I don't care because I had a GREAT time watching this 3rd Bourne.<br/><br/>THANK YOU PAUL GREENGRASS, Matt Damon and everyone else involved in the production of this movie --you too, Moby."

","The best film this summer so far! Ulitmatum gives the series redemption from the disappointing Bourne Surpremacy. Well directed and acted, with strong character development. Noash the handler and the CIA director are the evil characters, while Nicky and others can not handle the guilt of the job, having a human side. The evil vs good premise is Bourne's personality. Bourne lives with his guilt as an assassin, but can still be a heartless machine. Ever scene Bourne is vigilant, alert, and thinking. Bourne is intelligently tactical he does one thing as subterfuge, while accomplishing another. Add in spectacular car chases, chases, and fights we have a great movie. 9 out of 10 Bourne mercy, and kindness saves his life in the end."

","This is arguably the best of the three Bourne movies, and I could not agree more. This movie is so awesome that I might just have to spoil it. There are awesome car chases and a lot of other action. Plus it's great seeing Matt Damon and Julia Stiles together. Their characters should fall in love seriously. And Joan Allen looks great for her age! The acting is great, and so is the dialogue. I won't give away the details, but we FINALLY learn who ""Jason Bourne"" really is, and all about his past.<br/><br/>There was just one thing about the movie I didn't like. Julia Stiles' new hair! If you ask me, she looked really disturbed with that new hair, even if it was meant to be a disguise.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is definitely one of the best movies ever made. I won't spoil the ending, but you won't believe what happens!"
"Chris Knipp","8","2","4","4 August 2007"," They make more of the same and yet it still seems new: that's why the series can go on
","The Bourne stock is high. Paul Greengrass, who's made the last two, is a good director. He proved his mettle with his documentary-style history film about Northern Ireland, 'Bloody Sunday,' and another one last year, 'United 93.'<br/><br/>Once upon a time action films ended with a chase. In the stripped down action world of Jason Bourne, the whole film is a chase. And that is fine. Matt Damon is a brilliant action star; he IS the Bourne franchise, as Bruce Willis is his franchise. Bourne is a new kind of hero. He is a cipher who suffers, a hyper-kinetic version of a spy hero, because he doesn't know who he is, and everyone is his enemy, and he is always in a foreign country. 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' the latest, but no doubt not the ultimate, of the series, begins with Bourne in Moscow, and then moves on to Paris and London and Madrid and Tangier and New York. Bourne is equally at home--and equally a stranger--in all these places, and we love this blurry world tour with bodies and bullets and cars flying. Jason Bourne doesn't know who he is or what happened but he has astonishing skills. He's the ultimate human weapon, lethal and indestructible, and he speaks good Russian, French, German and Spanish and can open any door, get past any code, dodge any pursuer. He is a wily trickster. That makes him a character of folklore, a creature of our dreams.<br/><br/>But let's not kid ourselves. With each successive sequel, the series is growing thinner. 'The Bourne Identity,' which was based on a Robert Ludlum novel and directed by the young Doug Liman (Greengrass is ten years older), took the time to establish places and people and had the intense relationship between Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente) -- something approaching a love interest. Potente had an air of recklessness and danger that made her a good match. This was the essential Bourne film. It began with Bourne emerging from the water, like some kind of sea birth. 'The Bourne Supremacy' (the ante is upped in each title, as if screaming to be noticed) also had a long prelude full of tropical atmosphere. It had moments of tragedy and betrayal. The first film had Chris cooper and Clive Owen and Brian Cox. Cooper and Owen dropped out,. and we got Joan Allen and David Strathairn. Albert Finney seems a rumpled version of Cox., and he is underused.<br/><br/>But the spy-chaser machinery brought to bear against Bourne is really meaningless except as a foil. Nutty as the CIA is, would all of Langley be marshaled in a giant war room to track down a single man--who only attacks when he's attacked--and whose threat seems to be that he may remember who he is and what he was supposed to do? Doesn't that make us all dangerous? The marvel is that the CIA can track Bourne on TV monitors all over the room that come up with sound and pictures and tap into cell phones at a yelled command from Strathairn. The believable part is that Bourne always dodges or offs the CIA ""assets"" who're after him and escapes from the net. And Bourne catches them all napping and they lead him directly to the information they seem to want to hide from him. That part is very convincing.<br/><br/>'Ultimatum' is a post-Abu Ghraib story, showing that hoods and water-boarding and sleep deprivation were used in Bourne's training. But in year seven of Bush II, the arrest of some CIA chiefs for using harsh tactics in their black operations seems unlikely. These are just brief allusions, anyway: the special ops, even though there's a new one revealed, ""Blackbriar,"" were more fully developed in 'The Bourne Supremacy' than here.<br/><br/>Greengrass uses a technique of very rapid editing and very unsteady camera (Liman's camera work did not require Dramamine, but his does). He introduced that in 'Supremacy,'' and he continues it in 'Ultimatum.' This style in time may date, but for now it makes the visuals seem fresh.<br/><br/>It always seemed Matt Damon was an awfully funny kind of matinée idol, a strange degeneration of the Hero: he looks more than anything like a burly bellhop. But he has proved in various films that he's a good actor.-- particularly adept at showing self doubt or emotional disconnection. I prefer Malkovitch's Tom Ripley to his, but his (in Minghella's film) gets best at the core of Patricia Highsmith's antihero -- his lack of affect. Though the Bourne action goes so fast you barely get a chance to appreciate it, Damon's obviously also an athlete. He may be no kung fu star, but better than that, he convinces you Bourne is not a showoff but simply a deadly physical opponent.<br/><br/>Given the increasing dilution of content, it's a bit surprising that the Bourne franchise films are seen as ""intelligent"" or even that they're seen as ""spy"" films. Yes, there's something classy about them, and they're not dumb by any means. They're battles of wits and skill as well as brawn and technology. And they are great fun to watch, even though the material is getting diluted and stretched.<br/><br/>David Denby cites Manohla Dargis as saying that ""the drama of 'Identity' was existential (Who am I?) and the drama of 'Supremacy' was moral (What did I do?)"" and concludes that ""the drama of 'Ultimatum' is redemptive: How can I escape what I am""? Very neat, but rather artificial, since all these questions occur in each movie, and yet there is no answer in any of them. It is another kind of stretching, this time by the film critics, to attach profound significance to these three movies and make them into a trilogy. It makes more sense to imagine the filmmakers considering how they can make more of the same and yet make it still seem new. They succeed at that, and that's why the series can go on."
"jemmytee","10","2","4","3 August 2007"," Intensity defined.
","I'm a huge fan of the first two ""Bourne..."" movies. ""...Identity"" was a top-notch action-thriller that kept you guessing all the way through. ""...Supremacy"" was so fast-paced and immediate, I found myself holding my breath more than once during one of Jason Bourne's escapes. So I could not wait to see ""...Ultimatum."" And for once I was not disappointed in any way by a third installment.<br/><br/>The plot is simple...on the surface. Jason Bourne wants to find out who he is, because that is the only way he can be at peace with himself. And he plows headlong into that task with his usual resourcefulness and adaptability, jumping from Moscow to Paris to London to Madrid to Tangiers to New York, chased all the way by those on both sides of the law, including people supposed to be on his side. We connect with some of the usual suspects -- Pamela Landy (the always excellent Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Styles being just right) -- and some new ones -- Noah Vosen (the always excellent David Strathairn) and Dr. Albert Hirsch (an understated Albert Finney). And I will not ruin anyone's enjoyment of the film by saying one thing more about the plot.<br/><br/>This movie starts in fourth gear and peels out like it's at a drag race. The chases are breathtaking, of course, but what is stunning is how connected you stay to the characters, even as they're running and jumping and driving and diving off roofs and chasing and being chased. I did not know it was possible to keep the action and suspense at such a high level for a full 111 minutes, but Paul Greengrass does it. I now truly believe the man is two steps short of God when it comes to making action films.<br/><br/>What's even more beautiful is how the story and images bring us right back to the beginning of the first movie. Taking the audience full circle and ending on just the right note. I've already told all my friends they have to see this film. I urge everyone else to do the same. It is intensity defined."

The story again follows Jason Bourne as he continues his journey of self-discovery, while again eluding new CIA bosses in foreign locations. Not many flaws that can be pointed out besides convenient plot-driving events which allow for shorter run time (I'm not complaining), and some may complain about an excessive shaky-camera, but it works well putting the viewer in the corner as Bourne gets out of another close-call. Overall, the combination of Damon's acting and Greengrass' film-making makes this a truly great action movie."

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","0","16 March 2020"," Good Bourne Hunting...
","And here comes the final opus of the Damon, decade-defining, ""Bourne"" trilogy, whose key word this time is 'ultimatum'. ""Identity"" and ""Supremacy"" didn't give specific indications but the big picture, that was enough; plus, they sounded good. 'Ultimatum' sounds great. It's like our hero Jason Bourne (not-known-anymore-as David Webb) means business. And the film doesn't belie the premise.<br/><br/>Speaking of titles, for the scholars, the French ones can be translated into ""Memory in the Skin"", ""Death in the Skin"" and finally ""Vengeance in the Skin"" and if they don't sound like literal translations, they capture the films spirit and with the last one having that confident resonance preparing us to something great, even better.<br/><br/>Now, is it great? Yes. Better? Maybe in the sense that the hero has grown on us and so have the supporting players like Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) reducing Franka Potente's Marie to a memory relic, one that is given its respectable closure with the news of her death told to her brother (Daniel Brühl), a scene that mirrors the ending of ""Supremacy"", making the emotional bridge between the films, and reminding that Bourne has personal reasons not to give up. The emotionality isn't overdone but it's right there.<br/><br/>Some might prefer ""Ultimatum"" because it shows that it's not just about missions being accomplished and even the hired agents aren't all cold assassins. But haven't the other movies suggested that already? I think the real merit of the 'Ultimatum' is to be as faithful in tone as it is in special effects to its predecessors and that it comes with satisfying answers without trying to come with a twist. It's played straight, ties the three plots together and ends in an effortlessly powerful way. It deserves its lion share of popularity because it doesn't try to be different.<br/><br/>And it's the right approach because the whole trilogy toys with chronology, taking us back and forth from Bourne's initial training (flashes coming in the form of an ominous man's voice responsible for his brainwashing) to clips from the previous films, which makes the feeling of continuity and narrative fluidity necessary. We need to stay in the same universe. One of the best surprises comes with it opening before the final ""Supremacy"" conversation between Bourne and Landy and that the discussion actually turns out to be a pivotal moment in ""Ultimatum"". And that's the only possible twist such a film can offer and it was a delight.<br/><br/>In my previous review, I expected the 'David Webb' reveal to be a cliffhanger, it's merely an information, it was the date of birth I should have kept in mind. I knew there was something to gather from that scene but I was misled. And that's the merit of that last opus, it knows where it takes you and it doesn't matter if we're one step behind Bourne or his pursuers, we're followers caught into the ride, which we enjoy with thrills of anticipation. Whether in the crowded Waterloo station of London, New York perpendicular streets or the labyrinthine rooftops of Tangier kasbah in my homeland Morocco, the pace is fast, the stunts exaggerated but never unbelievable and the shootings (whatever the meaning) keep us on the edge.<br/><br/>Even when we suspect Bourne or Nicky might survive at the end, there's always a little something to spice up the predictable situation: a few lines or a priceless surprise where Bourne outsmarts his pursuers and proves them that ""little brother is watching them"". The enjoyment is enhanced by these little patterns, these connections between the three films that reassemble the pieces of the puzzles so finely we don't have time to discuss the looser points: Bourne's insistence to change the girl's appearance but not his? The way the black ops can dispose of a British citizen with impunity? The CIA's incompetence or their insistence to keep secrets on what everyone knows. But seriously, is it worse than these moments where the bad guys could kill Bond with one bullet through the head and instead just stalled? Maybe the Bourne formula works well because unlike Bond, Bourne can't take any chance and must move quick and fast.<br/><br/>As I said before, a man of action, action governed by a twisted emotional mindset: Bourne tried to find his past in the first film with the present offering a few hints, in the second, he tried to escape from the past but it resurrected as the Treadstone operators trying to silence him, so the hunter became the hunter. In the third film, while being chased by other CIA corrupt officials (this time, it's Scott Glenn as the Big Bad and David Straitham his Black Knight) Bourne's still the hunter, it's his past he's hunting and knows his mind won't know no rest until he knows the truth... a truth I won't reveal but there's a hint that it might come from two men from a picture: one played by Colin Stinton, and one Albert Finney. Guess who that'll be.<br/><br/>The film's finale is remarkable in the way it doesn't go for a big spectacular scene. Paul Greengrass knows the action structures the plot enough to make drama the right culmination and even in its low-key approach, we have a great confrontation with agent Paz played by Edgar Ramirez, which echoes the memorable scene with Clive Owen. And naturally we have a badass conclusion with one smile and Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" playing while we can finally catch our breath and savor the victory. No need for a conversation or a scene that says ""goodbye"", the film is beyond these clichés, it knows its strengths well enough and additional blah-blah isn't one of them.<br/><br/>And may I add that the film will hold a special heart as the one that will finally earn me my first IMDb Top 250 badge for the year 2008. Should be a matter of a few seconds after I click on 'Submit'..."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","13 January 2020"," A big success with awards bodies, an okay movie
","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is an action thriller from 2007 and there are so many countries involved in the production as well as languages spoken during these almost two hours that I will spare you the details. If you are fluent in English, you should be fine without subtitles. This film is from 2007 and the director is Paul Greengrass, a really experienced filmmaker. The most influential writer here when it came to adapting the novel into a screenplay was Tony Gilroy and his effort here was briefly before he scored his two Oscar nominations. For another really good political film, but I shall elaborate on that one on another occasion. This one here is of course all about lead actor Matt Damon again. He was in his mid/late 30s at that point and he will turn 50 soon now in 2020. This was the third time he played Jason Bourne, about whom we find out that he originally had another name before he joined a very special unit. I shall get to that later. I watched this movie without having seen the first two installments and it worked out well. The only slightly negative aspect here is that you get some spoilers about the previous works, especially involving Franka Potente's character, but as for the new story here, it is really not required to have seen the other films. Actually, the first Bourne film I ever watched was the new ""Jason Bourne"" a little while ago. So not chronological at all on my part. It's alright though. I will probably check out the other ones at some point, but not really soon. This one here was not good enough to truly get me curious. They are showing all Bourne films (also the one with Renner, an actor I like a lot) right now at my local theater and this one here is the only one that truly caught my attention because it won three Oscars: two for sound, one for editing, and that is quite an achievement, especially because it ""only"" had these three nominations. Also I think rating-wise it is the highest here on imdb. So I thought why not give it a go.<br/><br/>The cast also includes some interesting names. David Strathairn is really always good and even if I am not too happy about how the character, how he was written in detail and how they made him look a bit stupid at times next to Joan Allen's, it is always nice to see him. Joan Allen's is depicted as the really gifted and strong-willed female agent, who is ready to catch Bourne, but not at any cost if it goes against her integrity. Which it does eventually and that makes her somebody who is not an antagonist anymore, but almost somebody who helps Bourne or at least makes sure he has a fair chance and nothing is going to happen to him that is not in accordance with the law. Same about Julia Stiles' character, actually there she even really protects her. This is maybe her most known movie still. She is not a love interest (I guess Potente's character is still on Bourne's mind too much), but the character that comes closest to that description. They have been in touch before this film and they help each other in getting away from the guys who want to kill them. The best example is Bourne's fight with the one guy he cannot take out in seconds because that one seems to gain the upperhand in the fight and there Stiles' character intervenes and helps Bourne to turn things round. The fight against this guy (Desh was his name) is also among the more memorable moments from the film. I would say that story-wise I was not too happy about the idea that Bourne does all he can to find out where he is from and why he doesn't remember. Or actually I should say I liked the idea, but the execution not too much. Also the scenes with Albert Finney left me rather unimpressed towards the end. It is rather the individual scenes that make an impact, like also for example early on the scenes with Paddy Considine's journalist character at the station where Bourne instructs and guides him in a way to make sure he is not found by the ones on his trail. That was really tense and the moment when the film gained a lot of steam. Before that, Daniel Brühl gets a brief scene, but he feels a bit wasted here. Anyway, back to the station scene: Even if it was good, it always feels a bit in a way where Bourne is too much of a superhero almost with all he sees and how he is constantly in control of everything and of course also when Considine's character dies, it was because he acted out of impulse and did not listen to Bourne. So it is a really fine line with the realism component sometimes being neglected a bit for entertainment and thrill purposes.<br/><br/>One thing I liked was the parallel at the end between the scene when we see Bourne swim into the unknown and the scene very early on when we see Bourne's love drown. That was pretty smart and a nice framework somehow. Takes more than that to kill Jason Bourne. In general, this film has some pretty good attention to detail and it shows that the director and the writers know their craft. I shall give you a few more examples, such as when Bourne is all of a sudden at Strathairn's character's office and the line about how he knows the guy is lying was really funny I will admit. He definitely made Strathairn's character look like a fool there. Here and there, we got a moment that could put a smile on your face and actually one guy in my audience enjoyed it so much that you could think it is also partially a comedy movie. But no, it is not. It's more about the coolness being entertaining enough. Still, like I said earlier, it really walks the fine line there between entertainment and authenticity. I mean isn't their workplace a really restricted area? Could Bourne simply walk in there and nobody realizes it? This also applies to basically the entire Neal Daniels story, like how they find out it is him there at the agency seemed a bit hard to believe like how they recognize the smallest details that lead them on his path and I honestly find it a bit hard to believe. These were the moments really that kept this film from being a big hit and a movie that I would consider among the finest from 2007. Technically, there is probably nothing wrong with it. The Oscars speak for themselves. This also applies to the guy who wouldn't take the shot at Bourne up there on the roof and how basically everything is solved almost and how Strathairn's and Finney's characters are brought to justice also felt rushed and for the sake of a forced hapy ending. I somehow also like Damon usually more than I did here. So there are flaws about this film, but I guess if you liked the previous two, then it's worth checking out. Probably more of a guy movie than a girl movie if such categorization is fair. I would say give it a go, although yeah it is probably unlikely that you have seen nothing else from the franchise when considering checking this one out, so you can make your mind up for yourself. I give this one a thumbs-up, which was never in question really, even if it is not an enthusiastic thumbs-up because for example how Bourne travels the world always with enemies on his tail never felt as interesting in terms of locations like it does for example with Bond, a franchise that I am certainly a much bigger fan of."

","I was a bit uncertain about watching this after being somewhat disappointed with The Bourne Supremacy, but I was surprised to find that the third one is much better and the best one yet!
Very gripping, tense, somewhat emotional movie with stellar action scenes and great acting, particularly on Matt Damon's part. He should be commended - he really embraces every aspect of Jason Bourne and is really shines in this movie.
Some surprising twists and turns and some very unexpected chain of events. I regret not entirely taking a shine to the second Bourne movie as I discovered the second is a build up to this utterly fantastic movie and some of the stuff in the second movie tie into this third one in a very critical way. If the Bourne movies had remained a trilogy, The Bourne Ultimatum would have been an immensely satisfying ending to it.
Trust me, this movie is so worth seeing. In fact, the entire franchise is. Hats off to the movie makers and cast!"
"josephrygaard","8","0","0","29 July 2019"," Before Watching: The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)
","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007) is the third (and for some final) installment in the Bourne franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>This movie plays straight off its predecessor, The Bourne Supremacy. As a result, it is highly recommendable to watch those movies close together, more so between The Bourne Identity and Supremacy. A lot of events during the first half of The Bourne Ultimatum makes a lot more sense if one can remember the ending of the previous one.<br/><br/>The editing in this movie is quicker than in the previous ones, with an average shot length of about 2.5 seconds. A trick to avoid getting confused and nauseous (especially during the fighting scenes) is to aim one's attention in the middle of the screen, as Greengrass does an excellent job of focusing on the things that matter in every moment in this way. It produces a very interesting and enjoyable effect, as we experience things the same way as Jason Bourne with these and other shots.<br/><br/>Finally, The Bourne Ultimatum provides a very satisfying resolution to the series. There should be no need to rush to the two sequels, The Bourne Legacy and Jason Bourne, as they never reach the level of the first movies. For me personally, I view this franchise as complete with The Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a pumping 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

","I like ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002) the best as it was the 1st in the whole ""Bourne"" series of films. There have now been 5 films. The 2nd was okay, and this one is much better than the 2nd. Then Jeremy Renner came in the 4th installment, and finally Matt Damon came back for the final film ""Bourne"" with super celebrity star Alicia Vikander, and tired old Tommy Lee Jones, who is woefully miscast. Those last 2 films are the worst. It shows how studios will wring the last possible dollar out of something which was very good; then when they should have quit, they go downhill all the way. I was surprised Matt Damon did it; they must have paid him a lot of money. There was nothing new; only a name plus action does not make a film interesting. For me, the plot was gone completely after this film, which is quite good. It's funny; after this, Joan Allen was cast in ""Death Race"" (2008); starring Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson; plus Ian McShane, Jason Clarke and Natalie Martinez. It's so gory, it's funny. Anyway, this is a good film. It still has the plot, and pretty much closed it all for me."

","This one is the better than other 3 sequels with same actor Matt. There is Bourne Legacy which contains some same actors, but I won't compare it with that here because main actor is missing. Of course, others are not much worse than this, they have better intro than this one. But there is more emotions, humanity, forgiveness, trust, justice, honesty, and relationship between people. While no sexual or romantic ones, here is more moral ones. About justice, trust, believe, care, and awareness. There are occurences with two women which could progress into much more stores, relationships, sequels, but unfortunately it did not, as far as I know, because I already watched newer sequels. We can see in many instances how main character is reasonable, moral, and doing stuff out of insight, which I liked. He is in his control. Also we get motivation to do good deeds similar like him, and to know that all is possible, even the most complicated, difficult, suspicious, and unclear stuff."

","An immediate shocker comes when you realize that we are actually taking over the end credits of the second part and continuing Jason's adventure without any breaks. Unlike previous chapters, this one causes the adrenaline surge instantly as if preceding stories were only a drilling before the burst of oil deposit.<br/><br/>Incredibly enough the viewer is not presented with a lonely scene packed with a breathtaking race; after a short instant, just enough to get rest and grasp bits of a story events the flick leads us further into an extremely sophisticated and skilled hide-and-seek that makes you think of escape along with the characters. And we get more all the way through the movie; Paul Greengrass has raised the bar high up in the sky by fully unraveling Bourne's abilities and performing a peculiar stress test for our pleasure. The usage of small cliffhanging moments put you on the razor's edge making breathing heavy while nails almost pierce the skin of the palms. That's what I call a perfect thrill!<br/><br/>Honestly, I am not a fan of the story behind Bourne's adventures: meaning all the time the government is shown so dumb that a blind person could have brought it down without even breaking a sweat. So, in terms of reasoning the third part deserves nothing but a cuff on the nape, although the regions of the operation still excite you by their diversity and special consistency.<br/><br/>The rant may conclude by saying that so far it is the best journey of Jason Bourne and we are served with a juiciest action on our trip. Hope further parts will not disappoint because the standard has just been raised and customers expect a solid continuation."

","3 August 2007. Warning: Spoilers. The beginning of the third installment of Jason Bourne begins more chaotically, more like television's ""Alias's"" opening scenes. There isn't much plot development or understanding regarding what is happening with Bourne that at this point seems an important piece of information. There are also several weak plot scenarios, including how manipulative The Guardian reporter's way of getting killed, Bourne's lame set up of Landy's meeting place, and weak and somewhat confusing re-introduction of the CIA asset chasing after Bourne in a car later in the movie, and the very ending scene that leaves the movie conclusion without any doubts about Jason Bourne. There are however some great action scenes and one of the most riveting close hand to hand combat scenes to date. Bourne and Parson's role in the movie together is rather unique in espionage films and the ultimate Bourne revelation about who he his is rather telling and powerful. Overall, the movie with its action packed thrills, strong plot background, and techno-gadgetry, still loses its punch with its flaws. Seven Out of Ten Stars.<br/><br/>Edited addition: After reviewing this movie twice more, the chaos of the beginning sequence becomes more intelligible whe one becomes aware of this scene as a continuing sequence from the ending of the Bourne Supremacy (a nice tie-in actually). The Guardian's reporter killing no longer seems manipulative but a nice bit of intelligence work on the part of the CIA and the interplay between a civilian and Bourne and the reality of the situation is much more understandable now. Bourne's setting up Landy's meeting again seems much more in line with the rest of the movie and instead of being lame, just another of Bourne/Landy's cat and mouse play with a new player, Vosen in play. A few weak pointss do remain in this movie - the way Jason Bourne gets a police car out of the parking garage since most parking garages have spikes to prevent a car from exiting an entrance way, how Bourne manages to drive a car off backwards off a parking terrace since the wall was vertical and there wasn't anything obvious to actually lift the car up into the air the way Jason was able to get a scooter up over a wall embankment earlier in the movie. Finally, the most unnecessary, last film sequence of Bourne was truly a waste and not intregal to the movie's approach and style - it was too obvious and amateur. The way Bourne killed the first asset by choking was unusually creative and the ending sequences oof the movie avoiding a lot of action was a much more sophisticated way to end. Bourne and Parson's relationship is again one of the most delicately portrayed of any in espionage history. Eight out of Ten Stars. [12/30/07]."
"The-Sarkologist","7","0","0","5 August 2018"," More Bourne Running from Cops Action
","A part of me was thinking that since this is the last of the books then the following movies are probably just trying to cash in on the popularity of these films, except that I discovered that this film, and the previous one, pretty much have absolutely nothing to do with the books. In a way it seems as if the creators decided to veer as far away from the books as possible for what ever reason I'm not really sure. Actually, I can probably guess and I suspect it has a lot to do with the action.
 The film basically begins where the previous film finished off - sort of. The previous film ended with Bourne in New York speaking to Landry over the phone, however this film takes a back step and has him back in Moscow running away from the cops (which is something that he always seems to be doing in these films - running away from cops, or at least other intelligence officers, but mostly cops). However, it turns out that a journalist in London has been writing articles about Jason Bourne, so Bourne decides to make contact with him. Mind you, the CIA also have him under watch as well.
 Look, this is a pretty good film and all that, and even includes the scene in New York, showing us that it is actually a part of a bigger picture. Well, sort of, because I suspect that at the end of the previous film they weren't really all that sure if they were going to be continuing the franchise, and thus when they got the green light, decided to incorporate it into this film, which sort of makes sense because it does show us the bigger picture.
 Still, as I have mentioned, if you have seen the other films, you basically get more of the same, except for the thing that Bourne really doesn't seem to like killing people. Sure, he was trained as an assassin, but having suffered amnesia, it seems that he really wants to get away from that life, which I why I suspect he spends more time running as opposed to killing everybody he comes across. Then again, he is a fugitive, so I guess he doesn't really want to give them a valid excuse.
 Yet they are still continuing with this amnesia story. Basically he remembers something important in the last movie, but there is still a lot hidden away, such as his real name. So sure enough we have more flash backs, and this leads him further on to dig up more of his past. Honestly, I'm not really sure what there is to dig up, and why he wants to remember it because, well, he knows that he is a trained assassin, and really doesn't want to be a trained assassin any more, and simply wants to be left alone. Well, that isn't going to happen because it is clear that they really want to clean up the mess that they have made.
 I guess that is the thing with these secretive government types - or at least those that operate in the world of Hollywood. Then again, truth is stranger than fiction, and there are many stories about shady government operatives doing shady government things such as overthrowing democratically elected governments because, well, they are bad for business. Sure, they claim peace and security and all that, but in reality it is all about business people making money, and making money as easily as possible, which means getting rid of governments that might get in the way, such as trying to regulate labour laws, and making them pay taxes, because, well, that is unnecessary costs to the bottom line. 
 Also, it once again seems to be, like the other movies, Bourne attempting to track down the people involved in these shady practices, or should I say secret plans to deal with the enemies of the government, or rather the enemies of business. Okay, he may have volunteered, but really, by this time, the formula seems to simply be more of the same, and I suspect that this is going to be the case with the next two movies as well. I'm still unlikely to read the books though."

I'm a die hard fan of the action thriller genre and this film was nothing short of a party.<br/><br/>THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM has got it all right: skillfully written screenplay with some of the best action sequences and plot twists apart from the ending which is just as breathtaking and exciting as THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.

","The final piece in the original Bourne trilogy and the culmination of a story. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to unravel the mysteries of his past, digging deeper into Operation Treadstone, the program that created him. Unfortunately the program doesn't seem to be as dead as he has been led to believe.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a solid crime action thriller. The character of Jason Bourne is once again beautifully realized by Matt Damon. I really like the way he can pull off these amazing action pieces and fight scenes, while still retaining that close to earth everyday guy vibe. It almost makes it seem like I could pull off these things, whereas someone like James Bond has always been much more a pleasant fantasy.<br/><br/>Pamela ""Pam"" Landy (Joan Allen) is also a welcome return, and she works as a great bridge between the movies, alongside Bourne himself. The film overall works the semi-ending of the second film beautifully into the narrative.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that cannot be about the plot in general. The first two films had room to build the mythos, to leave things unresolved, to make allowances for mystery. Whereas this film tries to answer all the questions. And it feels forced. There are certain scenes, certain conversations between characters, that are purely there to nail down all the loose strings, even those that could have been allowed to leave hanging. The curtain is pulled back all the way and unfortunately the reality does not match our imagination.<br/><br/>There's also way too much shaky-cam, which ruins the action scenes.<br/><br/>Still, if you've liked the previous two, this is by no means a bad film. The characters are enjoyable, the initial plot is interesting - even if the execution could have been better - and it's a very professionally made piece of espionage entertainment."

","The third film of the Bourne series shows more growth, and is assured more exciting with each successive installment. Firector Paul Greengrass continues to up the speed for this satisfying continuation to the saga of amnesiac spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). This film hits the ground running right alongside Bourne as he continues to evade his government ex-employers while searching for his true identity. This is one relentless chase from start to finish, with some terrifically suspenseful set pieces, expertly-staged smash-ups, and incredibly brutal fight scenes. <br/><br/>As in the most previous installment, The Bourne Supremacy, Greengrass is a bit too enamored of the shaky, hand-held documentary-style camera work, rendering a lot of the action a bit too chaotic and dizzying visually, but that doesn't detract from the smart plotting, spot-on performances, action that ends this trilogy on a series-best note (at the time). Overall, we see Matt Damon portraying Jason Bourne at its peak as everything appears to click and the film is an over intending thriller"

Still, the CIA could still track Bourne without Twitter.<br/><br/>The London Waterloo scenes are impressively shot, and I wondered how it was done.

","This movie essentially begins where the previous film ""The Bourne Supremacy"" left off with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) leaving Moscow and traveling back to Europe having given a the Deputy Director of the C.I.A. named ""Pamela Landy"" (Joan Allen) a taped confession from another senior C.I.A. official of heading a secret-but highly illegal-operation code-named ""Treadstone"". Having provided Pamela with this information he also warns her to call off any further attempts on his life. What he doesn't realize is that ""Operation Treadstone"" has evolved into something much more sinister code-named ""Operation Blackbriar"" and that neither the Director of the C.I.A. ""Ezra Kramer"" (Scott Glenn) nor the official in charge of ""Operation Blackbriar"" named ""Noah Vosen"" (David Strathaim) have any intention of allowing him to live and possibly jeopardizing this deadly new program. So once again Jason Bourne has no choice but to carry the fight to those responsible. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had the same high-octane action as its predecessor but also seemed to flow more smoothly from one scene to another which made for a slightly better overall picture. That being the case I have rated this movie accordingly. Above average."

However, the CIA believes that Bourne knows than he does, and will do whatever they can to take him out before he may leak information. This movie focuses more on the chase, and the investigation of the last bits of Bourne's memory. It is well done, and well thought out script wise.

","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) dodges a ruthless CIA official (David Strathairn) and his agents from a new assassination program while searching for the origins of his life as a trained killer.<br/><br/>There are some concerns about this film. First, the continuing use of Julia Stiles, who has proved herself to be a very average actress. Although she showed promise in the 1990s, it never seems to have panned out. But, at least, she is in relatively few scenes.<br/><br/>Second, the use of the shaky camera. While this may be effective for chase scenes and to suggest fast-paced action, the film tends to use it in almost every scene. More often than not, it is not necessary and just gives the impression that the crew had attention deficit problems. (Director Paul Greengrass likes his shaky camera, but he also knows how to keep it under control for films like ""Captain Phillips"").<br/><br/>As far as a straight action and spy thriller, this is excellent, and very entertaining.

"brchthethird","10","0","0","14 November 2014"," Bests the previous two in every way: a masterclass in action and suspense
","THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM brings Jason Bourne's story to its inevitable conclusion, and does so in the best way possible. This time around, Paul Greengrass and company outdo everything they did in the previous two entries. Matt Damon and the rest of the cast give outstanding performances, and the attention to story and character this time has been fine-tuned to perfection. In this third entry, Jason Bourne finally comes home to take on the agency and find out once and for all who he is and how he got that way. The cast has been expanded slightly yet again, this time adding David Straithairn as a ruthless CIA chief who runs a black ops unit. Scott Glenn and Albert Finney also have smaller roles as the CIA Director and the doctor who introduced Bourne into the program, respectively. What ensues is a globe-hopping adventure that gives the audience some amazing on-location shooting and enthralling action set-pieces. My personal favorite, and the centerpiece of the movie is an intense chase through the streets and back alleys of Morocco, culminating in one of, if not the best hand-to-hand fights in the series. And this time, despite the chaotic nature of the cinematography, all of it was immensely more comprehensible than in the last entry, even the car chases. I also thought that they did a better job this time of balancing the different story elements and cutting between a variety of locations in a way that always kept the story moving. They also succeeded in bringing things full circle, as well as teasing some new developments which could be used in future sequels (and were, in THE BOURNE LEGACY). While bringing closure to Bourne's story, they didn't end things such a final way, which I thought was great. After all of the great storytelling of these first three, I'm definitely in the mood for more of it. Overall, I think that this is the pinnacle of the Bourne series, which was already very good to begin with. It's the American answer to Bond, as well as being an anti-Bond. It keeps you immersed in a believable world with real characters and human drama, as well as showcasing the best action that Hollywood has to offer. Seeing the previous two is kind of a prerequisite for understanding this one, but once you do, you shouldn't miss this one."

","I'm not a fan of the Bourne films. I don't hate them but I was never hugely invested in Jason Bourne's quest to uncover his past. Identity was boring and aside from a gritty tone didn't bring anything new to the table although to be fair to it, it has its moments and we needed it after James Bond surfed a poorly rendered tsunami, drove an invisible car and descended into self parody with Die Another Day. Supremacy has a few problems but benefited from Paul Greengrass' shaky camera-work. This is probably the best of the trilogy. Jason Bourne finds out the truth at last. It's highly regarded, but it's certainly not a great film or deserving of a place on IMDb top 250. It has the dullest action hero of all time with Matt Damon, who is no more than a zombie with muscles and although the seriousness partially works, the film often seems to suffocate itself in its own grit and at times gets rather dry.<br/><br/>There are some good bits, notably the final chase and an interesting set piece at Waterloo Station. The building jumping sequence was over-hyped as you can't really tell what is going on, but you have to admire Paul Greengrass as a filmmaker. The script is average, although there is a human side to it. This is a decent film with plenty of good moments but after a while the grittiness and constant downbeat conversations and conspiracy become boring and the trilogy ends on a somewhat abrupt note. Unfortunately, James Bond the year after this was released was almost impossible to tell apart from Jason Bourne. Despite its overload of grit, it is diverse with several different locations and types of scene covered and it is interesting to finally find out who Jason is. A satisfying conclusion overall and a watchable well made action thriller. A little actual sunshine wouldn't have hurt.<br/><br/>7/10"

Sometimes, I lose some of the action. Other times, there is no real reason to do the shaky camera. He just needs to give me a few more quiet breaks so that I can catch a breather.

He eventually escapes only to find himself hunted by a new and more ruthless CIA deputy director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) who steal believes Jason is a threat. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is not convinced but reluctantly goes along with it. When Jason meets up with Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) she leaves the CIA to work with him. They are hunted by an assassin (Joey Ansah) but Jason kills him. After sending Nicky into hiding Jason goes to New York. The ending scene from The Bourne Supremacy is shown where Landy tells Jason that his real name is David Webb and he was born ""4-15-71"" in Nixa, Missouri, United States. Jason then tells her that she looks tired and should get some rest, indicating that he can see her. 4-15-71 is actually a code to the place where Jason was first brought into the Treadstone project. He talks to Dr. Albert Hirsch the mastermind behind it who tells Jason his back story and that he volunteered for the operation. Vosen and his men arrive to kill Jason but he escapes into the river after Vosen shoots at him. Landy exposes the operation, and Vosen, and Hirsch are arrested. Meanwhile Nicky is watching a news report of the exposure and seems pleasantly when she learns that Jason's body has not been found. This film is great for a number of reasons. I like for mainly the same reasons I liked the other Bourne films. In this one though we learn when Jason became a part of this program. This was never mentioned in the earlier films and Jason himself was unaware of it. It's a great movie but the only way it will really make sense is if you watch the other ones first. It's a spectacular finale to the trilogy."

","Puzzled and accepting to the violence to which he is inclined to Matt Damon Returns for another go round as Jason Bourne, the unstoppable killing machine exhibiting his bizarre but rewarding skill set. This Third installment of Bourne Ultimatum is the most satisfying action film to be added to the Bourne Trilogy. With Bourne on the run again, the film once again creates a fast pace action thriller that ""keeps you on the edge of your seats from start to finish""(Keating). Bourne is finally setting out for revenge against the renegade leaders of Blackbriar who are constantly sending other, less qualified of course, assassins to neutralize him. With the help of an England reporter writing an expose about the company; Bourne is revealed to new information regarding his life that has been in the dark and with this torment roaming through his mind he finally goes after Blackbriar for it all the content that was once wiped from his memory. Matt Damon has become the icon for Jason Bourne through his charismatic embrace of the role. Damon's modest style is the key to why the Bourne movies have been a retreat from other blockbuster action films. Unfettered from the usual computer-generated effects of explosions in other cliché action films, He's has succeeded in bringing the genre of action thrillers back down to earth with a realistic and emotional touch. The Bourne Ultimatum, directed, by Paul Greengrass, continues the story of the brainwashed and memory swiped hero trying to find his identity. He has evolved form his thoughtless killing machine to his more conscientious master of resources. Although still struggling to remember his past, Bourne is constantly given flashbacks and clues to his true and original identity. The article that brings Bourne out of hiding reveals information regarding Jason Bourne, himself coexisting with the top secret CIA operations of Blackbriar and its Leader. Of course with this information arising the leader of black briar, David Strathairn, finds it very dangerous and does all his power to keep Bourne in the dark along with killing the reporter digging into his company. This doesn't do anything but feeds Bourne's hunger for wanting to find out more about the company along with his identify. With all this set into motion, the Bourne Ultimatum turns into an exquisite, mind boggling chase coinciding with high-speed car chases to public shootouts and intense hand-to-hand combat. While you are taken form scene to scene, danger constituently arises but the pacing is astonishing. Greengrass keeps this forward motion towards its conclusion at the perfect speed so that you aren't struggling to put pieces of the story together. The script also helps deliver the information the viewers need to receive promptly but also clearly before the film moves into the next fast pace action scene. Matt Damon also does a fantastic job by drawing focus on the urgency that helps the film constantly move forward allowing viewers to set back and be pulled along by his adventurous life. Without his threatening skills and charismatic personality the film would not have its sense of danger that it does. Damon adds the most important part of Bourne which is the since of urgency. Because Bourne is constantly being tracked and sought after by lethal assassins, the tone and body language along with facial expressions all provide a clear representation that he has no time to waste. It will be hard for viewers to forget the infamous lines of ""Run Jason! RUN!""(Ebert) that confirms that Bourne has not time to sit around. While kicking ass and taking names Damon always seems to keep a calm and collected disposition. He appears to always know what next move is best and makes the decisions within a blink of an eye. Damon Also sits you down and let the action of the movie assault you. Instead of using futile punch lines and senseless techniques of destruction, all and every thing he does is discrete and requires more skill then blowing up C4 making the intense action scene in the movie more rewarding. The Bourne trilogy is one that precisely captures the Dangerous lifestyle we all wish to live along with the uncertainties of our Generations Government. Bourne Ultimatum is the peak of the trilogy and overall, the film is a fulfilling conclusion to Bourne's exciting and prolonged mystery not only to the fans but also to Jason Bourne Himself."

The use of technology, tactics, clever tricks and techniques (usually adopted by Bourne) is just so cool to watch and reminds me of why I watch films. Ultimatum wraps up the trilogy really well and makes sense of the first two perfectly.<br/><br/>The sequences in London, Tangier and New York are so enjoyable to watch, the script is really well adapted to each of these places as we see action take place in a variety of environments. My opinions and comments cannot do the film justice, go and see it and DO NOT watch the Bourne Legacy - Do not even consider that film in the same league as Ultimatum or either of the other two in the trilogy."

","The Bourne Ultimatum is truly an amazing movie. It follows the first two in that Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still on his journey of discovering the truth behind who he is. Bourne got so caught up the person that he was created to be that he forgot who he used to be and how it all happened. On his quest of discovering who he is, Bourne had been following leads and looking for answers in all the places that he could remember. He ends up becoming a security threat to the agency and it is ordered that he be taken out. The order came from Noah Vosen (David Straithairn) a key head of the CIA and also one that knows the secrets that Bourne is seeking must remain secrets at all costs.<br/><br/>Bourne is chasing leads in London and then to Tanjer only to discover that the CIA is on his tail. They are pulling out all their weapons to stop Bourne and to hide what they have kept secret for so long. Bourne knows that the only thing left for him to do is go to the source. That is where he will find the end to his search and answers to his questions that have long led him on his wild ride.<br/><br/>The director uses setting as a way to show to what great lengths Bourne is willing to go to get the answers he is searching for. It creates a sense of reality in that at each location, the places are real and the sound effects used to build those areas make you feel like you are there with him. The sound that you would hear in a busy London train station to the sounds on the streets of Tanjer brings life to that moment of the film and gives you a sense that you are in those places instantly.<br/><br/>Lighting has a big impact in the film. There is a large amount of ""darkness"". What I mean by this is that darkness symbolizes the secrets and unanswered questions that Bourne is facing. Bourne is constantly hiding around corners or in the shadows or staying hidden. Obviously to keep from getting caught but by the end of the film, all the darkness is lifted and Bourne is back in the light.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Bourne finds help from the unexpected. He is helped by Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), an operative in the CIA who may feel that Bourne has been wronged and deserves to know the truth and in Pam Landy (Joan Allen), a higher up Agent that feels the truth is not what the agency stands for and wants those involved to pay for what they did to Bourne and possibly others along the way.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is truly a suspenseful action packed movie. It keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering what is next for Bourne and how can one man take on the obstacles laid before him."

","This was one of the best endings to a trilogy of films I have seen with all the three films standing up as great action films with a deep narrative. Matt Damon is once again Jason Bourne and he kills it in this role in all the films including this one, but as the sequel you will need to see the other films before this one. In this film Bourne is back and he is looking for the last of his memory back which leads him to encounter both the new main antagonist Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) and old ally/enemy Pam Landy (Joan Allen). Vosen is an extremely interesting character that owns the screen when he is on and he is the newest freshest face to take on Jason Bourne adding to the intrigue to this film. There are some problems with the shaky cam during fight sequences but that is really the only issue. This film does look at themes that weren't explored in either of the films before but they also leave out themes that were which were interesting but this film has enough to it for it to be awesome and worthy of all the praise that it is getting. The ending of this film is tense and provides the viewer the great ending this film deserves."

","And off we go again, part 3 of the Bourne dashing all over the place franchise. I can't fault the action and pacing, the sense of realism and the brevity of it all, I still don't like the shaky camera-work though. The old guys wouldn't be able to stand the pace I'm afraid: what Matt Damon as the ultimate hero-food goes through in here - Roger Moore would have ended up mussed and breathless, Sean Connery hors de combat strangled by his wig, John Wayne would have survived the first ten minutes of Identity only as horse-food. In my case, maybe 10 seconds.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne is still looking for himself with bloody consequences for everyone. It's a fascinating wild chase through Madrid, London, Tangier, New York with I regret to say, the CIA with its knickers continually in a twist. Just what on Earth are our Betters paying these hopeless clowns billions of dollars for?! And the woman who eventually brought the baddies down was originally put on the case by them – some forethought! Tch – 2007 and so much paper and so many paper trails, equals an old fashioned McGuffin. But I thought the chase and resultant fight in Tangier was one of the most gripping sections in the whole trilogy, amazingly swift data gathering by all involved including the viewers, and Bourne wasn't even bionic. As with everything involving opinions or shaky-cam it's not perfect, but how can this be bettered?"
"GeorgeSickler","6","0","0","20 October 2013"," Enough is enough
","I don't blame Matt Damon for wanting to call it quits for another sequel in the series.<br/><br/>This one went probably 35-55 minutes longer than it needed to be with absurd chase scenes that seem to go on forever, in crowded venues by foot and by car around the world, and NOBODY loses sight of each other.<br/><br/>And here's Jason in horrendous car crashes. The air bags don't even go off. The car careens over embankments, lands upside down, careens into other immovable objects -- and he just climbs out the car's window and moves on.<br/><br/>Imagine being chased by the police in Tangiers in solid people/ pedestrian confusion and no matter what you do, the police seem to know where you are to continue the chase. After 15 minutes of non-ending chase in a maze of people and alleys beyond compare, you finally elude your pursuers just in time to jump off a building to save the life of your heroine of the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this final (I hope) saga in the Bourne series became so tedious and unrealistic that if I were in a theater, I'd want my money back.<br/><br/>And on top of that, the script actually REPEATED prior plot lines (Oh! She cuts her hair and dyes it again to avoid detection? WOW!) Matt Damon is a fine actor, and has made the right choice."

","Directed by Paul Greengrass and produced by Universal Pictures, The Bourne Ultimatum is the third part of the Bourne series, as a sequel to The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy. The Trilogy is a novel adaptation, written by Robert Ludlum. In 2008, the action-thriller movie won three Oscar awards. IMDb's rating is 8.1 and Rotten Tomatoes, 8 out of 10. Robert Ludlum was an ex-marine and a theatrical actor before becoming an author, who sold more than 210 million books worldwide. He typically portrays a one-man story, who is faced with mysterious and scheming conspiracies from powerful organizations and governments. His style of writing is suspenseful and detail-oriented. Jason Bourne is America's version of James Bond, who takes espionage to the next level by being highly-resourceful, tactical, and blending in with any part of the world like a 'chameleon'. Paul Greengrass attempts to bring the best out of the novel, however no movie can match a book that covers all details and stays in the original story line. The movie does not include ""Carlos"" a global terrorist who is one of the main characters in the novel series. In The Bourne Ultimatum, the CIA red flags a conversation by an English reporter, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) who talks about operation ""Blackbriar"" and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Ross publishes his investigations in The Guardian, which is read by Bourne after his trip to Paris. In Paris, Bourne meets the brother of his girlfriend, Maria Kreutz (Franka Potente) to inform him of her death in India. Bourne says ""someone started all this, and I'm going to find out who"". Bourne calls up Ross's office and sets up a meeting with him in London's Waterloo station. Here, Bourne realizes Ross is being tracked and slips him a cell phone. Bourne guides Ross to evade the crack teams and the cameras. After some brilliant action sequences, Ross panics and runs out into the open. A CIA ""asset"", Paz (Edgar Ramirez) is waiting to take out both Ross and Bourne at the busy train station. When Ross comes out, Paz shoots him with a sniper but is unable to get Bourne, who by now is running after the assassin. Paz eventually escapes in a train. Bourne and the CIA (director Noah Vosen and deputy director, Pamela Landy) are after Ross' source, who is Neal Daniels, the station chief in Madrid. Daniels was involved with Treadstone as well as Blackbriar, who Bourne vaguely recollects during his first day of the Treadstone program. Bourne goes to Daniels' office which is empty but a CIA squad team reaches there as well. After another mind-numbing action scene, he meets Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who is willing to help him. Both of them reach Tangier, where Daniels is waiting to withdraw his escape money (which is held by the CIA, so they can assassinate him). They intercept the ""asset"" but are unable to save Daniels. The ""asset"" is now after Nicky, and the audience is treated to some roof-top Parkour action from Bourne. The ""asset"" is killed and Nicky is sent into hiding. Bourne returns to New York City and lures Noah Vosen away to break in to his office. The climax of the movie takes place in NY, and the audience will not be disappointed with the car chases and the thrilling action sequences. This is a must-watch movie, and is at its best if watched in the original Trilogy order, starting from ""The Bourne Identity"". The 2013 movie, ""The Bourne Legacy"" stars Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton, which was directed by Tony Gilroy."
"kenobi7","10","0","0","19 June 2013"," Wraps up Bourne's story in the best way possible.
","Definitely the best of the franchise. Due to the story elements, this film operates on a different level than the first two, but it all works out. Ultimatum finds Bourne still suffering from his wounds that were inflicted at the end of Supremacy, desperate to get out of Moscow. He is determined to put an end to the agency's search for him. Within the agency, we meet Noah Vosen, the new head of the still ongoing search for Bourne. He reports directly to the CIA director, Ezra Kramer. Vosen proves to be nowhere near Bourne's capabilities, so he calls in Pamela Landy, introduced in Supremacy, to help him out. Much like she did with Brian Cox's character Abbott in Supremacy, she begins to grow suspicious of why the agency really wants Bourne and if he might actually be innocent. To further complicate things, there is a reporter in London who has some very interesting information on Bourne's past, but also has a very mysterious source that might be directly involved with the whole thing. And, of course, Bourne has begun having more visions. Like before, they are just brief flashes of scenes from his his past, along with voices and faces he doesn't recognize. In his quest to figure all this out, Bourne travels from Moscow, to Naples, to Madrid, to Tangiers, and finally, to New York City. This is where the final scene from Supremacy comes into play. It is seamlessly integrated into Ultimatum's storyline. Bourne meets up with Nicky Parsons, a former agency employee that is now willing to help him. She sees something in Bourne, much like what Marie saw in him. She begins to realize that he might very well be innocent, and that the agency is trying to eliminate an innocent man. This relationship between them is not at all romantic, but is very important. Bourne sees Nicky as someone that he can just use at first, but later, he realizes that she genuinely wants to help. Therefore, he has to protect her just because she didn't tell on him. Nicky sees Bourne as a highly tortured and emotionally conflicted person. I think that she has also had enough of the agency, and wants to do whatever she can. All throughout the film, we are treated to spectacular chases, fights, and some terrific acting by the entire cast. All of which has become expected from these films, and never gets old. Due to the agency's continued search and the inclusion of the reporter/source subplot, a lot of the film is spent away from Bourne. But this actually works in Bourne/Damon's favor, because literally everything that is happening is always focused on Bourne and what he is doing. Each member of the cast realizes and fully understands their role, and how their character ties in with the script. It is a great film because it ratchets up the intensity and suspense from the first two, without being overbearing or too simplistic."

","The third and perhaps final outing for Matt Damon as super spy and assassin Jason Bourne was in the Ultimatum. It gets increasingly tense from start to finish and the scenes become violent due to the point with the rains of blood-splattering punches inflicted between the hero and enemy within together with the usually quirky editing and camera work. Also, the film makes you hold your horses as Bourne searches for the truth behind those corrupt agents but the low points with this film is its a little bit silly and slightly exhausted with some security blunders and slightly lacks the sparkle of the Supremacy while you can only speculate at the film's ending with ""what next for Jason Bourne?"" Quibbles aside, its generally good."

","I enjoyed ""Identity"" and, frankly, was not blown away by ""Supremacy,"" which left me really unsure what to expect out of ""Ultimatum."" What I found was a very entertaining and suspenseful movie that in some ways I thought was even better than the original. The loose ends that were left there (necessarily in order to keep the trilogy going) were pretty much tied up here, and Matt Damon gave another great performance in the role of Jason Bourne, in this continuing story of the mystery surrounding Bourne's identity and the CIA's involvement in turning him into this dangerous weapon. Supporting performances from David Strathairn and Joan Allen were also very good. The end of the movie clearly seems to leave open the possibility of future sequels (something along the lines of ""The Continuing Adventures of Jason Bourne"" I guess) which I personally wish they would leave alone and simply be satisfied with a very successful trio of movies, but which is apparently already under development. Hardcore fans of action movies will be thrilled with that, I suppose, but I personally think the character has done as much as we could expect from him, and that we should be left with good memories of the trilogy rather than what is probably the inevitable slow descent into more and more ridiculous stories.<br/><br/>This third movie, however, was a lot of fun. 8/10"

With the loss of his love interest in the last film Bourne discovers clues connecting him to a covert CIA operation known as Blackbriar.<br/><br/>A thrill ride of car chases, gun fights, and hand-to-hand combat sequences awaits viewers in The Bourne Ultimatum with the action pulling them along as Jason Bourne uncovers more and more details about his past. Director Paul Greengrass makes effective use of the shaky hand-held camera technique to give the audience the feeling of being there with the characters as the story develops. The flashbacks that were present in The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy also make their appearance in Ultimatum serving to unravel the mystery behind the main characters persona, but never so revealing as to give away the actual ending of the film.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne endures the loss of a loved one, pursuit, and physical injuries during his ordeal. He does not struggle alone however as Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) both provide him a measure of assistance and protection along the way. Pamela's work to uncover Blackbriar pits her directly against Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) inside the CIA's New York headquarters. Nicky Parsons is targeted by a CIA asset for elimination due to her cooperation and ties with Bourne. In a scene reminiscent of the first film Parsons attempts to change her appearance by cutting her hair then dying it black and the similarity to Marie (Franka Potente), Bournes wife, is not lost.<br/><br/>In the end the struggle comes to a close.

Oscar Wilde said in an essay that people would believe the unbelievable rather than the improvable. I keep wondering why Vosen made so many mistakes and why would Daniels want to speak to a British Journalist. I wondered when Landy found out that Bourne had memory loss. Why would the British give access to the Americans in their security cameras -- a big issue in the UK -- and not complain when they killed one of their own.

","Jason Bourne: You listen very carefully to what I'm about to tell you... I remember... I remember everything WOW! In a summer where movies have been lacking in quality, the third and final installment in the 'Bourne' trilogy comes out and knocks my freakin' socks off. Arguably the best of the three, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' restores my faith that 'action/thrillers' can still be intelligent motion pictures. Matt Damon showcases his admirable acting skills again as the hero with amnesia fighting the CIA for his true identity. The rest of the cast is solid to say the least, with veteran actors David Straithrin (Good Night and Good Luck.) and Joan Allen (Pleasantville) turning in first-rate performances. Julia Stiles is decent in a kind of nothing role, while small appearances by the greatly talented Albert Finney and Paddy Considine are a nice treat. The real star of the movie isn't Damon or any of the other actors, it's director Paul Greengrass. Greengrass, who also directed the previous Bourne film, was an Oscar nominee last year for directing 2006's harrowing true story of Flight 93 entitled 'United 93', which was one of last year's best films. Greengrass is an incredibly talented and innovative director and his mind-bending and in-the-action camera work here proves it. The camera is never steady, and that may be annoying to some, but I found it enthralling because it constantly kept me involved with the movie. All in all, 'The Bourne Supremacy' isn't exactly Oscar material, but it's probably the best action film you'll see all summer, and perhaps all year. Grade: B+"

Ahhh, nothing like a little light entertainment. Gee. I don't understand why we're misunderstood in the world.<br/><br/>The movie, its action sequences & its music are certainly well beyond anything in the tired James Bond series, but the backstory here turns out to be flimsy & ridiculously insufficient to have put the violence & actions of the 3 movies into play. We find out who Jason Bourne is in a scene so underwritten that one has to guess that his original motives were well-intentioned. Or as I was thinking; 'Poor dumb thing... How could you be so naive?' The movie would be better without this scene.<br/><br/>And it's here the movie unintentionally parallels the real world and makes the same painful point we're relearning in Iraq; the efforts and intentions of the young and patriotic can be warped & misused for sick, corrupt, personal & political reasons; until say, a stupid backwoods girl is holding the leash of a naked prisoner and going to jail as a scapegoat. <br/><br/>At the start of the war, naive people were warned that they were being used, but they didn't listen and lambasted people's patriotism. Now the same people tell me it's my duty to ""support the troops."" Well I'm more knowledgeable than you; I don't let myself be used by corrupt politicians. It isn't the nations job to make you feel better about the ill-conceived decisions you make, which help ruin the reputation of OUR country abroad. I am disgusted by the deaths and injuries the young are withstanding after willingly placing themselves into this war. They have my deep sympathy, but some lessons come at a high price.<br/><br/>For Jason Bourne, it's a dead girlfriend (Film 2 in the series) and a lost memory. I enjoyed the movie but how can people question so little, before offering their services as a killer? <br/><br/>Only three things in life are inevitable: death, taxes and the misuse of the naive.<br/><br/>BTW - What ultimatum does the title refer to? - Joan Allen has had a truckload of facial work done. You won't even recognize her. It's creepy."

","This third part of Bourne movies is a complete waste of time. There is no real development of characters. By the end of the movie we get to know Bourne's ""real"" name, but it doesn't add anything to the character and / or story. We get to know a bit more about some secret intelligence program which he was part of. But so what? There is no real suspense as Bourne is always at least two steps ahead of his enemies, always knows perfectly how to escape from the most dangerous situations without ever getting wounded severely. The only highlight in that respect is the fight against Desh, which on the other hand reminds me of the fight in Paris in the first Bounre flick. So again nothing really new. But what annoyed me the most was that always flickering shaky camera style. It is used throughout the whole movie in scenes where it is totally unsuitable. This is *not* innovative and supported action scenes only that far that you could not recognize what's happening no more (especially in the fight with Desh). Someone should have pumped the camera guy with a huge load of Ritalin. I only sat it through because I was not the driver that evening. Don't waste your money and time on it!"

In fact,... <br/><br/>(*****SPOILER*****) <br/><br/>...about 3/4ths of the film takes place prior to then ending scene of the second film. However, while there were the standard Bourne fight scenes, car chase scenes, etc., the movie didn't have the ""wow"" factor the first two movies contained. There was nothing that raised the bar for the series. It really just felt like I was watching an extension of Supremacy (which it actually was.) That being said, I still feel that if you're a fan of the first two films you should go and see it just to find out how things turn out for our hero.

","Without a doubt, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is flawless. The cinematography, which ups the ante from ""Supremacy"", was easy to follow even through its shaky documentary feel, and John Powell's score builds emphatic tension with perfect cadence. The writing maintains the complexity of the first two installments of the ""Bourne"" trilogy, but may in fact be the easiest story to follow of all three.<br/><br/>A particular sequence roughly two-thirds through will be a standout. Without divulging details, I assure the uninitiate that they will all but hold their breath for the ten minutes in which Jason Bourne races to save a compatriot's life. The grim intensity that Matt Damon displays as Bourne makes up one of the most immersive character portrayals in any modern set of movies.<br/><br/>If you have not already seen this extravaganza, in which every stop is pulled out for a fantastic film-going experience, get up from reading this review and do so.

It was entertaining and a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon, however, I never got the same ""thrill"" as I had in the previous films. Perhaps it is just because it is the third one, and there is little new - particularly in the plot, which is rehashed from the last movie. There is lots of chasing. Chasing in cars, on foot, in buildings, across buildings, in train stations... you get the idea. <br/><br/>It starts out in Moscow, where Bourne takes out a bunch of Russian Police (which is never really explained), then as he gets snippets of his memory back, he goes on the same spree as before. He spends the movie tracking down answers to his past and showing off lots of CIA uber-agent skills and survives more death encounters than Friday The 13th Jason Voorhees. There is minimal mind engagement and most of the movie is about Bourne's physical prowess. The end was anti-climatic at best. Lastly, The camera movement was maddening. I saw this movie with 7 other friends, and universally that was the chief complaint. One actually said there should be a warning that watching this could cause epileptic seizures. While I understand the intent is to make one feel as though they are in the middle of the action, it really just made me nauseous. Overall: It's OK."

Another option is to close eyes and listen, then fights are good and chases are OK. Only one chase was interesting to watch, when Bourne rides bike. If you try to understand why the evil CIA officer order killing after killing, only one reason could be seen: to show how very-very bad the guy and CIA is after everyone. It does not matter that these killings send warnings - or maybe it makes the movie ""more intriguing"": how such stupid person could make so good career?

This movie lacks a coherent storyline; lacks anything that even remotely approaches good acting; and is just another noisy Hollywood special effects-a-rama.

","I was looking forward to this film, I generally enjoyed the first two as decent action movies, not great but very good. The locations were done well in the first two films as well.<br/><br/>To be honest I was very disappointed in this film. As stated in many previous reviews, the editing was AWFUL. If I had not been with my girlfriend I would have walked out. At certain points it made me sick to my stomach. The use of location shooting really didn't matter since in any one scene they would not hold still for longer than seemed like 15 seconds. The annoying editing was present in the second film, but not to the degree as it was in this film.<br/><br/>The ""MTV' style edits was used to cover up the contrived dialouge and weak script. Damon had very little dialouge and got by on frowns and facial expressions. Julia Stiles simply isn't believable in her role. Joan Allen is a stretch as well. Its a shame they killed off Franke Potente (Marie) she was one of the lynch pins in this series having a ""cool"" euro factor to them. See ""Run Lola Run"" to see her in a great role.<br/><br/>I am all for suspension of disbelief in a rip roaring action film, but you can't have it both ways as Greengrass did, attempt for the realism and then over the top, almost silliness in some scenes.<br/><br/>At one point, Bourne gets into a fight that goes on for minutes, that from my experience and knowledge might not be survivable. He escapes with a minor drop of blood from his nose and appears no worse for the wear a few scenes later. Huh? The vaunted chase scene invovling NYPD marked cruiser was again undone by the crazy editing. Wired magazine featured the technology used to pull off this scene, its truly a shame it could not be enjoyed by the quick cuts and shaky editing.<br/><br/>This ground has been covered and much better in films like Enemy of the State (Same concept, same style editing, but pulled off much more enjoyably) and Spy Game. Yes different movies but you get my drift.<br/><br/>Its as if they ran out of ideas on this one. Some high points, Albert Finney and Scot Glen were both very good in their small roles as CIA scientist and Director respectively. I thought David Strathairn was decent but his role was ruined by clichéd dialouge on how they assume federal agents talk and operate(""Code 10 abort"", ""all agents have shoot on sight authority"").<br/><br/>The computer usage and tracking capabilities (in the Ops Center) was so far fetched it bordered on science fiction. The overly dramatic acting in the ""ops center"" also was over the top. ""I need to know were his is NOW!"" Strathairn yells at the tech at the computer in while the action is happening in Madrid. In another scene J Allen yells ""Put everything you got on XXXX on video 1, NOW!"" Please.<br/><br/>I am concerned who they are making films for these days. I know its not me. (I am 31 and work in law enforcement).<br/><br/>The ""dumbing down"" of films is alarming, mass market appeal is overriding good filmaking and smart intelligent writing/dialouge. I really don't know if there a sustainable market for great films like HEAT (Micheal Mann), Syriana (S. Gaghan), Traffic (Soderbergh), Spartan (Mamet) etc.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I am all for over the top and/or smart action movies, but this one does not hit it on either count and does the first Bourne film shame.<br/><br/>Wait for the video."

It's as if someone not only shot everything hand-held, but added oscillating mass drivers turned up to 11. It took so much away from the film, I came away feeling ripped off. Yes, I know that that is Greengrass' style, but it was worse in this movie than his previous efforts, and when combined with the other movie-shooting clichés (the blurry obscured over-the-shoulder talking head shot, which is OK once or twice, but beaten like a dead horse here), ends up burying what felt like might have been a great movie in a total mess."

As it turns out, the bad CIA people in the 1st & 2nd movies weren't really the Ultimate bad people. Now we just move it up a managerial level, use the same story, a few flash backs, and now we kill the REALLY bad people. <br/><br/>And of course, the American CIA is the root of all evil, so they're always the bad guys. All the other secret agencies in the world are just sweet-hearts, so we never make movies about China's Ministry of Security or the North Korean Police.<br/><br/>So other than a retread storyline, there's one more thing you have to look forward to: motion sickness and a headache. <br/><br/>To support the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, director Paul Greengrass only hired camera-men with severe Parkinsons Disease. So, if Speed II: Cruise Control gave you a headache, prepare for a serious migraine from this movie. I'm sure there were some great action scenes (the high speed chase on the scooter, for example), but I couldn't watch it long enough without my eyes throbbing. Even walking down a hallway, the cameraman must have had a hangover, because the DT shakes were severe.<br/><br/>I've played Doom, Quake, and Halo, with no ill effects, but The Bourne Ultimate Headache was nauseating.<br/><br/>Since the story line for this movie was so invigorating, fresh, and new, I can't wait for the next movie, where we find out that we didn't kill all the really bad CIA people, and we didn't find the truly bad doctor who caused all this. So get ready for the 4th movie: The Bourne Endoscopy.<br/><br/>Bottomline: go see Die-hard. Now THAT was a good movie!"

","Everyone is hyped up about this movie because the promoters did such a super job in promoting it. But there were many disappointments. First, the lack of plot. Chase, chase and more chase was the name of the game here. What they should have done was focus more on the why all of this is happening instead of the what. A lot of folks are seeing the Bourne series for the first time. Second, the limited use of other cast members (should have used the newspaper guy more). Why did the reporter exit so quickly in the storyline. Could have built more on him. Third, the blurred visuals(was that deliberate?). I go to the theater to see a clear, focused picture. I am hearing that the camera was shot this way on purpose, why???I could have waited for this on DVD. The Mission Impossible series had a better storyline. Maybe the Bourne Resurrection will be better....good try though."

","*SPOILERS* <br/><br/>Oh boy The Bourne Ultimatum the third movie in the Jason Bourne film series, it is the movie that I have never liked and honestly the weakest dumb movie I have saw. I think this movie is over hyped over praised on IMDb 8,1 and it is way over rated movie that it is not good. Honestly I don't care about Jason Bourne in this movie and about the lead character anymore.<br/><br/>The action sequences are terrible for me, I don't buy the action in this movie. Wow car crashes in New York or something. This is the movie I never liked, I never understood and I always forget what this movie is about! Is about nothing and I don't care.<br/><br/>What is so decent about this movie tell me?: Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when Ross panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Blackbriar assassin Paz (Édgar Ramírez) shoots him dead, in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Matt doesn't shows any emotions in this movie when Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is killed. Like I try to save him, but I couldn't or that he would promise that he would get justice for an innocent person but no! He only showed to me how selfish he was in here.<br/><br/>Paz (Édgar Ramírez) killed Ross and Bourne let him go in the car crash he didn't killed him! Why did Bourne let him go? Paz killed an innocent human been a person, he was evil character and Bourne let him live an assassin! So that he could kill again and again!! <br/><br/>How dare you movie?, how dare you movie to let a bad guy live?! <br/><br/>As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, ""Why didn't you take the shot?"" Bourne repeats the dying words of The Professor in The Bourne Identity: ""Look at us. Look at what they make you give."" Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the East River. How the heck did Bourne survive in this movie when he was shot in the back and he jump in the river?! <br/><br/>Only two actresses I like in this movie: Julia Stiles and her character are still alive, she helps Bourne and Bourne saves her by hiding her from CIA agents for termination. He saves her from Paz by defeating him in a fist fight with his martial arts.<br/><br/>Joan Allen her acting performance was incredible and it was a movie that it was a worth of watch but I never understood or liked this sequel I can't. I love the first two movie but I don't like this one at all.<br/><br/>Those are the only two things to watch those two girls I liked about this movie, that it is worth of time watching.<br/><br/>NOTE: I am still going to watch this movie as a time waster to complete trilogy, it is MILES way better than The Bourne Legacy and Jason Bourne the last two movies that come out! <br/><br/>I don't care about the full disclosure of Jason Bourne or that his real name is David Webb just like I don't care about Jason Bourne the fifth movie that come out this year that sucks ass! This movie is way better than The Bourne Legacy and Jason Bourne but is not a great movie it is not the best one at least not in my honest opinion.<br/><br/>He let the bad guys go, they won in this movie. I don't like it The Bourne legacy is worse movie than this I have issues with those three movies that come out. It is a step down from the first two movies that come out.<br/><br/>The ending is unexplained and not logical how Bourne is alive, what happened to Agency and the operation Blackbriar? What happened on the end? It is not logical and confusing.<br/><br/>I think this movie should have been the last Bourne movie, there was not needed by making any more sequels. The only good thing about the movie I can say is it is not boring or over long like The Bourne Legacy is. <br/><br/>This franchise to me is dead I only can enjoy the first two movies but that is all. I will try to make exception for this movie and change my opinion. But every time I am watching this movie I liked it less! <br/><br/>The rating for me is F 1/10 I don't hate the movie or the fans but I don't think it is a good movie mostly the lead character is not a decent bad-ass but a selfish prick in this movie for 2 hrs."

","For me ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is definitively the weakest of the (generally overestimated) Bourne trilogy. It boils down to a rehash of Bourne 1 & 2: spies hunt Bourne, Bourne escapes and/or kills spies, Bourne escapes keystone cops, Bourne wins another car chase. The plot is virtually non-existent, and incidentally -granted that action movies do not strive for realism- I was a bit surprised how easily it was to get into a CIA building and steal top-secret files those (bad, obviously bad) CIA agents are willing to kill to protect.<br/><br/>On the plus side it's still entertaining, Joan Allen is still a great actress, and the Waterloo Station sequence is inspired."

","I rarely give out a 10 but the Bourne Ultimatum deserves it not just for the terrific ride that it takes us on but for giving us a great conclusion to what is (in my humble opinion) one of the best trilogies ever. It doesn't feel contrived, drawn out or in any way just cashing in on previous films as other series have. <br/><br/>Greengrass carries on where he left off from Supremacy complete with the hand held camera that places you in the heart of the action. This seems to have divided opinion but for me it works brilliantly especially with the fight and car chase scenes.<br/><br/>Much as I would love to see more Bourne it's hard to see where they would go with the character now especially as this film ties up all the loose ends from the previous two in a really satisfying way. i know there have been sequels written to the Ludlum books but to be fair the films bear little resemblance to the novels.<br/><br/>One thing for sure is that the Bourne trilogy has reinvented the spy genre and it's something that hasn't gone unnoticed by the James Bond franchise with their recent reworking of Casino Royale.<br/><br/>Definitely one to see more than once."

Never was there any dull moment in the film.<br/><br/>The pacing was just right in that it was really quick (but not too quick) so much so that it did not quite feel like it was an almost 2-hour movie. The adrenalin rush was enough to keep the audience at the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Equipped with brilliant dialogues, scheming political conspiracies and lots and lots of governmental jargons, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is one film that qualifies as a truly action-packed concluding chapter in the Robert Ludlum's Bourne trilogy. In fact, the Bourne series itself should be considered as the longest action-thriller movie if all the films were put together.<br/><br/>To wrap the film, the end credits rolled with the trademark Bourne song EXTREME WAYS by Moby.<br/><br/>However, I was left rather unsatisfied at the end of the movie for the fate of Jason Bourne (or his true name, which I would not reveal). Although it is the concluding chapter to the Bourne series, I somehow felt as if the ending forces me to think that there is a need for a continuation.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it was a superb film."

","I have to start by agreeing with another person's comment: the casting of Matt Damon was genius and is probably the reason people enjoy these movies as much as they do. This movie started out very well and it takes some skill to start a movie out well. Very few people can achieve a good start just think about the Bourne Supremacy; I don't think that movie began well. But after the great beginning The Bourne Ultimatum deteriorates into the same old, same old, CIA, NSA bad guys against the rogue covert ops hero. Boring! Too bad they didn't use more intelligence when they wrote the script. Sure car chases and fight scenes are nice, if you're a 17-25 year old male, but come on the rest of us want to see a little more than the camera swinging around as someone gets killed. They had some great opportunities to do something really smart but they failed to do it. And let me say one more thing, the character Marie was used very well in the first movie and even Pam Landy (well played by Joan Allen) in the second, but this time both female roles (Niki and Landy)were wasted. Come on women might not need to fight but we can certainly use our brains. I got so tired of the closeups of Niki doing and saying absolutely nothing. And poor Pam Landy though heroic we never get to see how she thinks. Too bad 7/10"

","Just back from seeing 'The Bourne Ultimatum.' Which called to mind John Simon's famous quote about Ali McGraw: 'Her emotions ran the gamut from a to b...' <br/><br/>If the stars of this movie were paid by facial expressions used during the filming of 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' the producers either paid too much or made the movie for pennies. Matt Damon uses one grimace throughout, in fact all the actors, down to the smallest parts, are only called upon to grimace. When Bourne looks at a picture of his dead girlfriend, a picture in which she is smilinga smile amid the grimly grimaced grimaces, the audience in my theater, after enduring such A to B-dom, spontaneously hugged the persons to their left and right in relief. Rumor has it, that the producers attempted to get a Brite Smile product placement and when they failed, dictated a no smiles policy on screen.<br/><br/>The movie seems an homage to '24', with continuous use of technology rather than human interaction, and shouts of ""form a secure perimeter..."" between the Run Jason Run plot. Yes, an homage with the same fabled porous perimeters that drive so much of '24' s action. Never in the history of movies have more perimeters been demanded with less effect. It would have been a much more enjoyable movie experience if we all had adopted the 'form a secure perimeter' drinking game of hard core '24'-ers.<br/><br/>The story is a succession of chases, done with close ups so close that you wonder more about the actors' pores than their craft. Hmmm, what does Matt Damon use...a mild facial cleanser and an exfoliant? Does he wash his face every night? Dove? Keihl's face cream for men? I sat there and thought: kind of big pores for a movie star and Albert Finney's?..well, it's been a long time since the youthful smoothness of 'Tom Jones.' So we sit and munch our popcorn to the thumping soundtrack, and Jason runs at or away from us for hours, runs away from increasingly ludicrous numbers of CIA operatives sent to kill him and anyone he talks to. Frenetic action with all sorts of film school mannerisms: lots of overhead shots, lots of odd angles through elbows/over shoulders/through distorting glass, grainy film stock, purposeful out of focus shots to put the audience there, in the scene, grim faced and large pored with the actors.<br/><br/>And, of course the au courant deep loathing of the Beelzebub CIA, of the United States, the twins of complete immorality, incredibly invasive technology, porous perimeters, legions of mindless minions, tramplers of all human rights, and, always, at the dark heart of it all: conspirators with conspiracies within conspiracies.<br/><br/>I don't think I have seen an action movie recently involving anything to do with government that does not have an obligatory water-boarding scene, or hasn't worked 'rendition' into the script. These are now totems to prove the writers/producers/directors bona fides as speaking truth to power and moving the Big Lie along.<br/><br/>The ordering of a murder with a small American flag at the murder order-ers elbow is the kind of subtlety used to make sure you know what country lies at the belly of the beast.<br/><br/>Not nearly as good a movie as the first two Bournes but, absolutely worth seeing. Go to marvel at the adrenaline rush excitement the Director's skill creates hoping it will form a secure perimeter around plot holes big enough to swallow the Texas School Book Depository and the grassy knoll.<br/><br/>Note to fellow action movie lovers: four stars for the number of scenes in which nine millimeters in two handed extended arm sweep rooms, houses, streets, offices. Four stars for honoring the tradition of at least one attractive female lead self dyeing and cutting off her hair with scissors to disguise herself and emerging as a butterfly from a caterpillar with a look that John Edwards pays $400 for."
"diac228","9","2","5","6 August 2007"," Jason Bourne and the shaky cam return with a vengeance
","If you think the first two Bourne movies were out of control, that's only because you are reading this without having actually seen the third installment. The Bourne Ultimatum is a thrill ride of a movie, and wastes absolutely no time in getting started. What made the first two films very good is present in this one, plus much more. In it we have more crazy chases, insane camera work, over a dozen different settings, brutal fights, tense moments, and very limited slowdown. The plot is not as convoluted or as smart as the others, but we still have an engaging story that is full of twists, mysteries, and surprises. To top it all off, this is the most brutal of the three, as the production holds back no punches.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is basically about a cast of characters looking for closure. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) wants to find out what happened to him in the past, or his life will remain the way it isalways running, always hiding. Going after him is a top government official Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), whose closure is finding the wanted assassin dead. Re-seeking closure in the midst of the hunt are familiar faces Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who want the entire ordeal to be over once and for all and on peaceful terms. This chase runs through a good portion of the entire planet; jumps from Moscow to London to Morocco and finds it way back into the United States. One would think that with all these nice places we could stop and admire the scenery, but Greengrass wants us enjoying the conflict, not the landscapeleading to less than two seconds of overview footage of the current location.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does an excellent job portraying Jason Bourne once again. His delivery is icy cold and merciless, as well as his fighting and his espionage skills. Yet underneath the tough exterior lies a torn man that has no idea what has happened to him, diminishing his trust in other people and his willingness to communicate. The other performances were good as well, notably Strahairn and Stiles. In terms of summer blockbusters, this movie has some of the best acting, nothing feels or sounds forced. The soundtrack in the Bourne Ultimatum is also superb, as it blends orchestrated work with the occasional techno and trance.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass is back with the shaky cam, but this time its just as frenzied as ever. While the camera does slow down during the calmer and more emotionally driven moments, the action scenes make up for it with a violent case of camera thrashing. The camera vibrates like its been through an earthquake, it gets hammered by props, gets a beating during the fight scenes, and ultimately has you right smack dab in the middle of the insanity. The technique is hit-and-miss, but here it works very well because you can actually see the subjects and you do not get confused as to who is who. Greengrass also directs one of the best foot chases in a very long time; the best chase in the series also turns into the most brutal fight in the series, as Bourne takes on a highly skilled assassin resulting in a fight that is the best in movies in quite some time.<br/><br/>We have a much more straightforward plot that is easy to follow in the third installment. Within the first ten minutes, one can be fully caught up with what happened the previous two movies, which is an added plus. Most of the tense scenes involve a bunch of CIA folks in the office trying to figure out Bourne's next move, and that is usually followed by an intense chase. Like the other Bourne movies, there is no remorse or mercy towards the vehicles, as we get not one, but two vehicular chases, both meshed in with on-foot chases. By the end of the chases, we will have unrecognizable cars sprinkled throughout the setting, leaving the viewers gasping for breath. The best part of Bourne Ultimatum (besides the action) is that all questions are answered; all loose ends are tied together. Troy Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns craft a screenplay that may not be as smart or as engaging as the original, but is much easier to follow.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The definitive action movie of the summer has arrived, and stands as one of the smartest action movies since the second installment. Trading in humor and unnecessary subplots for more action and suspense, The Bourne Ultimatum never feels slow, never feels forced, and doesn't bore the audience with unnecessary scenes created to just extend the running time. From the very beginning the conflict is presented; and after visiting half a dozen countries and witnessing jaw-dropping scene after jaw-dropping scene, you will be left desiring more. Fans of the first two movies will not be disappointed, but if you have not seen the first two movies, it is required to watch Identity and Supremacy before enjoying this powerhouse flick. The Bourne Ultimatum is a another great addition to the series, and rises as one of the better movies to come out in 2007."
"dfranzen70","7","2","5","5 August 2007"," Best of the series, but that's not saying much
","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), or whoever he is, continues to be on the run from the police, innocent people, the CIA, and the world at large. He's scared, he's frustrated, and he's in mourning, since losing his beloved Marie (whom he met in the first Bourne movie and who died in the second). Bourne's put together a little bit of his past, after killing scores of people with skills he didn't know he had, but now a British reporter has published a series of articles about Bourne - and they seem to contain a lot more detail than an outsider would have. This sets the plot in motion, as Bourne's flushed out into the open in London, and the CIA battles with itself to either bring him in or shoot him dead like a dog.<br/><br/>You can see the frustration build on Damon's increasingly creased face; he's looking older, weathered, beaten down - although Bourne can still disarm two strong bastards quick like a bunny rabbit. Jason Bourne doesn't have much to go on regarding his former life, but he's able to grasp at a couple of loose threads and weave a comfy blanket out of them. That sort of sums up this movie, really - it's a comfy blanket that doesn't go overboard in trying to wow the viewer while avoiding the appearance of stagnation. Damon has grown rather well into the lead - ironically, he looks a hell of a lot more believable here than he did as Edward Wilson in the recent The Good Shepherd. Damon's grim and determined but not robotic; he appears to be a couple of steps ahead of the audience, anyway, and that's what's important.<br/><br/>Helping Damon out is an excellent supporting cast. Joan Allen is back as CIA operative Pamela Landy and manages to look tough while not looking bitchy. Great job, Joan! David Strathairn joins the cast as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen, with an aging Scott Glenn as the agency's director. Turns out Strathairn (who's also a fantastic actor - see him in Good Night, and Good Luck, for example) and Allen have tremendous chemistry together; their in-office battles could have come off as just histrionics, but both actors use steely glares in lieu of angsty shouting. When these two were on screen, the tension was palpably thick, and you were always wondering if the characters had ulterior motives in how they want to deal with Bourne.<br/><br/>Also back is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons; her scenes with Damon far supersede those he had with Franka Potente in the first two Bourne films. So much is said with a flit of the eyes, with a curl of a lip. We aren't beat over the head with Nicky's motivations - in fact, they're left rather vague, which is good - and neither she nor Bourne behaves quite as predicted when they're interacting.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of the first in the series (The Bourne Identity), and I felt that the second (The Bourne Supremacy) was a little bit better. This one, purportedly the last of them, is the best of the lot, although that's perhaps damning with faint praise. One trouble is that there are plot holes that you can drive a car through. Another is that when director Paul Greengrass wants to film an action scene, he makes sure no cut lasts more than a half-second, else your brain would be able to follow what's going on. It's extremely chaotic, intended to convey the sense of how a real fistfight or car crash would appear, but still - I don't need the scenes to be so realistic that I get a headache from watching them. This is supposed to be fun for me! A favorite dumb moment - Bourne's involved in a high-speed chase that culminates with his car hitting a parked car and then getting slammed by the chasing car, from behind. Bourne, of course, exits his car with a few scratches, although the guy who slammed INTO him dies while slumped over his car. Makes little sense. Sure, we need to see violent crashes - it's the American way! - but c'mon. No injuries? Heck, at least Bruce Willis limped a bit in the new Die Hard movie.<br/><br/>And finally, although this is alleged to be the last of the Bournes, it's all left rather open ended. Which is a shame, really; at the end, you'll notice there's a great chance to finish the series definitively without making it seem too pat. And the filmmakers passed this up, presumably to ensure they could have another shot at making millions more dollars."
"just-an-amateur","Null","2","5","4 August 2007"," Made for action-movie-lovers
","It felt like the movie must have cost a fortunate to make from the series of action scenes in which things were destroyed - cars totaled, cars exploded, windows broken, etc.<br/><br/>I got my $10 bucks worth from that perspective.<br/><br/>But the scene after scene of action and chases got boring for me. Not to mention you couldn't tell what was going on on-screen because of really choppy editing and camera-work. (I know, this was on purpose). After the third or fourth scene, I got tired of watching these scenes. <br/><br/>Nothing to appreciate it against, to balance out the work. Unless you're an adrenaline junkie, in which case, it's a good one!<br/><br/>But still, nice sense of style, at times, ""neat"" to watch the special effects, and nice views and scenes of international cities. THey must have filed on location all over the world!<br/><br/>Julia Stiles hair and expressions were great! Joan Allen's hair looked gorgeous too! So, two thumbs up for the female appearances.<br/><br/>Nobody is a star in this movie - the real star is the action. Sometimes it's the clever things Bourne does to get out alive from scenes. And the interesting cities, international ones, we get to see too.<br/><br/>It's sort of like a dressed up, action movie, with no sense of humour."
"Doylenf","5","4","14","17 August 2007"," Paul Greengrass does it again...shaky camera movement and fast cuts don't make a thriller...
","Not only is THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM snuffed by fast camera cuts that never allow the eye to focus on a single scene--evidently Paul Greengrass' idea of a film with fast pacing--but on top of that, we get the same shaky camera movement that he used all through UNITED 93 to give it the gritty look of a documentary.<br/><br/>It doesn't work this time. The pace is fast, sure, but the price to pay is that no scene is allowed to run more than a few seconds before the next cut. This must be the sort of thing that pleases the MTV generation of movie-goers who like their action fast and streamlined to the nth degree. But for a plot to hinge on nothing but fast camera cuts is fatiguing after the first hour and tedious after the second.<br/><br/>The story depicts the CIA as the model of efficiency, with everyone a crackerjack at breaking codes, flashing the latest movement of everyone they're spying on on their TV monitors, making one click of the computer the answer to everyone's detailed biography at an instant command. It's total hogwash. We should be so lucky that the agency is this savvy with their computer techniques and wire tapping. If it were, we could avoid something like 9/11 ever happening again.<br/><br/>Having said all this, it manages to hold the interest only because MATT DAMON is riveting as Jason Bourne, running through the paces like a true action hero should, never failing to connect the right punch to the right victim and then go on to the next rooftop chase. JULIA STILES makes a rather expressionless heroine opposite him.<br/><br/>But watching it, you have to suspend your disbelief that the CIA knows everything about everyone in a click of a computer key and that they can communicate with each other on a dime's notice. Hard to swallow. All of the action is pounded home excessively by background music that is anything but subtle in John Powell's explosive score.<br/><br/>Summing up: Would have been a decent thrill ride if Paul Greengrass hadn't decided to direct the whole thing as a shaky camera exercise in fast cuts that obliterate any awareness of what is actually happening on screen. As spy thrillers go, this one is only passable.<br/><br/>Needless to say, with all the hype the film has had, it's probably making big bucks at the box-office for no good reason."
"jescue","5","8","36","5 August 2007"," camera work by a 12 year old in heat??? or a jiggle cam teenager????
","the movie WOULD have been a 9 out of 10, like the 2 earlier titles from this series.<br/><br/>i am not sure if they ran over budget and hired a 12 year old ""in heat"" or if they got a teenager with a jiggle cam.<br/><br/>robert ludlum should raise the cameraman's salary?? did he pay them with a burger and fries? was this guy a real professional camera man?<br/><br/>the story, characters, action scenes (what you could see of them without all the constant wiggling of the camera and darkness) were otherwise well done.<br/><br/>did some amateur ""auteur"" think using a hand-held camera and constantly moving it, even on stills and close ups of characters in non action settings has something to do with movie making.<br/><br/>the camera technique used on this film was really hot stuff in the mid 70's for low budget porno movies when the first hand held cameras came out and it was exciting and new to see a scene shot differently, at least in the 70's it was realized that wiggling a camera constantly detracted from a movie, not enhanced it.<br/><br/>also the lighting, small tip for the movie staff, when the sun goes down you need to remember that one single candle is not enough light for a modern movie. once again, spend a few dollars on a technology called a light bulb, they were invented about a 130 years ago but i guess your staff might not have heard of the technology yet. also works well in dark rooms.<br/><br/>once again, 9 out of 10 for the first two movies from this series, this only gets a 5 due to the terrible film and lighting work."
"harposkc","5","3","11","9 August 2007"," Heartless and nauseating disappointment
","Rather than being a satisfying climax to a great trilogy, Ultimatum is more required viewing for those like me who loved the first film and found the second satisfying if lacking the solid craftsmanship of the original. The story needs to be finished, but you wish it had more of a bang. Instead you get an entertaining piece of action cinema that isn't too stupid for arty folk, despite some gigantic leaps of logic.<br/><br/>That's fine except for some major gripes. For starters, Paul Greengrass' shaky cam makes the action nearly impossible to follow. It's all one big blurry movement. Dialog scenes are shot with objects blocking the actor, so all you see is their eyeball, and the drunken camera man seems to be going out of his way to nauseate you. This is all accentuated on the big screen. It's nerve-wracking and it never, ever ends. Riding a roller coaster is fun, but after two hours you want to get off and puke.<br/><br/>However, the biggest problem is that Bourne's humanity gets left on the doorstep. Julia Stiles is supposed to give the movie its heart, but all she does is look longingly at Bourne. They've gone out of their way not to give her any dialog. When he has questions that need answers, she just looks at him longingly. When he's searching his soul to understand who he is, she touches his hand and looks at him longingly. When she leaves him to a world of danger, another longing look. Not even a goodbye. She could help Bourne out a lot if she would just open her mouth and start yapping. She hints that she knows quite a bit, but he learns more about himself from his own flashbacks.<br/><br/>Ultimately, who Jason Bourne is is a whole lot less interesting than Jason Bourne wanting to know who he is. The more he learns, the less provocative the story gets. The Bourne series has made a promise that it's worth three films to learn the truth, but sadly in the end it's nothing more than an excuse for car chases and exotic locales. It's a movie that really needs to pack a punch, but all you get is some fancy slight-of-hand.<br/><br/>I say wait for DVD and watch all three at once"

If i was 12 maybe i liked the movie, but come on, this is pure crap; yet another proof marketing and brainwashing do work nowadays. Actually Van Dame, could kick Bourne's $#%, cause besides fighting and being shot at, he could also have sex with the girl. Bourne lacked that skill! Badly!"
"nytruth","5","3","11","3 August 2007"," My opinion of this movie relative to others in the series
","My favorite aspects of the Bourne movies have always been Matt Damon's ""innocent hero"" persona and the premise that international black ops is a horrible, squalid business, beneath the dignity of authentic humans. Show me a pervert who ENJOYS ""black bag"" work, and I'll show you someone who heartily deserves a hot-lead lunch, which is exactly what Jason Bourne dishes up.<br/><br/>On these points, the movie still delivers. In other respects, I find it less satisfying than other installments, especially the first movie.<br/><br/>The Hollywood craze for hand-held camera work is just getting TOTALLY asinine, and this movie is a perfect example. The camera work is so jittery and bouncy half the time, it just gets tiresome. Knock it off and LET ME SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING! In a related vein, the Director opted for such a frantic, chaotic, adrenaline-freaked visual style for the movie, with blurry split-second cuts all jammed in next to each other throughout whole scenes, that it seriously interferes with the movie's visual intelligibility, not to mention THE STORY. Yeah, it's ""exciting"" and all, yup-per, uh-huh, wappa-wappa, but at the same time it left me feeling bewildered at times, and to what purpose? This sort of photography and editing has its place, no doubt, but the key is *punctuation*. It has to be a counterpoint to longer, stable-camera shots and the like, or else it gets really overbearing really fast, which it DID. The Director completely abdicates any discipline about this.<br/><br/>My gut tells me this is a tawdry way to crank out ""uh ack-shun moo-vee"" (for which an audience is certain) while completely copping out on the elusive, expensive thing called 'ART'  at which point I realize I'VE BEEN HAD! The first movie worked much harder to engage me on this level. The second one slipped significantly here, and this one slips further still. It's just an exercise in raking in $$$ from an assured market."

","Hollywood sure has it in for the CIA. After turning a pro-American book into an anti American movie you can see how Hollywood doesn't like the CIA. My hope is that its just simply an action movie and doesn't persuade anyone to thinking the the CIA has agents that kill when notified. Also genetic engineering has risen in this sci fi flick. You add or subtract and genetic material you will have mutations, and not the type you see in these movies. The CIA functions to get information from its agents who are in the field. There are no trained hit men that the left in Hollywood would like you to believe. God help you if you do."

","I was so disappointed by this movie. Having seen the earlier two installments, I had high hopes for this film. The previews make it look so cool and action packed that it cant possibly be bad, right? WRONG! From the opening scene of the film you are overwhelmed with anti American, liberal propaganda to the point of feeling sick. This movie makes Michael Moore and Sean Penn look like fair, unbiased individuals. For whatever reason, the film makers decided to portray the American government as an evil, devious entity bent on world domination and willing to kill anyone who gets in the way. This movie is based around the fact that Bourne is looking to expose the ""evil"" ways of the CIA and the US government, and so he basically goes around beating up and killing US government agents around the world.<br/><br/>DO NOT SUPPORT MOVIES LIKE THIS! We need to stand up to the bias of Hollywood, and demand that they start making good movies again. By watching this movie you endorse the (extreme left wing) sentiment that America is the cause of all the worlds problems."
"movieguy097","10","2","6","24 August 2007"," A Fantastic and Rewarding Film
","Let me address that there are some spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>I have been a huge fan of the Bourne series since the first film was released in 2002. I've watched all the Bourne movies now multiple times (including Bourne Ultimatum) and am delighted with how the series played out. There is speculation as to whether they could continue on with the series, but I believe this serves as an excellent conclusion to the trilogy as well as a rewarding one for die-hard fans.<br/><br/>Honestly, I was surprised at the amount of people who gave a horrible review on this movie (and Bourne Supremacy) on the premise that the ""shaky camera"" ruined it. Yes, as many people have said, the camera work in that way added to the realism of the film, thrusting the audience into the action, but the real reason here is symbolic to the story and Bourne as a character.<br/><br/>Notice how the camera work gets rougher as the movies progress? We first see it significantly in Supremacy, and even more-so in Ultimatum. This is symbolic to Bourne as a character. With each venture (or movie) he goes through, Bourne is continually hurt. He gets physically tested and abused, emotionally shot, and more confused. The camera mirrors what he is feeling, attempting to project that into the audience and herein making us feel his confusion. Did some of you get headaches from that camera work? I guarantee he was feeling worse. Even when not in an action scene, a common ""symptom"" of the Treadstone agents is migraines, as The Professor (Clive Owen's character, the sniper) briefly brings this up to Bourne in the first film.<br/><br/>I do understand that this camera work may not have been to everyone's liking, but while it may have annoyed you, please try to remember that there is a reason behind every aspect of a good film; this was done for a reason.<br/><br/>The action is fantastic. What makes it fantastic is that it's not mindless. It's calculated and brutal, and what adds to that edgy feeling much of the audience will get is the fact that these are not bumbling, dumb henchmen going after Bourne. They are just as smart as he is, and just as brutal if given the opportunity, adding to the danger. The scene that left the most lasting impression for me was the rooftop chase and final showdown between Bourne and Desh, a CIA operative. This rivals the showdown between he and Kirill (the hit-man that chased him in Moscow in Supremacy). It's just as brutal in its own way, and serves as a reminder to the audience that Bourne is still human. He's not a machine, not invincible. Seriously, for a couple seconds there I thought Nicky was a goner. It would have been reminiscent of Bourne's failure to protect Marie when she was killed.<br/><br/>I love a film that has me guessing like that. When a core character's (Nicky in this case) fate isn't completely safe to you as an audience member, you're watching good material, getting to witness a good story.<br/><br/>Matt Damon as always gave an excellent performance. Some people have said that his acting was a bit stale, zombified, dull. This aura he gave off was intentional. Please, you don't think that an actor of Damon's caliber just decided to ""give up"" and kind of mumble his lines in the last movie due to laziness, do you? I'll say it again, Bourne at this point in his story is broken. He's hurt physically and mentally. He's tired and with each dangerous brush with his pursuers, he gets a bit more desperate. Bourne watched his lover and only friend on the face of the earth, Marie, get shot in the head (Bourne Supremacy, 2nd movie), and only had time to mourn this when he could get a chance to catch his breath. I would be demoralized beyond words if I had to go through something like that in my own life.<br/><br/>And on top of all this, let's not forget, when he finally DID find out who he was, he wasn't happy at all about being a professional killer. He didn't think it was right and felt rather terrible about this realization. I mean on top of the everything mentioned in the previous paragraph, the man hates himself. The events in the first two movies sculpted Bourne into what he is in the third installment. No folks, Matt Damon was exactly who he wanted to be.<br/><br/>I applaud his and everyone else's acting in this film. It's believable, and keeps you interested in what's going on. This isn't a mindless cat and mouse film. The Bourne Ultimatum is the conclusion(?) to the story of a desperate, disoriented man seeking only answers, but instead finding gritty danger, ruthless adversaries and even more questions every step of the way.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to give a film 10 out of 10 stars but when I have to TRY to find something wrong with a movie, that's a good sign."
"memino02","10","2","6","21 August 2007"," Good movies are Bourne again.
","Never would I have thought a sequel to any movie would be better than the original movie but The Bourne Ultimatum shows that sequels can be good. A mix of high intensity action and gismos which make James Bond look like it's in the stone ages. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you DO NOT want it to end but sadly it does. I don't usually like Matt Daemon but this completely changes my opinion of him. Bourne Identity was good but when Supremacy came out people questioned the freshness of the ideas, this one is good because there is lots of original stuff added.<br/><br/>A must see movie this year! Movie of the year (so far) 2007. What you still doing here? Go see it now!"
"eddieknocker","10","2","6","20 August 2007"," Very satisfying conclusion to excellent trilogy.
","Have to agree with most of the reviewers. If you liked the first two films (and if you didn't then why the hell not?!) then this should give you a nice warm feeling as you walk out the cinema.<br/><br/>Everything is nicely resolved and if it's a mark of the quality of the series it didn't feel ""neat"" or contrived. You want Bourne to find his identity, the ""bad guys"" to get their comeuppance and for Bourne to live at the end. There is nothing new here but as the cliché goes ""if it ain't broke..."" Perhaps Paul Greengrass' direction is a little bit more frenetic and the pace a little faster (if that's possible. Yes I did need a little lie down afterwards to get my breath back!) <br/><br/>One particular touch I liked was when Nicky Parsons - the CIA operative from the first 2 films - cut and died her hair in a obvious nod to Bourne's dead German girlfriend and that when Bourne was presented with the option of going on the run with her he said no (the implication for me being that he could not take losing another love)<br/><br/>There was also an implied (romantic?) history between Bourne and Nicky which was not explained but if you need every-little-thing spelt out then perhaps this film isn't for you.<br/><br/>Watching this should make you want to watch the other 2 films straight away...and then watch this one again.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

Does everyone remember the first Bourne movie? How about the fight scene in Bourne's apartment? Good action, Mr. Damon did great, as did the other fella. It was believable that they were beating the heck out of each other and you could tell what was going on. In one of the fight scenes in this one, it takes me hearing ringing metal off of tile to know the the bad guy had a blade. Half of the action has you wondering ""Who's hitting who?"". Then there's the car chases. Instead of enjoying the scene, you spend all your time trying to pick out what's happening. There were subtle things in the first movie's car chase, background stuff that was neat, interesting scenery, and you could see the people jump out of the way. In this one, it was just way too cut up. Too many camera jiggles and too many cuts. What's the point of having killer action if you can't see it happening? Sure, some jiggly camera kind of gets you into the action, but let's be honest here, me with two bad knees and one bad back could do a passable fight scene with all that jiggling. If I took off my glasses you probably couldn't tell me from Mr. Damon either. So, rant session is over.. Overall, 10 out of 10 for story, 2 out of 10 for using a ""Cops"" camera-man on meth."

","First, let me state that I enjoyed the first two movies a lot. I have watched them many times, and I was looking forward to ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" very much. I watched it yesterday, and the disappointment still lingers.<br/><br/>The movie is horribly paced: It starts out with three cities in three minutes, most of them seemingly filled with zoom-in aerial pictures. I can do that too on Google Maps. Then the movie suddenly grinds to a halt, as everyone in the movie (I don't want this post to contain spoilers, hence the ambiguous wording) tries to figure out what is going on.<br/><br/>""Ultimatum"" has terrible characters. Bourne is the only character that is still the most interesting -- how could an assassin with amnesia not be. The rest of the cast have two-dimensional cookie-cutter personalities: The evil, exchangeable killers. The cold-hearted CIA chief whose only way of dealing with anything is killing. The utterly predictable change of sides of someone. The amateur-like allusion to a past connection, including dyed hair -- from brown to black.<br/><br/>What I found most the most intriguing in the past two movies was Bourne's quick decision-making. He always instinctively knew what to do, there was never a bit of hesitation, and he always managed to stay one step ahead of his foes. This element is almost completely missing in ""Ultimatum"".<br/><br/>What also annoyed me tremendously, and here comes the spoiler, was the very forced happy end. Bourne said himself: ""This is where it started, this is were it will end."" I think it should have."
"baumer","10","2","6","4 August 2007"," The best film of 2007 and perhaps ever!
","For now I just want to say that this film has no business being this good. The quality in here is on par with other sequels like Terminator 2, Aliens, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and so on. Paul Greengrass has to be one of the best directors in the world right now. Where as The Bourne Identity and Supremacy were good, this is in a league of it's own.<br/><br/>""This is Jason Bourne, the toughest target that you have ever tracked. "" The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further into the Bourne story and Bourne/David Webb doesn't like who he is or what he has become or what he has done. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting to the story to the lighting, everything is perfect.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a frenetic pace as Bourne is running from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They aren't his target. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is one of the best third installments to a movie ever. And this might make my top 25 movies of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"walentys","9","1","2","29 August 2018"," I believe that it takes a certain level of genius to depict a genius character
","I believe that it takes a certain level of genius to depict a genius character showing how intelligent he or she is. It's one thing to declare a character as ""genius"", as many stories do, without it ever being shown in his or her actions or words (beyond cheaply throwing in the occasional ""big words""). But it's a whole 'nother when the intelligence of the character is plainly visible in front of your eyes.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for this goes to Robert Ludlum, the author of the Bourne novels, for creating the character and the story in the first place. After coming up with the scenario and overall theme, Ludlum had to ask, at every single corner of the story, ""What would this genius do next?"" He had to become and think exactly like the character Bourne, who is very intelligent. It takes intelligence and creativity to get in the mind of an intelligent character like that.<br/><br/>In fact most of the characters in the entire film are pretty smart, and convincingly so. This is a tough thing to achieve in the film world; when it's done poorly, it's fairly transparent and the character just doesn't seem bright even though he or she is depicted as such. It's the lack of intelligent writing (and perhaps acting) that makes you feel that they just aren't what they're portrayed to be.<br/><br/>This is why Tony Gilroy, the screen story writer, gets a large portion of the credit as well. He has displayed that he knows which bits work better just left to the book and which were translatable into film, and carefully sewed together a modified version of the story that just works better in a film context than the book's would have.<br/><br/>I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of Paul Greengrass's directing style as a whole; the intentionally shaky camera can feel a bit gimmicky and sometimes even amateur. But I also must say that he was a smart choice for director of this particular film. The style fits the fast pacing and there's something about the very raw, quick feel about it that works well. The cuts give you the sense that there's no time for breathing room, because there basically isn't. Bourne has a mission and can't waste a single second. It never really gets slow or boring; it constantly grips your attention.<br/><br/>One very subtle thing I love in this film is the extremely unspoken romance between Bourne and Nikki Parsons, played by Julia Stiles. Fitting with their personalities and jobs, they both don't reveal a single word of it but you can just feel it's there, especially when Stiles delivers the line ""With you, it was ... difficult..."" You know what she really is saying there, but they never reveal anything directly beyond that.<br/><br/>To top all of it off, the film offers some of the slickest fighting in the past decade. Excellent choreography and once again just plain intelligent, not just on Bourne's end but also his opponent's. He is, of course, going up against some of the most highly-trained killers alive, so naturally they have a different kind of smarts about them, combat.<br/><br/>This film just plain and simple delivers intelligence in almost every arena: story, writing, acting, characters, choice of director, fighting, and certainly plenty of CIA ""intelligence"". All the qualities that make the Bourne trilogy great it does the best. Best movie of the trilogy."

Note 7.0"
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","2","28 July 2016"," He Remembers Everything
","All three of the original films work extremely well as one cohesive watch, as I've found out after watching them back to back to back, but 'Ultimatum' is the biggest and most explosive of the series.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass returned to direct the conclusion of the originally planned trilogy, as does Matt Damon in the title role. Greengrass added a much more human aspect to Bourne in 'Supremacy' all while adding just the right amount of action. I feel like there was a bit more of an imbalance in 'Ultimatum'. Certainly, the car chases and the breathtaking rooftop chase are great, but there are a few too many leaps of faith the audience has to take in terms of logic. Especially considering how grounded the first two films are.<br/><br/>Even with the logic issues, The Bourne Ultimatum may be the most entertaining and heart stopping film of the entire series, with one thrilling scene after another. The aforementioned rooftop sequence in Tangier is one thing, but one of the opening scenes takes place in a London terminal, and it may be my favorite scene of the film altogether. It's usually not the high octane chases or visceral gun battles that get me, but the scenes in which Bourne is using his slick wit and experience to one-up those against him.<br/><br/>Among the cast returning is Joan Allen as Pamela Landy. Although you can make the case her story ended with Bourne in 'Supremacy', the direction they take her arc in helping Bourne tear through his past made sense here. Opposing Landy is Deputy Director Noah Vosen, played by David Straithairn. Straithairn is very good at playing characters that get under your skin with frustrating decisions and Vosen is exactly that. So although I preferred Chris Cooper and Brian Cox in those roles, Straithairn is a solid counterpart to Damon. It's all the more impressive considering the very little screen time, if any, that the antagonists end up having with Bourne.<br/><br/>Though it is now 2016 and there's a new Jason Bourne film coming out, watching The Bourne Ultimatum made me realize that there really never needed to be another entry in the series. The film comes full circle and Bourne's search for answers got to the point I hoped for. The end really feels like the end, so I sure hope the new film reinvents itself and doesn't retread the same story beats because Ultimatum certainly does.<br/><br/>'Ultimatum' has its detractors and I can see a few of the complaints being warranted, but there's no denying the epic scope and thrill ride the film takes you on. It's the most cinematic of the bunch and the characters don't really take a backseat to action. I only hope there aren't as many leaps of logic next time around.<br/><br/>+Scope<br/><br/>+Rooftop and terminal sequence<br/><br/>+Feels like the end<br/><br/>+Landy & Bourne<br/><br/>-Leaps of faith in logic<br/><br/>9.3/10"
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","20 February 2016"," ""Someone started all this, and I'm going to find them.""
","I fault the film makers for not showing Scotty using the transporter beam to move Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) around from country to country, city to city in the span of time that the film races through. Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) runs his CIA group through their paces as if they're all watching the action in real time, and unless you consider that it would take at least a few hours each to fly from Moscow to Paris to Madrid to Tangier to New York, then you'd have to presume this picture a fantasy instead of an action adventure.<br/><br/>But on the other hand..., it's a gripping story and if you go for this kind of pace the movie won't let you down. After making mincemeat out of his vehicles in 'Supremacy', Jason Bourne actually drives his car off a roof in this one! It doesn't get more outlandish than that, unless you consider the one on one against asset Desh (Joey Ansah). That was pretty intense.<br/><br/>The coup de grace of course was Bourne getting the goods on Vosen and his Blackbriar group. I would posit that virtually none of what Jason Bourne does in the picture is even remotely possible, but he sure makes it look cool doing it.<br/><br/>One last thought - maybe this is the one they should have called ""The Bourne Identity""."
"LoveIsAStateOfMind","10","1","2","29 December 2015"," Favourite Bourne film in the trilogy - a shipper's perspective
","'The Bourne Ultimatum'. Hands down Best. Film. Of. The. Summer. Quite possibly Best Film of 2007. POTC and HP pale in comparison as does Oceans 13 . I haven't seen Shrek 3 but given my apathetic nature towards Shrek then I'm pretty sure The Bourne Ultimatum is better than that. Of course, it's probably unfair to be comparing any of these films since they're all of different genres and all aim to give the audience a different kind of viewing pleasure but if I was going to pick a best film award then I'd have to deal with all those things and totally give it to 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. I mean, as a girl, I don't get all giddy over action scenes or fight scenes but OMG they were amazing. Plus you throw it come awesome acting, a great soundtrack, amazing locations, hints at shippy stuff and a whole lot of buildup and tension and you get a film which has totally catapulted itself into my Top 5 Favourite Movies Of All Time. Get the picture? I love it.<br/><br/>So let's obsess shall we? Waterloo Station <- I know that station and the Southbank like the back of my hand and I tend to squee over unimportant things like this in life, I mean I bought stuff from that kiosk that they run into and the whole WH Smiths and Man I would have killed to have been there whilst they were filming. Anyway, this was a brilliant sequence. It must have been impossible to shoot there with all those people but they nailed it.<br/><br/>When the NYPD skids along the barrier thing near the end? I thought that was an amazing action bit. That's a really random thing but I was watching it and it just occurred to me how cool that looked.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, obviously what I want to ramble on about is Nicky/Jason. And Julia Stiles. I mean they didn't have to do that .... they could have just had Nicky has a friend who wants to help Jason because she's seen what he's been through and she hates what the program's done to people etc. but that one line, that ONE line was all I needed. I mean I liked Marie but she was just kind of there and when she got shot I was just like 'Oh poor Jason, Marie's dead' but then with Nicky you have all the angst, the history, the mountains of unexplored character depth. I mean how freaking hard must this whole thing have been on her: seeing Jason get tortured during training, seeing him with Marie, having him point a gun at her head several times and nearly killing her and then fully have to process the knowledge that he doesn't remember anything. ....<br/><br/>And the scriptwriting! Amazing! Jason/Nicky just have that one line and then everything else Julia Stiles plays out brilliantly in just looks - in the cafe, on the ferry, after Bourne's killed the asset, in the room in the mirror, touching his hand, listening to him tell her to go, seeing him look at her as she cuts her hair, the scene at the coach station where it's like she really wants to say something or hug him but she forces herself not to, the look she give him when he tells her it gets easier ...... I mean WOW. One line and then she never speaks again (apart from technical stuff). Sometimes you don't need any words."

Matt Damon reprises the role of Jason Bourne, he does a great job, as usual, but let's talk about the movie.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything I hated about the first and second installments is gone, made better. The movie has absolutely no pacing issues whatsoever, it's a fast paced action ride that never stops. The movie makes you think but the plot is never convoluted, and I love that in a movie. Talk about packing a mean punch, the movie is awesome. Every action sequence is expertly crafted and amazing. They also gave Pam Landy a shot at redemption, cause in the second film she was nothing but annoying.<br/><br/>The only issue I continue to have with Greengrass' directing is the use of the skaky cam. It works a lot better than in Supremacy, but by the end of the film, if you're not feeling dizzy or have a headache, you're probably not human.<br/><br/>But overall, The Bourne Ultimatum is a perfect conclusion to the trilogy, satisfying in almost every way, action packed, tightly scripted movie."

","The Bourne Ultimatum is easily one of my favorite movies. Based on the novel by Robert Ludlum it continues the fast-pace story of ex CIA agent and assassin Jason Bourne and his run around the world to find the answer to one very simple question: ""Who am I?"". <br/><br/>The story is great, exciting, mysterious with many twists but in the same time it is not hard to follow nor is it to fast. In the time of high-budget action movies with explosions and expensive action scenes but no story or sense at all, this movie, like the previous two from the series presents the best of the thriller genre. Matt Damon plays the role of incredibly skilled but ""lost"" assassin perfectly combining the characteristics of a killing machine he was created to be and those of a normal human being just trying to get out of it. Throughout the series you'll find yourself connecting with Bourne, felling sorry for him but after watching the Ultimatum you will most likely ask more questions. The supporting roles are all great even though they don't seem to be quite as important in the movie based around one man. But the supporting roles, such as Nicky Parsons or Pamela Landy, are important because they show us the human side of Bourne.<br/><br/>The camera is shaky, almost a trademark of Paul Greengrass,and it may be a turn-down for some, but I find it just perfect for this kind of movie. You feel like you are reading a great book, like you jumped in that world, like you are the person filming Jason Bourne in his quest for answers.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the best real thriller movie I have ever watched and one of the best action movies ever, showing once more how much can be done with gripping story, great leading role and good support even if you don't have sky-high budget and marketing. This is a must-watch for everyone."

I'm sure the director was after some kind of visceral frantic feel but instead we are robbed of what made the Bourne films good in the first place, the tense fully observed and at times brutal one on one combat scenes.<br/><br/>The camera shake is enough to ruin the film but the plot is also to a large extent a dreadful re- hash of the previous films.<br/><br/>A stain on the trilogy, I advise anyone to watch the first two and pretend this one doesn't exist."

"drqshadow-reviews","7","1","2","8 August 2011"," Despite Solid Action, This Finale Offers No Comparison to its Predecessors
","I've read that the producers responsible for this series had never intended to make a third film, but faced with mounting pressure from the studio, they chose to invent a few excuses to get their amnesiac action hero back under fire. That's certainly evident in Ultimatum's story, which does have its moments but never really shakes the feeling that it's just another adventure for Bourne and not an integral part of the arching primary storyline. I had trouble investing in the hunt for the new government goons after Supremacy effectively wiped out the last remaining string pullers of any circumstance, and it's never adequately explained what interest the new goons have in capturing, hunting or killing Jason. Julia Styles is positively crammed into the same wide-eyed, good looking field liability that Franka Potente played in the first film, but doesn't have the same kind of connection with Matt Damon that made the original relationship work so well. Ultimately, the enhanced role granted to her character feels like an unnecessary step backwards. The action is still good, though, with a rooftop parkour chase through Tangiers being the highlight and another high-speed street chase that does its best to mimic the successes of the previous one (even ending in, basically, the exact same manner). However, the abundance of hand held shots this time around are way over the top. Rather than relegating the technique to the action scenes, where it makes the most sense, this time around we get the shaky treatment everywhere from baggage check at the airport to a sit-down conference in the pentagon. I still enjoyed Ultimatum for what it was - it's a high speed thrill ride - but one that pales in comparison to what came before."
"RyanCShowers","Null","1","2","5 August 2010"," Prepare to be stunned
","The Bourne Ultimatum is a fast, smart, rich, fun, and sometimes confusing conclusion to one of the best film trilogies ever made. Matt Damon is back in the title role as Bourne. His performance in all three of these films is Oscar-nomination worthy, but never gets the attention it deserves because it's an ""action role"". Let us hope the Academy will start to see things differently this year with Leonardo DiCaprio Inception role. This would be snub number 3 for Damon. <br/><br/>Ultimatum won the Oscar for Editing in 2007, which may have raised some eyebrows because the Editing trophy usually goes hand in hand with the Best Picture trophy. But it is so deserved here. The tension is so high here with suspense; you're biting your nails practically every minute. There are more action sequences here then the other two films, by far, and in he wrong hands could've been overkill, but with the editor keeping it tantalizingly alive it works and creates the atmosphere for the film. <br/><br/>Joan Allen reprises her role as Pamela Landy. For all you Pam-fans out there, she doesn't get as much screen time as she did in the second, but when she's on screen Allen works with the material. She hits all the right notes, Joan Allen is just one of the greatest actors in America. <br/><br/>Though, Ultimatum is inferior to Supremacy, it's still very close to the excellence. My main problem here was it was a more intricate storyline than the other two films. It's not hard to follow, but if you don't pay attention in that first half-hour, you'll be lost. I think the narrative could've been handled more properly. Other than that.what's not to love? 9.5"

There's a crackerjack cast along to either aide him with his quest or keep him from it - Joan Allen, David Straithairn, Albert Finney, Julia Stiles, and Scott Glenn.<br/><br/>This time around, Bourne is believed to be a CIA mole who has given a story about Blackbriar, an assassins program, to a newspaper reporter. Seeing his name in the story, Bourne contacts the reporter, and the CIA is all over him. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) knows that he's not the mole -- that Bourne tries to avoid the government. Bourne wants to know the name of the mole, too, because that person can tell him his true identity and why he is a killer. So who gets there first, the ruthless CIA agent (Straithairn) and his cronies, or Bourne? Excellent acting with another great performance by Matt Damon, a wild car chase, shootings, stalkings, great suspense, and plenty of it, will keep you on the edge of your seat, as was true in the previous two films.<br/><br/>Based on the Robert Ludlum books, the film versions of the trilogy are among the best and most exciting films around.

"ilovelctr","9","1","2","30 May 2010"," A nice switch from the 2nd film and a great end
","As soon as the 1st Bourne film surfaced, it generated a large amount of hype due to its realism, which is rare to be seen in today's action films, not to mention Jason's wisdom is the power that pushes the pace on. And these two factors have since been carried over in the two sequels.<br/><br/>First, the pace is incredibly fast and is definitely highlight in this Bourne film. To some degree, it's even set a brand new high bar for action thrillers in future, as IMO, it's probably the fastest-paced movie ever made. However, the way the crew created such a fast pace was more than intelligent. That said, the pace wasn't purely based on the amount of action sequences. Actually when compared to films like James Bond: The World Is Not Enough, the amount of action in Ultimatum is far much fewer, but that's adequate enough to give you real adrenaline. So, the story itself is very fast-paced as a whole. For instance there's one scene in Waterloo Station where there's not much action while it keeps your eyes stuck on the screen cuz the dialog really builds up a dangerous climax.<br/><br/>As it's very paced up, not much plot can be expected of it this time around, but it turned out to be a nice decision. Both the 1st and 2nd Bourne films are plot-heavy, and they would've been bad if it was not for the plot. But as the story went clear, we've known enough about Jason's past, his present and what he's up against/to. And that's why I think less plot does right for this final piece.<br/><br/>The action sequences were very well done. Hand-to-hand combats look on par with those in the 1st film, much better than these in the 2nd of course. Kali/Jeet Kune Do stuff did fine with nice choreography, no necessary curvy punch done either. Jason's IQ is as high too, which can be seen in many little surprises, which happen when he's met with some situations that normal (wisdom-wise) guys can't work out.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a masterpiece for me, also for many ppl. :D It's one of the best films of all time, for its acting, directing, story and stunt works. The only major flaw is the shaky camera work, which gets a lil bit annoying at times, especially during the action sequences. But generally I think it's better done compared to the predecessor.<br/><br/>9/10"

"showtime-14","10","1","2","15 March 2009"," One of the three most intense films I've ever seen
","WOW! The series has come along way since the original and each film surpasses the previous. This has to be thee most intense film I've ever seen. The other Two being The Departed and Running Scared. The pacing in this film is off the wall yet you don't find yourself trying to catch up with the story. Its complex yet its straight forward. Matt Damon surely does embody Jason Bourne, his personality, his emotions, his intelligence, he portrays it very convincingly. I cant help but compare this series to the lord of the rings series in that the first set up the story perfectly, the middle chapter went deeper into the characters and the third basically being the cream of the crop finished it of in epic fashion. You find yourself just bedazzled on how Bourne is always one step ahead of the CIA and he basically single handedly took them down. This isn't your typical action film. The action isn't meaningless. It is well crafted and everything has a purpose and the action scenes which is half the movie are justified by whats going on in the story. It is indeed the best action film I've seen in a very long time. Certainly in the same league as The original Die Hard, Terminator 2, and any of the 007 films if not in its own league and i say that because any of those films do not contain both the action and the intelligence that Bourne Ultimatum has."

I know there expensive but hey I got one if you need to borrow.<br/><br/>So besides all the rest of the crew and actors doing their best to make a good movie, minus Oliver wood. This film rocks! I'm finding myself becoming more and more impressed with Matt's abilities as well as Julia Stiles. Great movie, and even at its heart as a good moral foundation as to what this agency is about and also that not everyone feels the same as far as governmental agencies go. There are some good people and I like the fact they comment on that.<br/><br/>Anyway enjoy the film, don't sit to close to the screen. And if you are a fellow filmmaker looking to hire Oliver, kick him out the door."

","all the answers that have been on our minds since we first watched Bourne Identity who is Jason Bourne is answered in the Bourne Ultimatum. <br/><br/>I am an avid fan of both Bourne and bond films but now I feel bond is trailing behind Bourne is one of the best action/spy thrillers of recent years it sets the guidelines for all spy films to follow. Over the course of the three films Matt Damon has moulded into the perfect role of assassin Jason Bourne. As well as a great performance from Matt Damon recurring actors return from the previous two films as well Joan Allen as CIA operative, Julia Stiles as Treadstone operative who in this film tries to tie her past with Bournes. Also several new additions to this film Albert Finney stars as the Treadstone manager who has several reappearances in Bournes flashbacks and David Straitharn as shady CIA operative always trying to be one step ahead of Bourne<br/><br/>Expect the usual set pieces of the bourne trilogy, the amazing hand to hand fight scenes a crash bang wollop of a car chase through busy new york city streets and a rooftop chase in tangier which can be seen mirrored in a similar way in the new bond film ""quantum of solace"". <br/><br/>Overall the bourne ultimatum is a great way to end the series, and i advise any fans of the spy genres and fans of films in general to watch this film."
"Tweekums","9","1","2","8 December 2008"," A thrilling conclusion
","Having enjoyed the first two Bourne films I looked forward to seeing this one and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Surprisingly this film opens with Bourne still in Moscow just after the car chase in the previous film; in fact the majority of this film takes place between then and when he telephones Landy in New York as seen at the very end of the previous film. Somebody in the CIA decides to leak certain information to a reporter working for the Guardian; this person makes the mistake of mentioning ""Operation Blackbriar"" on a mobile phone, this is intercepted by the CIA and they soon have a team ready to pick him up in London. What they don't know is that the person he is planning to meet is none other than Jason Bourne who is still trying to learn about his past. The meet goes wrong when the reporter is shot but Bourne gets his note book which leads him to Madrid where he runs in to Nicky in the apartment of the reporters contact. Soon they are on the run together, following the contact to Tangier. Here we are treated to a dramatic rooftop chase as Bourne and Nicky are chased by the local police and an assassin who has been ordered to kill them both. He then heads to New York where he can finally find out who he really is.<br/><br/>As in the previous films Matt Damon is great as our hero Jason Bourne and Julia Stiles does well in the roll of Nicky, the other actors are convincing too. Once again there is plenty of action which is well directed and we get a nice conclusion to the story."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","30 November 2008"," ""Ultimatum"" brings Bourne action to a pinnacle of excellence
","You could say third time's a charm for the Bourne series, but only because ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is merely the best of three phenomenal action movies. The team that successfully assembled the first two films delivers yet again and even more action-packed, intense and shrouded in Bourne's mysterious past than the first two films.<br/><br/>If you still don't believe Bourne is the action hero of the decade, then you've spent too much time being preoccupied over the re-boot of the Bond franchise. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the real deal and when a fourth installment comes out, there will finally be all the noise and publicity these films deserved.<br/><br/>This film continues directly after ""Supremacy."" Bourne starts to get traces of another memory returning to him of his initial transformation into a CIA super-assassin. Meanwhile, a British reporter has gotten hold of information from an ex-CIA informant about Operation Blackbriar, an upgrade of the Treadstone project that bred Bourne of which Bourne was apparently the first subject. Naturally this information intrigues Bourne and also captures the attention of the CIA who still has secrets to protect as long as Bourne is alive.<br/><br/>Joan Allen gladly returns for the second time as Pam Landy, who has begun to sympathize with Bourne. However, she is forced to work with Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) who is helping guard the Blackbriar secret and wants Bourne flat out killed. Julia Stiles reprises her role yet again as Nicki, who helps Bourne out in a couple spots. Also joining the cast is Albert Finney. Strathairn and Finney are two other awesome additions to the franchise that has included Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Clive Owen and more. Clearly the producers know talent.<br/><br/>""Ultimatum"" is a lot more of the same for the series in terms of structure and formula, although the way this film unfolds is much more straightforward than ""Supremacy."" All the CIA treachery stuff fits in well with the action instead of being a tangential subplot. The only real subplot is understanding what Bourne's new fuzzy memory is about. Everything else makes sense as Bourne jumps from locale to locale yet again in this film, ultimately ending up in the United States for the first time, just in time for the series' best car chase yet involving Bourne driving a police car. <br/><br/>The stunt work on this film is way more incredible than the last two. While director Paul Greengrass prefers the sometimes too shaky hand-held camera-work, it never gets dizzying or distracting because this film is so well edited. The way everything is strung together keeps your attention on all the right things whether details or just keeping you on where the action is so that it makes sense.<br/><br/>""Ultimatum"" just gives you more and most applaudably without the special effects that other action films use as a crutch. It doesn't get more real than this series as far as action goes. Simply another job well done executing this film. I don't know if the formula can be relied on for a fourth (formula being Bourne tries to uncover more of his past - gets chased by CIA - beats people up in four countries minimum - car chase). There is a definitely a much clearer resolution in this film that would lead you to believe something new would need to come in for a fourth film to be made."
"petar-mrdja1","10","1","2","2 November 2008"," The best action picture of the all time
","First of all, let me point out that i am not a huge fan of action pictures, because action in them tends to get boring and unimaginative, however, this is not the case with this movie. It starts of very slowly, not showing that it will differ from the previous two instalments in the franchise, but when Bourne enters the London train terminal, all hell breaks out. ¸There is a short break in Madrid, and then the chase in Tangiers starts. For me, this is the best action scene in movie history. There have been many rooftop chases in movie history, but this one is truly incredible. Its simplicity, power, speed, suspense is unparalleled. The shaking camera, which a lot of people point out as the weak spot of the movie shows its true meaning in this scene, and i think it, alongside the incredible movie score, is its strong point. Of course, the screenplay, acting, directing, sound, picture, and not to forget the best stunts ever seen in a motion picture make this movie truly the best. This movie is not more than a compilation of three huge action scenes put together with breaks in between, but that is why this movie is so brilliant. I went to see this movie with my cousin, who truly dislikes action movies, and he told me afterwards that it was incredible. I can""t think of a better recommendation for it. If you have the opportunity, go see this movie in the movie theatre, you""ll have an incredible movie experience."
"Sanou_san","10","1","2","30 October 2008"," The Best sequel (probably the finale) ever
","This got to be more of unexpected turn of events! I couldn't believe how much the Bourne Trilogy upgraded so much. From Identity to Supremacy, and now the Ultimatum, this got to be one heck of work for them. The third installment was certainly the best improvement among the Bourne movie series. This was as if ""the best for the last"" and the crew behind really worked hard for the success of the movie, no wonder it got to top 135 for this site and garnered an ample vote to appraise its brilliance. Bourne Ultimatum indeed was an awestruck for me, I've never fathom how much Paul Greengrass had heaved this movie much, not only to popularity but for a prompt qualification on Oscars as it deserves. I agree that new 007 Bond movie(s) need to be aware of such rapid elevation for Bourne movies. After Bourne sorted few more things and retraced his steps gradually at the second installment he come to terms of finishing what started Treadstone and put an end to a more upgraded version of this program: Blackbriar. Though he got no idea who where the people behind, he sure was decided to put an end to what he believed started with him. Bourne Ultimatum has more of reasonable brilliance than the rest of the Bourne Movie, more conspiracy, action and new characters. Its substance and form blend almost perfectly and its sheets of surprises which adequately complements the luster of the movie. The conclusion was also fitting, it was cool and satisfying and I deem never leave viewers befuddled with sequels, well if it does have one I bet they could pull a much more neat trick to outwit the recent one."
"arieliondotcom","9","1","2","19 October 2008"," The Prisoner Lives?
","Something nagged at me while watching this film and I suddenly realized that I was seeing the resemblances between this series and an old television series called ""The Prisoner."" I realized then that the whole Bourne plot was just a rehashing of that one. (It's amazing how many famous writers are really just retelling stories they've heard elsewhere without realizing it, but that's a tale for another time).<br/><br/>That said, this is an awesome film, especially given that I didn't know what I was watching for at least the first 1/3 of it and only got clarity later, like the monocular view Bourne has at one point in the film, getting clearer as the twists increase. <br/><br/>I, as other have mentioned, found myself laughing at some of the (intentional) umor, but t myself as well. In fact, I was well into writing my review as I watched it and was in the midst of rating it lower because of the ""gaping plot holes"" (agents using cell phones that could easily be traced while working for the CIA, etc.) until the ""gotcha"" came and I realized, along with the characters in the film, that I'd been played. The writers/directors knew what they were doing all along. (Which, too, I think is the problem with those who gave the film such negative reviews. They don't ""get it"", but like some forms of art, either you see it or you don't, and if you don't you can't. It's just a matter of connections you either make or don't make.)<br/><br/>For me, this was a wonderful movie. No, the plot (of the entire trilogy in fact) isn't really unique. Yes, the ending turns out to actually be hackneyed when you think about it. But the movie is so good and you are so involved in the plot and character that you actually find yourself smiling and cheering at it anyway.<br/><br/>A fine, fun film. And I, too, hope that the writers leave well enough alone and not do a prequel or sequel. Let him rest in peace....Well...at least let us imagine the other adventures on our own."

","Having enjoyed the first of the trilogy and been a bit disappointed with the second it has taken me a rather long time to get round to seeing the third. But, as with the first, what a great surprise. I enjoyed the first because the excellent script helped enormously in encouraging our involvement with the characters and thereby making the action so much more exciting. The second seemed too glossy and clever, too obsessed with the brilliant action cinema but somehow leaving us the viewer, wondering just what it was all for. Here with the third and the movie roars with authenticity, good script and such action as to take our breath away. There is not a lot of story but what there is, is believable and we are on the edge of our seats throughout. Well done Mr Greengrass you have learned from what I think were mistakes and pulled off a very fine film."
"Dr_Kruger","9","1","2","21 May 2008"," Please don't spoil this fabulous trilogy with a fourth
","Sequels are the most annoying habit of modern American cinema for me. More often than not they have the smell of money making greed running through them instead of wanting to create something special with a logical and satisfying ending to the series.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum has succeeded in rounding of a fantastic trilogy of films in the way I described above. Along the way it has provided thrills and spills with excellently executed to give the maximum buzz. This final? instalment ramps up the tension dramatically and steers clear of any kind of mushy ending which would'be been a real letdown.<br/><br/>I seriously love these films. My only quibble relates to Greengrass's obsession with using 'shaky-cam' to heighten the tension. In places it is highly effective, but in the longer dialogue/office scenes it gets rather annoying. It's a minor complaint but I still think it's an exceptional, well thought through ending."
"alanfw","10","1","2","11 March 2008"," Yet another masterpiece in the Bourne series.
","Firstly , I have to say, I have read some other reviews on here where people whinge and whine about the ""shaky"" camera and filming style and quite frankly these people would be better off just sticking with their ""Mrs Marple"" murder mysteries or ""Murder she wrote"" TV shows as it would seem that the filming style used in these shows are about as intense as they are able to handle.<br/><br/>Anything beyond a sedate and lethargic filming style seems to give these people motion sickness apparently. I suspect that the attention span of said reviewers is equally limited hence why I think their comments should be approached with caution and taken with a huge bag of salt let alone a proverbial ""pinch"".<br/><br/>Let's get one thing clear,. the whole point of the filming style is to involve the viewer in the action as much as possible and to maximise the intensity , and it works whether you like the style or not. If you don't get that , then you're missing the point! Right , now that I've got that out of the way , I'll get on with the film.<br/><br/>I'm so glad that Greengrass ( director ) kept to the same style of filming as the Supremacy and once again gives this film a real gritty and intense feel about it. <br/><br/>The Ultimatum raises the bar yet again in terms of a pure cinematic experience with Paul Greengrass ensuring that the viewer is always kept as close to scenes as possible. The camera work is superb<br/><br/>As far as the action sequences in this film, well, they are more impressive and inventive than ever. The fight choreography is some of the best I have seen and it is good to see that they didn't make Bourne totally invincible, allowing him take some hits now and again. Nikki's( Julia Stiles ) character certainly gets more time in this film and leaves open the possibility for further development between her and Bourne as we start to understand that they both had something of a ""bond"" before his 1st mission. The range of locations is again superb and the director of photography deserves a pat on the back for a job well done too. <br/><br/>This latest of the Bourne series continues to confirm that Paul Greengrass has a great understanding of how to get the most from each scene and that Matt Damon , along with the rest of the cast are masters of their craft , putting in convincing performances to make what must surely be one of the best movies of 2007 and quite possibly one of the best action/thrillers ever ( or at least until the next bourne film come s along )"
"McQualude","8","1","2","10 February 2008"," Not as good as the second.
","The series continues to deviate far and wide of the books but I don't it's a bad thing when the movies are this good. The middle movie is still my favorite but this one would be a close second. The camera seemed a little tighter on this one or maybe I am just noticing it more; for my tastes the tight camera and quick cuts are getting ridiculous and I still feel like it's to compensate for lazy choreography but it didn't detract too much from the fight scenes. Ultimatum picks up where Supremacy left off and leaves one important loose thread that makes a nice setup for yet another sequel. A nagging suspicion I've had about Nicky since the first film is confirmed. The ending is far fetched. I loved the books though and I love the films."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","29 January 2008"," Bourne ends with a blast but I'm glad it's the last (oh my that rhymes!).
","Yes, I'm quite the poet.<br/><br/>One thing that the Bourne movies also really learned us is that magazines, books and towels can be more lethal weapons than guns or knives. I mean with this that the Bourne movies mostly redefined the action genre by having the guts to be different and original.<br/><br/>Still I am glad it's the last out the Bourne series, also because this one is definitely the least out of the Bourne series. They with this movie obviously ran out of ideas and this movie is also mostly a rehash of the previous two Bourne movies. It's really more of the same and actually made me realize how much alike all of the Bourne movies actual really are to each other. The story is actually quite similar to the second movie, also because halve of this movie is set at the same time the second movie was set in (getting confusing?). There again is also an assassin on Jason's tail and his superiors once more want to see him dead to cover up illegal secret mission and.<br/><br/>Just because you have lots of shaking camera-work and fast editing doesn't mean you have a good action movie as well. It makes the movie fast paced but in my opinion they could had gone a bit more easy on its style. Paul Greengrass already sort of overused this with the previous movie ""The Bourne Supremacy"". The shaky cam and all works great for its action sequences and more realistic moments, such as in the other Paul Greengrass movie ""Bloody Sunday"" but making an entire action movie, with an obvious fictitious over-the-top action story is a whole other thing. The same goes for the overall same gritty visual style. This visually has as a result that Madrid looks absolutely the same as New York, New York looks like Moscow and Moscow looks like Tangiers. A reason why I think they could had gone a bit more easy on its consistent visual style.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact once you really start thinking about it, this movie isn't even really THAT action filled, in terms of having lots of fights, chases and explosions.<br/><br/>The main reason why this movie is in my opinion the least out of the Bourne series is simply because of its story. This movie has such an incredible simple storyline that it really seems that they simply pushed it entirely to the background and let the action instead tell the entire story on its own. Nothing wrong with it, since this definitely worked out for the movie but it of course is a very cheap way of film-making, that makes you get away with practically everything. And does this movie really reach a satisfying enough conclusion for the trilogy? In my opinion not really, since I don't really have the reason that lots have changed for Bourne. Somehow I don't think he picks up a normal quiet life after all he has been trough.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is perhaps the biggest winner after his three Bourne movies. Before these movies he sort of had a dull and very boyish, nerd like image. His career was already getting sort of slow, before he signed up for the first Bourne movie. He by now has officially been taking serious by lots of critics and movie goers all over the world and he has proved that he can actually handle action really well and is even a convincing action star. Joan Allen also luckily returns in this movie and so does Julia Stiles, though I have the feeling they should had dropped her two movies ago. David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney are some of the new welcome additions to the cast this time.<br/><br/>It's a real fancy and fast, slick looking action flick, that all in all forms a satisfying enough conclusion of the Bourne trilogy.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Solid 7/10."
"Pavel-8","8","1","2","28 December 2007"," I remember everything
","One of better movie series of the last decades possibly concludes with the release of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", the third movie that follows super-secret spy/assassin Jason Bourne as he attempts to track down his past against the wishes of the United States government that trained him. The original, ""The Bourne Identity"", was one of the best pure action movie in recent years. The sequel, 2004's ""Bourne Supremacy"", was unsure and not quite as polished, but still solid. Now comes the series third installment, which just about wraps up the summer movie season.<br/><br/>The storyline follows a natural progression from the previous two movies. Now that Bourne has figured out who he is now and atoned somewhat for his sins, he wants to know who he was. In order to do that, he must race the government to various people who know the secrets behind his black-ops work.<br/><br/>Few cinematic characters are as perfect for action movies as Jason Bourne, from both an action and narrative standpoint. As he learns his past, he takes the audience along for the ride. But that process is not tedious backstory or mediocre character development, as is often the case in such movies. Instead, his quest is the story, which makes for a rapid-fire flick that simultaneously entertains and enlightens. Matt Damon's determined yet understated demeanor is ideal for the role, and the no-frills approach never distracts from a driving story that is filled with plenty of high-tech action.<br/><br/>In a lesser movie, the technological implausibilities might weaken the movie or distract from the storyline. But ""Ultimatum"" dodged that bullet in two ways. First, the story moves quickly enough that the viewer barely has time to think about what might or might not work before the flick is on to the next frenetic sequence. Secondly, the movie does not use the technology as a dominant point of the movie, like ""Enemy of the State"". Instead the devices are merely a means to an end.<br/><br/>Also overshadowing the technology is another strong supporting cast. The always-good Joan Allen returns this time, joined by Scott Glenn and David Straithairn, from ""Good Night and Good Luck"". Strathairn and Allen are compelling in every scene, particularly when they are together. Their exchanges crackle without flying over the top, and their restrained focus is as intense as any shouting match. They add a layer of gravity to the goings-on that separates ""Ultimatum"" from other summer action like ""Live Free or Die Hard"".<br/><br/>Other differences between this and ""Die Hard"" lie in the technical aspects of the film. Director Paul Greengrass also helmed ""Supremacy"", and he and his crew remedied one of the main problems of the second movie, which was the overly shaky camera work. Most of the shots are still hand-held, but they are more static than before and pulled back a little in the fights. The music is surprisingly good too. As Bourne trots through Europe and Africa, the music travels along, mixing in pulsing strings, African drums, and even going completely silent when appropriate.<br/><br/>""Ultimatum"" often echoes ""Identity"", which is a good thing. Both possess a similar driving intensity interspersed with quiet moments that allow humanity to leak through. This one lacks the originality of ""Identity"", but replaces it with the satisfying resolution that Bourne is seeking. On the whole, as the summer movie season wraps up, this is the best action film of the last few months. It's better than ""Die Hard"", although it doesn't provide as much fun. It's a better film; ""Die Hard"" is a better movie, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Better than the second; not quite as good as the original, but still a bang-up way to end the summer movie season. A slightly generous 8 of 10."

Now is this good at all for any useful means? The film has no heart: it doesn't trap and captivate the spectator; it's a full rush of (much more than is acceptable)unreal events unfolding frantically.

More real, more human. More vulnerable yet more lethal. And Matt Damon plays a great Bourne. It's these qualities and the realism of the fighting and chasing that really jumped out in the first two Bourne films.<br/><br/>The excessive camera shake and hasty flashing from one camera to the other in this third installment are over the top and don't contribute any more to these qualities. In fact they diminish them. It's just the director trying to grab your attention by force.

","I just got back from watching this film, and found it to be a middle of the road picture. I would have rated it higher if it hadn't been so ""shaky"" in parts, especially in the beginning. It seemed as if they employed some film students to shoot parts of the movie that should have been still, and it looked like someone with a palsy was holding the camera. I found this to be very distracting from the movie. I am truly hoping they can figure out how to keep the camera still if they do another sequel. The movie is essentially Bourne running and trying not to be killed. There is a minor subplot with a reporter who finds out a bit about a clandestine operation. There is also another bit with an internal CIA operative who believes in Bourne, and works to expose the director, who is abusing his power, and seems to have something to hide. These small portions help keep the movie from sliding over the edge to complete predictability. However, I feel that the frenetic pacing of the movie is really used to keep you from noticing the lack of a real plot. My wife suggested that the whole thing could have been compressed into a half hour TV show, and I think she is right. Next time around, just make Bourne an agent working for the US, and get rid of the whole bit about him running from the good guys."

","""You listen very carefully to what I'm about to tell you. I remember. I remember everything. I'm no longer Jason Bourne."" <br/><br/>Lock, stock, and thrills galore, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is undoubtedly the summer's most anticipated and well-received film, casting a long shadow over other recent performances such as 'Atonement' and 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'. Reprising Matt Damon in his role as amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne, on the run from the people who trained him; this non-stop and adrenaline pumping film culminates into one of the finest espionage 'flick's' in recent memory.<br/><br/>In this, the third film of the Bourne Trilogy, we find Jason brought out of hiding by a newspaper reporter who is trying to unveil the CIA based 'Operation Blackbriar'; the program which effectively trained Bourne to become the proficient killing machine that he is. Seeing the reporter as his last chance of finding out his true identity, Jason sets out in pursuit, only to find himself embroiled in a constant battle with 'Blackbriar,' which is also in pursuit of the reporter and his sources, who have blown the operations cover. From London, to Tangier, to Paris, to New York; the cat and mouse game of assassinations, lies and deceit provides a thrilling and tense battle wits, and an ending that is guaranteed not to disappoint any Jason Bourne fan.<br/><br/>Following the successes of its two prequels, 'The Bourne Identity' and 'The Bourne Supremacy', 'The Bourne Ultimatum' always had much to live up to, and more importantly had to retain the interest of its domestic and worldwide audiences. To this respect, the 'Ultimatum' has done amply well in securing its viewers interests and fulfilling the great expectations that were laid upon it. The film itself has all the basic components of your typical espionage movie, but with the exception of an added pinch of special effects, a splattering of brilliant storyline, and a dash of the 'Bourne factor', that makes the trilogy as a whole such a magnificent 'movie fest'. That said, the film has its underdone features as well, most notably the shaky camera work and panning, which is guaranteed to incur motion sickness from the outset of the movie. Nevertheless, this third (and purportedly) final installment could well be considered the pièce de résistance of the entire trilogy.<br/><br/>At first I was dubious about the 'Ultimatum'. Espionage films are notorious for degenerating further into disappointing pulp-fictions with every sequel that's released, and although the first and second films could only be described as thrilling, I still felt that this film was bound to disappoint the media-hype it had been given. (After all, 2007 has become infamous for this movie phenomenon; especially in regards to films that concern snakes, planes, and motherrelated expletives!) Yet despite all my fears, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that a sequel can claim to be even better than its original predecessor, but in regards to 'The Bourne Ultimatum' this is most certainly the case. The film's clever plot ties, 'über-suave' presentation, and brutal 'blood and guts' style action scenes never failed to impress and importantly, unlike most Hollywood movies, it doesn't forget its roots.<br/><br/>The ever-dependable Mat Damon again proves his ability to portray Robert Ludlum's most famous creation in a decisive, cold, and calculating way that is very much in key with this film's impersonal, technophillic, and paranoid feel. Although well known to the role, Damon's greatest achievement is to portray Bourne in a brilliantly fresh yet constant way that is very akin to Ludlum's original portrayal, and is guaranteed to keep you guessing till the end. The film also hosts a convincing co-starring cast, most of whom appeared in the prequels, with Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Edgar Ramirez, and Joan Allen all being well suited to their pivotal roles. Performances particularly worthy of note are that of Julia Styles as Nicky Parsons, Bourne's former colleague and accomplice, and Joan Allen who portrays the Deputy CIA'S chief, Pamela Landy, who is also a sympathizer of Bourne's.<br/><br/>However, due praise must also go the film's director, Paul Greengrass, who it appears has managed to bring together all the ingredients to create a highly noteworthy performance, which is set to become one of the best blockbusters of 2007. The artistic style of the film, although described as 'clumsy' by some, is inspired in my belief, as it provides a kinetic clarity that fits into Greengrass' own style of jerky, hand-held-camera intrusiveness that doesn't seem so documentary-like, so much as it gives you the sense that you're following Bourne and eavesdropping on his conversations; providing a subtle mirror to Bourne's own actions.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is a genuine success that is bound to thrill some moviegoers and maybe pass over the heads of some others. With the minimalistic yet brilliant roles portrayed by its cast, the awesome special effects, and an ending that is guaranteed to put a wry smile on even the most austere critics face; 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is a 'spy-tacular' film that will ignite the secret agent within every moviegoer!"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","2","30 September 2007"," The end of a period
","The third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is a political film more than a plain entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed some one who became his corpse. But the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all American citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people. Who was one essential officer of the CIA up to 1980, when he became vice president? That goes along with what is being said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation. A woman and the Senate; read my lips. In the USA politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the cinema. Right now Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So go and watch the film. It is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for, but no one is able to pretend it won't come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"kch_975","10","1","2","22 September 2007"," A excellent movie and trilogy!!!!
","This movie was excellent. I was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did. Like all the Bourne movies the action is fast paced, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also. The movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic. OK, Julia Stiles character showing up in the Italian safe house was kind of far-fetched especially after what happened in Supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in ""Treadstone"" that Bourne knows, that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction. The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them. The thing that I always loved about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them. They never treat the audience like idiots.<br/><br/>All the actors were solid in their performances. I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from Joan Allen reprising her role from Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this film and the trilogy. I do miss Franka Potente though."

","What was key hair stylist John Quaglia thinking? The blonde highlights don't work on Julia Stiles at all. They all but ruin the unique appeal of her deadpan, yet strangely quizzical expression and her sneering smile. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with the predictably action-packed third installment of the Bourne franchise. Highlights include David Strathairn's appearance as CIA hardliner Noah Vosen and Jason Bourne's short-range skirmish with CIA hit-man Desh Bouksani (Joey Ansah) in a Tangiers townhouse. Bourne (Matt Damon) knocks him out expertly with a medium-sized coffee-table book. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't make out the title of the deadly tome. I guess I'll have to wait for the DVD. Fairy tale fanciers will appreciate how Agent Parsons uses the remains of her crushed cellphone, breadcrumb style, to set Agent Bourne on her trail."
"MOscarbradley","8","1","2","15 September 2007"," You'll be on the edge of your seat so long as you leave your brains at the door
","Like practically all of the recent Bond films up to the frankly magnificent ""Casino Royale"", the first two Bourne movies were highly enjoyable if hardly memorable, (the problem with most of these films is that they all look and sound the same). Now we have the third, though probably not the last, in the Bourne franchise and if it distinguishes itself from its predecessors it's due almost entirely to being one long chase from start to finish. When it pauses for breath, which is seldom, it is as banal as any thick-ear action driven movie can be. It helps, of course, if you have seen the one before and recently since this seems to kick off where that one ended. It's still possible to enjoy number three, of course, even if you haven't seen the others though making head or tails of the plot may well prove impossible.<br/><br/>As a high adrenalin action picture it's fantastic, literally as well as figuratively. It begins in Moscow, moves to London then Madrid, Tangiers and ends in New York while Bourne traverses the globe without baggage, money or sleep, (the 'superman' theme is stretched beyond credulity), pursued all the while by sundry assassins and it's in the chases themselves that the film really takes off. There is a wonderful, seat-edging sequence filmed in and around Waterloo Station, a chase through the alley-ways and over the roof-tops of Tangiers and a car chase through New York all of which are master-classes in timing and, although each is lengthy in itself, none of which seem to drag on too long.<br/><br/>It's in the plot department that the film falls down, (Bourne is still seeking his identity), and a good cast, (in support, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Joan Allen and Paddy Considine), are largely wasted. As Bourne, Matt Damon uses that chiseled Mount Rushmore expression to good effect, his granite chops never betray what, if anything, he's thinking but then that may well be the one activity that's beyond him."
"madonnawb","7","1","2","13 September 2007"," Loved the suspense and the action scenes BUT not the shaky camera
","Seeing the first two prequels, I was excited to see how the third one would conclude the series.... and while I loved the action shots and the build up, I cannot say I was as happy with the conclusion.<br/><br/>Basically, after the murder of his girl friend Marie Helena, Bourne is after the CIA with an extra zeal to uncover not only his past but expose to the public all of those behind the Treadstone organization. He gets some help from a news-reporter (Simon Ross) who was onto the Threadstone and operation Blackbriar. Just as Bourne is about to get more info, CIA surveillance team is after Ross to eliminate him and who ever is his source. Ross gets taken out by a sniper while Bourne manages to escape taking along with him Ross' notebook which reveals that his source is Neil Daniels CIA's station chief in Madrid. As Bourne is on his way to Madrid so is the CIA lead by the vicious CIA official Noah Vosen and Deputy Director Pamela Landy, who is more sympathetic to Bourne. On his way Bourne also gets help from another CIA personnel Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). Finally after many car chases and fight scenes in Morocco and New York and with help from Pam, Bourne finally arrives to the Treadstone training facility at 415 and 71st Street to find out who were the people that made him into the monster killer he became. The truth however turns out to be partially of his own making since Dr. Hirsch who ran the psychological training reveals that Bourne - real name David Webb, volunteered for the program. Naturally it does not excuse what the program became and their actions, but it does send a message that we should not give our lives away so easily for someone else's cause and people's dirty business (hint hint army).<br/><br/>That said, the conclusion didn't have the avengence feeling like expected, but the action shots were awesome. What I did not like was the shaky camera style of the film mixed with the awful South Keys cinema out of focus projection quality- we all had to squint at"
"houseofwilliams-1","7","1","2","10 September 2007"," Good, not great
","Good action sequences, but I generally felt there wasn't much going on by movie's end. I also know the books are nothing like the movies, so that kind of brings it down. And all three movies are pretty much interchangeable: same basic plot, some fight scenes, car chases, and some nice foreign shoot locations. The shaky camera work is especially off-putting. Sure you get a sense of urgency, but you can never see whats happening until the last car crashes or someone dies. Even when nothings happening you notice a tremor. And ultimately, the plot is thin. It all comes down to who is REALLY responsible for turning him into a killing machine. At the end of each movie you think he's found them, but as always, its not over. Entertaining, but not the end of the world if you miss it."

","The Bourne Ultimatum marks the third installment in the Bourne franchise. It seems that all three films basically follow Jason Bourne on one continuous journey as he runs from the powers that be; people who for one reason or another want him dead.<br/><br/>As the film begins, we find out, he is still in fact, on the never ending run. He is understandably hell bent on finding out who he is and why he is able to do what he does. The agency that comes after him apparently wants to kill him simply because he's the loose cannon, the lost piece of the big puzzle that is their human rights violating war on terror. We never find out in the film what Jason really knows. Perhaps he holds some key information apart from the existence of his organization that, if revealed, could collapse the entire CIA. It seems the entire film is based on the premise that Jason has to outrun and out think the people who hired and trained him, but the ends don't justify the means. In retrospect, there is no intent; no purpose as to why Jason has to run apart from wanting to stay alive and find out who he is. The agency apparently doesn't know he has amnesia, but that's neither here nor there. As someone watching the film, I really didn't have any reason to invest in the story or the characters apart from feeling sorry for Jason Bourne's sad state of affairs (or maybe I only cared because it's Matt Damon?).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film is without a doubt, edge of your seat stuff. The pacing was terrific and you really are sitting there thinking about what is going to happen next, even though the ending is not at all satisfying. One technical downside to the film is the over use of the shaky camera work, trying to make this seem more like a documentary rather than a film. There are scenes where I was wishing it would just stay still so I could see what's happening without having to think the cameraman was going to fall over.<br/><br/>As for the action, yes it is there. The film ends up being more about tension and pacing rather than the over the top action of say, Die Hard 4. One scene in particular though will go down as one of the best hand to hand fight scenes in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Every performance in the film seems a little stale. Jason doesn't seem to have any remorse for the deaths, although he does show some compassion to a fellow treadstone agent. It seems they took out the human factor and watered it down to make this more of a summer movie.<br/><br/>Over all, the film wasn't bad but the writing was a bit weak. I would've preferred a better story with a more satisfying conclusion and more intriguing characters than the thriller that was the final product. Either way don't wait for the DVD; go watch this one in theatres."
"petit76","Null","1","2","6 September 2007"," applause to the consistency of Greengrass
","have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me. Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window. With that said, the Bourne series has been fantastic. Doug Liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly. This is not the sci-fi absurdity that was Bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less). There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out. With director Paul Greengrass taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair. The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. Greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment, The Bourne Ultimatum. In what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy, the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.<br/><br/>Once again, Bourne is brought into the minds of the CIA by false pretenses. Someone has leaked information about the Treadstone upgrade called Blackbriar and once Bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story, he is assumed to be the mole. Only Pamela Landy, she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy, knows that he can't be the one. Bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace. It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them. What ends up transpiring is that Bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer. The film, then, becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends, or if Bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.<br/><br/>In what is probably the simplest storyline of the series, with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story, it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression. This is not a detriment at all, however, as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot. Admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight, between Bourne and the CIA's second asset, alone. The chase jumping through windows in Madrid is cool on its own, but when they finally meet up, we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see. Also, rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films, we instead get around three small scale road races, just as intense, but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.<br/><br/>After five years of waiting, we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling. By the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him. No one could have done it better than Matt Damon. He has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences, but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him. Joan Allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job, but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how Brian Cox's character, from the first two films, took matters into his own hands. Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from David Strathairn. Like Cox, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision. With as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the Blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country, you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing. Even the little guys do a wonderful job, like Paddy Considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything, Albert Finney as a man from Bourne's past and possibly key to his origin, and Edgar Ramirez as one of the CIA's operatives sent to take Bourne out. Ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by Clive Owen (Identity), Karl Urban, and Martin Csokas (Supremacy). He doesn't talk much, if at all, but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in Domino.<br/><br/>In the end, one has to applaud Paul Greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them. His skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as Tony Scott, but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts. Rather than feel like over- production, his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action. Let's also credit cinematographer Oliver Wood, who shot all three Bourne films. He was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them.Evren Buyruk from California ,2007"

Bourne is a killer, very well trained in his job, but has also a human side, which he shows in a very natural way. No false morale, not pathetic, not hypocrites. He is authentic. And the film has exactly the right ingredients, not too much and not too less. And it leaves the spectator open to imagine a further film, where maybe our hero gets a little more closer to his female co-star.

","Here's a tip: don't eat before you enter the cinema. This is one stomach-turning film.<br/><br/>I say that not as a criticism of its quality. Quite the opposite in fact; this film represents the new elite of Hollywood: brainy AND ballsy, edgy without preachy, fun without betraying the characters' cores.<br/><br/>The camera-work is what will kill the stomach. It moves with such velocity sometimes that I found myself squinting to make out what's going on. A marvelous tool to bring reality to what would otherwise be a difficult-to-believe plot line. It makes you feel not like you're some static viewer, but someone whose been thrown into the pit of this chaotic tale and you're constantly chasing the characters as they blast and bark their way through scenes.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the acting: effortlessly perfect. Damon is a brilliant actor in my mind. Most main stars would be all-too-tempted to be showy and just begging to throw soundbites here and there. (I'm looking at you, Cruise.) Matt has the modesty, temperance and understanding not only to hold back with dignity, but be damn-near silent throughout most of the film. This in turn allows him to play the real character: an unstoppable weapon of destruction hell-bent on wreaking justice on those that took away his life and his love. Words are seldom used on his part because they are seldom necessary. When he does speak, it's mostly terse commands or direct inquiries, with a gun in his hand. A comment on government style these days, perhaps? Joan Allen is another excellent performer. She really pulls off the role with style. She makes her work seem effortless in all the films she's done that I've seen, but especially in this film she shines as an actress fully-capable of immersing herself in the character. By the end of this film you can fully relate to how she's changed from chasing Bourne to...well, you'll see.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles is not my favourite actress in the world, but maybe that's only because I'm not a major fan of her films. they always seemed to be in the teenybopper area, which ain't my cuppa tea. This film shows her to be a very mature, and restrained actress. Again it must take discipline to be able to hold back, remain cold, on a big Hollywood film. She does it admirably. Whilst still not being the best at emoting---or perhaps that's the point of her character?---she does however give us another viewpoint on the plot line, another angle on Bourne, and that's more than can be said for most actors out there.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass is a gift from God as far as I'm concerned. He seems incapable of any ego-ish actions. Most directors when standing on the pedestal of cash handed to them by their thankful and greedy producers, tend to display all the restraint of a five year old with ADHD. This their chance to shine and they frequently blow up instead. Greengrass takes the world by the unmentionables and shoves it in our face, shows us the ugly as well as the beautiful, takes the grit of real-life espionage and rubs it in our eyes til we're war-hardened and tired. And that's exactly the point. It's no secret he and his fellow castmembers harbour reservations when it comes to the USA foreign policy. This film is a direct FU to those people, but done in an intellectual and entertaining way.<br/><br/>These, to me, are the essential attributes of an excellent film.<br/><br/>The upside: bombs, guns, chases and riveting dialogue.<br/><br/>The downside: stomach-quaking camera-work, you have to see the previous two to really get emotionally involved.<br/><br/>The sum-up: see it, and think on what the world we live in really is all about."

Anti-climactic. The Bourne Supremacy? Oh yes, that was a magnificent picture. So, I guess it's not really surprising that The Bourne Ultimatum, the sequel to Supremacy, is arguably the best film of the year so far. We went in with extremely high expectations, and I'm happy to say that those expectations were met, and then some.<br/><br/>When we last met Jason Bourne (Damon), his girlfriend had just been killed, so he was out for revenge. This time though, it's back to basics. Bourne is being hunted by CIA officials, led by Strathairn's Noah Vosen, as he's still searching for his unknown past. Also unlike the last film, Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Allen) and series regular Nicky Parsons (Stiles) are on Bourne's side.<br/><br/>I'm quite sure no other film this year will give you the Adrenaline rush Ultimatum gave us.

Basically, the film is one massive action scene. The chases in London and in Tangier in particular took my breath away and had me on the edge of my seat. But if you think Ultimatum is just a loud & dumb action flick, well, think again. The film's got big a heart; Bourne is still the sympathetic spy who wants to atone for his previous sins. And even better, Ultimatum has a brain too. The story is complex and gripping and believe or not, but Ultimatum is probably the most anti-American film since Syriana, Damon's 2005 political thriller (I haven't seen Sicko yet)<br/><br/>After helming Supremacy, United 93, and Ultimatum in a row, I think Greengrass has firmly established himself as one of the best directors working today; the film has an excellent gritty look, innovative fight scenes, and an outstanding score. The English filmmaker still uses the shaky cam excessively, but because the editing is phenomenal, the shots hold long enough that you can actually tell what's going on. Greengrass got the best out of his cast as well. Damon excels as Bourne, Allen is amazing as usual (she should get an Oscar like, now!), Stiles finally gets to do something other than listening to her earpiece, and Strathairn is good, but somehow underused.<br/><br/>So, I'd definitely recommend seeing The Bourne Ultimatum. It's a fitting end to an amazing trilogy, and it's one of (if not) the best films of the year"

","Jason Bourne is still trying to figure out his past and who he really is and how he became Bourne. Certain people in power still want him dead as Jason Bourne moves ever closer to the truth about himself...<br/><br/>Tying in very nicely to ""The Bourne Supremacy"" this is a great tension packed conclusion to an overall great action trilogy. Like the previous two films this one has virtually nothing to do with Ludlum's original book save for that frenetic and relentless tone that Ludlum described so vividly and Paul Greengrass has put on screen so effectively. The chases, fights, and even plot developments are paced so that someone watching doesn't even know time is passing by. They are just nailed to what is going on.<br/><br/>However, there is a critical slip in a key scene where Jason Bourne WILLINGLY gives away his location to the people hunting him. He knows that they'll descend on him like vultures and he hasn't even secured his exit yet. This is the first time in three great action movies when it blatantly feels that the protagonist has more luck than the cold and constant calculation he utilized before. If someone digs deep enough, even in the books, they'll see Bourne has lots of luck, as all action heroes, but it never quite felt that way. The action and plot always sailed smoothly over it. Here they both graze the tip of a dangerous iceberg, but the film quickly recovers for a strong conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall the film trilogy is a great book-to-screen translation of three great books. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action.

","I watched this movie on August 7th at SM Megamall, before the release date of August 15th. I sat at the front row, as I normally do, and because this movie is loaded with action, I was not able to take a nap. I watched this movie, twice on the same day, mostly because I had nothing else to do that day.<br/><br/>My wife had to work that day and I, for having watched all the past Bourne movies, could not miss this one.

The hand held camera works fine, and the sounds effects editing is fantastic. 9/10 But this comment is not aimed about my feelings on the movie. I just gave you them in a nutshell.

","What a great action movie. The Bourne Ultimatum keeps the pace going from start to finish, with particularly exhilarating fight scenes in the middle segments in Tangiers.<br/><br/>That being said, some of the more interesting human elements from the first two films are missing here. The fact that Marie is gone puts a bit of a damper on Bourne's emotional development (if that's what you're here for, anyways). He's back to kicking butt and taking names, which is perfectly fine for me.<br/><br/>Overall, the performances are strong throughout. We aren't really introduced to any new characters who are particularly compelling, which is unfortunate. We do get a bit of an expansion of Julia Stiles's character, who is really minor in the first two movies. Her strange and strained relationship w/ Jason is probably the only part of the film that breaks out of the constant rush of action being thrown at you on the screen.<br/><br/>The camera work, much discussed, is not always great. The shakiness can be a bit much at times, particularly when there isn't a great fight scene going on. However, it's part and parcel's the series's overall feel and never exceeds mildly annoying."
"chrichtonsworld","8","1","2","19 August 2007"," Good conclusion
","Good conclusion of the ""Bourne"" trilogy! This third part is just as good as the first two movies! I thought that the plot was well constructed! It is however not a complicated one! But that is OK! Because the action and adventure part make up for that! Very Impressive and realistic action scenes and as far as I can tell no CGI was used (At least not noticeable)! ""Bourne Supremacy"" however doesn't add anything new! The ending was more or less expected! You just know that Bourne will get the job done! Don't get me wrong! I enjoyed watching this! If it were up to me they would make more movies like this one! But if you look at the whole trilogy they could have stopped after making""The Bourne Identity""! That movie also had a satisfying conclusion and was actually a finished product! I would like to have seen more diversity! (Just as in the ""Mission Impossible"" film series! Every part was at least different in style and plot!) ""Bourne Supremacy"" is more of the same! In this case that is not a bad thing! Don't expect any real surprises and you will be entertained for two hours!"
"sultan-5","8","1","2","17 August 2007"," Paul Greengrass, Please Read This
","First off, I'm honestly writing this in the hopes that the director (Paul Greengrass) will read it, so that when he makes the next Bourne movie, he can take it from near-perfect to perfect. The ""spoilers"" that follow are ever so slight and probably not even spoilers (I've tried to be vague and ambiguous), but IMDb's spoiler warning before I submitted this review was stern so I'm erring on the side of caution.<br/><br/>This is a tight, intelligent thriller that maintains symmetry with the original two movies, and we learn some interesting back-story about more than just Bourne (e.g., Nicky, and in fact one key item that changes certain dynamics of the series), which is intriguing and refreshing. I gave it 8 stars. As I submit this, this movie is ranked #55 of all time by IMDb users (I have noticed that IMDb ratings for certain newer films tend to skew higher than they really deserve, probably because a bunch of young fans who've seen movies that cater to them vote for those movies; for example The Simpsons Movie is ranked #231 of all time---I mean *come on*). Seems like a bit of a stretch (action spy thrillers aren't supposed to be in league with Citizen Kane or Casablanca), but all the same when you add up the plot (smart, as I said, which automatically puts you ahead of 90% of the other movies out there), the fact the movie makes you think and draw your own connections about why things are happening the way they are before letting you in on it, the quick pace (I had to leave to use the bathroom and waited a good 15 minutes before I thought it was safe to leave the theater for 60 seconds) and the taut and semi-gritty ""feel,"" you've got a winner. The movie doesn't feel contrived at all, and even though all of the events are improbable, the ""voluntary suspension of disbelief"" (as William Blake would say) is never in doubt, even for these fantastic situations. When all is said and done and you're walking out of the theater, you realize the director didn't assume you were an idiot (didn't lay political moralizing on you too thickly) and yet the outcome of the film and all of the key players is exactly what you would have wanted (with the resolution of a few plot points held back (such as what to make of the back-story we learn about Nicky), which I'm sure are deliberate so that the next movie can develop them.<br/><br/>However, Mr. Greengrass, please cut it out with the unsteady camera already. It's annoying. All right, a little unsteady camera action, particularly during the action scenes, is useful and effective. But the swerving camera at the beginning, for example when Ross is meeting with his source in Turin (hardly an action-centric scene), is just annoying---I felt seasick. Honestly, I thought a nervous 10-year-old kid must have been holding the camera. (Later on, when there's the close-up of Nicky in the hotel room in Tangier, it's unsteady but much less pronounced, and therefore much less annoying.) When your audience starts to notice the camera action instead of the movie itself, you know you've gone overboard. I realize I'm whining here and most people don't care, but it's easy to notice and, once you have, it's hard to ignore. Don't let this detract from the rest of the movie, which is otherwise more or less faultless. I've said what I wanted to say."

Yeah, it's a similar film to it's predecessors but it is as equally entertaining.<br/><br/>Fair enough, it ain't ever gonna win any Oscars but it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Damon does what Damon does and he is ably supported from a decent cast.

","A fantastic conclusion to this trilogy, Matt Damon is back in fine form, no topless scenes though girls and i'm not sure if he looks like the 37 years old his character is meant to be, never mind. Lots of wobble cam moments but I found this only added to the gritty and real nature of the movie. Top notch acting, great country and city scape scenes, and only a couple of unanswered questions left to keep me wanting more Bourne! I'm pleased it starts right where the second ended. I would recommend you watch the second right before you watch this. Bourne, eventually finds out where it all began and faces many challenges along the way. Great chase scenes especially a one on an old rusty motorbike through Tangiers. I hope the film writers, decide to write another even though Robert Ludlum didn't. Matt Damon - what an action man!"
"jai84@yahoo.com","9","1","2","16 August 2007"," Matt Damon shines yet again !!
","The third installment in the Bourne franchise does not disappoint. This is an adrenalin charged actioner (cliche), with very little time spared for any subtle or quiet moments. Even in the talkie parts the director chooses to keep the camera moving unlike the first two.The filmmaker tried to induce a sense of confusion and realism in the frames by constantly keeping the frame on the move and not stagnant at any point for more than 3 seconds. It works well if you sit really far from the big screen and view it .<br/><br/>Coming back to the film, it sets its pace right from the beginning and never lets up. Its a thrill every minute to see Bourne use his skills against the people who trained him to be what he has become.It has enough action and story to keep you engrossed for two hours and the actors wont disappoint you. There are some new faces compared to the last two films but that is not a complaint because very sequel needs new blood to keep it fresh. Matt damon gets full marks for an electric performance and joan allen is her usual best.<br/><br/>If you expect to watch a movie whose main premise is to showcase its incredible chase set pieces, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10."
"mjscarface","9","1","2","16 August 2007"," Superior spy thriller and a great close to an excellent trilogy
","The Bourne trilogy is certain to be considered one of the best ever, especially when compared with the uneven Pirates, Matrix and Spiderman outings. In terms of consistency, Bourne has come up with the goods for all three films, with Ultimatum being a fitting, breathless and stylish conclusion.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous two films however, Ultimatum plunges headlong into the action before the title card even appears. Picking up from where the last film, Supremacy, left off, we follow Bourne as his escapes Moscow and continues to pursue his past. As more detailed flashbacks start to emerge, Bourne gets closer than ever to finding out his origins as an assassin. His first stop is a British reporter who has been getting leaked information on Bourne and various black ops.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is relentless and aside from a scene where Bourne visits his dead girlfriend's brother, there is barely a moment to catch a breath. This is because, once again, the CIA are determined to find Bourne and terminate him at all costs. This time, his journey takes him across four continents with a whole bunch of hit men after him. The action sequences are, once again, fantastic and include a number of brutal punch-ups and a couple of awesome chase sequences.<br/><br/>The story itself is very satisfying, with revelatory moments packing the punch they need. This is helped largely by the late appearance of Albert Finney as Bourne's ""creator"". Matt Damon fits back into the role like a pair of old slippers and there's not one weak link in the chain, with regards to the other actors and the script.<br/><br/>In fact, Ultimatum plays like a greatest hits of the first two Bourne films - not just in terms of action. The score brings together all the music from Identity and Supremacy, while key scenes and lines are recreated. Incidentally, there's also a brilliant moment where the last scene from Supremacy is used (the conversation between Landy and Bourne), which shows that this is a trilogy that rewards those paying attention as well as those in search of a slam-bang chase thriller."
"Jon_Pratt","9","1","2","15 August 2007"," Outstanding
","I have been disappointed with so many films in the last 2- 3 years it is great to watch a film that surpasses expectations, and with Bourne my expectations were already high.<br/><br/>Outstanding in every way: fight sequences, suspense, chases, characters. Yes even cinematography.<br/><br/>Cheesy dialogue is kept to a minimum or even non-existent. Action is gritty and unapologetic. Sentimentality is ignored and characters are developed only as much as they need to be.<br/><br/>All this coupled with spot on pacing makes this one of the best action films ever made. My new favourite trilogy."
"moviewizguy","9","1","2","15 August 2007"," Probably the Best Threequal of this Summer!
","Bourne dodges new, superior assassins as he searches for his unknown past while a government agent tries to track him down. So we're on this last chapter of this trilogy. Last time we saw Bourne, he was mourning over the death of his lover and obsessing over a black-ops program code-named Treadstone. In this film, he's still mourning and still obsessing to find out who he is. Caution for those who are going to see this: Please, go to the bathroom before you watch this film. You may never want to get up again until it ends.<br/><br/>This movie will grab your attention from the beginning and will never let you go until the end. This is a fantastic kinetic spy thriller. You can't help but admit this is one of the few best spy thrillers you've ever seen. There's finally a mature movie not for the teens to go wild on. Like the other two films, this is still intelligent. The action scenes are still relentless. We're still hopping from one country to another. But there are some moments in which is repeats itself from the second film. I'm not giving anything away.<br/><br/>If you've seen interviews from cast members of this movie, they're trying to keep it secretive. By the time you have finished this, you would know why. This third entrance of the series, based on Robert Ludlum's novels, lacks the emotion from the second, replacing with the questions ""Who am I?"" and ""Why am I?"".<br/><br/>Matt Damon' performance is excellent. He seems to suffer without actually doing anything, which is a rare gift for an actor. Other returning cast members are Julia Stiles and Joan Allen, which both give good performances. There are also new cast members, most notably David Strathairn.<br/><br/>With every chase after chase, we get to enjoy Oliver Wood's cinematography, shaking here and there. The scenery from each country is great. The action sequences are terrific that one has no dialog for at least fifteen minutes. Paul Greengrass also proves us once again that he's a great filmmaker. There's also the same score we heard from the second film, which was good.<br/><br/>This film does not drag. The film is gripping and suspenseful all along the way. The sound work is amazingly done with the ear-splitting car accidents and every idea creative. The action is great and you'll get to know everything. So why not watch it? I don't know. Everyone is going to watch it."
"honorhorror","10","1","2","15 August 2007"," Awesome movie with every minute thrilling, and forget about the camera
","First of all, let's just forget about the camera problems that a lot of people mentioned. It is not a big deal at all IMO. The fact is, the movie is directed and shot in its own style through which Greengrass wants to show a cruel and cold, fast-paced thrilling spy-world. For example, the most-criticized shots from behind Damon's shoulder is very intelligent, showing how dirty and miserable Jason Bourne's world is and how dangerous the information Bourne viewed are . I mean, it is deliberately made but not without a point. All the shaking camera scenes are affordable and wouldn't make you puke, unless you've had too much milk in the morning.<br/><br/>I was not a very big fan of Bourne and Damon before. However this movie really made me one. The storytelling is simply clear and dramatic. Only a few filmmakers can make a no-surprising story looks so good on the big screen. The story begins with Damon being chased by Russian policemen, which is just following the climax of Bourne Supremacy, and maybe a little bit confusing at first, but will give you a surprise near the end. In the movie, Jason attempts to save a reporter, a spy-trainer and then an old friend, Nikki. However the harder he tries, the more professional killers are sent after him. Therefore the movie is filled with more actions and chasing scenes than the sum of the last two Bourne films. It will definitely be the most satisfying film by the fans of the genre.<br/><br/>The other thing need to mention is the atmosphere of the movie. As a thriller, the story and the actions just pull up the sense of thrilling to the roof of the theater, where everybody was just stuck and astonished by the movie. Sometimes a little bit dark-humor dialogs are not bad at all. After you watch Bourne being chased for whole 15 minutes, you will find the very human side of the super spy. Seemingly he is an unstoppable killing machine. However if you pay attention to the whole trilogy, you will find Bourne's changing as an unhappy agent who is tired of killing, seeking for a narrower but right way to deal with people even those who will kill him without a second's hesitation. In Identity, he killed almost everyone who is sent to hunt him. In supremacy, he let go of the killer of his loved one, after finding him bleeding in a crashed car. In Ultimatum, you will be amused by the effect of this trend. The camera intentionally focuses on Bourne's face from time to time, showing his nervous, assertive, tough yet desperate, sad expressions. Meeting his victims' family means torture to him. The families simply presume him to be some sort of monster from another world, fearing him in every movement. However the sorrow deep inside Bourne helps compromising between them as weak humans more than enraged people with vendettas. This theme is emphasized in the second movie and becomes even more important in Ultimatum.<br/><br/>There are so much to say about it. But I have to stop before speaking too much to spoil your appetite. In short, welcome back Bourne.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 (to remember, this is the first 10 I gave in 3 months,and I've voted 644 titles on IMDb already)"

","The Bourne Ultimatum reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>The auditorium in which I screened The Bourne Ultimatum was filled to capacity and humming comfortably with the floating refreshment of air conditioning when I took my seat. By the film's end, the theatre was still full to capacity but the room's temperature had risen several uncomfortable degrees. The air conditioning was furiously rattling, expelling refrigerated air as efficiently as possible, but it couldn't keep up with the perspiration-inducing intensity that the film had caused our heart-rates to rise to. The film had indirectly made the room hotter. Talk about global warming. <br/><br/>Stoic, solemn, and robotic, Jason Bourne returns for his trilogy capper, The Bourne Ultimatum. Less of a continuation and more of an upgrade from The Bourne Supremacy, this third installment, working off of Robert Ludlum's source material again, invents new memories for the amnesiac hero to remember. What used to be Operation Treadstone has now been upgraded to Operation Blackbriar and Mr. Bourne was (of course) involved with it in some corner of his blurry past. <br/><br/>As Ultimatum picks up almost immediately after Supremacy left off, Jason Bourne is still on the run, hurdling cops like leapfrog and outrunning the CIA like they were a pack of blind, one-legged cats. Falling in beside the defensive, calculating Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) as the CIA's resident Bourne expert is Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosen heads up the Blackbriar gang and has hooked a reporter, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), whose exposure stories on Bourne have uncovered confidential information. Because the information concerns Bourne's past and because it's a matter of national security, Ms. Landy, Mr. Vosen, and Mr. Bourne are all on his trail. <br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) wastes zero time in mining the action from this storyline. As a filmmaker, his edit points are quick, his camera shaky, and his close-ups constant. He wants realism and he wants his action to appear in real-time. The pseudo-documentary style he's becoming known for is at its best here, muting the spectacle of his stunts to make room for believability in the play-pretend realism. And since it appears many of his stunts were actually coordinated on setand not in front of a computer monitorthe realism is certainly accepted as, well, real. <br/><br/>For this reason, The Bourne Ultimatum sprints as a missile for the moon. It's fast and sometimes infuriatingly so, as it rounds plot corners at double-time, leaving us confused and choking on its dust. But all is forgiven when a clever foot-chase is launched, when Bourne kicks down the clutch of a motorcycle, as he hijacks an NYPD squad car, as he leaps from a roof, etc, etc. Luckily his stunts are as loud as they are intelligent. And since Bourne stays generally low-tech with his tricks, he becomes a sort of spy-version of MacGyver. <br/><br/>Though I'm not positive as to how essential this installment is to the Bourne legacy. CIA Director Ezra Kramer is discussing the Bourne subject with Ms. Landy early on in the story. Both are unsure of Bourne's importance to the agency, weighing out the possibility of giving up the search altogether. Landy mentions that maybe he's not involved with this particular quarrel at all; that this isn't Bourne's fight. Kramer shrugs, frowns, and says, ""Well, let's keep looking."" It seems even the fictional players are stretching their connection to Bourne to keep this story chugging. And it's true; the Bourne legacy doesn't require this story to be told. This becomes apparent when the same good joke from the second film is repeated twice more in the third; and also when the action set-pieces are nearly the same, if not extended to a more satisfying length. Like I said, this is more of an upgrade than a sequel.<br/><br/>But don't think I'm complaining. The intelligence of the screenplay is a damned marvel. To craft the delicate logic of such a complex CIA tale deserves a merit on its own. And so what if it's a formula their running through the Hollywood factory for another go-round? The last film was the best spy film in ages. Just imagine how good this upgraded version is. And technically The Bourne Ultimatum does have its own (very valid) storyline that jet-sets Jason from Morocco to Paris to London to Madrid and finally to good ole' Manhattan. And though what character building that's continued here may not be required viewing for any Bourne enthusiast, the power that David Strathairn most certainly is. Skeletal and sever, Strathairn's Noah Vosen is a formidable needle of a villain. He's human, as all CIA leaders claim to be, but that trait is buried beneath a permafrost mounted by his overwhelming coldness. Strathairn drives this storyline into a realm of quasi-originality, making The Bourne Ultimatum relevant enough for us to enjoy it unabashedly. Because of him we swallow again the tired conceit of Bourne's lost memory and his lingering guilt. We admit that, yeah, this truly is a magnificent flick. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"
"shiftyeyeddog","7","1","2","13 August 2007"," An exciting movie... that we've already seen twice
","If the Bourne Ultimatum was just a single film, it would rate higher. But as the third in the series, it loses a little something, because all three of these movies are essentially the same film just rehashed again and again. They just add a new main villain, plug in a different ""asset"" for him to have his climactic one-on-one hand-to-hand combat with, and give it a new title.<br/><br/>Is the movie exciting? Affirmative. Great performances from a stellar cast? Definitely. Is the story interesting? Yes. ...BUT... the three movies could easily have been condensed to one film. Each of the Bourne films is essentially a two-hour chase scene... which CAN work as a movie. Think of The Fugitive. GREAT film. But now think if you took The Fugitive and stretched it out over three (or more) movies. It would just be too much. A lot of filler and repetitiveness. Now you get my point.<br/><br/>I also had to deduct a point based on the ending of the film. It seemed they were going to finally bring the story to a close and tie up all the loose ends. But no, they had to leave themselves one of the villains as a loophole should they decide to make yet ANOTHER Bourne flick. Ultimatum would have been far more satisfying had they properly wrapped up the whole story, especially considering any books after this one were just cash-ins done by someone else rather than Ludlum himself."
"jflxster","10","1","2","12 August 2007"," Pretty Good but not a ""Top 250""....
","I saw this on Saturday in a full house of Bourne enthusiasts and I have to say that the first 30-45 minutes had me enthralled. The story was compelling, acting was great, and the camera was alive in a way that really drew me into the story.<br/><br/>Somewhere about half-way through it, though, it began to get repetitive and the bond that had developed between me and the movie was broken, and I found myself thinking, and questioning some of the logic and ""tradecraft"". Now these are small things but I'm going to mention them here because eventually they became problematic for me.<br/><br/>First of all -- major plot point -- after the car bomb Jason Bourne goes to New York because in the wreckage of the dead guy's briefcase he sees a scrap of a top secret cover sheet of a ""Blackbriar"" file that has the actual address of the ""deep cover"" CIA NY Anti-terrorism unit on it. Guys, I've got to tell you -- no way. <br/><br/>Secondly, when Nikki Sparrow comes into the Madrid sub-office Noah and company KNOW there are two dead or unconscious bodies there, minimum, and Jason Bourne somewhere in the area. Yet when he does the ""authentication"" question: ""are you okay"" and she has a choice ""ruby"" meaning ""I'm under duress"" or ""everest"", I'm okay -- it's silly that she says ""everest"" and they just accept it. A), Bourne would understand and they would know he understands the drill, B), whether Bourne is there or not, it's certainly not a normal situation. This goes on a bit as they, after this scene, just ignore Nikki and leave her with access to all systems even though they would have to be very concerned that she's not controlled any more.<br/><br/>Thirdly -- I'm no CIA specialist but over the years one thing that is clear is that the CIA doesn't put sensitive offices on the outside of buildings in Manhattan where there is line of sight into the offices. Yet in this movie (and all the Bourne movies), he always manages to get on a roof across the street and can look right into Pam Landy's office (or Noah's). This is great dramatically but I think it would work better if the film-makers made it the way it really is -- with sensitive offices being buried deep within the bowels of a building (particularly if it's a city building) rather than on the perimeter. <br/><br/>Anyway -- my point is not so much to take issue with the film-makers on these points, but rather to illustrate that the repetitiveness caused my mind to wander into these areas rather than stay locked in the story."

","When virtually every trilogy ending film of 2007 has proved to be an assault on the stupidity of its viewers, there doesn't seem to be much hope for the rest of the pack. For surely if the blockbusters of Spider-man, Shrek and Pirates fail us, who won't? Well, the answer to that question has finally arrived, and it comes in the explosive manner of Jason Bourne. <br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum, a direct sequel to The Bourne Supremacy, continues Jason Bourne's (Matt Damon) search for his original identity before he became the hardened assassin he is. He is forced out of hiding when he believes a journalist, named Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), will be able to help him with his search. Bourne learns new information about himself and the organization which trained him, Treadstone. Yet hot on his trail is Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), a government official bent on eliminating Bourne at all costs. <br/><br/>The story within The Bourne Ultimatum, is actually quite accessible by those who did not watch the previous two incarnations. While the film does only make very brief hints to the previous films, it is essentially it's own unique story while continuing where it's prequel left off. It should be noted that the story is not in taking with the novel of which it is adapted. Of course, those who are viewing The Bourne Ultimatum as the first in the trilogy, will be lost to little details, and even a scene which shares similarities with the previous installment. But as both a continuation and a new story, the Bourne Ultimatum is smart with its direction. It is effectively a cat-and-mouse affair with little bits of information cropping up over the course of the film. The story never gets complicated by trying to confuse the viewer, but there is still a strength of complexity not only in regards to the story, but the characters themselves who are major to the events that unfold. <br/><br/>A distinct feature of The Bourne Ultimatum is the complete synthesis of story with action. From the get go, there is never a scene which lacks intensity and most of these scenes are therefore naturally action orientated. But while the drama situations don't have as much screen time, it is an exceptional feat by director, Paul Greengrass, to be able to make every scene feel so important to story advancement, character development, and pure excitement. The action is adrenaline pumping, with some well captured cinematography in the field of close quarters fighting, and are easily amongst the best seen in recent times. And thankfully the car sequences follow suite, with some ferocious driving skills.<br/><br/>Of course all this action and story is only possible due to a commendable cast, who, for the most part, capture their respective characters with lifelike appeal. Most commendable is Vosen who comes across as ruthlessly cold, and willing to make sure that his position as a government official is not jeopardized. While not having the same presence as Vosen, Joan Allen is nonetheless vital as her portrayal of Pamela Landy, who is still willing to be of help to Bourne. The former contact of Bourne's, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), also features but Stiles, like Considine, have too little screen time to be of any acting importance. The most interesting actor, is none other then Damon himself. The character of Jason Bourne never comes across as a challenging role through the film, but there is a certain melancholic particularity that Damon brings to the character of Bourne, and you can't help but feel the determination he has in his actions.<br/><br/>Though it must be said that The Bourne Ultimatum, like it's protagonist, is not free from harm. The amazingly gifted director, Paul Greengrass, utilizes a shaking camera technique. Now for the most part this works, and it greatly emphasizes the fast paced decision making and intensity of the film, but it gets used throughout and can become a bit much after a while. The problems lies in the fact that viewers are never given a time to take in the many scenes, and just relax for a minute or two before the film kicks right back in to some more action. <br/><br/>The film contains no sex or nudity, but there is a minor use of language, most notably blasphemy. The film does contain a high number of violent situations, ranging from shooting and hand-to-hand combat to car chases. While the violence contains little blood, it can be seen to be too intense for younger children. <br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a rare breed of action thriller films: it's constantly action packed, always story driven, never without intrigue, and a very fun watch with a coolness factor that surpasses even the likes of Steve McQueen himself. It's sad to have to say that its ultimateness has to be barred by a constant shaking camera, but even with that, the final Bourne film is easily one of the best in cinema today.<br/><br/>--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---"

","Jason Bourne now is one of my heroes. I am absolutely moved and amazed by this third masterpiece. Is now a perfect trilogy. Who would have thought that the very first ""Jason Bourne"" identity would have become one of the best trilogy I have ever seen. And probably not just in my opinion. This movie couldn't be better. From the incredible action to the emotional, this movie reaches almost perfection. After the two amazing ""Bourne"" movies, I had heard a rumor, just right after the second one, about the making of a third Bourne movie. So, after waiting a very long time I went to the theater with obviously some very high expectations. Well, the scenes and the story, they were all filled with an extreme even surprisingly excitement. Something like, ""I can't leave my eyes from the screen"" kind of movie, including screenplay, photography and the whole film altogether. This makes it as one of the year's best and personally one of my top. Go see it, you won't be disappointed even if you don't like the genre. -Alessio-"

And now, with the release of the Bourne Ultimatum, it has been confirmed that Matt Damon has taken a name and turned it into an unforgettable phenomenon. The Bourne Ultimatum not only exceeds its predecessors, but it also makes an attempt to be considered the best action movie ever made.

","Excellent storyline and tie ins from the second movie, show the subtle genius of the best Bourne at least since the first! There is a really great story and plot line and tons of excellent martial arts and car chase scenes. By the way, this should not be the last Bourne, since a forth book by Ludlum, reveals all and shows why the spy chose to become what he became; from what I've heard, it is the best of them all. There is a possibility that there will be one more movie, but who knows, I hope so. Matt Damon does a great job a the tortured super spy who finally comes in from the cold...or does he; the viewer must determine that.

It doesn't over-do anything, keeping it believable but unbelievable at the same time if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass directs with precision while the quick-cuts and flash cinematography only enhance the intensity of the car chases and fist fights, Matt Damon is excellent in the role and the supporting cast plays there part to a tee.<br/><br/>If this is the last of the Bourne Franchise they went out on top because this is not only the best of the trilogy, it's the best action movie of 2007 period."
"mOVIemAN56","7","1","2","9 August 2007"," Very good. I wasn't as impressed as most people but I still liked it
","I thoroughly enjoyed the third installment of the Bourne films. Most people I know who have seen it are praising it as one of the best action flicks of the summer and they are correct. This puts most other action films in the past few years to shame. It's a great action film that is very well thought out. It's enjoyable to watch, very entertaining, and completes a story most of us have been following the past 5 years. Beside that I didn't find anything that special about the Bourne Ultimatum beside that is was a way better action flick then what usually comes out nowadays and it was a bit smarter then most.<br/><br/>The film completes the Jason Bourne saga. Yet again Jason Bourne, who continues to suffer from a case of amnesia, travels across Europe and the United States, trying to evade CIA agents who want him dead, in a quest to discover who he is and what his past is. Along the way he is helped by a former colleague, Nicky Parsons, and gains a very unexpected ally. The Bourne Ultimatum jumps around like both other films taking us to various locations throughout the course of the film.<br/><br/>Yet again the Bourne films do not disappoint. Ultimatum has the same great action sequences that its two predecessors had. No one will be disappointed by the flash it brings to the screen. The story is again very good though I won't say it is as good as The Bourne Identity in terms of script. A few things didn't work for me plot wise but most weren't too major of problems. The cinematography is done wonderfully, the dialog is well written, and the interaction between actors is very good.<br/><br/>Matt Damon, yet again, gives a great performance as the amnesiac Jason Bourne. He brings out all of Bourne's traits: very very smart, strong, good fighter, and above all, without a clue on his past. What I was glad didn't happen is at the end when Bourne learns about his past Damon didn't have his character break down crying or anything. I don't know if this was Greengrass's choice or Damon's but thank God that he didn't start crying. One thing about Bourne that makes him so interesting is his lack of emotion toward almost everything.<br/><br/>A few problems I had with the film. First off, someone has got to show Greengrass how to work a tripod. The film is WAY to shaky at unnecessary points. I can understand during a chase or fight sequence but when a character is meeting another in a café and the camera is swinging wildly it was too much. I know the director is trying to make us feel as if we are there but it was totally unnecessary to have the camera moving so much. Second, lack of buildup. There is practically no build up to the end. Something happens then it is over. The movie is well paced then at the end everything seems to get rushed as all lose ends are tied up. I was a bit disappointed with that.<br/><br/>Everyone should go see The Bourne Ultimatum if they want to see it. One may use the excuse that not seeing the previous two films may make things almost impossible to understand in the third installment. My brother had not seen the middle film and still understood everything that was going on. It is very easy to follow though I do suggest you watch the first. Pretty much an amnesiac being chased by the CIA for reasons unknown as he tries to discover his identity. It has some great action scenes, a great story, and some great characters (with great acting behind them). Highly recommended.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars"
"DICK STEEL","10","1","2","9 August 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Bourne Ultimatum
","Move aside Transformers. Retire John McClane. Matt Damon is back as the best of the best prototype secret agent-assassin Jason Bourne, and his Ultimatum wins the best action movie of the summer, hands down and without a single thread of doubt! Loosely based on the Robert Ludlum novels of the same name, the movie version starring Damon in the titular role, have already established itself as serious, slick, and got almost everything right in the spy movie genre. It owned James Bond, and in my opinion, possibly one of the best franchises out there.<br/><br/>Though the poster of the movie had Damon in a pose resembling Mark Wahlberg, the Bourne series is clearly the movies that boosted Damon's bankability as an A-list star, as we follow with much interest how Jason Bourne suffers from amnesia from Identity, to being hunted down and out for personal revenge in Supremacy, before coming back home to discover the background and truth of his identity in Ultimatum, which for some parts, had Wolverine styled flashbacks into a highly top secret project within the depths of the CIA.<br/><br/>In this cat and mouse game, he becomes both the hunter and the hunted, interchanging between the roles as he tries to outwit the slew of assassins coming after him, since he's accused of committing treason and being the source of a leak. He's been on the run for three years, and there's no letting up, no thanks to Noah Vosen (David Strathaim) from the CIA, out for his blood, and who reports to someone who might hold the key to Bourne's own past. It's suspenseful action from the get go all the way to the end, and once it grips you, there's no letting go. The adrenaline you get from watching Ultimatum, is simply an indescribable feeling of joy for any action junkie out there.<br/><br/>With tight links to the earlier movies, it pays if you have watched them prior to this, as Bourne maneuvers his way to find out who he is, and at the same time, build on the trust already established with his previous hunter Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who becomes his off the record source of help from the inside. Julia Stiles returns too as Nicky Parsons, and fans of Stiles will be glad with her slightly expanded role here providing that tinge of sexual tension between herself and Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>The action scenes marked a slight departure from its predecessors, but for the better. The close quartered fisticuffs combat in the earlier movies have rather been quite a hallmark, as Bourne dispatches his opponents with hard hitting series of punches and kicks, and contained what is probably more realistic human to human fights which doesn't seem choreographed given its realism. But having too much of a good thing becomes a repetitive bore, and thankfully, such scenes are kept short and sharp, and few and far between. What is excellent here, is how Bourne utilizes more of his smarts to outwit, outplay and outlast his opponents, and those sequences in England and New York are testament to that - smart, adrenaline pumping, thrilling, and at the end of it, you can't help but to cheer!<br/><br/>Like any self-respecting spy movie, Ultimatum had its fair share of jetsetting locations in Europe clocking up frequent flyer miles. Nothing beats having to go to new location after new location where the story takes you, and being a man on the run, this is but part of standard protocol. And the movie can't be complete without the complimentary car chase sequence, and this Paul Greengrass directed installment could possibly have one of the best I've seen in re cent years, with the car as a battering ram, and everything going boom and bang right at your face, directly to the camera. I reckon if watch on the IMAX, you'll probably start to cower and shield yourself from the flying debris.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a winner, and a fine wrap up of the franchise should it choose to end at this point. Besides the ending of Smokin Aces, the ending here will also be one of my personal favourites, as it cunningly showed everything coming to full circle, and with Moby's Extreme Ways, the theme song used in all the Damon-Bourne movies, comes blaring through the speakers, it's just plain sweetness..."

"MaxBorg89","10","1","2","9 August 2007"," Ultimatum is the ultimate spy story: the year's most satisfying thriller
","In 2002, The Bourne Identity gave the action/thriller genre the shot in the arm it so desperately needed. In 2004, The Bourne Supremacy improved on that, standing out as one of the boldest, most interesting spy films ever made. And now, with The Bourne Ultimatum, the year's best threequel, the trilogy ends triumphantly.<br/><br/>Set six weeks after the Moscow showdown at the end of Supremacy (the final scene, where the amnesiac hit-man learns some vital information, is actually part of Ultimatum's narrative), the film shows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the run once again: even though he contributed to bringing down double agent Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), the CIA director is still convinced he is a threat, with only Pamela Landy thinking otherwise. Things don't get much better when a British reporter (Paddy Considine) writes an article about Bourne and several illegal operations, prompting counter-terror officer Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) to initiate a manhunt that will take the hero (and the viewer) across the globe and closer to the truth, as Bourne starts to remember things and realizes his only choice is to find out the definitive truth about his mysterious past.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert cleverly pointed out that in five years and three movies the quest for the truth has almost become, like Hitchcock would say, a MacGuffin, an excuse for the protagonist to run for his life and kick villainous butt in increasingly breathtaking set-pieces. He has a point, as director Paul Greengrass, whose hand-held, edgy approach made The Bourne Supremacy a unique summer blockbuster, ensures the adrenaline level stays sky-high for the entire duration of the film: The Bourne Ultimatum has more action than the first two movies combined, 75% of the picture containing the most inventive chases or fights (hardback book as a weapon, anyone?) since, well, the previous Bourne outing, and it is a real pleasure to watch Damon, who now wears the role as if it were a tailored suit, take the character to new extremes.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean the plot is sacrificed in favor of the style, though: the script is solid and intelligent, the traditional intrigue element being treated in a new way and allowing Damon's co-stars (the ambiguous Strathairn and scene-stealing Albert Finney most of all) to play their parts in a three-dimensional way that is unheard of in most action flicks. Heck, the movie is even audacious enough to reuse the second film's ending and give it a whole new meaning, proving once again the Bourne franchise is a lot of steps ahead of average genre pictures.<br/><br/>And that's without mentioning the brilliant conclusion: having revealed only what is strictly necessary, Greengrass exposes all his genius in the last images which, while hinting at a possible Bourne Legacy (unlikely, but possible), represent the perfect closure of a series that has raised the bar for action films for many years to come."
"drew-carmony","10","1","2","8 August 2007"," Perfect. The Best in the Series
","In a summer filled to the brim with threequels, none have managed to tie up a trilogy as well as The Bourne Ultimatum. A big fan of the series, I had high hopes for this movie. Not only did it surpass all my expectations, it raised the bar for what I expect from action films, as well as all films in general. This engaging, well-developed script is brought to life and taken to an all new level with the brilliant cast. It should come as no surprise to Bourne fans, who have seen Matt Damon play Bourne with incomparable depth and complexity throughout the series, that it is his performance that not only carries this film but launches it into the stratosphere. In my humble opinion, he deserves (Dare I say it?) an Oscar nomination for his portrayal, but perhaps that is just wishful thinking. He's had me so convinced that he is Bourne that I have had to check the database to make sure his name is really Matt Damon. Outstanding. Don't even get me started on the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Of course, what is an action movie without...well...action? This is far and away the best of the series in terms of cinematography and choreography. I was ready to jump out of my seat throughout the movie. Truly some of the best action I've seen in a film to date.<br/><br/>I left The Bourne Ultimatum with a smile on my face and I have not been this enthusiastic about a movie's quality in quite some time. I recommend those who haven't seen the first two to view them before jumping in, but you don't have to be a fan to appreciate this action masterpiece. Perfect."
"coldcipher99","10","1","2","7 August 2007"," Gripping fast the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" never lets go until the very satisfying end.
","I never thought I would run across a spy movie that would earn a perfect ten. The ""Bourne Identity"", ""Bourne Supremacy"" and ""Bourne Ultimatum"" are perfect examples of NON-Campy spy movies that the public has starved for since the deterioration of the Double 07's. Given, ""Casino Royale"" established a new look-Bond, there was still the womanizing agent who had a defibrillator in his car. Congratulations on the more realistic approach Martin Campbell brought as director of ""Casino Royale"".<br/><br/>Realism is what brings Bourne into the spotlight and keeps the taught storyline, pulsating pace and very well developed characters into very symmetrical movie that is hard to keep your eyes off of. You can relate in so many ways to Bourne's struggle for meaning and the struggle of CIA agents who are conflicted in doing what is right versus what they feel is their duty.<br/><br/>It was also a classic depiction of a government agency fitting a persona that America believes it to be, an agency with no regret and hardly any regulation.<br/><br/>Revelations are abound in this movie and a perfect well-scripted and storyboarded movie it is to the most. A perfect end, or maybe not, to a trilogy that deserves praise and all the money it would make at the box office.<br/><br/>As for the steady camera effects or lack there of, it wasn't to where I couldn't distinguish what was going on, I just had to pay closer attention. I was drawn in more and that was the intended effect.<br/><br/>Wonderful Movie."
"3xHCCH","9","1","2","7 August 2007"," Action-PACKED!!!
","This is one of those rare third episodes that really lives up to the first two. Very very good indeed! The action begins even before the beginning credits. Then, throughout the movie, this action is relentless. Those motorcycle and foot chase scenes in streets and houses of Tangiers and the car chase scenes on the streets of New York City are really editing masterpieces. Very exciting! The direction of Paul Greengrass does not disappoint. It was breathtaking. All the scenes are important. There is no wasted time.<br/><br/>As with the first two installments, there is very little downtime in this. In fact, the downtime is very similar to the first two, where Bourne is in the company of a female, and washes up.<br/><br/>Honestly, during the first Bourne movie, ""The Bourne Identity"", I did not think that Matt Damon would be a good action star. In fact, I believe I did not watch that one until I watched and was very impressed with the second installment ""The Bourne Supremacy"". Matt is really very good and convincing as Bourne, in all three. In this one, the drama was more intense as Bourne comes into information that leads him from Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangiers, and New York, back to the very facility where his new violent life began. Matt's talents as a dramatic actor balances perfectly with his physical prowess in the amazing stunts.<br/><br/>I think this is really a great action and espionage trilogy I would probably watch all over again, together, one day. While the trajectory of Bourne's character arc is clear to me, I would like to note more the other characters, like those of Joan Allen and Julia Stiles, who played important roles and character development in all three movies."
"ericjams","8","1","2","7 August 2007"," Gripping, Heart Pounding, Intensity. . . and StoryLine almost keeps up.
","The Bourne Trilogy having the benefit of Ultimatum as its closer serves up one of the best modern trilogies. The cat and mouse tactics between Jason and his pursuers is what makes the final segment of this trilogy a required viewing. These scenes are at first compressed into a majority of the first 40 minutes. The beauty of these scenes is that they simply take human nature and inject the highest level of awareness, reflex, and intuition. Its not as though Bourne's act is believable, but its not unbelievable either. The movie eventually tries to down shift, but even in the scenes of circumspection where characters try to process and react to the last crazy action sequence, intensity is rarely if ever lost. Bourne is so fluent in the language of covert tactics that we see notions of evasion, manipulation, and anticipation taken to the highest level. Of course, Bourne's efforts, while amazing are stunningly short lived, equally cool is the way Greengrass portrays the CIA as momentarily hoodwinked, but back on the trail within seconds. Greengrass, the director deserves accolades for his use of the hand-held cameras that give the footage a ""live"" type of feel, and implant the moviegoer into multiple P.O.V's in split second takes. I know this was done in Supremacy, but Greengrass has clearly mastered his own technique, and the manner these scenes are shot in differentiates the movie from your run of the mill action genre. <br/><br/>With the movie taking a running start, filled with action sequences, its noticeable that the actual plot lines were never the bread and butter to this movie. Unlike in Identity""where the omnipresent theme of amnesia acted so as to give Damon a boyish innocence/experience identity crisis, and made his romance and battle with the CIA emotionally significant. Ultimatum is more similar to Supremacy in that the plot is now a more bright line ""search for the answer to who I am, and who is to blame"" theme. Bourne finds some answers which do infuse some emotional depth into the robotic plot, but it just seems watching Bourne deconstruct scene after scene of entrapment is more robotic, because we know Bourne, and expect as much. Additionally, as Bourne learns more about himself, the mystery of who he is, and the impact this had on Bourne in the earlier parts of the trilogy vanishes.<br/><br/>Lastly, Ultimatum provides a fissure within the CIA in how to handle Bourne. We all know that Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) appears sympathetic to his plight, but now we see Noah Vosen (David Straitham) who is sympathetic to the CIA's plight in keeping secret the truth about Bourne and the program that trains/creates similar black ops. If Landy can see a shade or two of gray, Vosen sees only black and white. This allows for the final match point to develop, in a mad dash through Manhattan. Through all of the location shifts, and cat and mouse games, I think the actual plot and dialogue falter at times, perhaps only because they wind up being truly secondary instruments as compared to the cinematography/action sequencing. I wont hold that against the movie, I still think its top flight cinema that far far surpasses the vast majority of modern day action/thriller movies."
"druss44121-1","8","1","2","6 August 2007"," I'll avoid saying anything silly like ""The Ultimate Bourne!""
","In this film Bourne chases and is chased, and sometimes both happen at the same time. It all becomes twisted yet it never loses a basic simplicity that keeps us involved.<br/><br/>There are some great additions to the cast, including Albert Finney, Scott Glenn and David Strathairn (he was Edward R. Murrow in Good Night, and Good Luck.) The acting has been strong in the entire series, and it's great to see the ""evil higher-ups"" not spitting and screaming at each other but talking calmly and realistically, their menace more believable. Then when they do yell, it actually means something.<br/><br/>There is also a great twist that puts this movie into chronological perspective with the second film.<br/><br/>It is further proof of great directing and writing that the same scene with the same dialogue can have two completely different emotional meanings when spun in different ways. Really connecting this film to The Bourne Supremacy, this further stressed that this is one story told over multiple films. It does that trick better than many sequels nowadays shot back-to-back.<br/><br/>Also, Bourne's connection to a character with a small role in the previous two films is given new meaning that easily could have become silly and cliché. Instead, it really works and actually gives an extra layer of substance to Bourne and to the people helping him on his dangerous journey to self-discovery.<br/><br/>That's why the film works, because it has real characters who aren't idiots.<br/><br/>Still, the action does not disappoint.<br/><br/>In fact, what makes the action so successful is that there is a sense that it is captured rather than created.<br/><br/>I'd say the style most reminds me of the television show The Shield, which also uses a lot of hand-held camera work and zooms, sometimes shifting out of focus as if it were documenting real events unraveling at breakneck speed before an audience.<br/><br/>It's a style that has gotten Greengrass notice since his 2002 film Bloody Sunday.<br/><br/>It's also a style that could get tiresome, but Greengrass doesn't keep everything at ""11."" Although the hand-held is a constant, there are different degrees to how the shots are framed and, especially, how they are edited together. There is a dramatic curve to the writing, directing, and editing, which creates room for slower scenes that aren't about running around on roof tops.<br/><br/>The second film got a lot of complaints for its use of ""shaky cam."" It never bothered me that much, but I do think Greengrass has gotten better at his style. He perfected it with last years United 93.<br/><br/>He brings what he has learned to the table here. Even a few shots in The Bourne Ultimatum are completely breathtaking and memorable. One involves a dive into a river, and another is that money-shot from all the trailers of Bourne as he jumps in mid-air through a window. And you can feel the crunch of the metal against the hard road in the New York City car chase.<br/><br/>Yet, the directing is never about just one shot but about how they all connect together. I think this is what helps Paul Greengrass stand out as a director, as in some ways he is almost like a modern (and non-communist) Sergei Eisenstein.<br/><br/>The editors know exactly how to cut the shots together in a rhythmic, almost musical way.<br/><br/>One example involves a codeword which we see on a computer screen. At a different location, a character answers when asked for the codeword but does not give the same one. You're confused for a split-second, and then back on the screen another word is revealed with a different meaning.<br/><br/>This all happens in about three seconds, and the entire film is directed and edited with this care, always keeping a sense of mystery and spontaneity. When characters make choices, we feel there are literally making those decisions on screen.<br/><br/>And the credit really goes to everyone who made this film.<br/><br/>The music is fantastic, and the best in the series. It really sets the mood without devolving into cliché, and there is some surprising orchestral work.<br/><br/>The writing especially stands out for delivering a script that escapes a lot of its genre confines. In a way The Bourne Ultimatum becomes the ultimate character driven action film.<br/><br/>The flashback scenes are a bit too formula ""streaky lights"" and ""jerky slow motion."" I think it would have been more original and effective if a different film stock were used, perhaps 16mm with a different range of colors to more subtly reveal these important moments. Some very important moments happen during the flashbacks, too.<br/><br/>Also, after one particular crash Jason Bourne only has a few bruises on his face. Although in all the movies there are unrealistic moments, everything is still fairly grounded to Earth. This one has the most ""superman"" elements of any of them, and though the majority of it all fits for the filmic world created it would have been nice to see him a bit more beat up at the end, kinda like how he was bloodied and limping at the end of The Bourne Supremacy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, one could argue that the revelations behind Bourne's past aren't exactly earth shattering, but the series as a whole has always been more about the journey than the destination. I would argue, as well, that the real twists are more character based than narrative based.<br/><br/>With these minor details aside, this is easily the best action film of 2007.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum will help solidify the Bourne trilogy as being one of the big movie surprises in recent memory. Who would have guessed five years ago that Jason Bourne would become one of the defining action heroes of the decade, like James Bond of the 60's, John McClane of the 80's and Jack Ryan of the 90's."

","Matt Damon showed why he is regarded as a high quality actor especially in the action genre. Working with the same directer from the previous two ""Bourne"" films Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a Man trying to rediscover his past and what he represents. The film has its usual high in suspense moments which I have to say kept me on the edge of my seat for 92% of the films duration. Im not going to give to much away but it had a thrilling middle an end. The film has similarities to the ""SAW"" trilogy with a whats going to happen next edge to the film.

","I have to say it's been a while since I walked out of a theater wanting to tell everyone how enthused I was about the film I'd just seen. In the case of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", I would especially mention the ultimately satisfying ending, so subtle, yet so satisfying, that Greengrass could accomplish so much in an action film with a simple Mona Lisa-like smile and a limp, submerged body suddenly coming to life. And there are some classic scenes. For me, the scene where Bourne calls Noah Vosen in his car, and the exchange goes something like ""Where are you now?"" ""I'm in my office."" Etc, etc...Priceless. I would also mention the scene in Victoria Station, with the planted cell phone. I thought at times that Noah was almost too evil (did he have a loving wife? Kids? A dog?), and I felt sorry at first for Joan Allen, a superbly talented actress who looked like she was about to become the cold, calculating operative I remember from ""Identity"". (Some posts here may suggest I got that wrong.) Anyway, there's nothing like redemption. And she gets hers, big time. Frankly, it's made me want to watch ""Identity"" again. Not even ""The Godfather, Part III"" accomplished that."

","Great movie! Love the trilogy! Overall the movie would have benefited from more use of a stead-cam. The out-of-focus pieces (shoulders, posts, walls) in the foreground of the shot are real artistic, but get real annoying when it's all filmed with a hand held camera. The fight scenes are pasted together from multiple shots, quick edits, bam, bam, bam, cut here, cut there, then combine that with the shakiness of the hand held and I find it very distracting. I would have much preferred longer scenes, with fewer cuts.<br/><br/>Will be interesting to see if another movie is produced following the Eric van Lustbader continuation of the series.<br/><br/>Krazymann71"

","In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" titular character Jason Bourne (a.k.a. David Webb) has finally elevated ass kicking to an art form. You could say he is the premier artist working in the medium of anal annihilation. He is peerless. Contemporaries such as John McClane and Jack Bauer have made relevant (and to be sure, important) strides in the field. But only Jason Bourne has mastered the rump-rupturing arts. To him, a book is not merely entertainment for a leisurely afternoon at the beach. Nor is a towel simply a convenient drying device. In the supremely talented hands of Jason Bourne these innocuous objects become weapons of ass destruction. It's truly a remarkable sight to behold, and one I encourage you all to witness."

","Bourne returns to the big screen again, and what a treat for cinema goers. The Bourne Identity was an enjoyable movie, yet something seemed lacking. In The Bourne Supremacy, that was redeemed, with high octane car chases, and cleverly choreographed fight scenes. (Pen and newspaper scenes anyone?) The Bourne Ultimatum caps off the trilogy and nicely ties up all lose ends. Bourne's field craft is better than ever, and the fight scenes are simply stunning. One can be guaranteed never to look at familiar household items the same way again. The pace is fast, and had the audience riveted to their seats and cheering Bourne's antics. Go see this movie and you will not be disappointed."

","This is the best action move released in a very long time. I read the reviews here beforehand, complaining about the shaky camera. I was prepared to hate this move because the complaints sounded legitimate and real.<br/><br/>They were wrong. The shaky camera is there, but I found you get used to it after a short time. If you deliberately look for it you will see it, but if you just watch the movie normally its not a factor.<br/><br/>Some of the best action scenes I have seen for many years, especially the fight with the first assassin. Later on there is an incredible car chase that also is awesome.<br/><br/>The movie is almost non-stop action with a story that is simple but well told. Matt Damon is outstanding in the role, and easily outdoes his performance in the first two films.<br/><br/>This was by far the best Bourne movie of the three.<br/><br/>Highly recommended"
"deltajuliet","7","1","2","5 August 2007"," Ultimatum Makes for a Good Action-Thriller
","I enjoyed The Bourne Identity thoroughly, but I was somewhat let down by its sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Now, Supremacy director Paul Greengrass brings us the final film of the trilogy - The Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>Identity was cool because it introduced us to Jason Bourne. There were some great action sequences, notably an apartment fight and a car chase, and it played out like a good espionage/spy/international thriller flick.<br/><br/>The second to me seemed like more of the same. Also, Doug Liman was replaced by Paul Greengrass. I have the utmost respect for Greengrass, but I didn't like all the shakiness utilized in the cinematography that he's kind of known for. Shaky camera is distracting, and why do you want a distraction from a well choreographed fight scene or car chase or whatever? And it didn't seem like all that much had been accomplished - the movie essentially ended where it started.<br/><br/>Then we come to Ultimatum. Greengrass is back for this one, and there's still some of that shaky camera, but it's less distracting than in Supremacy; I think this can be attributed to the fact that there's less of it and that there's more flair in the action scenes. Speaking of action scenes, Ultimatum has one of the best fights I've ever seen. Think of the bathroom brawl at the start of Casino Royale extended for several minutes. It's pretty cool. There's also a decent car chase, ending in a great crash, but it's not as exciting now since these have become typical occurrences in the Bourne movies.<br/><br/>Unlike Supremacy, however, Ultimatum does advance the storyline of the Bourne universe. In fact, the biggest development in the whole trilogy probably happens at the end of this one.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a pretty good summer flick, much more intelligent than the Hollywood fare we've enjoyed thus far, this summer. A little sophistication is nice after the likes of Shrek 3 (ugh), Transformers, and Rise of the Silver Surfer. Still, I think the action could have been a little more streamlined and the whole movie in general a little more enthralling. But I won't complain. It's definitely one of the best movies I've seen this summer, probably even the past couple of summers. Bourne fans won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>I give it a 7.7/10."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","2","5 August 2007"," Bourne Returns Strong
","Matt Damon as Jason Bourne comes home to exact revenge in Paul Greengrass's ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", and it is well worth the wait. Greengrass and screenwriter Tony Gilroy return in this conclusion based on Robert Ludlum's ""Bourne"" trilogy. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a smart intense action packed thrill ride. Matt Damon is powerful as Jason Bourne, the government assassin desperately in search of his past and those who created him. Bourne says, "" and this is where it ends."" Bourne (Damon) escapes termination in Russia, and recalls vestiges of his origin. He tracks down British reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who has written about Bourne and the training program he was a part, to determine who is the source of this information.<br/><br/>This soon leads to a clash with Black Ops director Noah Vosen (the great David Stratharin), who enlists CIA Operations Lead Pamela Landy (smart and sexy Joan Allen) to hunt down Bourne. All is not what it seems; Noah is somehow protecting Director Ezra Kramer (strong Scott Glenn). Noah leads a successor to the Treadstone program that created Jason Bourne (Damon). Pam pleads to Noah that Bourne must be taken alive to resolve this intelligence breach. Ignoring Pam, Noah orders Bourne be killed on sightactivating assassins to kill him. Bourne finds an unlikely ally in Nicky Parson (Julia Stiles, also in the previous movies), who may have had a past relationship with Jason which he does not remember.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Ultimatum"" has one the best fight scenes, ever. The fight with Jason and Desh (Joey Ansah) is brutally electrifying. Renowned stunt choreographer Jeff Imada said that he used kali in the scene. There are also elements of jeet kune do and aikidoand others I don't know. The fight is realistic and exquisitely executed. Ansah is an accomplished martial artist. Damon, who is in great shape, looks amazing in this knock down fight to the death. Aside from the appreciation of the great skill, this is a signature of the story. Bourne is old school. Desh represents the next generation of assassin: young, strong, and merciless. Desh accepts his mission to kill Bourne without question. Bourne on the other hand, is haunted by his past. At one point he confesses to Nicky (Stiles), ""I see all the faces of everyone I killed"" He also accepts that he can never be forgiven for what he has done. This declaration in a sense makes Bourne honorable in this cloak and dagger world.<br/><br/>I agree with Richard Roeper that Matt Damon gives an award worthy performance as Jason Bourne, but that is also unlikely given this is an action movie. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a great action movie, largely due to Damon's performance. Damon is a powerful and physical presence. He eloquently balances the impeccable action scenes with the quiet introspective moments. Joan Allen is great as Pamela Landy. She commands a natural authority and respect, at the same time hinting at a weariness of the cost of freedom in the intelligence war on terror. Allen always brings an acute intelligence and strength that I find so attractive. David Stratharin is masterful in capping Noah's capabilityjust shy of Bourne's. His Noah is the obvious villain of Bourne maintained more as an undercurrent. Stratharin is amazing. Julia Stiles is smart and tough as Nicky; however, she isn't given much noteworthy to do. Here she may just be a pawn of the story.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass (""United 93"") elevates the action movie to another level in ""Ultimatum"". Greengrass blitzes through the story across different countries, eventually concluding the States. His narrative style is focused and coherent throughout, effectively managing the spectacular action scenes along with Gilroy's crisp dialog. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is one of the great action movies, and I would welcome another return of Jason Bourne with Greengrass and Damon."

I'm a big fan of Robert Ludlums writings and wish he was still alive to write more.

They say that the book is always better than the movie, I think it was close to a tie in this case.

"moutonbear25","9","1","2","5 August 2007"," Born to be Bourne
","Central Intelligence agent, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), has found herself once again in a tiny room, surrounded by a team of people, all scrambling to track the notoriously elusive, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). At this stage, bringing Bourne in is not just her job but an obsession, one that has gone far past the point of hunt and capture and developed into a need to understand the man himself. In Paul Greengrass's THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, we are right there with her every step of the way. Only it's a much more enjoyable experience for us than for poor Pam. We have the added advantage of being able to see both sides of this chase from where we sit. From this vantage point, we see the C.I.A. constantly miscalculating Bourne's next move and, in what is perhaps their biggest misconception, mistaking Bourne for some sort of super human, incapable of infallibility. Jason Bourne is just a man. Yes, he's an incredible specimen with quick reflexes, heightened intuition and kick-ass moves but he too is just trying to figure out the mystery of where he came from and who he is. How can the C.I.A. pretend to know Bourne when Bourne does not even know himself? The Bourne paradox is what makes Jason Bourne one of film's mot intriguing action heroes and THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is a perfect answer to years of unanswered questions.<br/><br/>To recap, we first caught a glimpse of Jason Bourne in THE BOURNE IDENTITY (directed by Doug Liman). He had no idea who he was and it was exhilarating to watch him awaken to his special brand of fighting style, while still infuriating to watch his struggle to understand how he came to be so skilled. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY followed with a new director (Greengrass) and a depressing change in tone after the death of his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), at the film's onset. The film could not help but be a more sobering experience after that. THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM changes Bourne's direction from less running away to more running towards. Tying all three films together is the constantly improving performance by Damon as Bourne. Damon brings a sleek brand of class to his characters in most of his films and he treats Bourne with a stealth speed and fiercely internalized stoicism. You might say he was born to play Bourne. His tormented mind has gone from wonder and awe in the unraveling of his rediscovered personality to a dark brooding. He has understood that getting close to others gets them killed and has cut himself off as much as possible to both avoid future tragedy and maintain his focus on the goal. <br/><br/>Another man who found a stronger focus this time around is director, Greengrass. His direction for SUPREMACY was at times difficult to follow. Not only was the story not told as succinctly as in Liman's IDENTITY but Greengrass's now signature extreme-shaky aesthetic and jump-cut obsession made it visually jarring as well. After snagging an Oscar nomination for his direction of UNITED 93 last year, he has learned a stronger command of his unsteady film approach. The result is a visually more engaging experience that ushers in a different kind of American cinema. The British director follows the action through numerous international locations, from running across rooftops and hopping through windows in Tangiers to zipping in and out of the crowds in a busy London bus station. The world flavour only further serves to highlight the film's direct criticism of American home security practices post September 11th. Greengrass's portrayal of the C.I.A. is one hyped up on power and the authority to kill anyone whenever necessary and that power reeks of paranoia. Making the C.I.A. the enemy makes our hero's actions, choosing to spare life whenever possible, all that much more commendable. American cinema that makes Americans look bad is always refreshing. They're not all bad but it's obnoxious to pretend they aren't somewhat bad.<br/><br/>The Bourne series should be commended for successfully accomplishing what so many others have recently failed at. It is a consistently enjoyable trilogy that never takes itself too seriously and has purpose in each installment that justifies the necessity of three films to tell a complete story, rather than just being an excuse to rake in more cash. They are all three intelligent and compelling works, with THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM serving as a smooth, sophisticated closer that is only disappointing because it draws the entire ordeal to a close. I would love to see the series live on but it will lack the one driving force that has made it so compelling for so long now. Now that Jason Bourne knows where it all began, he will no longer be in constant, compulsive pursuit of the ultimate puzzle, understanding himself. Is there any more gripping a pursuit to be had?"
"solip-1","7","1","2","5 August 2007"," Good addition to the series.
","I liked it quite a bit but the camera work that seems like it's in an earthquake is bothersome for me. I didn't care for it in The Bourne Supremacy either. I think the camera work makes the pacing of the movie uneven and, at times, a little hard to follow. There's some good technique brought forward from the previous movies but if there's a fourth one I hope it doesn't become a cliché (like the Bond movies). The Bourne Ultimatum is beginning to get a little that way. The acting is excellent and I'm glad to see that Julia Stiles got more screen time. Her role is a wonderful addition to this movie. This is a great series that I hope, if it continues, doesn't become repetitive in it's presentation."
"arcticlvr1","10","1","2","5 August 2007"," Great finale
","I just saw Bourne 3 and thought it was the best of the series.<br/><br/>The movie ties everything together nicely, and keeps it fast paced with nonstop action. As a spectator of Bourne's life you are taken of a fast paced,<br/><br/>action packed journey through many countries. I love the use of the shaky camera because it is how Bourne would be seeing these countries. He does not have time to look around and enjoy the sites while he is on the run. Also, I like how the movie is tied into the last one of how he got from Russia to the US. Paul Geengrass has stepped up and become one of the best directors out there. Honestly, I would love to see him tackle the horror movie scene. His style of making films would work great in the horror world."
"nyc man","8","1","2","5 August 2007"," The viewing audiences may be below par, but the film's enjoyable
","Okay, folks, I must be one in a thousand, since I was the only one to laugh at a line in the movie ""Bourne Ultimatum"" where a lead character says ""you can't make this stuff up."" In case you don't get the joke, the movie is fiction, so the whole thing is made up. And if you doubt it, then you may believe that George Washington's niece was the first spy for what later became the CIA, and her great-great-grandson George Bush (the father of W.) later became head of the CIA. You know: ""you can't make this stuff up."" <br/><br/>The movie is fun and fast, and visually tough to follow. I agree with the critic (quoted on TV's ""The Daily Show"") who said: ""Will someone tell this director about the steadicam."" The good parts about this film have the characters who are what I wish I could be: smart, athletic, and able to do anything and defeat almost everyone. It does suffer a little bit from what I call the ""Mr. Bond, I'm going to kill you, but first let me show you the la-bore-a-tor-ree."""

The one where nobody in the audience dared to breathe while the fight was in progress. This is the first movie in 44 years where I had that feeling.<br/><br/>Except in this movie there are six or seven sequences that are every bit as exciting as that scene.<br/><br/>Recently, I have seen several attempts to compare Jason Bourne to James Bond, but they always fail because Bourne and Bond are two very different sorts of agents. Bond is suave and sophisticated. Bourne is a finely tuned instrument of death and little more; he is more like Robert Shaw's character than Sean Connery's. Except he is beginning to remember who he was before the government made him that way and he resents it.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this startling and exciting movie."

The nay sayers will say nay, as they have throughout this series, but I suspect that they are opposed to taking pleasure in any film that exists solely for the benefit of entertaining audiences, which the Bourne movies do well, including this one.<br/><br/>Bourne Ultimatum sets off head long into the throws of a story that picks up very shortly after the events of the preceding film's conclusion, which left very few characters to be revisited from the ever dwindling principal cast. Facing new opposition, these are the players which Bourne is forced to rely upon, to complete his self assigned mission, of reaching the source of his search, for the answers to the questions, who is Jason Bourne, & where did he come from? <br/><br/>Does this film contain less overall plot development than its predecessors? Yes, but it is nearly unheard of to be able to claim the opposite, when referring to the third installment in any cinematic series. This is the only verifiable fault of this movie, & it's surely nitpicking too damn the film on that basis alone.<br/><br/>In every other way worth noting, this film is a success. It travels in the directions that were virtually unavoidable, & though Bourne's hunters are no more prepared to face him, than their earlier counterparts, the characters are no less viable, nor are the actors' performances. The suspense continues to be taught, & the action is overwhelming.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is true to the character, as it's become, & the supporting cast manages to deliver, in spite of there being less for them to work with. If this is truly the finale of Jason Bourne, then it does sew things up somewhat neatly, if not much else. I can't say that I'd be completely fulfilled were this to be the last film of the series, but then again there is no guaranteeing that it is.

Alleged super-spy Jason Bourne is apparently the only person in the movie with more than one neuron yet even he (hunted for by the UberCIA) is able to move around the world with ease, avoiding all facial recognition software, making no effort to chance his appearance, or even his clothes. He is also apparently made of titanium as he survives (essentially unscathed) fights, falls, explosions etc that would cripple an entire platoon of Marines. This is not the worst part. The worst part of the film is the utter lack of realism. The CIA conducting black bag ops in the UK without being cleared/found out by MI6?

What, they've had people spanning the globe scanning blueprints of EVERY building? The CIA opens fire on the NYPD? The CIA executes a shoot on site order on US soil, in NYC never the less? This movie took more than a willing suspension of disbelief, it took a lobotomy. The action sequences were nothing special, almost all of it has been seen in other movies. Subpar garbage even for the summer."

","No way this movie is a 8.7/10 as it currently is rated !<br/><br/>I haven't seen the first 2 Bourne movies, I guess there is no point now!<br/><br/>There was unnecessary camera shaking which often made it difficult to see what was going on. Unnecessary lack of realism in several spots distracted from movie, see minor spoiler below.<br/><br/>I didn't really care if any of the characters lived or died. I wanted to leave the theater half-way through and I would have if my friends weren't with me.<br/><br/>Save your $9.50 and go rent ""Casino Royale"" or ""The Good Shepherd"". These movies are way better and also have more realistic ratings.<br/><br/>Minor spoiler follows.<br/><br/>I thought it was stupid that Bourne could hit the acknowledge button on a RAZR cell phone to be able to confirm ""a kill"" in this age of passwords--and don't tell me he just knew the password. I also thought it was stupid that one could just look into a CIA building where classified materials are kept from another skyscraper--that's not how it works folks. Look up SCIF on wikipedia. There ain't no windows. I know there are more such stupid examples, I'm glad I can't remember them!<br/><br/>I thought it was sad that Motorola has bet its future on selling commodity RAZRs, such as the ones seen in this film. Movies already make a bloody fortune, don't need more advertising. Lots of people have been laid off from Motorola, probably should make a movie about that, it would be more interesting than this one."

","I only comment because of it's rating of 8.7. #56 of the top 250??? This is an insult to the 194 movies with a lower rating. The story is not genuine at all. A special agent gets out of control, his agency is out of control too... What else is new? The action scenes could be impressive, but you hardly see what's going on. The pictures are cut in such an swift sequence that you can barely follow with your eyes, let alone your brain. Besides, what is it with this fashion of shaky cameras? Is Parkinson's decease now a condition of employment for camera men. Or are they all alcoholics who didn't get a drink in days?

","I really enjoyed the intelligent characters and plot in The Bourne Identity, but this piece of crap is just destroying everything that was great about the first Bourne movie. It seems like someone has forced 10 monkeys to write an arbitrary story line. It has literally no coherent plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>It is just a long and surprisingly boring series of consecutive man hunts accompanied by ridiculous cliché lines like ""We've got to move!"" and ""They are on the run!"" - and this annoying ""Now-things- are-really-exiting"" music score. News: You can't have peaks, if you try to sell every god damn scene like it was the most exciting clip in the history of movies ... then everything just ends up looking ridiculous! <br/><br/>Insultingly many plot holes, like how CIA is always able to put at least 6 men on rooftops and around in the park in matter of seconds, no matter where on the globe the rendezvous is. And how no one bat an eyelash of a high speed pursuit through close traffic in NY shooting in every direction, and wrecking 100 cars on the way. Are we supposed to believe that that's normal procedure at Langley? Please!<br/><br/>And finally the camera movements - it does not, and will never compensate for a lack of story, to let the movie consist of ½ seconds clips with hand-held camera and poor focus! Most of the man hunt scenes (which is pretty close to 90% of the movie) looks like they were taken with a mobile phone by a jogging cameraman with spastic seizures! That might be fun to play with, as an artistic feature in a Dogme movie - here it just makes the movie almost impossible to watch! :-O"

","The Bourne films reach a devastating climax with this, the final film in the trilogy and also the best alongside SUPREMACY. Directed by Paul Greengrass, fast becoming a favourite with the likes of UNITED 93, as an action film this is as immediate and pulse-pounding as you could wish for. The director brings his trademark shaky-cam to the proceedings, not just in the various action sequences but all the way through the film, and it gives the viewer a kind of gritty realism previously unseen in cinema.<br/><br/>Of course, there's more to enjoy here than just the camera-work; on top of that, we get plenty of fantastic locations around the globe (ranging from London to Tangier, Italy to New York), some top-notch acting work from the cast members – Julia Stiles shines here after appearing somewhat lacklustre in the last two films; Joan Allen is terrific and David Strathairn makes for a superior bad guy. And it's so refreshing to see a film with an intelligent plot for a change – another reason why THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is a far cry from people's usual ideas of what a 'Hollywood blockbuster' is.<br/><br/>As an action thriller, you'd hope for plenty of shooting, fights and chases, and they're here in abundance. The two highlights are the sweaty-palmed chase through the crowded streets (and rooftops) of Tangier, as Bourne faces off against an Arabic assassin in a battle to the death, and the sniper-at-Waterloo sequence which makes for riveting viewing. In between we get our hero battling enemies using his martial arts skills, bombs going off, a car chase and crash (it doesn't top the one at the end of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, but then what could?) and plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout. Cinema really doesn't get any better than this – what a terrific climax to what has become a brilliant series of films!"

","First of all, if your wanting a modern thrilling action film, then your not going to find much anything much better than this. However, if you've watched the first two films which obviously is highly needed if willing to understand the plot, then i would say, depending on your amount of love for the trilogy, that you may find it tedious. In terms of structure and pacing, nothing has changed.<br/><br/>Bourne has flash backs, he needs to expertly endeavour to his final destination by tracking down high associated workers, tapping into phones and of course, eliminating any assassin whom attempts to eliminate Boure. During all this, the men at the top, the one responsible for Bourne's secret mission and memory lost, all sit in their offices, scrutinising the surveillance cameras. Yes, it sounds very much like the first two. Of course i expect some similarities but the whole tracking down Bourne Scernio is becoming tiresome.<br/><br/>I was tensed during the first two films but during the third, i became bored and didn't care to much about the long waited conclusion. When people complain about ""Saw"" being the same thing every film, the same can be said for the Bourne Trilogy.<br/><br/>I respect the story, it a fantastic story but the delivery is lazy. Thank God the story is excellent or i would of fallen asleep."

"John_Truby","9","1","3","7 January 2010"," A textbook example: Writing the action film
","The Bourne Ultimatum is the best action film of 2008 and is a textbook case for how to write in this very popular form. Let's look at just a few of the techniques writers Tony Gilroy, Scott Burns, and George Nolfi use.<br/><br/>The first element that stands out in The Bourne Ultimatum is the hero's strong need. Need is the one of the seven major structure steps in any good story, and yet it is missing from most action films, where the hero is a paragon of virtue or a superhero. Thatâs a huge mistake, because need is what makes the story matter. Itâs personal, to the hero and to the audience. Need is what unifies a story under the surface, so the action film becomes more than just a series of stunts.<br/><br/>In The Bourne Ultimatum, the hero, Jason Bourne, has both a psychological and a moral need. Psychologically, he must figure out who he is. Morally, he feels deep guilt about all the people he has killed and must try to make amends. The psychological need has been present from the first Bourne film (and novel), and is indeed central to the high concept premise of the series. The moral need is unique to this film and makes the hero seem like a real person, in spite of his almost super-human fighting abilities.<br/><br/>A second major structural technique the writers use in this film is a double desire line laid over a single track. Normally you want to avoid two desire lines, because then you have two spines and the story falls apart. But here, the writers give Bourne two contradictory desires, to seek and avoid. He wants to find out who at the CIA has done this to him and he must avoid those same people because they are trying to kill him. This is a classic predicament: going after A makes it much more difficult to accomplish B; going after B makes it much more difficult to accomplish A. (Ironically this is the same technique used in creating the sitcom desire line).<br/><br/>Notice, instead of creating two separate desire lines, this technique creates a push-pull effect along a single track and places the hero under extreme pressure. It also gives the story a very strong spine on which to hang a number of big action set pieces without losing plot and momentum.<br/><br/>This brings up the biggest mistake most action writers make: they don't know how to create action without killing the plot. There are a lot of reasons for this. One has to do with how you set up the opposition. Most action opponents are all-powerful and evil. That makes them dull. But more importantly, everything about them is right on the surface. Result: no surprise and no plot.<br/><br/>In the Bourne films, the opposition is very powerful. But most of it is hidden under the surface. There are layers upon layers that Bourne must uncover. In Ultimatum, he continues to dig into the corrupt CIA that made him the killing machine that he is. And he has both ongoing opponents, like the David Strathairn character, as well as a succession of new assassins trying to kill him. All of this contributes to a plot that is much better than we get in most action films.<br/><br/>Action stories are among the most underestimated of all genres, because they seem to charge full speed down a single straight line. That's why so many bad ones are written. A good action film, like The Bourne Ultimatum, is like an athlete who is so talented you don't see the myriad of techniques he has hidden under the surface. If this is your form, take a look at the Action Story Class, and study films like this one for the techniques that make this tough form look easy.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, visit www.truby.com"

So it looks bleak right now for a 4th Bourne.All he wanted was to disappear. Instead, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is now hunted by the people who made him what he is. Having lost his memory and the one person he loved, he is undeterred by the barrage of bullets and a new generation of highly-trained killers. Bourne has only one objective: to go back to the beginning and find out who he was.<br/><br/>Treadstone, the top-secret black-ops program that created this super-assassin, is now defunct. It has been reimagined as the joint Department of Defense program Blackbriar, with a new generation of trained killers--hidden from domestic or foreign oversight--at the government's disposal. To them, Bourne is a $30-million malfuntioning threat who must be taken out, once and for all. To him, they are the only link to a life he has tried in vain to forget.<br/><br/>Bourne has reached the end of the line.

","This is simply one of the best spy, action-thriller's of all time. For a 3rd sequel this is probably the only major blockbuster film that has been a huge and critical success in 2007. Thats down to the story line which is simple, its not glamorised, no gadgets, no gloss and its not over the top, and this is why it is such a realistic, breathtaking film without using any c.g.i. Continuing where (I still think Supremacy is slightly the best of the Bourne franchise) the previous film left off, it is a non-stop popcorn action-thrill ride.<br/><br/>It features the best chase sequence without cars this time, which is the tangier rooftop sequence that then leads to the climatic and possibly one of the finest fight sequences in recent memory. A brilliant car-chase in new york, and of-course the superb edge of your seat waterloo train station sequence at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Its Simple, Effective, Brilliant, and thats what makes such a classic film. Thanks to the excellent directing talent of Paul Greengrass (United 93 & Bourne Supremacy, that I am a fan of) and obviously Matt Damon who makes sure he has a more meaning and convincing performance as ever, as Jason Bourne compared to the likes James Bond.<br/><br/>This film and the franchise itself will, and should set an example to how action-thriller's should be made."

","I haven't read any of the novels, though I know enough to be able to assure you, these movies are different from them. This is pretty much adrenaline in celluloid form. From the first to the last frame, this is incredibly exciting and intense. The action gets a definite upgrade, bigger and also better than before. This manages to put a fresh spin on stuff we've seen before in the new franchise, and it works impeccably well. The choreography and execution of the fights, shoot-outs and car-chases are excellent, with no exceptions. I don't know exactly what it is, but the hand-held camera is simply nowhere near as distracting and unpleasant as it was in Supremacy, in fact, it's great. Maybe they improved, or perhaps one adjusts to it during that film, and is then ready for it in this one before it even started. We are again treated to exotic locations around the world, and they are gorgeous, sights to behold. Tangiers is unforgettable in several ways. The stunts are astounding. This has a marvelous plot that ties the three stories together, and develops well throughout. The pacing is spot-on, in spite of being unbelievably fast, it allows you sufficient time to catch your breath, so the audience is not overwhelmed. There is genuine suspense in this. This can actually be watched without having seen the other two, and without it seeming full of redundant recaps. Exposition is perfectly handled. The acting is strong, every single performance. New additions to the cast are well-chosen. Characters are well-written and fleshed out. The emotion and impact are very good, if Identity is possibly a little superior in that area. This is easier to follow than the second one, and more complex than the original, 2002 one. The score is yet again fantastic. On the DVD are 12 minutes of deleted and extended scenes sans explanation, five featurettes, four of which I will review on their entries here on the site, and an insightful and informative Director's Commentary. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, and/or the series. 10/10"

"sanddragon939","10","1","3","13 May 2009"," 'Someone started all of this, And I'm gonna find them'
","If there is one word third installment of the groundbreaking Bourne trilogy loosely based on the bestselling novels of renowned author Robert Ludlum its 'explosive'. The screen literally explodes to life with the movie beginning with an intense chase sequence. What follows is an array of mind-blowing chases, fights and explosions that will literally leave the viewer stunned in his seat. But great action alone is not what makes this movie a near-masterpiece; its the underlying plot and premise, and the enigma surrounding the protagonist and his search for his mysterious past is what really captivates the viewer. Very few thriller movies seek to tell a deeper story amidst all the fast-paced violence and action and many that try often fail, but the previous two Bourne films have already revolutionized the espionage thriller genre and this film proudly continues the trend. Matt Damon reprises his role as Jason Bourne, the amnesiac rogue CIA operative on the run from the people who made him what he was-the perfect killing machine, a lethal assassin who killed without mercy until he lost his memory and tried to regain his humanity with the help of the woman he loved. But his girlfriend, Marie, was killed as 'collateral damage' during his conflict with the CIA, who believes him to be a threat and a liability who needs to be eliminated. Bourne returned to the violent world of his past in order to avenge her death, and now, he finds he is left with only one purpose-to find the person who 'started it all', who molded him into the killer known as 'Jason Bourne'. From Moscow, to Paris, London, Madrid, Tangier and finally the streets of New York City, Bourne travels around the world, barely a few steps ahead of those hunting them, while pieces of the mystery surrounding the creation of the Bourne identity slowly and subtly fall into place. The action and excitement of the film culminates, relatively peacefully, with an encounter at the end of which Bourne finally knows all the answers. From an action point of view, the viewer is really spoilt for choice. Even a relatively minor scene like a violent encounter Bourne has with a few Russian policemen in the beginning is so expertly filmed in Paul Greengrass's gritty style that you really don't feel that its only a prologue to greater things to come. A notable highlight is the elaborate sequence in the Waterloo station. And then there is a rooftop chase in Tangier (which hearkens back to the 1987 Bond movie, The Living Daylights), and a car chase (similar to the one in The Bourne Supremacy) in New York, the last major action sequence of the film. Matt Damon of course does a brilliant job as Jason Bourne. Naturally, by this point hes had a lot of experience playing the amnesiac assassin, but in this film, Damon's acting, his speech and his body language really speaks volumes for how much the character has changed since the first film. With Marie dead, the Bourne's characters last link to humanity has been stripped away from him and he is now pretty much back to being the cold-blooded killing machine he must have been before the amnesia, except that this time hes targeting the people who created him. He speaks in a cold monotone for most of the time and yet conveys an intensity that can really send a chill down your spine. And yet, there is still a spark of humanity left in the emotionless machine, as we see in a crucial scene in the middle of the film, where a visibly distressed Bourne confesses how he is haunted by the faces of the men he killed in his forgotten past. We realize that the beneath the brutality and coldness is an ordinary human being with emotions and feelings struggling to break out and this makes us sympathize with the character further and become emotionally invested in his quest for the truth. Joan Allen turns in another excellent performance as CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy, Bourne's only ally in the Agency who is ethically opposed to the CIA's inhuman black ops programs and wishes to help Bourne as a means of redeeming herself and the Agency for all they've done to him.David Straithairn plays Noah Vosen, chief of the CIA black ops program codenamed 'Blackbriar', who considers it his mission to rid the world of threats to 'national security', threats which include Bourne and all those who support him. He proves to be the perfect antagonist to Landy in the bureaucratic corridors of power. Julia Stiles plays Nicky Parsons, a CIA employee and former contact of Bourne's from back during his days with the Agency. Stiles, who had a much lesser role in the previous two films, essentially plays the 'mystery woman' from Bourne's past-their previous relationship, if any, is subtly hinted at and largely left ambiguous. And finally, Albert Finney plays Dr. Albert Hirsch, the mastermind behind Blackbriar and the man who, in essence, 'created' the Bourne identity. Hirsch continues to appear throughout the film in Bourne's fragmented memories of his initial transformation into an assassin, and he is confronted by Jason in the end, revealing all the answers Bourne (and the viewer) have always wanted to know. In conclusion, I would like to comment on the last frame of the film which is essentially a homage to the first frame of The Bourne Identity-of the blackened outline of a man floating unconscious in the water. But someone who has seen the trilogy knows and appreciates how much the character has been through, how much he has changed in the years between those two frames, and we have the team at Universal and the cast and crew to thank for telling this most compelling cinematic saga of the 21st century."
"pboyall","9","1","3","4 May 2009"," Much better than the book
","It isn't often that you can say a movie beats the book on which is was based, but in the case of the Bourne Ultimatum that is certainly the case. The book is a massive monstrosity with a twisting plot populated by unbelievable superheros who have no flaws whatsoever.<br/><br/>What we are given with the film is a far gritter view of life (though certainly nothing as close to the bone as Spy Game; Bourne still depicts espionage as some sort of glamorous game). Both sides are flawed in one way or another, and that is what makes it so intriguing. You cannot be certain in the final scenes if perhaps Bourne is wrong. Of course you know that can't be the case, but there is enough there to make you wonder briefly.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles is sadly under-utilised; I had higher hopes for her character after the events of ""Supremacy"". She is pivotal, but the amount of screen time felt somewhat limited.<br/><br/>The stunts are once again excellent, and part of the plot without ever becoming the driver in themselves. The narrative is woven well enough to include action set-pieces which feel as though they ""just happen"", rather than the usual approach (Bond movies in particular) where it feels as though the stunts were performed and then someone wrote a script to fill in the spaces between them.<br/><br/>An excellent musical score underpins the entire enterprise, like the stunts it does not dominate but serves to back the story and round out the experience nicely.<br/><br/>An excellent movie and well worth buying the Blu-ray."

"howard.schumann","9","1","3","8 April 2009"," Action movies are rarely as involving in both story and character as The Bourne Trilogy
","Political assassinations conducted or assisted by U.S. intelligence agencies are not new and those we know about may only be the tip of an iceberg. In timely fashion, The Bourne Trilogy focuses on issues such as whether the ends justify the means in pursuing political goals or whether our intelligence community must seek justice in a manner consistent with our stated moral (and legal) values as a nation. In the series, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a trained assassin whose amnesia causes him to try and recover his past and, in the process, is forced to confront the morality of his actions. While the awakening of conscience in a trained assassin or government operative is about as likely as Barack Obama changing his name to Jubilation T. Cornpone, when it does occur, it is a pleasure to witness and the series as a whole, while superior action fare, refuses to glorify violence or portray intelligence operatives as larger than life.<br/><br/>In The Bourne Trilogy, it is chase or be chased and the series is replete with state of the art car chases and hot pursuits in, around, on, and through buildings. Even if the outcomes are predictable, half of the fun is watching Bourne use his ingenuity and whatever tools are at his disposal to fight his pursuers in a very creative way. Bourne is a no-nonsense guy who never smiles, yet the films are not grim but exhilarating and we can only smile as he calmly walks out of his car door after it has been bounced off roofs and bridges, smashed against walls, and turned upside down. Because of his precarious position, Bourne must constantly be on the go and we save the airfare by riding along with him to Zurich, Madrid, Berlin, Tangiers, Amsterdam, Paris, Moscow, New York and others, travelogues worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>In The Bourne Identity, the first and most human (and least dizzying) of the trilogy, Jason has lost his memory after an aborted assassination attempt at sea and must piece together memories to find out who he is and why he is being hunted. He recognizes that he is skilled at using a gun as well as his fists, and when he discovers a gun and forged passports in a safety deposit box, he suspects that he is an assassin whose mission, called Operation Treadstone, went terribly wrong. Jason doesn't really know where to go or who to search for. Those people and missions reveal themselves to him during the course of his journey as he unlocks more and more of his past. The first film also has the only romance in the series as Jason and Marie Helena Kruetz (Franka Potente) begin an uneasy alliance when he pays her a huge amount of money to drive him to Paris which develops into romance and the only touch of real tenderness in the series.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93), The Bourne Supremacy changes the style of the first film into one of non-stop, kinetic action delivered with a glossy style and shaky hand-held camera-work. Living with Marie in India, Jason is hunted once again as his fingerprints are found on a bomb used to assassinate a CIA informant. This brings in Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to take the search for Bourne to a higher level but she is met with resistance by those who do not want information dug up by Landy about Treadstone. After someone close to him is accidentally killed, Bourne goes to Moscow to find the truth about his involvement in the assassination of a Russian politician.<br/><br/>Shot in the same style as Supremacy but more focused and somewhat less frenetic, The Bourne Ultimatum brings in yet another main character, Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), head of Operation Blackbriar, an updated version of Treadstone. Landy begins to have doubts about Bourne's complicity in the informant's death but Vosen wants him taken out, thinking he is the source for a British newspaper story that is compromising to the Agency. Eventually, Bourne goes back to the source, Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney) in an attempt to atone for the many past murders he has committed in the government's name but events prove embarrassing to the men at the top.<br/><br/>Action movies are rarely as involving in both story and character as The Bourne Trilogy and this is in large measure due to the skills of Matt Damon who has created a character that we care about and root for. The success of the films is also complemented by outstanding supporting performances by stars such as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Albert Finney, Julia Stiles, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, Franka Potente, and Chris Cooper. While it may be unlikely that uncovering of a CIA assassination ring would lead to a congressional investigation, nonetheless, it is refreshing to see action heroes confront the morality of their actions.

","This film is the quest of Jason Bourne finding out who he is, and who is behind the operations that made him a fugitive for three years.<br/><br/>Just like the previous two Jason Bourne movies, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is quick paced and action packed. There are no unnecessary scenes, subplots or even dialogs. Everything exists for a reason. It is streamlined and yet it still lasts for two hours, meaning that it has so much action and thrill to offer. The hand held camera adds realism and a sense of urgency throughout the film, without making me nauseous like ""Cloverfield"" did. The music score is excellent, it propels the tension and helps sustain the suspense. In addition, there are no contrived romance or soft porn sex scenes to help sell the film. This helps the film to be focused as a action thriller."
"hnt_dnl","9","1","3","9 September 2008"," Solid 2nd sequel to IDENTITY
","I loved THE BOURNE IDENTITY and think it's one of the top 10 films of the 2000s. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY: not so much. I thought SUPREMACY was too herky jerky with all that fancy camera stuff and a rather boring story and dull villains, while IDENTITY kept it simple with a fresh, exciting chase story, an engaging hero and well-staged action sequences. Thankfully, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM returns to that form. It still has some of that fancy camera stuff like in SUPREMACY, but in ULTIMATUM, it works to much better effect. Seems like in SUPREMACY, the camera stuff was just done for show, while in ULTIMATUM, it helps drive the story along. And what a convoluted story it is! Our hero Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in another solid outing) is trying to find out 'where it all began'. He promises Marie's brother (don't remember him from either of the first 2 films) that he will get to the root of all this international intrigue. Bourne stumbles across an article by a British reporter Simon Ross (well played by Paddy Considine of HOT FUZZ fame) who, through an unknown source, outs Bourne and the CIA's covert Treadwell and Blackbriar operations. Bourne realizes that if he contacts Ross and find his source, who obviously is an CIA insider, he can find the men that recruited him to be a relentless assassin.<br/><br/>The Bourne-Ross convergence contains one of the best sustained action sequences I've ever seen in any film, where Bourne constantly eludes his CIA chasers through the London streets, subways, and shops and after putting a prepaid phone in Ross' bag, talks Ross through the chase. Really exciting opening act! The head CIA guy after Bourne here is New York CIA anti-terrorist chief Noah Vosen (played by the great David Strathairn in a slick, lethal performance). In to assist Vosen is of course SUPREMACY's Pamela Landy (the classy Joan Allen in an underused, thankless role). Allen makes the most of what she has to work with here, which isn't much.<br/><br/>Both Bourne and Vosen simultaneously figure out the leak and have separate agendas for wanting to find him: Bourne to find his original tormentors that turned him into a killer and Vosen to eliminate the leak and thus any trace of the torture tactics used by Treadwell/Blackbriar. <br/><br/>Bourne's femme fatale here is Nicky from the previous 2 films (Julia Stiles in a terrific performance). There is a real unspoken attraction between Jason and Nicky that is very stimulating! <br/><br/>Some of the exciting set pieces in this one include the aforementioned labyrithine London chase scene, a fantastic mano-y-mano fight between Bourne and Desh (a CIA strongman tasked to finish off Bourne and Nicky, who is supporting Jason's quest for the truth) in Tangier, and a fast-paced car chase in the streets of NY. <br/><br/>In addition, Scott Glenn has a small, yet effectively commanding role as CIA director Ezra Kramer. <br/><br/>The film moves at a breakneck pace, but never gets stale or tiring to watch. You stay entertained throughout. There is a nifty surprise rather late in the film that will shock the first-time viewer! <br/><br/>ULTIMATUM is a fine 3rd act to the Bourne series and definitely leaves you wanting more. Seems like where they missed with SUPREMACY, they more than made up for with ULTIMATUM!"

","Jason Bourne is back and he's faced with bigger challenges than ever. He's out to find the truth and highly skilled assassins are in his way. The action sequences are awe-inspiring. The fight scene with Desh is incredible. If only I could fight like that!!!! Anyway, the story becomes more intense as the trilogy comes to a close and the ending is done very well. the loss of his love had only increased his determination to find the truth as the truth took her life. I was surprised because I'd set my expectations low because The Bourne Supremacy didn't meet the standards set by The Bourne Identity. But I'm glad it shattered my expectations and delivered a GREAT movie!!!!!!!!! Thrilling!!!!!!!! I think this movie is better than the first one (Bourne Identity). I know the first one was great but I think this beats it by a bit. But what a way to end a terrific trilogy!!!!!!!!! All hail Paul Greengrass!!!!!!!!!"

","To tell the truth, I wasn't even that big of a fan of the Jason Bourne movies until I saw this film. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" provides the perfect conclusion to what I now realize is a great series. This sequel takes place in both Russia and in America, and once again Bourne (Matt Damon) must find out who he really is while evading those chasing after him. The film is highly suspenseful and action-packed, and it provides more entertainment than your average action movie. Watching Bourne's clever ingenuity and ability to escape his enemies in the most impressive ways is what really makes this film so fun to watch. Joan Allen and Julia Stiles are great co-stars once again, as is David Strathairn (lesser known but brilliant actor from films like ""Sneakers"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck""). After seeing this, I had to go back and watch the first two again, and I enjoyed them even more than before. This film, however, is easily the best of the three. It grabs your attention from the beginning and hooks you the whole way through. Few films can do that this well. Almost a perfect film.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"hardrock666","10","1","3","3 August 2008"," Ultimate thriller , engaging viscerally and intellectually
","It is rare for Hollywood to make an action movie that can keep audiences captivated for its entire duration. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is that rare gem of an action movie that is engaging viscerally and intellectually.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in this third of the Bourne movies - based on the popular Robert Ludlum novels - along with director Paul Greengrass, who also helmed the second installment ""The Bourne Supremacy"".Damon's Bourne continues on his quest to find out what his motives for killing people are: He is fully aware that he is a killer but has no idea how he became one. And since he has amnesia he has to depend on vague fleeting memories to piece together the puzzle.<br/><br/>He might be troubled but he is also resolute. He wants to find out how he became what he is. It is this resoluteness and the quest that is the heart and soul of the movie.The most exciting aspect of the movie is the momentum of the action. In essence it is just one long chase scene. It sets the pulse from the word go and for its entire duration does not miss a beat.<br/><br/>The movie begins by jumping in exactly where the second movie ended and doesn't bother to provide any background details. For those who have not seen the first two installments, this movie will be slightly confusing.The chase scenes are exhilarating but not in a stylistic way. The director employs the hand-held camera technique, which makes us feel we are in the centre of the action. The action has an organic feel to it.<br/><br/>In a one-on-one fistfight sequence there is no background music but just the sound of heavy breathing and cracking bones. Since it is in an apartment the two fighters resort to using a book, a rag and a toothbrush. It is a testament to the genius of the director that he creates engrossing action without resorting to explosions and blood.<br/><br/>Damon fleshes out his role with great subtlety. And the cast is rounded off well by some fine performances. Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy, the CIA boss who is responsible for catching Bourne.Scott Glen appears briefly as CIA director who just wants his subordinates to get the job done without involving him and the Oscar-nominated David Strarthairn is a company representative who is muscling in the operation to nab Bourne.<br/><br/>The legendary Albert Finney drops by to play the man responsible for making Bourne a killing machine. Julia stiles is Nicky Parsons, a young agent who has known Bourne from the beginning and provides what little information she can to him.Another merit of this movie is the global locales. It jumps from London to Moscow, Paris, Tangier and New York. In ""The Bourne Supremacy"", a pivotal development of the story where a key member gets killed takes place in Goa.<br/><br/>Bourne speaks every language he will need to know in any place he finds himself in. Though the movie shifts locales the thread of Bourne's purpose runs clearly through and the pulse is steadily maintained.<br/><br/>The movie has fared well at the box office internationally and is sure to boost the fortunes of Damon and the director. But on a cinematic level, the movie has just raised the bar for action movies and Hollywood is going to have to scramble to keep pace with Bourne."
"kongjr","9","1","3","3 August 2008"," No better action thriller, so far.
","I haven't read the book and I saw the Bourne Series as an independent story, no sophisticated technologies, no eye-catching special effects, no sex scenes, the director was simply so realistic in handling all the focuses of the cat and mouse catches, and it's hard to tell who is really in charge.<br/><br/>All the stunts of Jason Bourne were cleverly staged and laid, Bourne's escape from the CIA's chasing with the aid of his knowledge of the city layouts, insider's comprehension of the operation of the secret service and photographic memory, show an amazing planning which easily captivated the audience.<br/><br/>With the Bourne series here in mind, the Bond, the Die Hard or other similar action thrillers seem like Disney's production."
"billpeter","10","1","3","20 March 2008"," Makes 007 look like Inspector Morse
","I am a fan of Morse, but the style is like filling in a crossword puzzle - hardly action-packed excitement. However Matt Damon as Jason Bourne makes James Bond - even Daniel Craig - look like Morse - although Jason has the intelligence of Morse, which Bond has never had. This film's action is like the violence in The Passion of the Christ - RELENTLESS - like the Faces album; Never a Dull Moment. I've liked Matt Damon's acting since I watched The Talented Mr Ripley, and he is the ideal Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>I just hope there is another sequel with more Julia Stiles, and David Strathairn - the best ""straight"" baddie since Alan Rickman's humorous baddies in Die Hard and Robin Hood."

I'm on the love-it side, look at the scene at the Waterloo station, all the tensions and CCTV shots, the editing is genius. I don't found the shaking so vigorous. Some people may feel seasick on it, but that's not the problem of the movie, I guess it's just like you will get seasick on a boat. The editing(vibe) may make you sick. It's different for everyone.<br/><br/>Forget about how can Jason Bourne knocked down 3 or 4 in a second, coz it's a ""hero"" movie.<br/><br/>For an action movie, it sets the new standard."
"jboothmillard","9","1","3","17 February 2008"," The Bourne Ultimatum
","The critics give this third instalment five stars, I may not have remembered much about about the previous two, but I can certainly agree with that rating. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still in Moscow fleeing from the police, and after escaping them, six weeks later an English reporter, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) who finds out from CIA officer Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton) about a project called ""Blackbriar"", and Bourne is square one. The CIA meanwhile, are alerted by this mention of that word from Ross, and they immediately start tracking him when he returns to London, where Bourne has also followed. Bourne tries to protect Ross from assassination, because he could help Bourne finally find out the truth about his identity, but Bourne fails. Reading through Ross's notes, he sees the name of a firm in Spain, and decides to go there to get some leads, CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) and his team find out he's going there too. When there Bourne manages to bump into the woman that was helping Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) try to catch him, Nicolette 'Nicky' Parsons (Julia Stiles), and she helps him by giving some information about a place in Tangiers. The CIA meanwhile activates assassin Desh (Joey Ansah) to track them down, and eventually Bourne and Nicky come across the address of the cover up CIA office in New York City. Bourne calls Pamela, and she reveals his real name is David Webb, and secretly the area code of the secret lab in his date of birth. Bourne finally meets the man responsible for his amnesia, Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney), who tells him that he volunteered for the whole thing. In the end, Bourne is ""killed"" falling into the ocean, Vosen and Hirsch are both arrested for their involvement in this project, and we know that Bourne escapes. Also starring Edgar Ramirez as Paz, Scott Glenn as CIA Director Ezra Kramer, Daniel Brühl as Martin Kreutz, Tom Gallop as Tom Cronin and Corey Johnson as Wills. The story is slightly complex but very gripping, the chase and action sequences are impressive, the camera work is interesting when slightly shaky, BAFTA nominated director Paul Greengrass continues superbly from Bourne Supremacy, oh, and Doug Liman, director of Bourne Identity produces. It won the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing (all its nominations), and it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best British Film (it isn't completely British, but who cares), Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"
"Mattissimplythebest","9","1","3","12 February 2008"," Hypertastic Delivery of Fast Paced Action
","The best Bourne in the series so far takes things back to action basics, and twist a slice of intelligent cat and mouse thriller into the cocktail. So far I've been reasonably entertained by Identity and Supremacy (the other two films in the series), with the first film being better than the second and honestly I wasn't expecting this one to reach the heights that it did. It is nice to be surprised by the effectiveness of a leading character, and Matt Damon slips into the action sequences very comfortably; my favourite parts come toward the end when the cat and mouse scenario begins and Bourne starts to give his old employers the run around. Its classic payback stuff and if I may say so very well scripted; at the end you leave the cinema feeling justice has been served and you've just watched a killer action flick."
"antsmasherjack","10","1","3","2 February 2008"," After the events of the Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne searches for the people who trained him into an assassin.
","This has got to be the best action movie of 2007. The Bourne trilogy is by far the best series of spy movies in my opinion. The story goes really fast just the first two movies, but it's slow enough for people to understand its contents. What I love about Bourne Ultimatum is its aim to look realistic. There aren't flashy gadgets such as those in the 007 movies. The shaky camera technique was done wonderfully, even though many people have been complaining the camera was too unsteady. What I would recommend to people who get motion sickness from watching movies like this is try to watch it on a smaller screen rather in the theater. The story is still enjoyable on the the smallest screen. Anyways, the movie, just like the previous Bourne movies, has some of the most memorable foot and car chase scenes in movie history. The action is really well choreographed. They're really tense and the beautiful soundtrack composed by John Powell fits perfectly into the action. I got goosebumps from listening to the music. Overall, The Bourne Ultimatum is a great conclusion to the Bourne trilogy and I really appreciate it that the producers and the director, Paul Greengrass, didn't disappoint their audience as did the other noticeable trilogies like Austin Powers: Gold Member, where it has gotten lazy and has stupid, immature jokes, or like Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End, where it got too crazy and there's too much crap happening at the same time. So I would recommend that people watch this movie to get the sense of how an action movie should be like."
"Hitchcoc","9","1","3","25 January 2008"," The Best of All
","I decided to have a Bourne-a-thon. I had never seen these movies. I absolutely loved the first one, like the second. This one puts the pieces together. The psychology implications of Bourne's training are hinted at in the first two movies. The beauty of this is that everything is kept so tight and so tense. I think that a really good adventure film relies on villains that are more complex than one dimensional. The failings of the bad guys and their monomania are at the center of this. Because of their overreaching, they make themselves vulnerable. Bourne has been trained well because he never makes a move without a reason. That doesn't mean that his ignorance of his past doesn't get him in trouble. There are a couple times when common sense would have won out. But weight that against the odds. He also picks some honorable allies now. It had to happen. The last half hour of this film is vintage. It works on the mind and pops up one surprise after another. Watch 'em all."
"dead47548","9","1","3","8 January 2008"," Continues in the grand tradition of the series.
","Continues with the tradition of the series so far. Once again, the series excels at being an intellectual, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat thriller that starts with a bang and never lets up. It's a gritty, stylized espionage thriller that is certainly one of the most exhilarating and visceral experiences I've had in recent memory. Greengrass implies the ""in your face"" techniques that he used in Supremacy which makes the action seem authentic and really puts you into the point of view of Bourne, getting your pulse racing and your eyes completely attached to the screen.<br/><br/>The cast is all great, as usual. Damon and Allen add the intellect and commanding power to the film. It was great to see Julia Stiles getting a more pivotal role, since I felt she was pretty underused in the previous installments. The addition of David Straithairn and, more importantly, Albert Finney was absolutely brilliant. They just continued the tradition of brilliant, insanely commanding actors playing the generic ""hunt him down"" role. They certainly added a lot to what could have been very flat characters. The style used is gritty, suave and very authentic. <br/><br/>However, it can become a bit too stylized at times. It can cut too quickly and zoom in and out and tilt all over the place, and the editing could be pretty sloppy from time to time. Other than that though, I don't really have much to complain about. If you liked the first two installments, you'll surely be pleased by this one. If you didn't, then this obviously isn't for you. I was a big fan."
"jon_normile","9","1","3","30 December 2007"," Good Movie
","I really don't think I can add much more than what the 100-odd other people have posted regarding their opinion on this very fine film. As many before me have said, this is a very fine film. Smart, fast, clever, and up to the brim with adrenalin. As I told my wife after we had watched it, ""This move has restored my faith in Hollywood! You see, they really can make a good movie if they want to!!"" Aside from the expert way the film was crafted together, it very deftly makes a statement on how the ends do not justify the means. Something that every American citizen should remind themselves of, less we lose hold of that exceptionalism that makes America truly special in this unpleasant and frightening world.<br/><br/>And how clever was how they inserted 66% of the Bourne Ultimatum movie in the middle of the second movie, The Bourne Supremacy? As you know, if you saw the second movie, it ended with a phone call to the Joan Allen character from Jason Bourne as he was scoping her from across the street. Cut to the credits, that ending was played as a snappy, jazzy finish. And now in Ultimatum, we see how that whole episode was in the middle of such extraordinarily dire circumstances, and how it was so integral to the plot. Very nicely done! I haven't been so whipsawed in a movie since ""The 6th Sense""! <br/><br/>However, just to show I'm an independent critic, not bought and sold by the movie studios, I must point out two flaws in the film that have got me thinking. First, and most obviously, what is Albert Finney doing in this movie? Didn't his character commit suicide in the second movie? It appears that he is playing a different character now in the third movie, some kind of CIA MD (who apparently never took his Hippocratic oath too seriously). What is that? The Bourne movies are otherwise as tight as a drum. And it is because they are so believable, they have so much appeal. But that believability is seriously impaired with this kind of gaffe. I don't understand why they brought Albert Finney, a great actor and certainly a very weighty presence on the screen, to play such a role without any explanation of how and why he relates to that other character in the second film.<br/><br/>Second, and this is very minor, but still worth mentioning, in the second film, Jason Bourne, decides not to kill the Karl Urban Russian assassin character. However, when meeting the brother of his German girlfriend, he says he did kill her. Yet another discontinuity.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the two previous paragraphs, the Bourne Ultimatum is an excellent film and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates American movies of the highest order (even though the director, and half the crew are British.)"
"ronw-2","1","1","3","22 December 2007"," Absolue disaster of a movie
","I must be the only person that thinks this is just a dumb movie. The lead character has no emotion at all but then considering he looks faintly Neanderthal I guess we can expect little else from him. The plot is so silly with no attempt to even explain things that any viewer would question. Like how does he manage to fly around the world at a drop of hat. No visa's or passports. One would have to presume that any identity papers he had would have long ago been zapped by the government. Where is the money coming from to do all this. Liekwise the guns and the id cards and the ability to be able to waltz into top secret headquarters get past all the security and just go anywhere without be stopped. Come on surely films have to have a modicum of reality to the plot. All that hocus pocus of being able to whip text messages out the ether almost instantly and have cameras at all the action spots so that the people back state side can watch. I give this 1 out of 10"

Does it always have to be an English Classic?) The cinematography, dialogue and stunts were all terrific. Music could have made more of an impact, but it didn't.<br/><br/>Yes, a very good thriller again, but the pace has slowed somewhat when compared to the previous two Jason Bourne movies. Maybe the story dictated this. They tried to pick the pace up again when Bourne is running across rooftops and thru people's apartments as he tries to intercept the hit-man going for Nicky (Stiles). However, that chase went on for too long a time. (Hey, I don't have all day. Have to watch Judge Judy, you know.) And, when Bourne does catch up with the hit-man (Yeah, what am I giving away? Like you didn't know he would catch him?) it takes Bourne about 10-mintes to put him away in a very good fight where I had to duck a couple times. But previously, Bourne put the bad guys away with some fantastic moves in a matter of seconds. Here, it took a long time (Remember, I have get back to Judge Judy).<br/><br/>Julia Stiles is simply beautiful and has that Priscella Presley pouting look. Very sexy. I am in love again. You will hate David Strathairn in this movie and love him in We Are Marshall. Go figure. Guess that is the mark of a terrific actor and he is that.<br/><br/>And, it cannot be said enough that Matt Damon is a quality actor and why isn't he nominated for something in these Bourne movies?

Both 'Spider-Man 3' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean 3' were a disappointment compared to the previous movie. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is not one of these.

","In most spy thrillers, the villains are people from outside the U.S. who run roughshod over the world with their military, political or economic machinations. But not since Rambo has a cinematic hero taken on our own government as the bad guys. Like Rambo, his training has turned him into a nearly invincible fighting machine, who ironically now opposes his former bosses. As each sequel has progressed from the first BOURNE outing, Jason has attempted to come back home, like a loyal dog, but his masters keep barring the door. This dogged pursuit of his goal has made Matt Damon's character a screen icon right up there with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan. This latest ""Bourne"" installment, which I caught at my favorite Garland cinema house, is as equally well-made and entertaining as its predecessors. Great locations set the scene for great action sequences like the chase scenes on the streets of Tangier and New York City, and the fight scene in the bathroom with the asset is arguably Jason's best ever albeit shot at a little too fast a pace. Throw in some fine character development, a good musical score and a story full of suspense, and you'll find yourself strapped in for a great thrill ride. And without giving too much away, the story comes full circle back to the same physical environment from where Jason began his odyssey. I'm really looking forward to popping the cork on the next entry in the series, especially now that Jason seems to have picked an an ally and possible love interest in the form of Nicky Parsons.

"TheUnknown837-1","9","1","3","1 December 2007"," the best out of all three Bourne movies that still leaves plenty of room open for another installment
","Both ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" were and still are, some of the best of the modern action movies. They were intelligent, clever, powerful in action, utilized the important aspects necessary and limited the aspects that weren't'as vital to the storyline, and were overall, great rides for the audience. And ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" does that same thing again, only this time, it's far more powerful.<br/><br/>""Ultimatum"" has a more complex storyline, because it is a more complex film. Sometimes it might get confusing, but that's kind of the whole idea, for what confused you might have confused the characters, who have to figure it out as you are as well. Here, Bourne is not just entirely being hunted. He now has allies who will side with him and still maintain a high position of authority. Still, that doesn't present any obstacles for the people who have been trying to kill him, and the methods they are taking against him are better and more destructive than ever.<br/><br/>Character development in the film is the best it's been in all parts of the trilogy. Bourne is now the ultimate action figure for everybody and he is a little bit merciless now in his tactics in defending himself and those he feels he should defend to find his answers. Bourne has lost some of his generosity and when he's trying to find an answer, it doesn't mean as much to him if somebody gets hurt in the process. But yet, he hasn't lost it all, which makes him a more likable character. And he's still a clever fighter who uses whatever he can to his advantage. He can use even an object as common as a bathroom towel to help him fight somebody off, in ways you would not expect. He can tell instantly now whether an approaching person is friendly or unfriendly, he knows when he's being spied on, where his enemies are even if he can't see them, and many other ways that almost seem inhuman.<br/><br/>The assassins Bourne must battle with are the best he's ever gone up against. The character of Desh, who appropriately has no dialogue, is presented as being like a killing machine. He doesn't speak, he doesn't look anybody in the eye, he looks suspicious, he's intelligent, and above all, a powerful fighter and a deadly shot with a gun. He's called ""the asset"", and he is to the people he works for. Desh is a presumable representation of what Bourne was like before his landmark incident in the first film that ultimately changed his life and the lives of many other people at the same time.<br/><br/>In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" it seems as if most of the questions are now being answered for both Bourne and the audience and it leaves us with one open question until the ending: is Bourne going to survive the events of this film? What is his fate going to be now? But like the first two films, it will continue to leave open spaces that make us wonder what exactly is going to happen and whether or now the filmmakers are going to make plans for yet another sequel. Whatever the case, I say that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is the best out of the entire trilogy. It did become a little bit slow toward the end, but I thought it was an amazing action movie. Highly recommended."

","Couldn't have asked for a better ending to the trilogy.<br/><br/>This was one of the best movies of 2007.<br/><br/>Non-stop action from start to finish.<br/><br/>This movie had me on the edge of my seat literally.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was excellent as Jason Bourne.He is the new James Bond. Bourne identity and Bourne supremacy must be watched first to understand the plot and what is going on. This shaky camera that i have seen some people saying bad things about was great in the film it made you feel like u were with Bourne and in the scene with him. The writing in this movie was smart and there was no point in the movie where no twists and turns were not being dished out. If you are a Bourne fan or just like a great action movie you must see it. It has suspense from the first line to the last line.<br/><br/>I recommend it to everyone. Great action,great acting, great characters, great writing and just a great action movie.<br/><br/>9/10"
"smorris200","7","1","3","10 October 2007"," The worst of the Trilogy but still a good film
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** Action, Action, Action. One amazing set piece after another absolutely terrific.... or so I thought. I actually missed an intelligent storyline, I didn't really get the motives of continuing to chase Bourne following the deaths of Abbott and Conklin. The story was out there and I clearly felt that at the end of Supremacy he was getting his memory back and was at a place where he could move forward.<br/><br/>The first two films were intelligent and combined great action with a feeling that to watch the films and understand, you got a sense of how the intelligence service really worked. This last film whilst exciting and I was really on the edge of my seat at times, just lacked the coherence of the others and I really feel that by creating a more believable plot and not just rehashing supremacy the film could have been so much better!!"
"pc95","7","1","3","6 October 2007"," More Bourne....
","It has been awhile since I'd seen the first of this set - but I recall liking it fairly well. The 2nd film Supremacy I hadn't seen until very recently, and I didn't think it was as good as the first, but fair - this movie, The Bource Ultimatum feels pretty much like a retread of the 2nd film only with some generally excellent action sequences and better pacing - especially the whole Morocco run-through (except the actual fight scene being overlong). Despite some great action scenes, the movie features some poorly done flash-backs, a bit of a letdown ending, and some ridiculousness in terms of believability of surviving both a car-bomb and a high speed car wreck (but that's the spy genre I suppose). Also the makings of a new gf/love-interest seemed a bit platonic. Nonetheless this movie get's closer to the original and is better than the 2nd (Supremecy) imo. It's a good movie overall."

","I don't often write user comments here. But now i just have to. And sorry for my bad English.<br/><br/>I have not read the books but i have seen all three movies and that's the point at this website.<br/><br/>This movie(s) got it all. It's ""on the edge of the seat"" movie(s) all the way to the end. I think of all the three Bourne movies as one long Bourne movie. Cut it in small parts and u got a totally great TV-series. It's about spy's, mysteries and conspiracy. What more do you want? I don't know how they do it but the actors fit in all the way. When i watched this last Bourne movie i got tears in my eyes, and I'm not kidding. This is REAL art!!! Matt Damon once again shows what a great actor he is. No one could do Bourne better than him.<br/><br/>Bourne once again starts to remember things about his past. Bourne is getting closer and closer the truth about himself and CIA wants to close him down by killing him so there jobs in CIA can be saved. I don't want to say to much about this movie....just watch it and get amazed! I have heard rumors about a 4th movie and i really hope it's true. And i think there is room for a 5th movie in the Bourne series.<br/><br/>Just watch all the three movies and enjoy!!!"

But it was totally lack of an interesting history plot there! Personally, I think I could walk in to the movie at the last 30 min and still get enough pictures of the story.

","I saw it at opening at midnight. Then I went back. I loved the first two movies of the Bourne trilogy, but Ultimatum is by far the best.<br/><br/>The agent v. agent fight scene (Tangiers?) is one of the best fight scenes ever put on film. I was wound up so tightly watching this fight sequence I couldn't breathe until the end.<br/><br/>Not just quick and tight, but sooo SMART.<br/><br/>I want to go back and count, but I only remember Jason shooting a gun ONE TIME in the movie--and NOT at another character. I consider this a strong tribute to Greengrass's directing: always making the smart action choice, not the loud one.<br/><br/>The pace was GREAT, and the lag between masterful action/suspense scenes was minimal.<br/><br/>Get over the shaky camera, people! Ultimatum is the best you will see for years to come."
"pistoncylinder","9","1","3","20 September 2007"," the best Bourne by far...but...
","The third in the Bourne Quadrology is as exciting as the first two. The plot opens up like an onion, layer after layer, after dangerous layer. Matt Damon excels as Jason Bourne. As all American films, it shows one man to be a super genius and the system that is trying to bring him down as a bunch of idiots walking the streets on a Saturday market.<br/><br/>The film has some fantastic action scenes and he camera-work has been intended to make you feel as if the action is happening right in front of your face. The fight scenes will give you a feel that u r huddled in a corner while the action is going on all around you. Full marks to cinematography. Same thing goes to chase scenes in NYC and Tangier. Music is equal to the visuals and enhances the look and feel of the film, greatly. For me, the best scenes, in terms of cinematography and picturisation are the ones shot in London's Waterloo station and the action scenes shot in Tangier.<br/><br/>It has a lot of moments, where Jason Bourne's intelligence and presence of mind seems to outwit the CIA operatives, out to get him. It also gives a superficial scan of CIA psyche-breaking procedures, which were mainly used in interrogations, a subject brilliantly explained in the book ""A Question of Torture"" by Alfred W McCoy. Does Jason Bourne die, when he goes to terminate the CIA program that created him? Go watch it...and go with an open mind...coz the unexpected will hit you again...<br/><br/>cheers Raam"
"Sagimon","10","1","3","19 September 2007"," Movie is nothing like the book
","I finished the book yesterday and saw the movie tonight. The movie was terrific, but the only three things that were in both the book and the movie was The Bourne Ultimatum, Jason Bourne, and David Webb. Everything else was completely different. I wasn't sure they could make a movie from the book as it was difficult to read and follow. The book could have been done in fewer than half the pages and although there were some action narration, most of the book was quite boring. The movie on the other hand was at least as exciting as the previous two. It employed some of the same characters and added a number of new ones. I thought it was curious that in all the chase scenes in all the movies, not one airbag was ever deployed. I don't even recall seeing anyone use a seat belt."
"gjlmovie4711","Null","1","3","11 September 2007"," The Bourne - Disappointment
","If you like to see stupid men uttering stupid Hollywood/CIA-clichés, if you're into nervous and annoying camera movements that camouflage nothing-but-mediocre action shots, if you cannot get enough of cars being demolished over and over again, this could be a film for you. The fuzz about this movie has no real reason at all - I guess people are like parrots, repeating what others say without thinking themselves. After one hour this film really started to bore me but somehow I made it to the end, just to know if the last minutes could somehow make up for wasting my time. They could not. Is Jason Bourne supposed to be the Six Million Dollar Man of the 21 st century or what? I couldn't help laughing my a** off! This guy is supposed to see people he wants to see at a distance of about 100 yards - in a crowd in narrow streets an being chased himself!!! It's just ridiculous. This is only one example in a movie that had no real depth or plot - it's just chasing and running away over and over again, and in that respect nothing better than Part 1 of the trilogy (which was very simple-made). This is definitely a film for teenage boys or men that lack the ability of growing up mentally."
"dsaxe2","9","1","3","10 September 2007"," Nice cat and mouse scenes
","I saw this back in August, and liked it a lot, as people can tell from the star rating.<br/><br/>The movie starts off near the end of Bourne Supremacy, than goes to the CIA figuring out the remaining details of what happened in Bourne supremacy. Soon, though, they start tracking Bourne for new reasons, and the cat and mouse scenes and action scenes start up.<br/><br/>Once the movie reaches the point where the CIA starts tracking and trying to catch Bourne, it does not pause, and has constant chase scenes, fight scenes, or cat and mouse scenes, up until around 2/3 into the movie. The occasional moments where Bourne is not going something are filled with scenes where the CIA trackers attempt to fill in details or work out problems, and these scenes keep some form of tensions going between the Bourne scenes, which start up relatively quickly. Near the end, the movie slows down, and has a few impossible stunts, which for me makes it less exciting to watch, though they were still relatively fun to see.<br/><br/>The cat and mouse scenes, where Bourne is trying to outsmart and avoid CIA trackers, or work his way through other tough situations, are my favorite in the movie, and the main thing that makes it enjoyable to see. The fight scenes and car chases aren't as good as the other Bourne movies, but take up much less time as well."
"zzhang1975","9","1","3","10 September 2007"," Just something I'd like to point out after reading some of the reviews
","It seems some people didn't notice why Bourne made the call to Noah when he was in his office, it was to get his name recorded in order to open the security case.<br/><br/>Loved the waterloo station scene, there were quite some very interesting tricks and lots of actions, though the plot was kind of on the weaker side, the acting made it up. Matt Damon did a great job and same to the supporting casts.<br/><br/>So all in all, I enjoyed watching it. During the viewing, I even didn't notice the shaky cam... did notice later after reading the reviews. I guess if one was concentrated enough it's not that obvious maybe? Anyway, now I hope the cam could be steadier..."
"charchuk","9","1","3","9 September 2007"," The perfect end to the series
","Right on par with the first two, making this series one of very few trilogies to keep a high level of quality through all three films. It's nearly impossible for me to pick a favourite, as all three are pretty similar and equally excellent, but this one certainly is an option. The action is even more intense and the story is a natural progression from Supremacy, but the film keeps the trademarks of the series and ties off a lot of the lingering plot points. While the trademarks are all there, I loved how the film updated and changed them to reflect the evolution of the character and the series. For me, the numerous references to minute plot details from the first two films made this series seem much more like a trilogy than most other film series. The acting was great, the story was gripping, the direction was superb, and the action was incredible. Pretty much a perfect summer blockbuster."

","I found the interpretation of ""Extreme Ways"" at the end of the movie far inferior to the original Moby version sang in the two other movies...... and that's about the only remotely negative thing I can say about this movie which action, from what I was able to understand, occurs between the Moscow and New York sections of Supremacy. I loved the way previous sequences got me guessing incorrectly about the final fate of a couple of characters (Nicki and the reporter). The incredible chase at the Waterloo station is as good as the one in Tangiers, as the ones in Madrid and New York, and so on.... I don't question the film makers ability to come up with a fourth movie but frankly Ultimatum ties up everything so nicely than I much rather they leave them at three. If they do (which I sincerely doubt) the Bourne trilogy will always be remembered as one of the best action series in film history."
"r-sher","4","1","3","8 September 2007"," Hard to watch, hard on the eyes -
","Big Headache - <br/><br/>I did have to close my eyes to ""watch"" much of this film in the theater. The bumpy camera work continued even during what should have been still close-ups. The sheer white burnout area of so many of the camera shots was like having a flashlight shine in my eyes every couple of milliseconds. The focus was horrible - and all over the place. Yes, I enjoy Jason Bourne, and maybe this film would be more effective on TV - but it was a very trying experience at the movies.<br/><br/>Do the stars of this picture look so bad that we should not be able to focus on them? I left the movie having a better idea of what the characters Landy and Daniels looked like than Bourne or the Stiles character.<br/><br/>Hopefully this style of camera-work it will be out of style soon.<br/><br/>So - the emperor has no clothes - this style of filming is flashy and unrelenting and makes for a painful viewing experience.<br/><br/>Enjoy the story with your eyes closed -"

","Bearing in mind that I've just got back from the cinema, I thought this third installment of Bourne absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>The film takes you to a variety of global locations accompanied by '24' style survalence and intelligence. But what really makes the film is the variety of action scenes involved, that offer suspense, fast moving thrills, and heart pounding chases.<br/><br/>To accompany such good action requires a good storyline, and the Bourne Ultimatum is not short of this. The plot is fairly simple and similar to the first two, however the style of delivery is reminiscent of the late Bond films, especially Casino Royal.<br/><br/>In short, a fantastic film that will make you want to live the action of the film."
"atushbeef","10","1","3","5 September 2007"," Bourngasm
","The crew of this movie as well as the excellent acting of Matt Damon have made this a Bourne to remember. I got chilly feelings down my spine when you see Jason, his face half in light and half in shadow, really bringing out his tormented side as he talks to the chick after the bathroom fight. Bourne totally rocks on the fight sequences, though his newfound altruistic feelings (he lets people live) did dampen my silent cheering during the movie. I wanted him to kill everyone as usual. (At least he got the guy in the bathroom.) I do feel that this movie had less of the wonderful edginess in the first two movies, which is an unwelcome change. The reason these earlier movies were such a success is that they captured Robert Ludlum's obsession with Bourne's inner struggle. If you don't believe me, try reading the books. The books are in my opinion too focused on Bourne's torment. It gets repetitive. But that torment makes for a great first two movies. The last movie is about Bourne finding himself at last. I have nothing against that, but a little more darkness would have been appreciated."

"jzappa","8","1","3","2 September 2007"," The Adventures of Government Agencies That Go Unchecked
","In 2007, one expects nearly every big-budget American film to be less than impressive. I saw The Bourne Ultimatum and was thrilled the way action movies don't always thrill anymore. It thrilled me because there is definite mind paid to the film-making and screen writing. The action sequences are not a commotion of loudness, fast cutting, and violent movement. They are masterpieces of that good old friend suspense and inimitable tension. Take the sequence at Waterloo Station for instance. In a crowded place, there is Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon with a riveting assertion of each of the major elements of his character from his lack of memory mixing with vengeful aggression towards those responsible to the rigid and infinite training he must've completed in order to be realistically near superhuman. In this place compressed with endless streams of people, he must perfectly guide a person by phone so as to evade top-notch surveillance by the CIA's leading forces while beating up or killing guys following that person, all without drawing the attention of the overwhelming crowd in the terminal. That's a suspense sequence. Sir Alfred Hitchcock is turning to his side and fluffing his pillow in mid-dream in his grave.<br/><br/>There is a fight scene in this film between Bourne and a rotten-to-the-core assassin in a crumbly apartment that is so intense that one feels as if they are involved in the fight first hand. That is what the ideal fight sequence is supposed to do. You are supposed to love the good guy, boiling with anger at each hit he suffers, and absolutely relish every hit suffered by the bad guy. Shot in such a way that sustains a rhythm of speedboat rate, and also one of those rare action sequences where dramatic acting comes into play even amidst the ultrajittery camera-work and editing, create this beautiful effect that other action films, especially the shallow ones that only serve as cash registers, wish they had.<br/><br/>A peeve of mine, while we're on the subject of flimsy Hollywood blow-em-ups that serve as one of the many reasons why the rest of the world laughs at us, is the constant use in many of those films of musical score that is orchestral yet lathered in techno beats and sounds. I really cannot stand that kind of score. The Bourne Ultimatum is one Hollywood action film that does what I never thought one would do again, which is underscore with great orchestral music. Making film score fast and suspenseful can be done with an orchestra, you know. In fact, I don't think technologically synthesized music is very engaging at all. The Bourne Ultimatum knows this. Just thought I'd add that.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass uses cinematography throughout the film that, though it is glaringly dizzying still has a subliminal effect on the audience, leaking a paranoid, nervous feeling into each scene, and we thus know, by the excessive conspicuousness of it, that we are being manipulated, putting us in Bourne's position, fueling us with a riveted clenching of our hands to the arms of our seats, bruising the forearms of our dates and mothers. Not to mention that the scenes in New York City are some of the very very best I've seen in any recent film. Winter in New York, giving the climax of the film such unexpectedly affecting urban twilight atmosphere.<br/><br/>The tight, very professionally structured script is engaging in its use of the mysterious operation Black Briar, a truly effective title for a truly evil-sounding operation, the contents of which I cannot disclose without spoiling anything, contents that are pretty topical around the edges right now for America. Let's keep making movies like this with indirect affronts to unconstitutional goings-on, giving the characters involved the same wryly indiscriminate portrayal as David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, and Albert Finney do here.<br/><br/>This was a pleasant surprise. Save for the silly, very needless and obvious final shot, this is a genuine showcase of the stuff real action adventure thrillers are made of."
"tlspuds","9","1","3","2 September 2007"," Best of the three
","Where Shrek, Pirates of the Caribean and others have blatantly over-stretched themselves simply to make more money at the box office, the Bourne series has just got better and better.

You could very easily make an argument that this is just another remake of the original film and that is the only reason I don't give it a 10/10.<br/><br/>It is what it is and if you want action, action and more action and done with a fair amount of intelligence and style, then this is a must film for you."

","Paul Greengrass's sophomore outing as director of the Jason Bourne franchise is the best yet of the series.<br/><br/>This is a sensational film, exciting and wildly entertaining. For what it sets out to be, it's nearly perfect. The other entries were also good, but what I came away praising in those were individual action scenes. In ""Ultimatum,"" I was finally impressed with the writing of this series. They're very carefully constructed in and of themselves, but what's more, they're carefully constructed AS a series, so that characters and plot lines develop throughout the films, and little hooks in each film keep enough loose ends untied to make you care about what happens next. For example, though these movies are streamlined as can be, and stick pretty closely with Bourne, one of my favorite elements in this film was the expansion of Joan Allen's role and the battle of wills that occurs between her character and her rival CIA agent, played coolly and icily by David Strathairn. And though there's nothing in this film to match the sheer technical mastery of the car chase scene in the second installment, there's a hair-raising chase in this one set amongst the rooftops and maze-like alleyways of Tangier that should go down as a classic nailbiter.<br/><br/>There hasn't been a movie this summer I've enjoyed as much as this one.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

"camelot2302","9","1","3","26 August 2007"," Jason Bourne comes storming back hard
","I never thought I'd hear myself say it but I love the Bourne trilogy more than I do James Bond. After a stunning ""Identity"" and a lacklustre ""Supremacy"", Bourne is back in full force with ""Ultimatum"".<br/><br/>Once again, the big bad CIA totally gets the wrong end of the stick by assuming that Bourne is a mole, revealing classified intelligence documents to a London journalist. After a gun battle at Waterloo train station, Bourne goes on the run, determined to prove once again that he is not Langley's enemy, while Langley has already decided that Bourne should die. They send their ""best"" assassins after him but they don't realise (or don't seem to remember) that Bourne IS the best. Cue lots of battles and high body counts.<br/><br/>For the next 2 hours, we go all over the world as Bourne is finally determined to find out once and for all who he really is, how he got into the dirty business of killing and also to find a corrupt CIA station chief who holds the key to Bourne's past (but who is also targeted for assassination by the CIA for betraying them).<br/><br/>What I particularly love about the Bourne movies is that you are thrown right into the fighting scenes so when Bourne punches someone, you kind of feel the blow yourself. The camera gets right into the middle of the action, so close up that you can smell the adrenalin and sweat of those in the scene.<br/><br/>I also like how you can relate to Bourne on an emotional level. He is not the macho flawless fighting machine that James Bond is sometimes made out to be. This is a guy who is flawed, vulnerable, scared and in search of his identity. All he really wants is to be left alone and he only fights when he has to, when his back is to the wall and there truly is no other way out.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that they tragically under-used Scott Glenn and Albert Finney. These extremely talented actors should have been given more screen time.<br/><br/>A very enjoyable movie and definitely on the same level as ""Identity"".

","this film was a brilliant edge of your seat action movie. the story picks up from the action ended in the second film not were the second ended despite what you may have heard.<br/><br/>i hear you're still looking for me- this line from the second movie was more like an preview of what was to come. <br/><br/>The story was brilliant although there were times when the action ran on for bit too long and came close to losing the plot. this was the only thing that was wrong with the film. The action was however intense and exciting at the same time and this was without a doubt the most violent one in the series. <br/><br/>As someone who has read the books i've found that they weren't very true to the books, the idea is still there but considering how different the world has become since the books were written this is understandable. <br/><br/>Also they've only just touched the surface of his past, but if i hadn't read the books i would have been disappoint by the fact that there's not much new you find out about him. for obvious i'm not going to say what that is. <br/><br/>despite this, it's worth every penny and should be worth seeing if you like the first two. 10/10"

","Matt Damon was born to play Jason Bourne! His is not a pretty boy mug but it's likable and interesting enough, intelligence, earnestness and determination is alive in his eyes, and he has a bod that seems developed by actual fights and not by some cushy gym, all of which comprise a winning combination that makes him believable as Hollywood's fave spy of the season. <br/><br/>Julia Stiles reprises her role as CIA Nicky Parsons. She finally has a meatier role in this installment of the Bourne series, and she proves she is built of equally strong stuff, not necessarily physically, as she holds her own screen presence with Damon. The tension and mystery is sustained (are they ex-lovers? Siblings? Partners?) and her wordless expressions are just as raw and powerful as Damon's adrenaline-pumping fight scenes.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, Bourne Supremacy) really made the most of the singular, tying-it-all-together plot, despite it having a not exactly neat ending. The supporting cast is just as solid: Albert Finney as the mysterious Dr. Albert Hirsch who recurs in Bourne's flashbacks, Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, the most powerful woman in the CIA who knows how Bourne operates best, and David Strathairn as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen is so hateful you could imagine him to probably be the kid everyone picked on in school.<br/><br/>The action sequences and the spartan storyline is refreshingly old school and you don't feel manipulated in a way that the effects are out to wow you. You just feel for Bourne as he tries to discover who he really is, even if it means ending everything he's known for the past three years that he's lost his identity.<br/><br/>The series are just based on the Bourne books by Robert Ludlum, so don't bother comparing the two because they are not identical (i.e. Nicky is said to not be in any of the books); appreciate them separately."

"anifanmc","10","1","3","22 August 2007"," Fantastic ending to a soon-to-become legendary spy trilogy
","As the followup movie to The Bourne Supremacy, Ultimatum thrills, excites, and never fails. As a masterpiece of action, this film rockets from one action scene to the next without dipping into (much) unrealism and retaining the solid grit of real-time espionage, far removed from the rather bubbling optimism and invulnerability of the older Bond movies.<br/><br/>The story picks up exactly where Supremacy left off, with Bourne heavily injured in Moscow after tracking down the daughter of Vladimir Neski and apologizing to her for her parents' death. The story jumps ahead a month and a half into the future and the existence of a new black ops program called ""Blackbriar"" (alluded to in the first film) is revealed as an upgrade to Treadstone 71. This organization has the illegal authorization to murder anyone that its handlers deem necessary. A reporter stumbles upon the information from an inside source and following publication, is targeted by the same organization. Bourne tracks him down in order to find out who the source is, inadvertently causing the black ops team to believe Bourne is the source. Only director Pamela Landy, having understood Bourne's motives, is aware of the real circumstances surrounding Bourne and believes him innocent, and combined with her heavy disapproval of Blackbriar causes her to aid Bourne in his quest to discover the initial mastermind behind Treadstone.<br/><br/>Bourne enlists the help of CIA analyst and psychologist Nicky Parsons, fresh from the previous film, in order to discover the identity of the handlers at Blackbriar while being tracked by assassins across Europe and North Africa. Upon locating the headquarters of Blackbriar in New York City, he returns home to discover the horrible secret involving both his true identity and the brutal process of his induction into Treadstone 71.<br/><br/>The film manages to keep the storyline simple, yet enthrall the viewer and allow them to understand what is going on without boring them. A few key elements distinguish Ultimatum from its predecessors, including the presence of multiple car chases with sharp, kinetic action sequences instead of a single, drawn out chase. As the final act in a trilogy, Ultimatum is also chock-full of references to its predecessors and lines are echoed which, in context, finally make sense. Subtle and not-so-subtle elements of suspense are combined in conjunction with good scripting to make one very, very good movie."

"travelducky2","8","1","3","20 August 2007"," *Insert your favorite play on the word 'Born' here*
","Extremely entertaining! It was my least favorite of the three, but still better than most other movies out there. The steadi-cam horse has pretty much been beat to death, so I'll leave it alone and move on.<br/><br/>In the first movie, treadstone was portrayed as a niche of bad guys in an otherwise decent government machine. Somehow, we've shifted to the idea that pretty much everyone except the two attractive female costars is either spineless or evil. And while we're on the subject of the Bourne-girls, I have to wonder why they even invited Julia Styles to show up. Admittedly, I haven't read the books, so I don't know how much (or how little) a part her character played. She's an amazing actress, tho, and could really have kicked this movie to a higher level if they had just given her something to do. Maybe that's in the works for Bournes 4-6, I don't know.<br/><br/>All said and done, tho, this series is about kicking a$$, taking names, and finding new and creative ways to use books, towels, magazines, and oscillating fans to survive against the odds. In that arena, no other movie in recent history (since the last one, in fact) comes close."
"bobbobwhite","8","1","3","20 August 2007"," What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
","Yeah, maybe, if it doesn't wear you down so much that you die an old man at 40. Bourne had as much physical activity in this film as a typical person has in a lifetime, so dying at 40 doesn't seem too young for him. No sleep, constant travel, running, fighting, shooting, tension, worry, no love, no sex, etc. ...it made me need a nap just watching it. That said, I enjoyed the totally unrealistic chase throughout, as it was just one long and glorified chase flick, with top non-stop action and technicals...the first non-stop action film I've seen, even though Live Free or Die Hard came close. Bourne had to snuff tough assassins wholesale, avoid supernatural surveillance electronics(no one really thinks that stuff exists, do they? If so, get real. That was the gov't, folks.), resist one potential sexual encounter, and stay on his one-track-mind pursuit all the way to the ""end"". What a job, and who could ever have the fitness and energy for all that? But, what fun it all was to watch.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was at his stone-faced best, and the great Joan Allen as a CIA sub-boss nearly stole the show and still looks great and so trim. David Strathairn as the evil CIA boss was OK, but no way would the real CIA ever let a HQ headman have hair that long. Why do filmmakers let actors keep their hair the way they have it when they show up for filming when it is not realistic for the role? Details, details.<br/><br/>More detail nitpicks department: why do you think the filmmaker had to tell us(ignorant dopes?)each time in writing when the action went to these cities, that Paris is in France, London is in England, and Madrid is in Spain? Maybe he thought we might mistake unforgettable views of the Paris skyline for that of Paris, Texas? Jeez, even people from Texas know better than that. Maybe.<br/><br/>Entertaining movie overall, even if 99% of it was unreal fantasy. These days, movie cartoons are live action films with real people playing the cartoon parts, but make no mistake, they are still cartoons. Bugs Bunny...eat your heart out!"
"tsatsas","9","1","3","20 August 2007"," More of the same makes this top notch fun!
","The last time we saw Jason Bourne, he was on a search to find the one's who killed his girlfriend, finding those responsible he dealt with them. Before that he was on a path to recovering his mind with questions flying everywhere. Fighting his way through two movies with a strong silent sadness, we all know what he's after. Answers. Where did he come from? How was he made? Is he just the product of a company running experiments on mind control, or is he something special? This is a man, who can't remember his past, or how he can kill the way he does. All he wants to do is rememberand he wants it very, very badly. If you've been living in a place that doesn't recognize some of the best spy-thrillers in recent years, The Bourne franchise is an espionage Hollywood actioner based on the books by Robert Ludlum, and helmed by director Doug (Swingers) Liman and since the second film, Brit maker Paul Greengrass. What makes these films affective is that it is blockbuster action, done by filmmakers who are very comfortable in the low budget independent world of film-making. Without the use of over the top special affects and unbelievable plot lines, we have a new franchise that is taking things back to basics, successfully drawing in the audience with its powerhouse rawness and suspense high enough that the skin around the tips of your fingers will surely bleed due to the absence of fingernails. So in the third and unlikely final installment of this now trilogy, how does director Paul Greengrass keep the hits coming? Merely days after The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne gets sucked into the killing of a British Journalist who was close to uncovering the truth behind the CIA's involvement within the Treadstone project. A new conspiracy emerges, people start chasing him again, and so Bourne follows his new leads with the help of some old friends. The story gives the audience answers, and since Greengrass has more than proved how capable he is at handling this material (""Supremacy"", ""United 93"" anyone?) he raises the bar with the action even higher. The film moves with a pace so fast you can get lost in where a cut is made in the editing, and where another begins. The shaky camera work (although hated by many) stems from an independent field of movie making which beautifully and sometimes disturbingly puts the audience right in the middle of Bourne's confrontations. This is more than ""edge of your seat action""; this is an adrenaline cocktail of stunning camera work, great choreography and state of the art stunt work. Its swallows other films of the genre with an expressionless modesty, with the director unwillingly proving to us something he already knew long before we did. Paul Greengrass has to be the most promising filmmaker of the genre today, and his time to shine is very much upon us. With a satisfying gulp of closure oozing down the throats of those going to see The Bourne Ultimatum, the long hard impatient time of waiting for the follow up will begin the moment the credits role. Or if we are lucky enough, our man from London may grab the reigns of another soon to be made project, which will undoubtedly hold infinite possibilities in the progression of indie film-making, and some solid action movies. This films holds a lot of what many of us have been waiting for, and feeds us more Bourne than many of us will know how to chew. An action trilogy is now complete, yet many of us will still shout out ""Bring on Bourne 4"", oh please do."

His supporting cast also hit the mark, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Julia Stiles and even though smaller parts Albert Finney and Scott Glenn all give credible and believable performances.<br/><br/>The Direction is superb, Paul Greengrass certainly has ability in the buckets full. The tension never really drops, the action never really drops and the quality he gets out the cast, from the big guns to the bit players never really drops either.<br/><br/>The script like the previous two movies is first class, nobody in the movie has any uninteresting lines of dialogue or any over the top scenario's.<br/><br/>I have to mention the action in more detail. Whats exceptional about it is it feels real and plausible. Its no CGI monster this one, the visual effects and stunt coordinators earned their money with some out-standing set pieces.

","Just got back from seeing the Bounre Ultimatum and it was awesome! Matt Damon and Julia Stilles did a great job on the acting, so did the actors who played Pam Landy and Noah Vosen. The story was amazing.. pulled me in once I saw Jason limping with a bullet wound in his shoulder and leg w/ all the flashbacks. And the ending was great, didn't expect it. <br/><br/>The fight scenes were great, the camera was still shaky in a lot of the shots, but I liked it. Very suspenseful scene (SPOILERS AHEAD!!) when Desh, assassin, was after Jason and Nikki. I thought Desh was about to kill Nikki, but Bourne jumped off one of a rooftops and jumped through the window: and the fight began. (END OF SPOILER) <br/><br/>That was my favorite scene. The ending was great and I thought (SPOILER AHEAD!!!) the Bourne series was going to start all over again because he got shot in the back twice by Noah and jumped about 10 stories off a building and lands into the water, even some of the shots of him under the water were almost the same from Identity. Then at the end, they have a news footage about the whole Tredstone/ Blackbauer project thing and arresting Noah and the creator of this project, Dr. Alan (I think that's his name), and Nikki smiles once she hears the words: ""David Webb, known as Jason Bourne, was shot in the back twice by Noah Vosen and fell from a 10 story building and into the water. His body is still not found, but we're still looking for it."" She miles, Extreme Ways by Moby starts playing and then the final shot of the Bourne series: Jason swimming off. (END OF SPOILER!!!) <br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is a great movie, I think in my opinion, the best one ever made. It's a HUGE improvement fromt he Supremacy. If you think Ultimatum won't be as good because its the 3rd and sequel to the not soo good 2nd one, you'd be fooled and wrong. It's an awesome movie, #5 on the best action movie ever made on IMDb.com. There is another car chase sequence in the film, and this time, it's much bigger, and better than the ones in Identity and Supremacy. Two thumbs way up and 4 stars! <br/><br/>I recommend ANYONE to see it, you don't need to see the first two in order to see Ultimatum, you'll get it from the moment it draws you in."

With the summer ending The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the last movies of the summer. With two great predecessors how does the end of the trilogy do? Well it does AWESOME making it one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Once again Matt Damon plays a great Jason Bourne. he really understands the mood that Jason Bourne has been given. The action scenes are intense with everything from guns, punches, and makeshift weapons. The shaky cam might throw off some people but personally I didn't mind it. This is a must see and if you haven't seen the other two Bourne's yet go see them!"
"annillabean16","10","1","3","8 August 2007"," it's in MY top 10
","There is only one word that can capture this movie's essence: amazing. I am almost at a loss for words in attempting to describe the genius of this film. Greengrass has attained a new level in direction; the shaky footage made the film more real, as though it were unplanned, that everything was happening right then, right there. He seemed to take a spy's approach - coming into shots at different angels and making quick cuts as Bourne surveyed his surroundings. As it ended, I let my chin dust the floor, overcome by a sense of awe. What great minds must have imagined such a story and how they did it.. is so unfathomable to me. Wow. I will never forget this film, nor its predecessors. While one may it describe Ultimatum as having nonstop action, that does not imply that it lacks in plot or genius. It is the epitome of a complete package. It does not insult the viewer's intelligence; not everything is spelled out for you and that is exactly what makes it so incredible. If anyone were to ask, I would not hesitate in advising and encouraging them to watch this movie, unless, of course, they are very squeamish, because there are some intense fight scenes. Alright, my tangent is done, but for four words: GO SEE 'THE ULTIMATUM'!"
"tillc","9","1","3","6 August 2007"," Ultimatum Lives Up to Its Predecessors
","http://www.ParcEntertainment.com<br/><br/>http://FrameRate.blog.com<br/><br/>I quickly found out by watching The Bourne Ultimatum that I can hold my breath for about 100 minutes. The intensity and energy of this film is unbelievable and easily lives up to the previous two installments. Ultimatum rounds out the trilogy nicely, but it left me hoping for a fourth adventure.<br/><br/>Part three begins exactly where part two left off. In fact, as complicated as it may sound, some events in Ultimatum actually coincide with events that were seen in Supremacy. The chronology of the two films overlap in places, which I found quite a remarkable achievement for the writers and continuity people on the crew. For example, the very last scene of Supremacy shows up about 3/4 of the way into Ultimatum, and yet the two stories are completely different.<br/><br/>Matt Damon again reprises his role as the infamous forgetful assassin, Jason Bourne - the product of a top secret CIA behavioral moderation program. But the memories of his past still prove elusive and he still yearns to put all the pieces together. His hope of uncovering the past lies with a British journalist, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) who has a source within the CIA who holds the answers. As Bourne picks up the trail to find this informant, top CIA man Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) and his team work tirelessly to keep the lid on tight. And if that means killing Bourne in the process - so be it.<br/><br/>The action of this film starts at the very onset and doesn't let up. The viewer is taken to locales all over the world, including Turin, Italy; Tangier, Morocco; Madrid, Spain, and New York City. Once again Bourne proves to be a smart operative, dodging the CIA's hit squad and staying once step ahead of the guys in Langley. The entire film is hip, intelligent, and clever, without being overly-complicated. The plot is easy enough to follow, but is similar in places to The Bourne Identity. The story doesn't quite separate itself from the original as Supremacy managed to do.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass, who helmed Supremacy, once again takes on the chores of directing. His documentary style of shooting puts the audience right in the action, with enough subjective hand-held shots and shaky camera work to make anyone nauseous. Greengrass would have done well to pull out on some of these fight scenes and car chases to give us more establishing shots. It's very disorienting to the point of distracting. Often it's difficult to tell just exactly what's going on.<br/><br/>Matt Damon fills the role of Jason Bourne nicely, blending cold intensity with a sense of vulnerability. However, more attention was placed on characterization in The Bourne Identity than in The Bourne Ultimatum. It seemed to be all action with no depth of character. The fault here lies with Greengrass, who apparently didn't want to take the time to flesh out the characters and their motivations. What comes across is a cast of so-so performances, when (with a little attention) they could have been just as explosive as the action.<br/><br/>In all, The Bourne Ultimatum is raw and intense with a ton of action - spectacular fight scenes, car chases, and gun battles. Bourne is the new Bond."

","The Bourne Ultimatum is a mix of action, some drama, and the ultimate movie. I was really happy about this movie even if I thought it wasn't going to be as good as the first one (The Bourne Supremacy) Id recommend it to teens and adults but NOT for young kids and children. I really liked Matt Damons character this time: Stealthy with a bit of loyal characteristic as David (A.K.A) Jason Bourne. I really think this is the best movie out of the rest and it will make a huge hit for the next one to be a even better hit. This movie is definitely for the type of person looking for action, drama, and even looking for some romance!<br/><br/>My rating 10/10"
"rc_whittle","9","1","3","6 August 2007"," Damon Dynamic in Best of Bourne.
","This review contains NO SPOILERS for this movie - ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". There are some SPOILERS for ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"".<br/><br/>Firstly if you're a fan of Robert Ludlum's books don't look to the movies as a comparison. The movies follow an entirely different plot through the entire series and there is no continuity between them.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity took us through Bourne's first ventures into self-discovery after waking up on a trawler without any idea who he was. The end of the story left him with his girlfriend (played by Franke Potente) romantically reuniting at her beach front store. <br/><br/>""Identity"" was a defining thriller because it had been a long time since we'd seen a credible ""secret agent"" with a serious thriller tone that had a fulfilling plot and glut of fulfilling action sequences. Add to that a series of cameo characters (such as Children of Men's Clive Owen) and ""Identity"" had it all and rightfully has become a fondly remembered example of the genre. 8/10<br/><br/>The first sequel - ""The Bourne Supremacy"" - took us directly from the end of ""Identity"" where very soon Bourne's girlfriend is shot dead and Bourne goes on the hunt for revenge and carries out his threat that he issued in ""Identity"" that if the CIA unit that created him ever came after him he would bring the fight back to their door.<br/><br/>""Supremacy"" desperately seemed to lack any actual ""support"" from the supporting cast. Whilst Damon is an accomplished actor one man rarely if ever holds an entire movie. A Russian speaking Karl Urban did little to present a charismatic bad guy.<br/><br/>""Supremacy"" disappointed in terms of the action sequences and in terms of a fully developed plot. The lack of any role for a supporting cast almost rendered ""Supremacy"" a thorough waste of time. There were, however, some bright moments, and some character development.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>In watching ""Supremacy"" in fact it was my initial feeling that I had watched a movie that was simply intended as a bridge to another sequel. I feel I was right for more reasons than I could imagine but you'll have to see all three films to know what I mean.<br/><br/>Cue the second sequel or ""Threequel""  a popular trend this year - ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". <br/><br/>I would recommend anyone thinking of seeing ""Ultimatum"" to watch or re-watch both ""Identity"" but particularly ""Supremacy"" as everything will make more sense  particularly, and I think I can say this without spoiling anything, the sequence in New York City.<br/><br/>As is now expected with a ""Bourne movie"" one is treated to vistas of cities across the world. It has a Bond-esquire feeling if only for the fact that we are repeatedly treated to the sounds and sights of spectacular cities and magnificent vistas.<br/><br/>This time out the journey feels much more natural and plot driven and it takes us back to the roller-coaster feeling we had in ""Identity"".<br/><br/>Matt Damon is superb throughout  his acting chops have considerably improved over the past decade or so since we saw him in the 2002 release of ""The Bourne Identity"".<br/><br/>In ""Ultimatum"" Bourne is fearsome, awesome, and devastating. It no longer feels like it's just a character  this time Bourne has a persona  and he can be petrifying with every carefully choreographed movement.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles has had a checkered career thus far  granted she's only 26 now in 2007. Sometimes Julia Stiles reminds me of a ""Star Trek"" holographic character  but one with only two or three programmed personas. <br/><br/>Stiles has perfected and should have maybe patented the character I would call ""What-ev-r""  or ""Valley girl with bad attitude"". As for her other setting - she has always seemed to work to great perfection that character of ""Scared bunny rabbit"" or ""Deer in the headlights"". There is, I suppose a third, but to be kind to Ms Stiles - Let's quickly skip over her performances as ""Reluctant White Urban Dance Princess"".<br/><br/>So  I'm writing about Julia Stiles, the actor, as 'Nicky Parsons"" and perhaps I should have always limited myself to that. <br/><br/>Here in ""Ultimatum"", Stiles seems to have found a way to rewrite her own programming and has come up with a more than acceptable actress. She's not a Charlize Theron or a Nicole Kidman yet  but her improvements are unmistakable. Stiles seems smart and genuine even in this limited role.<br/><br/>To summarize, This is by far the best of the Bourne movie series. You need to have seen the others to understand the whole story  but this is a definite high point in this franchise that can be enjoyed stand-alone.<br/><br/>Matt Damon deserves acclaim for a truly memorable performance. <br/><br/>The action sequences will leave you breathless, the story is intense and reminiscent of one of the Harrison Ford ""Jack Ryan"" movies, and the trademark shaky camera now seems successful in conveying the organic quality that was intended.<br/><br/>""Identity"" felt like it succeeded on youthful exuberance taking it to the very edge. ""Supremacy"" felt like a dutiful but near-blind old workhorse, willing but unable to find it's true path. ""Ultimatum"" feels like a truly purposeful and yet unrestrained stallion of a thriller.<br/><br/>See it in the theatre  it's well worth it for such a great ride.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Finally some notes on awards.<br/><br/>Award worthy performances for supporting cast come from Joan Allen reprising her role as ""Pamela Landy"" and the excellent Albert Finney as ""Dr Albert Hirsch"".<br/><br/>Notably, 71-year-old Finney has never won an Oscar, despite being nominated 5 times (most notably as supporting actor for 2001's ""Erin Brokovich"" and for leading actor in the 1974 production of ""Murder on the Orient Express""). It's about time, methinks."

","It's rare that a third installment of a movie is as good or better than the previous two. The action is incredible and the acting so rich that it begs to be a TV series because you just don't want the story to end. I saw someone mention where this is the ""American Bond"" and I would agree. It would be great to see even more Bourne movies but I don't know that Damon would want to star in any more and it just wouldn't be the same series without him. Make sure you don't miss this in the theatres because the action is not too be missed on the biggest screen available. Adding the likes of David Strathairn, Albert Finney and Scott Glenn just keeps the cast first rate."

","This is the perfect action movie and perfect action movie series. It has everything you want in a good action movie. Dynamite chase scenes, amazingly choreographed fight scenes, deep character backgrounds, a compelling story, and incredible and unique camera work. Also, the story leaves off at a cliffhanger. This opens the door to even further sequels, which i'm sure would only make everyone happy.<br/><br/>Usually sequels to movies turn out to ruin the series, especially when you get to the third movie. I think this movie puts the ""Bourne"" movies into the upper echelon of action movie series. Don't be surprised if you hear people say that the ""Bourne"" series is better than the ""Die Hard"" series. I certainly believe that."

","Take an Atavan before seeing this movie as Bourne Ultimatum will have you squirming, clenching, cheering and jeering from start to finish. Matt Damon is delicious. Much better use of many of the actors from previous Bourne movies. V. thought provoking and timely story. From the locations to the excellent support acting (hello Paddy Considine? brilliant!) to the looping storyline to the tight editing (only 111 min.) this movie is nearly flawless.

","Great movie, very entertaining and great ending....but geeezz... <br/><br/>I had a headache 5 minutes into the film! Every scene- regardless of mood - was shot with an excessive amount of ""shake, vibrate, move, quick-pan, zoom-in, zoom-out, etc"" technique. :( good grief!<br/><br/>The following is very ""opinionated"" and subjective I suppose... <br/><br/>I like the use of these techniques(shaking/zooming/partially obscuring subjects with foreground objects or people) in films like Babel or Saving Private Ryan, but this one went way way overboard with it and hence the effectiveness (of the camera) is quickly destroyed, because there's no visual dynamic to contrast dramatic to subdued scenes. <br/><br/>Its great stuff at times, but I shouldn't have to guess at what MIGHT be happening in the fight scenes, and sort of make up my own version as it plays out in front of me... ""ok, I guess there he twisted his arm and, wow! that must have been a kick or something...and oh dude! what happened then? I guess maybe he stabbed him or something"". And I shouldn't have to wonder ""why is the camera shaking, jerking, zooming, panning left/right during this subdued scene with regular conversation between 2 people??"" <br/><br/>Music varies with scenes to convey the intended mood, right?... Well, if there's no effort to vary the cinematography techniques to convey the mood of individual scenes, isn't that like painting a picture of a grassy field against a sunset and using red for the grass and red for the sun and red for the sky? ...imho. <br/><br/>I don't know - some people might like it constantly shaking with no attention to ""composition"" (in its classic sense) and no slow steady dramatic pans- but I need a little break from the jerky movement occasionally.<br/><br/>Great film otherwise... great ending too."

The director did a good job of shot locations(when you can see them!) production was also good. Action is great and mostly believable, unlike transporter 2. No major gaffes for a great action movie. Just the choice of blue tint the entire movie and of course wild and wacky shaky camera /cut scenes. Would have been an eight or nine but the camera work just was too disjointing to get any feel for the real action going on...it almost makes one wonder how back in the old days they showed action without CGI and shaky camera.

Ultimatum is a great movie- action packed, but with a good plot, good acting, good script,etc. I guess there's not as much of a plot as the other two movies, but it doesn't matter.

"saboonoir","6","2","11","3 August 2007"," Overdone, anyone?
","I went to see this movie at 12:01 on Firday morning; the earliest showing on the first day of its release. I absolutely loved the first and second movies, and was in such great anticipation of this third installment that I believed that the movie would do nothing but exceed my high expectations of it. This was partly because of the return of Paul Greengrass (the talented director of the kinetic and well-paced Bourne Supremacy) and partly because, hell, I wanted to see more of the clever and quasi-realistic action that had been initialized by the first movie and faithfully perpetuated by the second. Why should I think 'Ultimatum' would be any different? After seeing it, I still can't answer that question. Yes, there were still a few of the Macgyver-esquire clever moments, and blistering chase scenes, and plenty of bad guys getting the pudding beaten out of them, but it all just seemed so campy compared to the judicial placement of sequences like these in the previous installments. I think it will suffice to say that I didn't like the camera. Whatever effect Greengrass's choppy editing and washed-out color scheme did for the second movie, it was hugely overdone in 'Ultimatum'. What's the point of having a fight scene if the audience can't see what's going on? Instead of a clear view of the fight, the audience is strangely forced to focus on Matt Damon's left eyebrow, and the existence of loud punching noises. I also hated the potential love interest of *secret mystery character*. It was poorly placed, and a little contrive: there had been absolutely no reference, not even a hinting at the existence of such attractions in the previous films. Moments like this abound throughout the movie; inexplicable, arbitrary revelations and the convenient acquiring of crucial information take place, it seems, just for the sake of moving the movie along with little regard to adequate explanation. Furthermore, cheesy one-liners which, I'm happy to say, were absent from the first two movies, seemed to run obtusely against the grain of the established seriousness of the genre. Moments like the return of the quote first uttered by a dying assassin in the first movie could have been kinda cool, if they didn't play on the overdone and campy aspects of the movie. All of this, in conjunction with a flashback scene taken, it seems, straight out of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (you'll see the connection) and a terrible attempt at integrating music from a British punk band covering the original ""Extreme Ways"" by Moby into the end credits, seem to drown out the admirable struggle of Matt Damon to keep Jason Bourne as badass as he always was. It's possible that my expectations of this movie were simply too high to be satisfied, but I just can't help but think that the given formula of the other films offered Greengrass plenty to work with without him marring this one with kitsch and convenience."

","Movie goers should stick together and punish all movies made with monkey-cam (shaky-cam) by giving a 1-star rating.

Does this review contain spoilers? There is nothing to spoil here."
"rohoso","1","1","4","8 December 2018"," Lacks every aspect that makes a good movie
","The Bourne Ultimatum is a movie with a generic action movie plot.
I am not the biggest fan of pure action movies but I can enjoy some fun explosions.
I will (as respectful as possible) try to explain why The Bourne Ultimatum even fails to be that. I really tried not to be sarcastic but it didn't work at all times...
Also I do not throw around 1-star ratings easily.
I seriously could not find a single good aspect about this movie.
Here is why:<br/><br/>1) Plot
The generic plot that was made up for this movie only makes up about 5% of the movie, the rest is chase scenes. This is not exaggerated. It is easy to forget why Jason Bourne is chased in the first place because the plot is just sprinkled here and there to justify 2 hours of chasing.
And then there is this role of the heroic woman that seems weirdly forced maybe to put a strong woman into the movie.
Last there is the professional killer who doesn't shoot Bourne because he makes him question why he should kill him. This seems like a typical deus ex machina since this is not at all justified by the plot.
Also the 2 last scenes where totally unneccessary, even made it worse. It seemed like this was decided in the editing phase: A cut of one actress with a TV and some edited in news show, then some footage of Bourne in the water when he swam back to the surface and the camera was still running.<br/><br/>2) Believability/VFX
Despite the plot weaknesses the movie could have been fun if the chase scenes and visual effects would have been believable or visually pleasing.
Most of the stunts where over the top, not action movie over the top but in a ridiculous way. This were several certain deaths he survived.
Everything from explosions to sparks looked incredibly fake when they could easily have used real ones. And CGI was also way better at the time.
Also the audience is supposed to believe that the protagonist shakes off local policemen through back alleys in a foreign city. It is as if he was born and raised there.<br/><br/>3) Cinematography
-This can still be used for killing some time so how do we make it completely unwatchable?- must have been what someone said while making this movie.
The cinematographer did it! Every single scene, and this is not exaggerated either, is shaky.
When I say shaky I do not mean simply hand held. I mean that every close up, every computer screen, every little detail and of course every action scene is filmed as if the cinematographer filmed with parkinsons on an old mobile phone.
I might be sensitive but I had to look away a few times because I got a headache from the blurry images.<br/><br/>4) Editing/SFX
Better be safe that noone is able to enjoy the movie: The whole movie is cut as if the editor went cold turkey in the middle of cutting.
Most scenes only last a few frames and they begin and end with a larger camera motion almost every time.
This suits the cinematography well which is not a good thing.
Sound effects are often off timing and sound cheesy/cartoonish."
"cinephile-27690","4","1","4","11 July 2018"," Not memorable
","I do not remember a darn thing about this. I did not see any of the movies and that may have helped. Hardly any of it was good and I thought it sucked. Please skip this.
2007 movies I recommend: Norbit, Daddy's Little Girls, Ratatouille, Shrek The 3rd, Bridge To Terabitha, Are We Done Yet, Firehouse Dog, The Simpsons Movie, Pirates/At World's End, Evan Almighty,and many more.
Better Matt Damon Movies: Saving Private Ryan, We Bought A Zoo, The Departed, and more.
These are movies you should see. Not this."
"tieman64","Null","1","4","22 March 2013"," Enjoy your egg whites
","""At the root of Bond is something neo-fascistic and totally materialist."" - John Le Carre <br/><br/>The Bourne franchise stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a kind of anti-James Bond who, though a secret agent trained by the CIA, finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against Treadstone, a Black-Ops arm of the US military.<br/><br/>As action movies go, ""The Bourne Identity"" is stronger than most. The best of its franchise, ""Identity"" features a number of low-key and inventive action sequences, most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn. Bourne's quick thinking, unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers, the opposite of Bond, who's always playing catch up.<br/><br/>The film's sequels, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", merely rehash the franchise's first film, emulating its ""running man"" plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences, blow for blow. What was once fresh quickly becomes stale, and Bourne's ""ingenious"" battle tactics now rarely surprise. <br/><br/>Still, both films contain a number of subplots which aren't usually found in Western action movies. Here Bourne, once a state sanctioned assassin, tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins. Elsewhere he colludes with whistle-blowers and left-wing newspapers (The Guardian, itself slowly dying in real life), attempting to expose a CIA which routinely engages in off-the-grid criminal activities (in real life, they'd brazenly assassinate the leaders of, or engender coups in, Congo, Morocco, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mozambique, Guyana etc). This is a far cry from James Bond (""Goldfinger"", we recall, opens with Bond blowing up the oil supplies of Latin American revolutionaries). Bond's the Imperialist's, misogynistic foot-soldier, Bourne's a disillusioned grunt in an age of Bradley Manning, Jullian Assange and John Kiriakou, which of course makes him a threat. As journalist Kevin Gosztola observed, ""To this day, the only CIA officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody."" <br/><br/>Bourne is himself both whistle-blower and action hero. A John Rambo for liberals, his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia, to direct confrontation. He attempts to expose and remember, whilst the CIA attempts to cover up and silence. This aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers; the State is the enemy, and Bourne's a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer. Indeed, when pitted against foreign agents, Bond repeatedly says ""my argument is not with you"". Unlike Bond, a relic of the Cold War, Bourne's decidedly post-Cold War. <br/><br/>Bond's always had a very rigid sense of self-identity (""The name's Bond. James Bond.""). Bourne, though, doesn't remember his name, his past, his identity, and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesn't recognise. The locales our globe-trotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable; everywhere looks the same. Bourne's both representative of a culture that doesn't really know what it stands for, and one which can't morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identities.<br/><br/>Whilst a ""liberal action film"" is some kind of contradiction (the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc), the Bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things. Women are consistently the film's moral guardians, Bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons, the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation (water and water-boarding, continual motifs in the franchise, led to the very creation of Bourne) and Bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with ""what represents me?"" (and by extension, America). While Bond's your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown, country and offshore escapades, the Bourne franchise ultimately deals with Bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption; he chose to be Jason Bourne. He is culpable.<br/><br/>No surprise then that Doug Liman, who directed ""Identity"", has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the Iran-Contra Affair. And Paul Greengrass, director of ""Supremacy"" and ""Ultimatum"", is himself a left-leaning Cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmaker.<br/><br/>The most interesting of the franchise, ""The Bourne Legacy"" was released in 2012. It starred Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another Black-Ops CIA agent. The film again rehashes the Bourne formula – Cross is pursued by the CIA, who again want him silenced – but also does a number of interesting, new things. It's explicitly concerned, for example, with issues of collusion and participation. How can organisms like Bourne and Bond exist, if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society? In ""Legacy's"" case, Cross maps a network of globe-spanning factory workers, scientists, politicians, engineers, all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal CIA project. Fascism, then, depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity, ignorance, compartmentalisation, collusion, separation, disavowal and outright secrecy. When the CIA project – Operation Outcome – is exposed, it then quickly evaporates, like shadow exposed to light. Members are hunted down, agents are ""suicided"", and scientists are reassigned or murdered. Such murders recall countless historical events. Regimes, from Ancient Rome to even 21st century democratic states, tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposure.<br/><br/>As an action movie ""Legacy"" is weak. A stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour. The film contains sequences involving Predator Drones, now the weapon of choice for the US military when it comes to naked war crimes. Recent legislation essentially makes it ""legal"" for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people. Accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipso-facto reclassified as ""terrorists"", ""insurgents"" or, as has happened several times, simply ""animals"" (dogs or cows). Of course Bourne and Bond are themselves drones. But while Bourne wants escape, Bond's the kind of guy sent to silence him.<br/><br/>7.9/10 - Worth one viewing."
"pj-hack","3","1","4","27 December 2011"," The Bourne Predicament
","Yet another offering with a soundtrack thumping away in the background and an editor suffering from St Vitus' Dance. Are all current film production people unable to make a film where a scene does not change to another view after 0.93 seconds? Do they ALL assume that the audience need junk music every second to keep their interest? Why the relentless pace, lack of establishing shots, even a pause for breath? Then I changed my way of watching this film. Put the sub-titles on and mute the sound. Ah, thats much better. It does seem to me that the cartoon films (coming out in great numbers these days) do pretty good at mimicking human characteristics and the action films, showing humans in the starring roles, are now given the attributes that years back were only available to Tom and Jerry."
"Lobstros","2","1","4","9 March 2010"," One of the worst ""realistic"" action movies ever produced
","How, oh how, can I movie that presents itself as ""realistic action"" that features 50 officially recognized goofs get a rating of 8.2? Simple: viewers have essentially no standards for what comprises an effective action movie.<br/><br/>There are essentially two routes that an action movie can take to be successful: -It can be cheesy, fast, fun, over-the-top and unbelievable with larger than life characters.<br/><br/>-It can be rough, raw, intense, realistic, and stay within the confines and limitations of real people.<br/><br/>These two sub-genres of action should be mutually exclusive. The Bourne Ultimatum tries, unsuccessfully, to blend the two together in what can only be described as a train-wreck of a movie. The plot is a mix of sensible ordeals and unrealistic conspiracy that plays off in an unsatisfying manner. The action scenes are beyond amateurish - hits don't look real, the camera jumps around to avoid showing just how bad the actors are at conveying action, and the editing is perhaps the worst I have ever seen in a high-budget production. My grandmother could throw together a better action scene on her personal computer.<br/><br/>This is perhaps one of the most thoroughly unenjoyable movies I have ever had the misfortune of viewing in the theater. It wasn't smart, it wasn't fun, it wasn't funny, I felt no sense of danger, and the plot was very predictable. Adding to all of that, there are numerous errors in consistency that seriously tear down the fourth wall. Easily the worst in a trilogy of mediocre films, the other two are at least watchable...this feels like getting hit in the face with a hammer and having to sit through an amateur editing project."

","All right, all right, everyone just calm down. I know you're all agonizing over my controversial re-naming of the recent Boring Ultimatum--see how I changed it again!. I'm writing this review about the Bourne Malarkey much less as a review than as me personifying B3 by using an arrogant yet self-deprecating voice, along with several impressions of people who obsess over the film with less justification than my cat has for sucking his own nipple. At least he purrs. I swear, Bourne fans gain no milk from the teats of B3. <br/><br/>Allow me to present a case for The Bourne Ultimatum's overrated appeal. <br/><br/>*Curtains up* *Enter The Bourne Ultimatum.

Jason Bourne, Man Who Knows When To Hang Up Before His Call Is Traced* ""Where are you, Bourne?"" *pretend, go ahead, FANTASIZE that you are the one in control of the situation rather than Jason Bourne. Come on, I'm sure you could trowel to the murkiest chasms of your imagination and make-believe that YOU are the one at the reigns in this conversation with J-Bourne* Matt Damon: ""I'm *insert shocking location*"" Bourne Ultimatum: ""Blah blah blah, something about 'who's Bourne's source?' lets chase Bourne while we minimize discourse....I mean really minimize discourse.... like, how are there three books about this plot; there is so little interchange! Blah blah, oh look, some other girl who Jason Bourne was sketchy with and is now cool with and who now has to run from the Big Bad CIA just cut/dyed her hair. Umm, uh, I guess car scenes where the car gets hit a lot of times was cool in the first Bourne, so um, let's do that again. Get Bourne! Get Bourne! We're corrupt, duh! The End! Yipee!"" (dramatic Moby song)<br/><br/>I feel I didn't emphasize the camera-shaking enough.<br/><br/>Overarching cool themes: Jason Bourne's whole ""How can I not remember who I am or why I'm here, yet be so suavely brilliant as to facilitate slipping a phone into a journalist's pocket and omnisciently guide him to safety amongst a sea of CIA agents promiscuously lusting after the blood of said journalist"" (of course, this suave sequence to safety ceases immediately when Journalist disobeys Jason's command... perhaps paralleling Journalist to Adam's decision to defy God and eat from the tree of knowledge. Is Jason Bourne God? Or, if this scene didn't reflect the Fall of Man, it could also be analogous to the Visa commercial in the lunch cafeteria where everyone synchronously purchases food with a debit card until Stubborn Joe Schmoe decides to pay with cash and screws up the whole system). <br/><br/>Anyways, this is pretty much the only cool thing of the movie: people working for the CIA slowly realize they are fighting on the wrong side (e.g., sniper guy who lets Bourne escape, Julia Stiles, the Blonde Older Girl who was also in The Crucible). All of the mentioned characters are versions of Jason Bourne in that, like Jason Bourne, they originally wanted to be Mr. or Mrs. Good Guy, killed people or tried to killed people, realized they were killing/ trying to kill the wrong people, got angry at whoever was in charge of the CIA, and sought revenge. Say this next sentence out loud in the most sarcastic voice you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams, it'll be fun: <br/><br/>WOOOOOOOW, what a SWEEEEEEET PLOT DUUUUUUUUDE! <br/><br/>This whole ""I've been working for the wrong side"" morality flip-flopping is the source of the movie's stupidity, and I will explain why, starting now: The morality flip-flopping of Jason Bourne (which we only kind of see in stupid Tripppy flashbacks), the Sniper Dude, Julia Stiles, and Older Blonde Woman is stupid because their exodus from the Dark Side occurs for the stupidest reasons... that is, they just SUDDENLY HAPPPPPEN to realize they are corrupt. How convenient. I know, I know, thats how all moral 180s occur. But why specifically those characters? Can't all the bad guys just sit down, have a brew with our weird-smiling hero Matt Damon, and comprehend how the CIA had brainwashed them as well as them? If the Sniper, J. Stiles, and The Crucible could recognize their mistakes by simply acknowledging Bourne's harmlessness, couldn't Desh, Clive Owen (yes, thats a reference to the Bourne Identity), or the CIA Deputy Head Honcho guy (who kinda looks like a cross between Dustin Hoffman and whoever plays the funny butler guy who's obsessed with feet in Mr. Deeds) just as easily do the same?<br/><br/>Camera shaking!"

"vovazhd","9","1","4","1 January 2008"," Almost certainly the best action film of 2007
","The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final film of the Bourne trilogy. It builds on the themes of identity and national conspiracy, while also presenting some of the most stylish and intense action sequences ever recorded. This time around, Jason Bourne discovers a source that is connected with his past. He takes the final steps toward discovering his identity while simultaneously avoiding CIA capture. He travels through Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangier, and finally New York City before completing his journey.<br/><br/>The action sequences are simply incredible. Rather than focusing on stationary punches or gun fights, they always involve 1. Bourne being chased or 2. Bourne chasing someone. Often, the sequences alternate between the CIA surveillance room and the actual area of action. As a result, its a chaotic but well defined hunt.<br/><br/>The most noticeable feature of the film is the shaky camera. The camera trembles for literally the entire time, even during discussion scenes. While its not distracting, its hard to tell if it gives any benefit. It certainly adds to the style, so I won't argue too much.<br/><br/>The plot has a few well placed twists to keep things interesting. The acting is realistic, although the character motives are not always believable. The dialog almost completely consists of technical discussion or orders, with few moments in between to get a real look at Bourne's tortured life. The pacing is excellent, switching between intense action and methodic planning, always slowly building up to the finale. The ending of the movie is simply perfect, both in length and clarity.<br/><br/>A sacrifice occurs between realism and style. Any sensible person knows that driving a car off a parking ramp, jumping between buildings, or navigating this accurately through death zones is suicide. It surely isn't realistic, but its awesome; that is what matters. Above all else, the Bourne Ultimatum is an action film, and in that it succeeds."

At no point in The Bourne Ultimatum does the eponymous amnesiac assassin offer anything that could remotely be construed as an ultimatum.Of course, by this, third film in the lucrative franchise, the plot is so far removed from Robert Ludlum's trashy page turners that there is really little similarity beyond the title. While this is not, in itself, a bad thing, it does highlight the essential flaw with The Bourne Ultimatum that sets it beneath the quality of its predecessors. While in the original Bourne Identity, director Doug Liman was able to craft a more compelling plot by building around the central kernel of Ludlum's premise, something Ultimatum director Paul Greengrass continued in the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, this film seems curiously bereft of any driving force, giving the plot that much needed momentum in between some, admittedly very exciting, set piece moments.<br/><br/>With Identity, the fact that the film suffered many re-writes and re-shoots probably served to strengthen the final product, here that same troubled production is a sign of a film with no strong drive to the plot. Although Greengrass does a strong job of tying Ultimatum directly in with Supremacy with the opening scene beginning straight after that film's crunchingly brutal car chase and the course of this film taking us through from there to a point where it meets up with Supremacy's New York set final scene, how it gets there is much less interesting and gripping than the previous films would have you expect. Meanwhile, the actual final confrontation is extremely anti-climactic with Albert Finney miscast and underused as the scientist responsible for programming Bourne as an assassin. The final revelations are such that they add nothing and tell you no detail you had not already assumed. There are at least some more intelligent and complex roles for David Strathairn and Joan Allen as the senior CIA operatives tracking down Bourne while disagreeing over their methods and Bourne's motives. These two are the only characters in the film that feel real and their interplay is a high point implying that there is a much better film in there that Greengrass could have made.<br/><br/>Much has been made of how the revitalised James Bond of Casino Royale owes a lot to Bourne's earlier outings and, if this is the case, then it is also apparent that Ultimatum owes a debt to Bond in some of its lesser parts. The film's plot is little more than a series of action sequences in exotic foreign locales, strung together by clichés and conventions and an excess of mobile phone usage. Where Casino Royale at least had flawed and vulnerable central characters to anchor the padding in between these sequences (something of a rarity in a Bond picture), in The Bourne Ultimatum it is hard to find sympathy with any of the central figures.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the character of Jason Bourne himself is no longer one who excites any empathy from the audience. Identity threw us straight in with Bourne's confusion and paranoia as the relentless pace of the plot forced him to run for his life while seeking his identity. Here, Bourne's motivations appear confused and thus so is the flow of the plot. Meanwhile, the character himself, now he is aware of his past as a trained killer, is completely cold with Matt Damon's usual inscrutability as an actor allowing us no window into his thoughts and feelings. Sometimes this inscrutable quality is an asset but in a film so anchored on the one character, with the support cast mostly ciphers used to further the plot (Julia Stiles, in particular, returns only to be lumbered with a completely two dimensional role assisting Bourne's progress), having no access to his motivations makes him seem much less complex. This problem is further compounded by Bourne's complete lack of vulnerability in action moments. Where Identity and Supremacy set the character up as a more real alternative to the old school of invincible one man army action heroes, in Ultimatum, he leaps across buildings, survives bomb explosions, incredibly destructive car crashes and multi-storey falls. Unlike in the first two films, you are never convinced that Bourne is in real peril. Something that causes Greengrass to insert Stiles and Paddy Considine, unusually awkward in his performance as a Guardian journalist, into the big sequences in order to keep suspense as we can believe there is a danger for them, rather than Bourne.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Greengrass is still pretty capable of handling the action, although those given motion sickness by Supremacy's jittery hand held camera work will not be happy to see it return here. The sequence set inside a crowded Waterloo Station as Bourne attempts to get Considine's journalist to safety, guiding him on his phone away from the many operatives, is a classic spy movie moment with Greengrass expertly handling the tension and panic. Meanwhile, a chase across rooftops and a bloody, violent fight using fists and anything that comes to hand, a book being the standout, in a rundown Morocco apartment, is everything for which the Bourne series has become justifiably well regarded.<br/><br/>Something of an anti-climax, The Bourne Ultimatum delivers a decently impressive turn your brain in at the door film of action thrills, but ultimately fails in being the promised intelligent thriller that could have wrapped up this strong trilogy in classic style. ***"
"salil-maniktahla","6","1","4","17 September 2007"," This is pretty much the same exact movie as the first two.
","Was I the only person who saw this movie and came away unimpressed? I'm issuing a spoiler alert, but if you had trouble foreseeing the plot ""twists"" (such as they were in this movie...maybe more like plot ""bends"" or possibly plot ""curves""), then really, explaining what happens after a yellow traffic light would probably constitute a spoiler for you.<br/><br/>At least part of the problem is that the Bourne books are written by Robert Ludlum (well, except this one, I think) (I really don't care enough to do any research, sorry), and let's face it: his writing is humorless and cliché to the point of nausea. So even though Supremacy isn't by Ludlum, the characters are products of his mind. That means they (and their attitudes) are rooted in, like, 1964.<br/><br/>The movie structure for each Bourne movie is identical. Initially there's an introduction to the government agency folks. Some of them are good, and it's made clear that they're good in no subtle way. You can trust these characters, the movie screams at us.<br/><br/>Then there are other characters. Those characters are BAD.<br/><br/>And then there's Bourne's intro. He just kills people a lot.<br/><br/>In the middle, there is always a very violent and prolonged hand-to-hand combat scene. It'll involve kitchen knives and rolled up magazines and whatever else might be handy. Unlike a real fight, it'll go on for what seems like hours. Then Bourne will win it by doing something really super-duper mean. So far, he hasn't shoved a chopstick up anyone's nostril, but I hold out hope for the inevitable sequel, which I am going to preemptively dub The Bourne Mistakacy.<br/><br/>Then there's a prolonged set of chases and gun fights leading up to the dramatic revelation, which in this case it turns out you should have seen coming all the way back in the first X-Men movie. It turns out that Jason Bourne was like an early predecessor to Wolverine, but without claws, cool mutant healing ability, or any kind of team-player ability.<br/><br/>Well, there you go. The rest of the country loved it, I thought it was the suck. So what do I know, right? Of course, that also seems to be the case for the war in Iraq, too. Just thought I'd point that out."
"logube","3","1","4","15 September 2007"," I thought it was a new movie!
","I thought this was a new movie, but I must have misunderstood. It looks like the previous 2! and the 3 ""Bourne saga"" movies all together all look like the 3 days of the condor! I think that if there is one thing that we know about USA thanks to Hollywood blockbusters is that at CIA work some very dangerous people! What? Oh no, they are sending an ""asset"" to terminate me! IMDb requires at least 10 lines to allow me to publish my comment, but it's hard to find 10 lines of stuff to say about this movie. Maybe one could wonder about the planet hopping of Mr. Bourne, his infinite supply of passports, and of that thing, called money, that we all struggle (on a daily base) to procure. I know I know, a movie is a movie, it doesn't need to obey the rule of physics! I so wish I wasn't the obese 42 years old ""it consultant"" I am, and instead I was a highly trained CIA cover-op assassin, someone that could survive everything and anything. I think it's 10 now. No really, I didn't like this movie so much. :-)"
"csandzou","10","1","4","22 August 2007"," You won't be disappointed
","I really had to clap my hands at the ending credits of that movie. That was fantastic, captivating and well-structured. I actually don't remember having stopped watching the screen at once. It was SO transporting! I give my hat to Filmmaker Paul Greengrass; he can enlist this movie amongst his masterpieces.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum actually commences where the Supremacy ended, and allows the viewer of the two previous films to gather the remaining pieces of the puzzle. Meantime, Jason Bourne, woo!, finally refinds his identity and rids the CIA of all those who are just good for prison. Undoubtedly, this guy has entered the memory of many! Matt Damon has really shown how brilliant he is, as well as Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and others. Bravo to All! The movie actually left me with quite few minor questions, especially on minor characters, such as the killer who spares the life of David Webb. It took me about 24 hours to settle them all. But once I did it, the movie appeared even greater, and I realized how worthy it was seeing it. Overall, this is THE BEST CHAPTER OF A MUST-SEE-TRILOGY."

"lee_a_scott","9","1","4","20 August 2007"," See this film or die! (now that's an ultimatum...)
","The Bourne movies always make me wonder why so many movies are so poor. They always seem to be so effortlessly excellent, to deliver in all aspects of what they do, to be cool, thrilling, action-packed and exciting, even when they get to the threequel, What is it about Jason Bourne or Matt Damon that makes these films so good? No idea. They aren't even really based on the books, so you cannot look at the source material. Regardless of the cause, the result is a franchise that shows Ethan Hunt and James Bond up from almost any angle and is a contender for one of the strongest trilogies committed to film. Ultimatum is excellent in its own right (the Waterloo sequence is a classic of tension and cool) and a fitting end (if it is the end) to the series."
"georgebush","6","1","4","18 August 2007"," great action, solid film, wrong villain
","(There may be a mild spoiler later in the review.) This film has superior action sequences. It is a return to the gritty action of From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and the French Connection only in this film it is non stop. The fight between Bourne and an assassin is very similar to the great briefcase fight scene in the classic Bond film: Russia With Love.<br/><br/>Some people have complained that the action makes them dizzy or disoriented. But in a real car chase the riders would be dizzy. The film and camera work are fantastic.<br/><br/>The only weakness in this film may be the villains. U. S. government agents are the ones chasing Bourne. Although this film may clarify that these U.S. government agents that are chasing Bourne are rogue agents, it also has many regular agents involved. In real life I am sure many agents would begin to question orders although there is a slight moment of truth late in this film in regards to that.<br/><br/>It is a fact that the best and brightest in our society join national security agencies, the C.I.A., the F.B. I. and the military. The finest minds and physically trained men and women join to protect you and this country.<br/><br/>One good point that can be derived from the film is that in a democracy and republic like ours, we have an open society. Even spy methods, interrogation techniques and and procedures can be discussed in the wide open in which the the whole society is aware of controversies. For example the discussion in our society of whether terrorist should be given Geneva conventions even when these terrorists have killed entire schools of children, beheaded reporters and murdered red cross workers is a wide open discussion. This film does not enter anything heavy like this but it does touch on the subject.<br/><br/>One more thing about the villains. In the real world the C.I.A. probably has more of a problem with left wing infiltration in which the CIA is made to be downsized and less effective and believes we have no enemies. Of course America has many enemies and 911 was not another American Government conspiracy. In real life terrorists in the Middle east, Africa, Asia, and South America prey on the innocent. The Bourne story ignores this. This film is more like James Bond in which Bond's own British secret service is after him. Hopefully there will be a sequel in which freedom's real enemies who are terrorists and thugs and warlords who are the villains. Hopefully, the sequel will be as well made as this film.<br/><br/>All and ail this film has the feel of From Russia with Love and the classic Michael Caine film Ipcress File."
"g-white723","6","1","4","18 August 2007"," Its just one big car chase
","I just saw my first Bourne film last night and I was quite impressed by it, but its basically one big car chase in several cities of the world. At the end it made me think of the introduction, ""Bond....James Bond"" except now I was thinking ""Bourne....Jason Bourne"". Many comparisons have been made recently but I think this is a superior Bond type film.<br/><br/>It's good because its fast-paced, action-packed, and it's well done. The much mentioned hand held camera, works well in the chase scenes but it is distracting elsewhere in the movie. The acting of Matt Damon and David Strathairn are very good. Damon is in some decent fight scenes and Strathairn is the evil adversary at the CIA. It was funny seeing Paddy Considine playing against type as Guardian journalist with a man bag. I thought much of the other actors were pretty wooden lifeless characters.<br/><br/>I liked the film but would not watch it again hence the six stars (just above average). The main problem is that it is a one dimensional, all action film with not much else to hold the viewer's interest. There are some beautiful locations in the film and the chase scenes are awesome. Although it's well made, there is no depth to the characters in the film."
"davisamr","7","1","4","14 August 2007"," Sadly not the best end to the trilogy
","Bourne 1 was clever and didn't rely too much on crash bang boom. Bourne 2 got sillier but 3 is the worst (not terrible but trying to put the 3 films into perspective). In 3, the camera work is often shaky making the viewer seasick and start to forget to watch the movie - is this good screenplay? not in mine and many others opinion - you don't need these ""effects"" if the story is good and well filmed and it wasn't needed in 1 or 2 so why change the style for 3? The story line was just a bit too far fetched in 3 - seems after the success of 1 the plots etc went slowly downhill with 2 and now 3.<br/><br/>I was disappointed and was hoping for a more intellectual movie but I guess that's Hollywood for you. Maybe they can remake it or there'll be an alternative start/end and middle on the DVD when published."

","The best , but, that's what I said as I watched each of the previous ones. Matt daemon is at his best. The movie does not have even a second wasted on crappy love scenes or any thing that takes away from the main plot of the movie. It is like watching James bond and Mission Impossible but without all the crappy love scenes, stupid funny jokes..etc. They did not even waste a minute on emotional love making or Matt doing anything stupid for a girl. You know what I am saying , right ? I think this should be the next James bond sequel. James bond is old this is new. Hopefully they will make more sequels to this. <br/><br/>I love this movie and every smart person would too."
"minty5848","10","1","4","6 August 2007"," The Best Trilogy EVER
","This movie trilogy is genius. It has the best action. It is not totally based on technology like other action movies are. It is the genius of one man named Jason Bourne and how he adapts to situations. Paul Greengrass was pure genius in The Bourne Ultimatum, Matt Damon is perfect for the role of Jason Bourne and does a superb job, and the rest of the cast is truly magnificent. This movie and trilogy gets 10 stars from me because it is purely the best. Don't believe me? Go and see it yourself. But rent the first two movies and watch them before seeing it if you're not a previous fan like I am, or else you will not understand the story behind the movies. Focus on every detail and every person that you see. Try to make connections between the previous films and the the most recent. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed by the Bourne Ultimatum. However, after the movie your adrenaline will be pumping and you may find yourself wanting to run through the streets of Moscow or Italy. Or maybe you would want to jump through windows and start a car chase? Don't try any of the stunts at home please."

","Your a good guy programmed to be a controlled bad guy, turned good guy, who has to do bad-guy things. And you still don't really know who you are!

Pam Landy's actions make perfect sense, and are the saving grace of this film. But why does Neal Daniels, a man who is deeply entrenched with these covert operations, and has been from the beginning, suddenly start leaking information to the press?

And who walks away from that many car wrecks! Please! <br/><br/>If you don't want to be aggravated, then don't watch this one"
"raimund-berger","3","1","5","8 December 2008"," Sucks hard.
","While I'm a great fan of the first two Bourne installments, this one clearly marks the demise of what should have been a duology kept intact. As the story has basically been closed with ""Supremacy"", where Bourne finally got into the clear about his Treadstone past and Neski assassination, the production team had to try hard and find something they still could tag onto and continue a finished story. Clearly, to squeeze some more bucks out of a financially successful franchise.<br/><br/>So we now gotta learn that there's been still *another* covert project behind Treadstone, called Blackbriar, and basically the same story we just went through starts over again. I.e. corrupt agent executives declaring Bourne to be a threat and chasing him in an eventually vain attempt to cover up their miserable deeds. Seen before? Yes.<br/><br/>And as the plot thins out, this movie naturally got to be more ""action packed"", where action basically means cars crashing, stuff exploding and stunt men performing various physical actions. So if you're happy with watching Bourne limping around after having crashed yet another car or jumped from yet another building, this movie could still be for you. Just make sure you leave both, brain and taste, at home though.<br/><br/>The really sad point about this is that those greedy losers ruin the first two Bourne's for us as well, because at least I just can't watch them with the same eyes as before. They've thoroughly been spoiled now, yet I'm confident the creators couldn't care less.<br/><br/>Incidentally, anybody hoping for an improvement on camera work and editing will be disappointed. It's the same crap as before. I guess it's their way of disguising bad planning and lousy choreography, by just tearing those miserable, shaky shots still further apart in the editing room and glue them together in cut fests which leave little to recognize for the viewer.<br/><br/>I hear they plan yet another sequel to drag this further through the mud. I can only hope they'll get to answer for this in final judgment, because too many sheep will go run and see it anyway, thus preventing the proper box office response. As said, the first two installments were just too good."
"curtis-8","2","1","5","17 March 2008"," Let the ""Roger Moore"" era of Bourne begin!
","The Bourne series has often been called the James Bond of this generation. Well, if that is so, the franchise has, with ""Ultimatum,"" hit its ""Roger Moore"" years. The action sequences are outstandingeverything else is poorly acted, poorly written, idiotic crap. I thought the scenes in the super-secret CIA subgroup's control center were some of the most ludicrous I've ever seen in a big budget movie. I thought the overwrought, ultra-clichéd, sub-Chuck Norris dialog was going to kill me! The CIA guy in command, David Strathairn, is constantly yelling out ridiculously obvious orders like ""I want to know everything about this guy before he even knows it!"" as though his team is doing this for the first time and doesn't know what they're supposed to do. And, even though these CIA spooks can apparently see anything they want on video at any time anywhere from the comfort of their secret lair, and even though they can put any number of operatives on the ground anywhere they want at a moment's noticethey still lose a key suspect they're tracking when Bourne tells the guy to STAND BEHIND A BUS. No, I'm not kidding. And there's also an inexplicable (and inexplicably stupid) sequence in which Strathairn (I hate to keep picking on him, but he was saddled with most of the idiocy) barks at his operatives in the secret command center to show him records with photos of the contents of an apartment that has been searched. What they show him are not scanned images or individual items, or anything like that, but photos of documents that have just been dumped in a pile at random. But lo and behold, they happen to see the info they need peeking up from behind some other papers! Wow! What luck. What dumb, dumb luck.<br/><br/>And the stupidity isn't limited to the CIA, either. Mr. Super-smart Bourne also has to depend on clues like file folders that have gigantic red stamps on them that read ""CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: TOP SECRET!"". I mean, reallyis there anyone above the level of an 8th grader who actually thinks the government puts big red stamps on their secret stuff? Is that what you do with stuff you don't want others to see, put a huge red sign on it that says DON""T LOOK? However, the action sequences were outstanding. Too bad the people behind the series have taken out all the brains."

For someone to believe that you can observe thru a window and see spies at work reading classified material and identify where they store material streches the imagination. The action sequences seemed to be stretched out to enable the director to take up time. There were to many instances where the plot was stretched thin and we endured several minutes of waiting for the ineviatable to happen, We could easily predict what was going to take place.

"bg11215","7","1","5","6 August 2007"," Satisfying but has some weak areas
","I love this trilogy, and as seems to be typical with series, those that come after never live up to the first, and I feel that's the case here. The Bourne Ultimatum did deliver; it's non stop action, but I feel that's a bit of a sell out. This story could have had much more depth and character, as the first did, which is why I liked it in the first place.<br/><br/>For example, they could have shown us what Bourne had been doing with his life since the last film, but they didn't show anything. Basically, there was very little dramatic story here; it was all action sequences strung together. I feel that's a cheap way to go. They could have really dug deep to give the audience more story for all that action, but didn't. Also I knew there would be plenty of violence in this one, but didn't like how much of it was graphic in the extreme. It doesn't take talent or skill to show someone getting their head blown off, and is it really necessary to show intense fight scenes resulting in murder, time and time again? They went way overboard with it in my opinion. Sometimes ""less is more"".<br/><br/>And one thing that I always find annoying is this hand held camera crap. It might seem suitable for a low budget documentary, but for a film of this size? I felt all the camera shaking was ineffective and detracted form the picture.<br/><br/>The film did satisfy, especially at the end, I thought it was brilliant. But I would have shot it very differently."

(Harry Potter 5).<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum, however, is the best action thriller of this year IMHO, the best of the Bourne movie series, and the only film that I do not need to lower any expectation to give it a 10 stars rating.<br/><br/>And don't worry about reading those great reviews from CNN, NYT and USAToday. Your expectation will be exceeded.<br/><br/>The pace is break-neck fast while the hand-to-hand combat is brutally COOL. Some people may not like the drunken hand-held cameramen, but I feel that technique makes the action sequences more dynamic and suffocating.

Everything comes together to complete the trilogy without any other questions to be asked. Jason Bourne finally gets a chance to stop running and a chance at peace. Excellent fight scene midway through the movie. Although towards the end the whole car chase in New York went a little overboard. Overall, a great ending to the trilogy!!! Matt Damon was phenomenal as usual, he was made for movies like this! What I really like about these movies are the on scene location of the film. Its not just studio with a big screen and images of a foreign country, but they actually filmed on location. Its always easier to get more involved when everything looks so real.

","This movie went far beyond my expectations! I thought the first two movies in the Bourne trilogy were superb, but this one reached an even higher level. While I was watching in awe this morning, I marveled at how high the action bar has been set by Greengrass/Gilroy/Marshall/ Damon/Allen/Stiles. The movie is brilliant, to say the least, and probably the single best action movie of all time. The way Greengrass tied in scenes from the first two movies was genius. When you couple this movie with the first two, this trilogy has no peers in the action genre. If the producers choose to do so, this Bourne is a satisfying ending to the trilogy, but I hope the same folks continue the Bourne series using the same formula. I would rate the movie a perfect 10 except the camera motion was a little too much at times. Nevertheless, I intend to see it again in a few days, and I can't wait for the DVD."

","Same boring Bourne BS that you saw in the first two. Regardless of whether or not you're a fan of this series, this movie does NOT deserve the spectacular IMDb rating that it's received thus far. As I've stated in past comments, IMDb ratings are no longer a reliable metric for movie ratings. Despite obvious effort to posture the movie as if it contained interesting plot twists or mind bending revelations about Bourne's origins, I'm afraid it is nothing more than its two predecessors - mindless tripe. So if that's what you're looking for then this is your movie, otherwise, spend your time and money elsewhere."

","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (B-3) is the third installment in the series (after B-1 and B-2). It helps greatly to have seen the previous two if you want to follow the plot, but it might also be an advantage to have NOT seen the previous two if you don't want to know basically everything that will happen during the film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW:<br/><br/>B-3 uses the same plot devices as the first two movies, it just shifts the locations and the people involved. There are the now requisite fight, car chase, and sniper scenes. Two scenes from B-2 in particular are replicated in B-3: (1) Jason Bourne spies on a CIA office from across the street, and (2) there is a grueling car crash involving Bourne and ""the bad guy."" There are several flashback, memory, dream sequences, some of which are new, and others are from B-1 and B-2 to help those new to the series to understand what occurred previously. Like I said, B-3 re-cycles both plot elements and actual scenes from the previous two.<br/><br/>Memo to Jason Bourne: If you're on the run and attempting to hide, please turn to page 3 of the ""Super Spy Handbook"" and re-read the section on disguises. Apparently only females are allowed to color and cut their hair to alter their look. One would think that a super duper spy like Jason Bourne (who in the first film had colored contacts and was shown with his hair dyed) would either shave his head, or let his hair grow long. Perhaps he could sport some glasses or sunglasses. How about growing a goatee, mustache, or beard? Heck, drop by the local joke shop and buy some Groucho Marx nose/glasses!!! Wear a hat! Anything, instead of keeping your exact same mug and looking directly into the not hidden cameras! Memo to CIA: Go to Home Depot at your first opportunity and buy some venetian blinds for your offices. In case you haven't figured it out by now, any kid with a toy telescope can spy on you from the office building across the street.<br/><br/>Memo to Real CIA: Disregard the previous comment directed at the script writers.

","Personally, this movie was WAY too far-fetched for me to even think it was believable or enjoyable. Many of the reviewers have accurately described the movie, like the car crashing off the roof. It just stretches credulity when the filmmakers wants us to believe Jason Bourne survives not only that car crash, but others too many to remember. But it's not just his Jason Bourne's immunity to death I had issues with. Like that scene they play in the trailer, in minutes he can not only break into that man's office, which just happens to be in the CIA, but also open his safe? Give me a break! I guess Harry Potter giving him his invisible cape was left on the editing room floor. While the technical aspects were commendable, I got a headache watching the jerky motion.

","No surprises in this story line. Directing and editing are uninspired. Rather than take the time to choreograph and make his bored star learn fight scenes, or complex car chases; the director has chosen to heavily edit and swing the camera around. Its a misplaced attempt to express chaos or confusion or action by using hand-held style techniques. The character, so highly trained, would not have experienced these scenes in this discordant manner- rather time would have slowed down for him. This time expansion effect is well illustrated in the first film. Director Greengrass misses the point again. SPOILER: wouldn't the ending have also been more effective left at the smile without the confirmation of swimming away in the water? It also would have made a nice bookend to the first film (opening of floating in the water) for this ending to leave him (and us) floating. I hope when they do the Emerald City that they learn to create excitement and confusion without waving the camera around. A well developed fight can have as many as 3 blows without an edit. Never in this film! Get a choreographer! And watch the first one again. Its the 10- not this one."

You can only do it again if you write a new script with some new ideas in it. The Bourne Supremacy has neither of these. We have Bourne wandering around Europe trying to work out who he is and who is tying to kill him. Didn't we have that in the first film. The action scenes are fine especially the cab chase, but the script is non-existent. Matt Damon is good but the rest of the cast just look like they don't know which film they are in.

","'The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)' is just incredibly, viscerally and unapologetically exciting, an edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride from start to finish. It whisks along from extended set-piece to extended set-piece - which don't always rely on straight-up fisticuffs or foot-chases, often feeling much more cat-and-mouse or cerebral - and provides, once again, an engaging and riveting espionage-based mystery for us to sink our teeth into (which might feel slightly tagged on in terms of the trilogy but totally nails the balance between Bourne and the CIA). The 'shaky' camera-work reaches its height in a mid-point fight that feels slightly frustrating in the way it's cut together, since the behind-the-scenes stuff reveals that both actors were doing complex and quick choreography far more involving than the chopped-up stuff that made it on screen, and in the way it sounds, since the slightly 'cartoony' sound-design of the first film seeps in here as well (though it's not as exaggerated), but these issues are mostly constrained to this one sequence as both elements are fine-tuned enough throughout the rest of the piece to work pretty much perfectly, creating a realistic and tense experience that keeps you on tender hooks right until its closing credits. The trilogy has consistently remained a favourite of mine no matter how many times I watch it and I always come away with a different favourite, proving they are all as good as one another and unique in some subtle way. While I'll always have a special place in my heart for the first, thanks mainly due to its more character-focused and arguably tighter plot, this picture was easily the most exciting - and possibly the best - this time around. 8/10"

The movie portrays the working of CIA that no intelligence agency can hope to attain even if half the world is populated by its robots and can move on to track 'targets' as soon as a single voice instruction is given by an individual sitting pretty somewhere in the US. Bourne Ultimatum's 8.1 rating as against Topaz's 6.3 is the giveaway clue on why people are encouraged to make such movies.

","I'm on the third of the initial Bourne Trilogy movies as I prep for ""Jason Bourne"", and that has brought me to ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", a film I had not seen since it was first in theaters in 2007. I remember thinking at the time that the camera work was troubling for me. It was even more so seeing it on Blu Ray. At the time I gave the movie 8/10 stars, but on this second viewing I have to go with only six.<br/><br/>This film is a direct sequel to ""The Bourne Supremacy"", and picks up exactly where that film picks up. The script is okay, but not great. I won't go into details so as not to write a spoiler, but the film centers around Jason Bourne uncovering more about his past life, and the climax of the movie is sort of the big reveal about that past life--and that big reveal was, to me, pretty hokey. The whole thing felt forced, and a bit like a caricature, or something you expect from a comic book character rather than a spy movie.<br/><br/>But the real thing that kills this movie is its terrible camera work. I get that it was the mid-2000's and the whole jittery camera technique was a thing, but goodness is it ever annoying. And the overwhelming majority of the film uses this technique. It makes you feel like you're on a ride at an amusement park, and it just doesn't work for me at all. I might have given this film seven or eight stars had it not been for the camera work, but that nuisance drops this movie down to a six. It's good, but not great--and a step down from ""The Bourne Supremacy""."

","A staggering work of precision craftsmanship, an absolute marvel of action filmmaking & a fitting conclusion to the Jason Bourne saga, The Bourne Ultimatum is a rare second sequel that works flawlessly by taking a huge leap with its premise to effortlessly surpass the towering expectations set by its much-beloved predecessors & isn't just the finest installment of The Bourne Trilogy but is impressive enough to qualify as one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Picking up the storyline right where it was left off in The Bourne Supremacy before taking a six weeks leap, The Bourne Ultimatum continues the quest of Jason Bourne as he retraces his steps back to his origin with a few help along the road to guide him through but also standing in his way is a ruthless CIA official who's willing to do anything it takes to eradicate Bourne in order to protect the secrecy of Operation BlackBriar - the upgraded version of Operation Treadstone.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Greengrass, this is arguably the finest work of his so-far terrific film career & presents him in complete control of every aspect of the story. The screenplay is a gem in itself for the plot is very tightly structured from start to finish & smartly ties up all the loose ends to conclude the trilogy on a really high note. And further enhancing the overall experience is the remarkable balance between its moments of action & drama, both executed to near-perfection.<br/><br/>Cinematography employs Greengrass' signature use of hand-held cameras to its full potential which in turn makes the action sequences all the more amazing by adding a frenetic energy to it. Editing is carried out in a furious manner for the story is ferociously paced. And John Powell's score once again infuses flavours of its own to further intensify the entertainment with Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" once again serving as an icing on what is an already delicious cake.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Matt Damon finally gives us the most complete rendition of Jason Bourne which, when blended with Damon's infectious screen presence & strong performance, also turns this quintessential assassin into one of recent cinema's most iconic figures. Supporting cast also chips in with commendable performances amongst which David Strathairn & Joan Allen stand out in their given roles of Noah Vosen & Pamela Landy, respectively.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Bourne Ultimatum is a powerful blend of kinetic direction, taut screenplay, dynamic photography, tight editing, breakneck pace, electric score, mind-blowing action & stellar performances that's stronger, faster & better than its predecessors in almost every department. Exciting, entertaining & immensely rewarding, The Bourne Ultimatum sets a new bar for action thrillers to follow and, along with Identity & Supremacy, makes up for one of cinema's finest motion picture trilogies."

"basilisksamuk","7","0","1","20 February 2013"," Worthwhile example of style over substance
","I heard the director, Paul Greengrass, being interviewed on the radio and he revealed that at lest five writers were used, including Tom Stoppard who isn't even credited. This tells you a lot. This film isn't about plot and it isn't about dialogue. The plot is a typical Hitchcockian McGuffin – i.e. it doesn't matter in the slightest. The great secret that Bourne is going to uncover isn't of the slightest interest in the end. There could have been a hundred other revelations as plausible as the one you are given. It just doesn't matter.<br/><br/>What does matter is the chase and the whole film is just a chase and very little else. However, it is the most exciting chase you are ever likely to see in this or any other film. It starts at a cracking pace and just keeps going right to the end. The whole thing is shot using hand-held cameras as far as I can see. Occasionally this is distracting as in an early brief expositional scene where as a viewer I was distracted and taken out of the film by the shakiness of the camera as it observed two characters talking. However this was the only point at which I was distracted.<br/><br/>Above all this film is a triumph of editing. The number of cuts are breathtaking and they are piled so deep and so quick that you can't help but be moved along by the kinetic energy on display. What might at first look like a directorial triumph is actually as much down to editing and music as anything else. The music, reminiscent of a pared-down Bernard Hermann, is surely a deliberate homage to that composer and it works brilliantly with the film to deliver an ever accelerating narrative. Bourne also makes a virtue of a stylistic device I have criticized in other reviews – the use of close shots of bodies in motion in order to give energy to a fight scene. The scene in which Bourne fights the CIA ""asset"" sent to kill him is shot in a fragmentary, blurred, partial manner which succeeds brilliantly in showing the desperate violence that such a fight must surely use. I don't think I've ever seen a more brilliant depiction of a one-to-one fight shot at close range.<br/><br/>Both a magnificent piece of film making and forgettable tosh then."

He's some poor mind controlled agent who's fending for his life while taking on the government, but there's just no character to his character.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has extremely narrow emotional range to his acting, and we end up watching his dead pan face, and not so brisk body motion throughout the film. Just because he's some kind of a lizard prince, I don't think he qualifies as a leading actor.<br/><br/>So if you like to watch Matt Damon walking around, this movie is for you, but if you''re not, the movie is not recommended for viewing."
"sashank_kini-1","8","0","1","16 August 2012"," Bourne Ultimatum Triumphs Over Bourne Supremacy Because 1) Bourne Protects Others Instead of Saving Himself and 2) Principal Characters Have a Wider Interaction With Jason
","If you closely watch Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum, you'll realize there is not much difference in the narrative progression except for the fact that while Bourne Supremacy is slightly passive and veers more towards 'evade and escape', Bourne Ultimatum is active in placing Jason Bourne in situations that involved protecting an important source of information. Case in mention the beginning of Bourne Supremacy where two characters crucial for exposing the covert operation 'Treadstone' are killed by Kirill, the Russian agent without any involvement of Bourne; in Bourne Ultimatum, Bourne has the power to save Simon Ross and Neil Daniels who again plan to make public a shocking revelation. While both situations are similar (exposing the truth), Bourne's involvement in protecting the key witnesses makes Ultimatum more exciting.<br/><br/>The third installment in the spy conspiracy action thriller goes hard since by now, provided we have seen the previous two movies, we know what Bourne wants, what comes in the way and what he has to do. Its approach similar the recent movie Salt – both movies know how to place enough character development while keeping the action high, loud and rabid. Roger Ebert mentions in his review that we no longer care about his name or whatever, but we want him to beat 'em baddies up and win in the end, and I do agree with the statement. We have realized that the stakes get bigger each time and that Bourne learns something better each time, and all we care is how he gets to that point of 'revelation' – that happens only after the brawls, fights, shootouts, car chase etc.<br/><br/>Plot: After evading the Russian police and getting disturbing flashes of his past, Jason Bourne visits Marie's brother to inform about Marie's death. Meanwhile, another secret operation 'Black briar' is threatening to be exposed by a former member Neil Daniels and Guardian correspondent Simon Ross. The CIA and Black Briar's director try to prevent them from leaking any information and rope in a reluctant Pam Landy, who becomes supportive of Bourne after their previous encounters. Bourne has to take on CIA and Black Briar team once again and unravel the grand conspiracy that has affected him for more than three years. Nicky Parsons, former Treadstone contact, also plays a major role in leading the narrative and also shedding a new, not-very-unexpected-considering-she-is-pretty-and-Damon-is-handsome romantic angle that may have existed in the past.<br/><br/>Key relations are given a push in Bourne Ultimatum; you can compare it with a 'Progress' rating – while in Bourne Supremacy, the overall progress was almost equal, the individual scores were low. For example, Jason's relation with Nicky, Jason's relation with Landy, Jason's involvement in protecting characters etc. Jason and the equally perspicacious Landy collaborate and use the smartest strategies in setting things right, and boy oh boy its fun. Also smart was the screenwriter's decision to place the previous resolution in the middle of the film to play with the narrative. So from the opening, we are in the center of action and are curious to know what's happening. The shaky camera and editing does wonders this time, but we should also credit the background music that appended the cinematography in creating the tense mood. It isn't perfect since there was a scene with Landy in the beginning of the film where I thought the camera just rammed like a speeding tempo into their faces in profile. Also, because of the volatile tempo, I couldn't retain the film in my head some time after watching it so chances are that I would forget some of the plot and recurring characters in the next installment. But I realized that won't happen since I heard Bourne Legacy is made without the character of Bourne himself.<br/><br/>Considering that, I regard Bourne Ultimatum a fitting conclusion to the trilogy and I hope Damon makes a comeback somehow in the future of Bourne. And he gets the smile back on his stoic face."

Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date. He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.<br/><br/>There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense. The reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way) or cheering on. (or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping. The audience was loving it.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package. All of the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how summer movie thrillers should be done. I love the Bourne trilogy."

","Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really didn't even notice it.<br/><br/>You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!"

"compi24","10","0","1","28 October 2011"," Review Of ""The Bourne Ultimatum""
","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is director Paul Greengrass' final installment of the Bourne franchise. The film stars Matt Damon and starts up where the previous film (""The Bourne Supremacy"") left off. To start off, ""Ultimatum"" had big shoes to fill - ""Identity"" set the proverbial bar for the franchise and ""Supremacy"" raised this bar. Does ""Ultimatum"" live up to the expectations that it was assigned? In short. . .yeah. . .yeah it does. ""Ultimatum"" is an expertly crafted film that takes every facet of the first two films and elevates them to an exponential degree. I honestly did not believe the claim that these movies got better with each installment. But, hey, seeing is believing I guess. Just when I thought that Matt Damon's portrayal of Bourne was multifaceted enough, he adds more complicated and compelling layers to this character in ""Ultimatum"" - I mean, layers upon layers of Bourne are presented throughout this film. If you thought that you had gained a strong emotional attachment to Bourne via the first two movies, well see the third because Damon just blasts expectations with this performance. This performance and the overall film as a whole, is built up by the brilliantly written screenplay by Tony Gilroy. This script is the fulcrum of the film. It's brisk dialogue and precious I-Can't-Believe-That-Just-Happened moments make the film that much more amusing as a whole. One of my favorite aspects of the entire Bourne franchise is the score. Whether it's John Powell's fast-paced music or Moby's stylish trademark song ""Extreme Ways"", the recurring musical elements really help to embed the film into the audience's head. Paul Greengrass' impressive direction is once again a masterstroke aspect of this film's massive appeal. I would say that, in the end, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" surpassed my expectations and lifted the franchise to unfathomable heights."
"raoulgomezmorille","10","0","1","5 September 2011"," One of the best spy movie ever made so far...
","Just a quick summary of the film: Jason Bourne dodges a ruthless CIA official and his agents from a new assassination program while searching for the origins of his life as a trained killer.<br/><br/>Okay, this film is sheer genius. The writing, directing and intense acting is just what spy movies need to be. This is one of the best spy film ever made. I stress when I say One of the best spy films ever made. I am not excluding Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy (mini series turning into a masterpiece film in 2011) or Taken, Nikita, the first two Bourne's, Body of Lies, Ronin etc. Matt Damon has done it again. Played Jason Bourne brilliantly and none else can replace him in my and many other people's eyes. Bourne tries to find the source of his identity and where he came from in this film. This has set the bar to action/thriller genre for years to come and the next one has a lot to live up to. This has everything a Bourne film has. It has one of the best chase scenes in motion picture history, the shaky camera and defiantly, it is not like Bond. People have been arguing (debating) who is better? Who is deadlier? Bond or Bourne and I personally prefer Bourne and the Bourne films but that is not saying that the Bond films are bad. This film has an interesting and intriguing beginning, an epic middle and just a brilliant ending. Don't go to watch this film thinking that it is a Bond want to be or a Michael Bay (he is a good director) trigger happy film. Go to this film and prepare for amazing acting, good directing, the best chasing scenes ever made, remarkable fighting scenes and a climatic ending. Like I said, it is one of the best spy film ever made and I am not even exaggerating, this is one of the best films ever made. Bourne is perfection in a spy movie."
"brodlimmel","Null","0","1","14 August 2011"," A great end to a trilogy
","This movie ends the Bourne series like no other. I was a real big fan of the first two and this one ties it up real nice and there are no loose ends. Jason Bourne is a bad-ass every time I watch one of these you think damn I wish I was that guy being able to beat up four guys at once. So the story starts out pretty close to the end of the second one and of course Jason Bourne is still being hunted by the government who is just trying to tie up loose ends by killing a reporter and Jason Bourne needs that reporter to find out who made him and why. That is the most interesting part of the plot who made Jason Bourne and why did he become this government assassin. But this movie is a true summer blockbuster you can never be bored there is action everywhere in this foot chases, roof chases, car chases, the some of the coolest fight scenes ever. Now I know Jason Bourne is a beast and can't be stopped but this guy is immortal he can get shot fall off building, jumps through glass, gets in these car crashes he is invincible. Now I hear they are making a fourth Bourne movie called The Bourne Legacy and that is one of those wait and see movies I hope that is good because I do love this series. So overall if you haven't seen The Bourne Ultimatum and you have seen the first two see this movie but if you haven't seen the first two see those first because that is the only way I think you can understand the entire story and care about the characters."
"www-muro-bg","10","0","2","29 May 2011"," Best action adventure movie of the decade
","From the universal logo to the end credits this movie nearly blow my mind. Mat Damon was consumed by the role of the amnesiac government killer. Fast, furious, dangerous... He is definitely not the good guy. He is the bad guy... No he is the worst guy at his best. Paul Greengrass's risky cinematographic method from ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" did very good job (the excellent job at the end did the editor). Vere are people saying ""Oh, that shaky cam style ruined everything"", but this is bulls*t. Very well conducted and played by all the instruments. In my opinion this is the best action adventure movie of the decade"
"KineticSeoul","8","0","1","12 April 2011"," My second favorite in the Bourne franchise so far
","Jason Bourne is back and he is sharper and more agile in achieving his objectives. In fact that is one of the coolest parts about this movie since he knows exactly what to do and knows the method of doing it, in a very entertaining manner. Yeah, there might not as be as much tension because of this but that is just a very minor thing. Since this is still overall a clever and yet entertaining action flick that is fast paced for the most part. Out of the three films in this trilogy before the fourth movie will come out, but this is one is the most action packed compared to the previous two installments. The previous two Bounre films was about Jason Bourne on the run while trying to find out what is going on, this time he is going for the source. Although there is some chase scene with Jason Bourne doing parkour. Another minor complaint is how this one is more all over the place than the previous films in this franchise which makes the film a bit more complex looking than it has to be, even if it moves in a very fast paced manner. But the main negative aspect of this movie is how there really isn't much character development and even if there is, it's not done in a very memorable fashion. Overall though I really enjoyed this trilogy and maybe the future sequels, but this film by itself I am going to give it a 8.3. I can see how some audiences probably didn't enjoy it as much though because of the very serious and realistic direction it tries to go. But I personally think that is one of the aspect that makes this franchise good as it is.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"zachdriehorst","9","0","1","26 March 2011"," Buckle Up!
","Hold on super tight when you watch this film!!!! Following the storyline of The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum puts the perfect conclusion to the legendary series. The title might take a few moments to figure out, and the movie's action sequences are confused at times but try not to think about it. Matt Damon adds so much integrity to Jason. I totally felt that he was just a guy seeking forgiveness for what he's done. The action sequences leave you breathless and astonished. The fights don't look planned out. You could watch the film one million times and never be able to tell the Matt is expecting the punches. I never expected the end. !!!!!!! Spoilers beyond this point!!!!! I seriously thought that Vosen had really shot Bourne (excuse me I meant David Webb) and Jason was dead. I'm glad that Nicky was in the scene when it was revealed he was alive. I had forgotten about her. I felt that the series was complete when the asset lowered his gun and ""Look at us. Look at what they make you give."" All I have to say is ""Look at this film. Look at what they make you enjoy."""
"magnuspy","8","0","1","16 February 2011"," Shaky-cam detracts from an otherwise great movie
","If you have not grown up playing video games, it might be a bit hard to sit through this movie. The director(s) of this trilogy adopted a technique of mounting the camera on a sort of tuning fork which vibrates with an amplitude & frequency proportional to the intensity of the action on the scene at any given point of time. It starts out OK with 'Identity' and maxes out in 'Ultimatum'. At the end of the third movie, I felt that I had just sat through a period of turbulence on an airplane and threw my guts up in the multiplex restroom.<br/><br/>However, the movies themselves are tightly plotted and enjoyable, and Matt Damon's performance is awesome in all three. What a pity they had to ruin it with the shaky-cam. If some enterprising soul finds a way to strip out the shaking, I'll pay money to buy the trilogy on DVD."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","0","1","9 February 2011"," Ultimatum
","Ah, this is what I've been waiting for with this trilogy, I think when people were bragging about this series, The Ultimatum was what they were talking about most of the time. This movie has it all, great action and a terrific story and what a way to conclude the movies for Jason Bourne. There are some really intense scenes as we see Jason trying to tell an agent with information how to escape an assassin that is tracking him down. The director really kept a good grip on his audience and didn't let up. Also I just love that we finally get to really know Julia Style's character who I have a feeling has a deeper connection with Jason Bourne than what was shown before. She becomes a very strong woman and a great counterpoint for Jason Bourne. I loved the return of Landy, as I mentioned before Joan Allen is just wonderful in this role and you continue rooting for her. David Strathium made for such a great villain, you had no idea what move he would pull next and how far he would go to cross the lines of when to say no wasn't enough, Jason Bourne showed him.<br/><br/>Guardian correspondent Simon Ross meets with a source to discuss Bourne and Operation Treadstone. The CIA begin tracking Ross when he mentions ""Operation Blackbriar"" on a cell phone call to his editor. In London, Bourne meets with Ross at Waterloo Station after learning of Ross' investigation of Treadstone. When Bourne realizes that the CIA is tracking Ross, he helps him evade capture, but Ross deviates from Bourne's instructions and is killed by Blackbriar assassin Paz. CIA Director Ezra Kramer sends Landy to help Vosen after he spots Bourne in a CCTV camera feed. After searching Ross' notes, they deduce that his source was Neal Daniels, CIA Station Chief in Madrid, who was formerly involved in Treadstone and is actively involved in Blackbriar. Bourne, having taken Ross' bag after he was killed, is led to Daniels' Madrid office but finds it empty. Nicky Parsons, a former Treadstone support technician, arrives shortly after Bourne incapacitates the CIA field team sent by Vosen and Landy to capture him. She decides to help Bourne escape another incoming CIA squad and tells him Daniels fled to Tangiers.<br/><br/>Well I finally completed the trilogy and I'm glad that I checked it out. I can understand why people are naming this the new James Bond spy genre. Hopefully they don't make another movie though as I heard Matt Damon doesn't want to continue as he feels his character had the perfect closure which I completely agree. It just won't work without Damon and his presence, but then again I have been wrong before. However this was a great movie and I had a lot of fun watching it. I loved the scene where Julia Styles is running from the assassin that is sent after her for trying to help Bourne, Bourne has to literally jump buildings, from rooftop to rooftop as he's being chased by the police to save Julia who is trying to blend in with the crowd and then having to pull some Jason Bourne stunts as well by jumping the roof. I loved the way the film ended with Jason finding out fully who he was and discovered that serving his country made him do things that he regrets and seeing the next in line to take his place breaks not only his heart but yours' as well. Great story, awesome action and a wonderful cast made this movie work and I highly recommend this trilogy as well.<br/><br/>8/10"
"elshikh4","2","0","2","24 January 2011"," Like someone talks absolute nonsense yet so seriously !
","Bourne travels all over the world? Why? And how? From where exactly he gets the money to afford it? And how he does it, having no disguise while he's the most wanted man on the plant? Bourne jumps from window to another all over Tangier's buildings while all the windows are opened and all the people are out! How, at the end of that chase, he knew the place of the one he chases? By the last's smell??! The CIA's offices have always glass, with no curtains, so whenever Bourne monitors them, he could see everything. So Bourne, finally, remembers, OK, what did he remember exactly and we didn't know?! Bourne could go inside the CIA while no camera filmed him? (He's the invisible man!). Bourne could survive a bomb that got exploded couple of meters behind him, not only this, he could also run after the one who exploded it, fight him, and kill him (Now he's Wolverine!).<br/><br/>Actually, it doesn't have plot holes since originally it doesn't have a plot. They didn't have much to write in this sequel, so they transformed it into idiot chase after another; someone wants to kill dear Bourne, and - surprisingly - fails, added to meeting the first mentor to know nothing new, and putting the whole gang into jail, so easily, by the end. The script reuses many points from the previous 2 movies; the big bosses are watching the lead through cameras in a surveillance room while beating their men, a car chases another.. one flips.. then the always great Jason Bourne comes out unharmed (the trademark of Bourne movies I guess, since it's present, as it is, in all the 3 already!), and - why not - (Julia Stiles)?? The only necessity of doing that is the penury. It has zero drama, zero attraction, and with (Matt Demon) around.. no credibility at all.<br/><br/>(Matt Demon) as an action hero is a tragedy. No matter what Kung Fu he mastered, this guy is too poor to convince me that he can waste all of these men in seconds. As a charisma, he's just a flat boy. And as an actor, there wasn't anything to be acted in this movie. See, lesser actors like (Arnie) and (Sly) do the job better. They can convince me as fighters, they have tough charisma, and they act in cool way (like saying their one-liners in memorable wit). So (Demon) here couldn't be them, and that script couldn't give him a decent chance to be a serious Bond either.<br/><br/>Director (Paul Greengrass) did some noticeable efforts concerning the action. And he handled the rest with his familiar style of shaking the camera deliberately as a different way to make the Hollywood fun while mixing it with a touch of realism. However, while there is no script to it, and a lot of (Demon), the action ran pointlessly and boringly. The green color that embodies the lead's pale memory, or the vague facts around him, didn't serve much, especially when he *remembers* this time (maybe Greengrass didn't remember that itself!). Sometimes shaking the camera was exaggerated for no reason. For big example, recall the scene of telling the brother that his sister / Bourne's love died; that was really annoying and adolescent!<br/><br/>The movie, self-conceited to the max, almost believes itself as one gritty political thriller. But by that empty absurd script, the whole thing turned into a long unfunny comedy. Scriptwriter (George Nolfi) is brilliant when it's about writing a collapsed movie, with dozen of unsolved questions, which looks so confident though. (Timeline - 2003), (Ocean's Twelve - 2004), and (The Sentinel - 2006) are good examples. Every one of them, including surely (The Bourne Ultimatum - 2007), seems like someone talks absolute nonsense yet so seriously. It isn't droll. It's rather pathetic, and with the insistence that it's droll: provoking!<br/><br/>Good things? The cinematography despite the over-shaking, the intense orchestrated music despite being unduly on for all the time, and the action stunts despite being detached segments that could be watched separately.<br/><br/>It is a mix of alleged script, too many whys and hows, very uninteresting lead, dull everything, and thrilling nothing. All of it encourages you not to interact, respect, hence watch. Long story short; I slept in front of it.. truly. (Ultimatum) is no more than inconsiderable movie that tries desperately and miserably to feel considerable. Let it, its publicity, and its blind fans delude anyone else. Voted as ""Movie of the Year 2007"" by Empire magazine MY FOOT!"
"son_of_cheese_messiah","6","0","2","13 January 2011"," Does not withstand repeated viewings
","When I first saw this, I thought it to be among the most exciting things I'd seen, however at the second viewing, it seems contrived, ridiculous and frankly annoying. Yes, there is always a great deal of suspension of disbelief in a Bourne film as in a Bond film, but this stretches it beyond breaking point. Certain things, slightly off putting the first time round become more tiresome on the second. The shaky camera work for example and the over-the-top sequences actually seem less exciting for being so unrealistic. When the film maker is not bound by the rules of physics or the basics of human anatomy literally anything is possible. So we have characters who survive impossible crashes, walking away with barely a scratch. Both Bourne and another 'asset' survive an unbelievable collision (which Bourne survives by holding the seat belt tightly!) with only Bourne having a limp to show for it.<br/><br/>Nor does Bourne's abilities stop merely at being invulnerable. He also seems to possess vast knowledge beyond his ken such as a detailed knowledge of Waterloo station including back ways out of sweet shops, where they lead and other routes to get there. No one in these shops seems to object at someone walking through by the way. Being an 'asset' is one thing, but things like this require detailed knowledge not acute powers of observation. <br/><br/>One of the poorest scenes, which annoyed me even on first viewing, was how Bourne gets into the highly secure CIA building and out again undetected. This was a wasted opportunity for an action sequence, made worse by a pointless phone-call which Bourne tells the CIA chief what he's doing.<br/><br/>Another aspect is that the characters are poorly motivated. This is especially true of Nicky Parsons in this film, who oddly shows up out of nowhere them gives up her career and apparently is prepared to spend the rest of her life on the run, simply to help Bourne out. He must be one hell of a guy. We never find out what her motivation is, although possibly this will be revealed in another episode of this franchise I guess."

"reviewbot","8","0","1","25 August 2010"," Film three in the series, Bourne is as kickass as ever and everything is finally coming back to him.
","REVIEWBOT - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is once again brought out of hiding in search of information relating to his identity. He discovers a journalist from The Guardian has been leaking information about him and his involvement in the Treadstone operation; and also about its mysterious predecessor ""Blackbriar."" He sets up a meeting with him but is soon spotted by CIA deputy Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) who assumes he is the source of the leaks; and wastes no time in trying to take him out. Bourne's energy levels for a human are frankly astonishing; as he is chased through Moscow, Paris, Madrid, London and Tangier. Although he does get a little help from his friends Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and Pam Landy (Joan Allen) who was on his tail in Supremacy; and reveals to him that his real name is David Webb. He goes on a mission of revenge; a human emotion which I feel is particularly unhelpful, and uncovers the harsh reality about what turned him into a killer.<br/><br/>Matt Damon once again does a great job of portraying Bourne, a believable action hero. There are a few stand-out sequences during the film; including a suspense filled chase through the busy Waterloo train station in London and fast paced rooftop chase scene in Tangier. There also plenty of brutal fight scenes and more action packed chases, which don't detract from the overall storytelling. ""Shaky cam"" is still pretty prolific in the movie; and does grate in places but adds to the overall into-the-action feel.<br/><br/>The conclusion to Bourne's story feels satisfying, so any further sequel will have a lot to live up to. Overall this is a very well made, well rounded action trilogy; at the top of its genre. It certainly got my circuits firing."

","So, this highly acclaimed trilogy pretty much boils down to lots and lots and LOTS of shots of Matt Damon walking, rapid cutting the whole time as if there is actually something happening rather than just lots of walking, and the gimmick of constantly changing destinations and 'local colour'. Matt Damon isn't given much to do other than to look harried but very determined. His face doesn't really need to register anything else, and so doesn't register anything else. There are burst of violence, which seems to be what us as the audience is waiting for. Then the burst of violence is over and it's back to the walking. Of course, I will be told that it's all about surveillance and how anything is possible to the 'intelligence' services, and that we live our lives oblivious when we should just wake up. The thing is, who doesn't know all this already? Take that away, and all that's left is the aforementioned walking, rapid cutting, Tangiers, Paris, Madrid etc to do some more walking.

","Paul Greengrass might wish to consider getting a camera tripod. The Bourne Ultimatum is a pure exercise in 'Parkinson's camera'; Greengrass gleefully indulges in shaky photography which results in a blinding action thriller. I wouldn't fault him because he has the cinematic intelligence to justify his decision to film the final chapter of the Bourne trilogy on a vibrating bed. However, he goes a little too much in certain scenes, jerking the lens about even during slower face-to-face conversations.<br/><br/>The storyline packs a punch, delivering an intricate plot of a former spy hunted by government agents who are determine to thwart the former from recollecting his mysterious past. The result is a well-conceived screenplay that makes James Bond films look like child's play. The Bourne Ultimatum is inherently a foot chase over many cities from New York to Madrid. I've to applaud Greengrass' for building up several of the film's twenty minute chase sequences' to heart-pounding levels through the clever use of snappy editing and the above-mentioned Parkinson's camera approach.<br/><br/>The final climax is somewhat anti-climatic and predictable. But that does not numb our satisfaction for The Bourne Ultimatum. It's one of the leading exponents of the spy-thriller in recent years. Matt Damon and a highly talented supporting cast lend enough quality to the film's emotional core whilst the transition from its previous installment, The Bourne Supremacy, is fluid. Greengrass might be accused of overusing flashbacks (which are sometimes distracting), but most of us will acknowledge that the pacing of The Bourne Ultimatum is top-notch, giving viewers two hours of excitement no roller coaster ride could ever dream to give.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

This time, Bourne, who's not having a good day, is chased around Paris, Germany, and a whole bunch of other countries by the CIA, who assume he's a threat to the country and want him dead A.S.A.P. Worse, he's the pawn (or at least his identity is) of another assassinating's plot, and must make a run for it, eventually leading him to New York, his home, to confront the ones who changed his identity and forced him to become what he is today. It's also great to see most of the cast back from the other Bourne movies, including Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, who's attempting to take over the ""manhunt"", Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons, the woman involved in Bourne's plan to flee, and David Strathairn, as Noah Vosen, whom we eventually learn set up the plan to kill the innocent Bourne. It's wonderful, kick-ass entertainment, especially if you're having a really boring night. P.S. Are they going to make any more Bourne movies?"
"dwpollar","5","0","1","1 April 2009"," OK action & chase movie...
","1st watched 3/27/2009 – 5 out of 10 (Dir-Paul Greengrass): OK action & chase movie where there is basically one storyline. Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, is trying to determine his initial identity before working for the C.I.A. The CIA is trying to find him and terminate him before he figures this out. There are some subplots like a secret initiative where the CIA can kill anyone who gets in the way, a possible prior romance with a CIA agent played by Julia Stiles that is barely followed, and that's about it. The reluctant hero this time isn't given very many lines this time he just does a lot of running, jumping, hitting, killing, driving a variety of vehicles and is basically given the line "" we've got to go"" too many times. This is OK for an action movie, but this one has very little substance to any of the characters, which doesn't make you care much for them after the movie is over. In the first movie, Damon's character was established and we got to see him try to have a romance with another woman who was kind of on the run also – which made it interesting. In this one, he doesn't have much time for anything else but his ultimate goal – find out who he is!! A little more sympathetic agent, played by Joan Allen, late in the movie tries to help Bourne after finding out the corruption in the CIA which makes things a little more interesting, but by the time she gets involved the movie's about over and it doesn't do much to help it overall. So, if you like action movie's this one's OK , but don't expect much else."

","There's that SOUTH PARK episode (Red Man's Greed) with the Native Americans named Runs With Premise and Premise Wearing Thin. If THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004) was Runs With Premise, then THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is Premise Wearing Thin.<br/><br/>Another karate chop to the Spock Nerve, another car chase through crowded streets with no liability insurance, another amoral superspy whining over his lost humanity, all shot through director Paul Greengrass's furtive Steadicams waggling all over the place like George Clooney's head.<br/><br/>Seen it once, seen it at least three times.<br/><br/>And you must ask yourself, Are you a Bourne Completist or just a sucker for punishment? <br/><br/>Reviewer David Poland favorably compares the BOURNE series to the BOND series. I'm no massive Bond-aphile, but I can judiciously state that with the Bond series, each new movie gave us a new adventure, new nemeses, new escape predicaments, new luscious ladies, even new Bonds in some cases. In the three BOURNE movies to date, there is nothing new - rehashing the same plot and sold to us as some Great Trilogy (like STAR WARS or THE GODFATHER).<br/><br/>Directed once again by Paul Greengrass like an epileptic with Attention Deficit Disorder, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM starts from somewhere in the middle of the last movie, and the ending of the last movie becomes the middle of this movie - does that make sense? Doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still running, still trying to find his true identity (that is, the person he was before he was indoctrinated as a superspy), and the CIA (whose modus operandi seems to be to eradicate their own operatives so that illegal sanctions can't be traced back to them) is still chasing him.<br/><br/>Joan Allen is still barking orders at the CIA bullpen (don't these people ever sleep? They are literally in their offices around the clock), but now she is joined by the great David Strathairn (wasting his time and talents); button-nosed Julia Stiles makes another contrived appearance. Brian Cox killed himself at the end of the last movie because, we suspect, he just couldn't take any more of the same plot line, but this movie provides a doppelganger to take his place as the crooked CIA boss - Albert Finney. Scott Glenn even tries to scare us with his vampire countenance.<br/><br/>Of all the assassins that have been sent for Bourne, the best fight must be that with the cold-blooded Desh (Joey Ansah, who reminds us of the dangerous Tarzan character from THE HARD WORD. When are Bad Guy Organizations going to hire Bad Guys who don't look so obviously like Bad Guys?). Greengrass finds the perfect balance for this fight, reminding us of the best moments from THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002, directed by Doug Liman). Unfortunately, his usual process of herky-jerky cameraworky will hurt your eyes long before the Bad Guys lose interest in Bourne's butt.<br/><br/>At least all three of these films' alphabetical order matched their chronological order.<br/><br/>Bourne does find answers in this third entry to the BOURNE franchise. Not only does he discover his real name, he discovers what a large asshole he was: in accepting his role as ""Jason Bourne: Assassin"" he himself gave up his normal life, which says something about his inherent misanthropy and sociopathic nature. Now he wants to recant his spy life  but though his spy life is murder and amorality deluxe, what kind of person must he have been prior to becoming ""Jason Bourne"" to want to become Jason Bourne in the first place? A discontent, dangerous, amoral, damaged personality that would do anything to escape reality.<br/><br/>Matt Damon IS Ann Coulter."
"I_John_Barrymore_I","Null","0","1","6 March 2009"," The Bourne Ultimatum
","Not quite as good as the first two Bourne pictures, but a thrilling entertainment nonetheless.<br/><br/>The emphasis on action is further escalated (to the detriment of the narrative), the centrepiece being a bloated, poorly-shot chase/fight sequence in Tangier that quickly outstays its welcome, is horribly generic and seems far removed from the realistic, down-and-dirty intentions of Identity, and to a slightly lesser extent Supremacy.<br/><br/>Not all the set-pieces are so familiar though: Ultimatum contains the best scene of the franchise by far, a lengthy sequence that begins with a phone call to a London paper's News Desk and culminates seemingly hours later with a narrow escape on the subway. It's one of the most brilliantly conceived moments of sustained tension I've ever seen, although coming as it does so early in the picture it unfortunately sets a high standard the film can't live up to.<br/><br/>While the films got progressively darker, Ultimatum sharpens that curve and the result is a more adult but overly-serious affair. Given the nature of the story and this chapter in particular the ending is perhaps inevitable, though it's still surprising, and a satisfying way to end the trilogy."

","If anyone is looking how to spend a couple of hours with a fast action film, they should look no further than to ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". Based on the Robert Ludlum novel, this is a movie that will not disappoint fans of the genre, or thrill seekers all over the world.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Paul Greenglass, takes us on a fast ride through several cities following CIA renegade operative Jason Bourne, who wants to find out his true identity. In the process, he will be chased by the same organization responsible for his own creation. The adaptation by Tony Gilroy, who also contributed to the two prior screen treatments of the saga, and the superb ""Michael Clayton"", offers an interesting premise for this movie. George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns also worked in the screenplay.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne is one of those movie characters that are larger than life. He proves that he is always one step ahead of the same people that gave him a taste for the job he was trained to do. Bourne problems begins when he wants to meet with a journalist from the English newspaper ""The Guardian"". The CIA chief, Noah Vosen, has other ideas in mind. He sends a team of killers to take care of Bourne at the busy Waterloo railway station in London. From that moment on, the film doesn't stop one moment to let the viewer catch his breadth.<br/><br/>Matthew Damon is well suited to portray Jason Bourne. This is an actor that is not as effective in other types of roles, but as an action hero, he looks unflappable. Nothing seems to bother him during some difficult moments where he has to fight all kinds of danger. David Strathairn, one of the best character actors of this generation, is excellent as the malevolent Vosen. This actor projects such malice with flair and style. Joan Allen, another excellent actress, doesn't have much to do in this version of the Bourne saga, but she has a pivotal role in helping Bourne achieve his goal. The rest of the cast, Julia Stiles, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, and even the great Albert Finney, have limited screen time.<br/><br/>The cinematography is by Oliver Wood, a good man to have behind the camera. His work is impeccable in whatever location the action takes place. Christopher Rouse's Academy Award winning editing enhances this film. John Powell's musical score greatly contributes to our enjoyment. Ultimately, all praise must go to Paul Greenglass whose intelligent approach makes this an action film that will stay in the viewer's mind long after it had finished."
"shanfloyd","8","0","1","1 December 2008"," High adrenaline action trip
","Being an ardent fan of the Bourne movies, my suspense was all built up before I sat down to watch this third installment. This is the film where all questions regarding Bourne's past are supposed to be answered. The screenwriters crafted a story compelling enough to keep the viewer occupied before coming down to where Bourne started. Director Paul Greengrass, like ""Supremacy"", again shows that he knows his job of directing an out-and-out action film very well. Although I'd comment that his trademark shaky hand-held camera technique is quite over-used here.I don't think all action sequences required that.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is once again his composed and physically super-fit Jason Bourne persona. Among the other actors David Strathairn steals the show as the CIA project chief Vosen. The role of Nicky Parsons is extended in this film and Julia Stiles does a good job at it.<br/><br/>The action sequences are phenomenal. What makes Bourne films tick is that they attempt to use more modern and different action styles other than simply car explosions, gunfights or chase sequences. The scene where Bourne runs through successive buildings and rooftops in Tangiers is just breathtaking. The use of Keysi fighting methods in the close combat sequences are impressive. Team these up with Greengrass' hand-held camera and sharp film editing and you get Bourne's adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>Read here in IMDb that they're making a fourth Bourne film. Now that Bourne knows his identity it would be difficult to find a suitable storyline as compelling as these were. But lets hope..."

","""Look at this. Look at what they make you give"".<br/><br/>THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM successfully redeems the Jason Bourne franchise, after the debacle that was THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, with an adrenaline-filled visceral ride through Northern Africa, Europe, and North America. Though not as intelligent as the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is purely fast-paced action at its best. That's not to say the screenplay is poor or unintelligent; it's actually quite good, and writer Tony Gilroy puts a lot of work into it. Seeing this film after THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, one might not be able to tell that it was done by the same director (Paul Greengrass, of UNITED 93 fame). Greengrass totally redeems the series with a stunningly intense and resolute Motion Picture.<br/><br/>The acting is again more impressive than that in the usual action thriller, and viewers (myself included) are slowly starting to like the way Matt Damon portrays Jason Bourne: with a low-key, emotionless, and nonchalant attitude. Julia Stiles has a bigger role this time around and does surprisingly well. Joan Allen is also good, and David Straithairn is simply a wonderful addition to the ensemble, as his portrayal of Vosen is almost flawless and believable.<br/><br/>The action is top-notch. I am personally not a fan of over-the-top action thrillers, but there are at least two lengthy sequences in this film that will draw many viewers in because they are so intelligently compelling and involving. Greengrass has the same 'shaky-camera' 'problem' that pervaded THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, and while the camera work is not as crisp as in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it's not as nauseating this time around, except for some of the hand-to-hand combat scenes. I suppose this was deliberate since I have noticed that some of the still close-ups are not without their 'shakiness'. My guess is that Greengrass does this intentionally to maintain the overall kineticism of the movie...who knows?<br/><br/>As mentioned, the writing isn't as good as the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY, but it is miles ahead of the sequel, and there is good development of characters and plot. As has become the case with many 'three-quels' these days, a lot of the story deals with past events (explanatory events that occurred prior to the original), and they are quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM surprisingly walked away with three production Oscars (Editing, Sound, and Sound Editing), and a close look at the film will reveal why: the sound editing editing is crisp and fresh; a departure from many action films.<br/><br/>Although I preferred THE BOURNE IDENTITY to this one, I will give THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM an 8/10 (even though the original got a 7) based purely on expectation and delivery; after THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, and after learning that Greengrass would helm this film as well, I expected the worst, and was pleasantly surprised. 3.5 stars (out of 4). The trilogy should, based on the strength of parts 1 and 3, make my 'Honourable Mentions' list. Highly recommended."

","Even with the great chase scenes and non-stop action, The Bourne Ultimatum ultimately does not satisfy as we have seen so much of this before.<br/><br/>It doesn't take much to realize as the film goes on that the head of the group has his own agenda. David Strathairn, in the latter role, plays the part cool and collected, even when the ax is about to fall on him.<br/><br/>Albert Finney, who comes in at the end of the film, is really marvelous in the role of the head who reminds Jason of what he has done and how the whole story came to be.<br/><br/>Joan Allen is so young looking here and appealing as a worker who comes to realize that Bourne is a victim of circumstance.<br/><br/>Naturally, Matt Damon steals the show in the lead role.

","First let me begin by saying this is a ""Comment"" not a ""Review"" and there is no need for me to sum up the plot of this film which has already been summed up by others. Let me say, however, that I grew up in a time where a thriller was a ""true"" thriller. I can think back on films like Silence of the Lambs and Cape Fear that combined action with psychological tension. Then there were the Hitchcock masterpieces. These days, ""Thrillers"" seem to be defined by how many non-stop computer assisted action sequences can be incorporated into a film. Which brings up to The Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>This film is non-stop action. Bourne runs, Bourne runs, Bourne runs... you get the idea. On the other hand, what ""plot"" there is actually makes sense. It ends up being an intelligent action thriller, with a LOT of action. I watched this film on DVD while working out on a treadmill and an hour felt like 10 minutes.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, if you like your thrillers with LOTS of action, and no plot ""loopholes"" in whatever plot there is, this one is for you!

","Robert Ludlum is, for me, unreadable. He writes techno-thrillers burdened down less by real thrills than by boring compilations of weapons specifications. Movies made from his books are, for me, only slightly more interesting. This was my first Bourne picture. The scenery -- Madrid, Tangier, even Manhattan -- was pretty. The action sequences were repetitive, unbelievable, predictable in their outcomes, and randomly violent. The characterizations and plot development were missing in action.<br/><br/>Black operations surely exist within the U.S. government run by pointed headed bureaucrats who truly believe that, by skirting the law and the bounds of moral decency, they are saving the Republic. The tables are turned in this movie, arrests are made, and Congress launches a public investigation. How unrealistic can a film-maker get?"

","Here we have the third film in the Bourne series, which is also the second of the films to have been directed by Paul Greengrass. Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne, this time evading CIA assassins once again while trying to uncover the secrets of his past.<br/><br/>The cast is good as usual, with a few holdovers from the previous film including Damon, Joan Allen & Julia Stiles. David Strathairn steps into the role of the latest guy who's out get Bourne and he does a decent job, though I much preferred Brian Cox. There are a few other noticeable names in smaller roles as well, including Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine & Albert Finney.<br/><br/>The script is packed with the same brand of action that made the first two films in the series noteworthy. While a different approach would have been refreshing it was nevertheless satisfying to see Bourne in pursuit of the secrets that truly made him who he is.<br/><br/>The direction by Paul Greengrass is very close to that of the previous film. There is a real uniformity between this film and ""The Bourne Supremacy"". I would have welcomed a bit of a change but for those who enjoyed the style of the second film this one is more of the same in terms of direction, editing, music and so on.<br/><br/>I can't quite see why this is the highest rated of the three Bourne films to date, though. I prefer it to ""The Bourne Identity"" but it's a bit too similar to ""The Bourne Supremacy"" for its own good. That being said, if all you're looking for is more of the same then I doubt that you'll be disappointed."

","I really like the Bourne Trilogy and is one of the few film trilogies that work on all three instalments. I really like Bond films and spy films in general and the good thing about this series was it forced Bond to change and make the excellent Casino Royale.<br/><br/>This film was easily the best blockbuster in 2007 and the best out of all the threequels that year.<br/><br/>The basic plot is Jason Bourne is still looking for his identity and is out for revenge against the C.I.A who had taken his life away from him. The film shows that an black-ops division known as Blackfaire which does all the C.I.A's dirty work such as training agents like Bourne, spying on anyone they think is a threat to America and even assassin people. This includes a British journalist in the middle of Waterloo station and American citizens. Bourne goes on a personal mission taking him to London, Madrid, Tangiers and New York. The plot is pretty complex and you will need to watch the Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy before watching this film.<br/><br/>They is great action in the film, especially the fight and chase scene in Tangiers. But what makes it different to other action films is they is a good plot and a heart to it. It shows the black side of the C.I.A: this is because the director Paul Greengrass is politically left-wing and very happy to show it. It is also different because it shows an American institution as the bad guy and questions it morales, compared to say 24 which it shows that the American would be very willing to torture people because they feel the end just justifies the means and that it would get information quickly. They are still guy characters within the C.I.A such as Pamela Landy and Nicky Parson.<br/><br/>They is good casting in this film, it help make Matt Damon from a decent actor to an action star, Julia Stiles best films and they are many other good actors in the film. This film easily plugs the gap until Quantum of Solace comes out this year. One thing I do worry about is talks of a sequel, which I don't know how they would do it."

","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007)<br/><br/>The 3rd part of the Bourne trilogy is certainly the best film of this trilogy. Though lacking a little in storytelling, the technique of this film is especially impressive, especially film editing. There's a lot of hand held camera usage and precise film editing on display here, that adds a lot of excitement and tension to the film. Unfortunately, two sequences actually duplicate from the 2nd Bourne Film, including the ending scene of the 2nd Bourne film. This is a disappointment and shows a lack of initiative and creativity. <br/><br/>When Bourne finds a surviving scrap of paper from a burned out briefcase that just happens to contain useful information to him (an address), well, this strains plausibility a little. What's immediately noticeable about this film is it's technique. The 2nd Bourne film, by the same director, was, in bits and pieces, a trial run for this film. Overall, director Paul Verhoven has crafted and excellent action film here.<br/><br/>The story begins where we left off in the 2nd film, with Jason Bourne on the run in Russia. The 2nd film came to a closure with Jason Bourne's escape. His escape sequence in Russia continues here to open this film. Jason Bourne, on the run in Russia at the end of the 2nd Bourne film, came to a safe escape, but yet we continue it here to open the 3rd film. This is my first minor criticism of this film. The 2nd and my biggest criticism is recreating, essentially duplicating the ending scene of the 2nd film near the beginning of the climax of this 3rd film. The police car chase scene near the end of this film, duplicates the same ending as the action set piece sequence of the 2nd film. <br/><br/>On it's own, this film is genuinely exciting and absorbing entertainment. Only with the 2nd film in memory, the minor flaws of this film become evident. <br/><br/>Winner of 3 Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Sound and Sound Editing."

","I read all his books. In fact, I read the Bourne series again before the first movie hit the streets. The movies are better and the last is to my mind the best of all.<br/><br/>The first installment flawlessly combined the requirements of laying down the basic story line with plenty of action and, most importantly, making sure we cared about the main characters. It was the perfect stew for the spy intrigue-action movie guy. The best of the series.<br/><br/>The second installment advanced the story and finally resolved things undone in the first movie. I had no idea where the third installment would go, since the films had long since abandoned the story arc of the novels. But, I thought the second installment the best of the series.<br/><br/>So, I was not only surprised, but pleasantly surprised by the force delivered by the last film. Its complicated storyline unwinds just slowly enough to keep your attention focused and the non-stop action keeps your viscera wholly alive. What else could you ask for from a smart action movie? The best of all of them.<br/><br/>The only thing I felt bad about at the movie's end was all those wasted Bond movies.

","A strong entry into the series? This is about as strong-a entry into a series of films as a Halloween sequel is. It seems that director Paul Greengrass has attempted to combine art with entertainment and has come up with a right mess consisting of very few things and those few things in their own right are disappointing. On the surface, The Bourne Ultimatum is Matt Damon returning to the role of Jason Bourne; a man on a mission, a man betrayed by those he was once employed by and a man fighting tooth and claw everyday  running and hiding, trying to evade capture or death  and for what? Well, this addition to the trilogy throws in the old 're-discovering the roots' plot line towards the end after someone in the agency turns out they feel a little sorry for Jason, needless to say, that was a huge anticlimax as is 80% of the film.<br/><br/>A lot may have been said about the camera work but I don't really have that much of a gripe with it; I acknowledge that people's attention spans when it comes to these sorts of films may wander uncontrollably but here, the shaking and the panning is enough to give even those with severe ADD the sense that they may have missed something and would like to go back to double check. But it is more than the camera that brings The Bourne Ultimatum down to the level of mediocre action film dross, it is the fact the entire film is a series of reaction shots; the idea that after having seen this film, stupid people will now be able to tell people they know a country called 'Morocco' exists or that in London there's a station called 'Waterloo'. But the biggest problem with the film is its story because it is a narrative that has been stretched across three films now and by the time the thirty minute mark has gone in this addition, it is a narrative that has worn thinner than an already size zero supermodel on a crash diet. OK, we know Bourne is on the run; we know these government people bark a lot at their colleagues, displaying copious amounts of ego and we know that towards the end, Bourne will get close enough to where he was created just so that we can witness him have an epiphany, with a little help from an insider who conveniently helps him.<br/><br/>The trouble with the film is that there is no heart and there is no logic at times, either. Everything is done by the numbers with chase scenes that do not thrill; fight scenes that do not matter and character interaction down the line of a cell phone complete with stern faces and serious reactions. Onto reactions; this film loves its reaction shots. Every so often there is a reaction in the command centre from one of the many nameless and faceless suit wearing government officials that want to kill Bourne. Every so often, Bourne will look at his surroundings, maybe whilst talking to reporter Simon Ross (Considine) as everyone keeps moving; talking and following one another; it is: 'chase, stop, talk, reaction' repeated about fifty times.<br/><br/>If people are to compare Bourne to Bond, the Bourne films must exercise some sort of clarity; some sort of interesting idea or narrative; some sort of mission for Jason to take part in  the first Bourne film worked because we knew as much as he did due to amnesia but along with that, there was a love interest; a hit-man out to stop Bourne and the off-screen threat of the government felt fresh, but here it is either too lacking or has gone stale. Locations are another important part of these sorts of films, especially if people will compare Bourne to Bond since here, there does not seem a reason for Bourne to travel except to keep on hiding. We are given crude establishing shots every time the action shifts to a new locale: Waterloo station; a Moroccan slum; Madrid. Each shot has a tacky sounding accompanying electronic soundtrack, moves slightly as it shows us these places and generally feels like its some sort of moving postcard. I think it's sad that an English director has to set his action at Waterloo, the busiest station in London but maybe the only one American's will recognise, likewise if the action is set in Spain  where else to go than the actual capital Madrid? It's never anywhere else, is it.<br/><br/>There is a scene that sums up the brainless logic behind the entire film. The scene takes place in Morocco and a car has blown up, maybe injuring Bourne. Desh (Ansah) does not think to walk over and finish him but walks off: cut to the reaction shot and you guessed it; Bourne opens his eyes as the stirring music starts up, kicking him into action as he tracks down the guy and has a fight with him  that highlights both the logistical flaws and the re-occurring reaction shot problem. By the time Bourne has a chance to find out who he is, we are sick of the sight of him; if we've seen him jump off a building once and live to tell the tale, we don't need to see it one final time as his leg flinches and that music starts up again. The Bourne series is becoming an obligatory and inane passage of film, straining its story and dumbing down its thrills and logic  this is certainly a case of The 'Yawn' Ultimatum."

","It's occurred to me that the cartoons these days are becoming more human in their reactions and facial responses and the modern-day action films are becoming more cartoon-like in the antics and tricks they can display. There seems to be whole new treatment of films now by the new generation of directors. They are dead keen on the fast editing, cut out the establishing shots and bombard the customers with this endless drumming which for me, is a total pain. Can the Sound Editing of the film really have got an Oscar?? The mind boggles. I enjoyed the film but only because I had a DVD of it and had the subtitles showing. Without them, I would have lost 30 to 40 percent of it. Films these days take no account of the difficulties for the hard of hearing with their multi-sound sources coming through the speakers. Having an unnecessary drumming racket going, virtually uninterrupted throughout the whole film was a bit hard to take. The story, the dialogue, the action, does not necessarily need an endless racket to keep the attention of the viewer. Tell them to watch RIFIFI."

","Movies can either get us to suspend belief, or to view them as tongue in cheek enjoyable performances. The problem with The Bourne Ultimatum is that it takes itself far too seriously to accomplish the latter, but is far to ridiculous to get us to suspend disbelief. Ultimately, it has enjoyable sequences but falls far short of being ""the best action picture in decades"" which is how it is billed on the rental box.<br/><br/>Technically, it is well done with good camera angles, a great deal of variety, and decent acting. It is entertaining, which is always a redeeming feature. Bourne is treated as a superhero, able to leap from tall buildings, jump out of all manner of car wrecks without a scratch, dodge bullets with impunity, and otherwise perform amazing stunts with ease. The actors are good across the board, and in isolated scenes credibly portray tension, anger, and intrigue.<br/><br/>But the plot itself is absurd, as are the capabilities of the CIA which are portrayed. Murder for unknown reasons at the highest levels of the operation, never really explained. This is paranoid delusion, the kind of thing you expect from a stoned out hippie at 3 AM who relates how ""they"" are killing people left and right but only the real ""insiders"" know about it. Yet somehow proof is never offered, nobody ever leaks the operation, and Americans just get shot willy-nilly without a trace of integrity or remorse. At its most fundamental level, this is just another Hollywood attempt to turn Americans against the CIA. We've got people being blown up all over the world by terrorists, but the movie industry seems to be obsessed that the bad guys are always Americans who are ostensibly patriotic. This meme gets boring after a while.<br/><br/>What is outright ridiculous is the capacity the agency is given to have a camera in every hall, on every building, and in every street and alleyway in the world. This all gets piped in to the top secret war room as if you are right there on the scene, courtesy of some wildly concocted surveillance system that never even goes out of focus. It's a little too much to buy into even in your wildest dreams.<br/><br/>That would be humorous, and perhaps enjoyable if it were done with an occasional wink to the audience. Instead, it is treated as fact and becomes part of the movie taking itself too seriously for the content it is delivering."

The entire pretext of the book is that Jason is out of practice from going underground (retiring)for 20 years and relies on his trained instincts to survive one attempt after another from the Jackal prior to the conclusion.<br/><br/>I guess the fourth installment of Jason Bourne will follow the book, maybe titled ""Bourne Ultimatum 2, the Final Showdown"".<br/><br/>I give the movie a 5 just because it was a good action movie but if the writers are going to name it after the book, follow the book a little more than just using the correct name of Jason Bourne."
"Grant_Price","8","0","2","4 January 2008"," Extreme in so many different ways
","The best trilogy of all time? Let us compare Bourne to other prolific movie threesomes. Star Wars? Nope, Bourne triumphs because it doesn't slap the audience in the face with a homosexual teddy dance to the strains of a John William's reject dance number at the end. The Godfather? I guess if Sofia Coppola hadn't stuck her giant nose into the third part then maybe, though even then the final instalment was not consistent with the other two. Die Hard? I always feel let down that 'Vengeance had to lower itself to join the ranks of the at-the-time burgeoning Buddy Cop genre in order for it to succeed. Indiana Jones? You've got to admit, Temple of Doom was crap. The Lord of the Rings? It is far too long. Leone's Man with no Name trilogy? No, simply due to the ridiculous, overdubbed prospector in the second part, who takes it upon himself to attempt to single-handedly destroy the bad-ass Western genre with a five minute Benny Hill routine. So, in conclusion, does Bourne represent the best trilogy of all time? No. The other films NOT mentioned in the trilogies above more than make up for their lacklustre cousins and stand head and shoulders above anything a buffed-up Matt Damon can offer. However, Bourne is indeed the most consistently rewarding. Ultimatum does not disappoint and in fact is probably the most entertaining of the three. Whereas audiences for 2002's Identity had to tolerate Franka Potente throughout and 2004's Supremacy was so up its own ass it would never see daylight again, 2007 seems to be the perfect year for Robert Ludlum's amnesiac assassin.<br/><br/>The strengths are numerous: a strong performance by Damon (as usual), a good supporting cast (chameleon actor Paddy Considine appears as an unfortunate Guardian newspaper journalist), realistic feeling action scenes and stunts (Bourne versus Desh), non-trite dialogue (Supremacy was full of it) and a bass-heavy soundtrack by John Powell which fits the film perfectly. A particular asset of Ultimatum is its total attention to detail; it feels as though Bourne is a real person living in the world and director Paul Greengrass just happened to be fortunate enough to capture all his movements on film (which would account for the overabundance of the shaky-cam technique...if it was real.) The use of different languages adds to this effect. The product placement does not feel forced, nor does it repeatedly smash the audience round the head with ""Look at ME! I'm Staples, the superstore! Come to Staples! Staples rocks!"" <br/><br/>In terms of weaknesses there are a couple of points that stand out. Why does Bourne feel as though he has to reveal to the CIA head that he is in his office, thereby making it several times more difficult for him to escape the premises than it would have been had he just said ""Oh you're in your office? I'm in McDonalds. Yeah I know, the burger never looks like it does in the picture."" Is it some sort of ego trip? ""Yeah, I'm in your office, I outwitted you once again. Come and get me."" He's like Macauley Culkin in Home Alone. The other problem is that some of the film feels like a retread of the first two instalments. I realise that this is intentional in places, but the cracks are beginning to appear in Bourne's otherwise perfect facade.<br/><br/>In conclusion, please do not destroy the trilogy and make a fourth film, you money-hungry Hollywood producers. Because I know you're definitely reading this. A 'Bourne Legacy' or 'Bourne Betrayal' is simply unnecessary. As Bourne rightly points out near the end of the film, ""This is where it started for me. This is where it ends."" Besides, who wants to hear yet another revamped version of Moby's 'Extreme Ways' over the credits in a couple of years time?"
"anhedonia","9","0","1","30 December 2007"," Redefining edge-of-your-seat
","How refreshing it is to sit in a theater and be thoroughly engrossed and excited by an intelligent, brave, adult thriller that actually makes the audience think. Forget ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones"" or even the over-hyped ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogies, the ""Bourne"" films might very well be the most entertaining and thrilling trilogy made.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Ultimatum"" begins a few minutes after ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) ended. And from the opening foot chase through the streets of Moscow (with the former East Berlin substituting for Moscow), ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" turns into a relentless and smart thrill ride as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) tries to figure out what happened to him.<br/><br/>True, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is essentially a chase picture. But thanks to director Paul Greengrass - what a brilliant move it was to bring him back for this film - Damon and some crackingly good editing by Christopher Rouse, the film is never dumbed-down. Some of it does seem preposterous, but the filmmakers and the actors - and there are some good ones here, including the always wonderful Joan Allen, David Strathairn and Julia Stiles - we are drawn into Bourne's predicament and find ourselves taken for one delightfully, pulse-pounding ride. The New York chase and the scene at Waterloo Station are two of the most tense, exciting sequences I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Damon truly has grown into this role and has quietly turned into a fine actor. Greengrass seems to get the best out of him. So it isn't surprising that the two are teaming up for ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City,"" about our illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq. I've always been a huge fan of Strathairn's - see some of his terrific work in John Salyes' movies - and in ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" he brings such quiet venom to Noah Vosen that you can just imagine the menace lurking under his persona. As for Allen, someday she'll win an Oscar, and it would be a well-deserved award. She is truly one of the best out there. And, this time, Stiles gets a juicier bit, but proves worthy of her expanded role.<br/><br/>As for the cinematography. I realize there are countless complaints about the use of hand-held shots and Greengrass certainly loves dong that. In fact, he seems to specialize in that. I didn't think it caused motion sickness. And I didn't find it distracting in the least. Greengrass' approach actually works very well for the story he's telling. It worked well on ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and it does even better here.<br/><br/>What's ultimately most satisfying about the ""Bourne"" movies - and especially ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" - is that it shows that you can make an adrenaline-rushed action film, but still make it clever, snappy and entertaining. In an age when Hollywood likes to turn pro wrestlers into stars and give them action films with dumb dialogue, films such as the ""Bourne"" movies are rare and should be appreciated. Here's hoping we get more of this kind and less of, say, ""The Condemned"" (2007) or ""The Rundown"" (2003)."

","I was a late bloomer, watching Bourne Identity and then Bourne Supremacy. They were great, and left me guessing. Then later, the Bourne Ultimatum rolls around, and it looked like a great piece of movie making. So I decided to go see it in theaters and was blown away. I love movie making, and I was as much in depth about how they did the making of the movie, like the stunts and all, rather than the movie itself. I saw it again, and I loved it just as much as the first time. I always laughed when, Roberts, I believe, was outsmarted by Bourne. Now, what I really like about Bourne, isn't like James Bond, who pulls out his granade launching watch (dramatization) and blows everyone away. Bourne uses his fighting skills, environment, and his head. For example, where he and Desh were fighting in the house, Bourne used a towel to defend himself against Deshs' razor. Bourne is a quick thinker, who knows what to do as soon as it happens. When Bourne was leading the reporter around the Waterloo Station, my friend and I were joking that Bourne had Google Earth all in his head. But overall, an incredible film. Bravo to all who made this film happen. -$tanley"

That would be great but I hope Hollywood doesn't damage the brilliant trilogy. Julia Stiles was great once again as Nicki and Pamela Landy wasn't as irritating as she was in Supremacy.

","After a somewhat weak second part, the end of the Bourne trilogy really shines. A start-to-end fast-paced action hunt this movie is sure to keep your pulse high all throughout. The story is not very complex and quite shrunk down from the book, but credibly told and it naturally integrates with the flow. Locations are extremely authentic (except i think they cleaned Tanger's streets a bit more than someone would believe who's been there :) ) Actually this global setting is what makes Bourne stand out from the pack. This is not your usual America-centric effect-stuffed action movie. You are really there, in all those countries, with all the right details of how they look and sound and behave. No stupid clichÃ©s. No pyrotechnical sparks flying when cars crash into each other. Instead find yourself immersed in a beautifully orchestrated symphony of broken glass and bending metal. And except for the phones i found no annoying product placements bending the story to show their names bigger on the screen. Excellent acting and well-done stunts round it all up.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is not a stunning new concept or daring experiment, but through and through solidly crafted and done with a lot of love for detail.

He makes his way over to London's Waterloo train station to meet a reporter who he believes can lead him to the source of the hunt to eradicate him. There is a super scene with Bourne evading the guys chasing him. Unfortunately the reporter doesn't fare as well.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles is back as Nicky Parsons who sympathizes with Bourne's plight and remains his ally. Always competent David Strathairn is CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen. And Scott Glenn is CIA Director Ezra Kramer. Albert Finney is Dr. Albert Hirsch, head of the division that indoctrinated Bourne and others in the covert experimental program.<br/><br/>Joan Allen is back as Pamela Landy, and she has a critical role to play counter to Vosen, who is bent on exterminating everyone who might expose the illicit operation.<br/><br/>A really, really good and entertaining movie.

","This film is one of the most solid third-installment movies I've ever seen. It had the same feel and flow as its two predecessors, which made it feel like I was watching the same singular movie, instead of the three-part story that it is. The way they seamlessly blended the movies together is incredible. The plot progressed nicely, the character development (especially that of Jason Bourne) was fantastic, and the dialog scenes were good enough to keep my focus and transitioned before the dialog got too lengthy.<br/><br/>The action sequences had the same great quality that you would expect from the two previous movies. While that's good and all, that also provides the one demeaning quality to the movie: It's more of the same. Together with Identity and Supremacy, this film is amazing, but it does not have anything to make it stand out from the other two (besides the fact that it has the ending). This statement speaks volumes, as it was reaffirmed by several customers I had who asked about the movies. They couldn't makes distinctions between the three movies, and I came to find that even my own knowledge between the first two Bourne installments was blurred in a few areas.<br/><br/>I had one other hang-up with this movie. For a man who is wanted by almost every country that he is in throughout the movie, Bourne is able to seamlessly get from nation to nation almost as easily as fast-forwarding the movie to the next scene. It just stuck out to me as something that was either overlooked or cut-out completely due to time constraints.<br/><br/>If you're like me and you love the first two Bourne movies, then you will also love The Bourne Ultimatum. Otherwise, it's just more of the same. It is a great action movie, and it deserves the 8.5/10 I am giving it. I just wish it had a little more to it than just ""a great ending to the trilogy"".

Okay none of it is remotely grounded in reality but for sheer white-knuckle ride entertainment, this can hardly be beat, so sit back, strap yourself in and go with the flow. The set - pieces are terrific, from the murder in the crowds at London Victoria Station to Bourne's pursuit of a top CIA assassin on the trail of his female ally - the from-behind shot of Bourne crashing through an apartment window at the scene's climax is classic - as well as a heart pounding car chase. Characterisation is of necessity slim, with few exceptions it's polarised goodies versus baddies, but there's no denying Damon's presence in the title role, essential as the film stands or falls on his ability to carry the viewer along with him in his quest (subjective shots are plentiful). Although convoluted, the plot makes a sort of sense and via a few twists and turns, comes full circle at the end. I've bemoaned blockbuster SFX thrillers before but this franchise justifies any number of inferior copies and I for one hope that old Jason gets another knock on the head to go round all over again."

Although we are set up for yet another sequel, at least next time he will know he is called David Webb and not Jason Bourne. But what will the title of that one be? 'The Webb Supremacy'?

From the first one to this one, the plot is unnecessarily convoluted, hard to follow, and filmed in a relentlessly frenetic pace, as though to camouflage a story that lacks excitement to begin with. It's all far fetched espionage gimmickry that requires a heightened suspension of disbelief. None of the characters are likable, and Damon is majestically milquetoast and boring. The plot is basically a prolonged chase scene, embellished with telecommunications gadgetry, spy-tech mumbo-jumbo and instantaneous escapes to various countries. We're supposed to think a lot is happening, and the tension is supposed to be building. Wrong. I was starting to fall asleep, actually. We're also to believe that because of multitudinous European locations, the movie must be sophisticated. But the most irritating element to the movie was the herky-jerky photography; again, seemingly meant to fool us into an on-the-edge-of-your-seat mindset. All it did was annoy me, and remind me of stupid forensic cop shows on cable TV. And the flashback scenes were laughably amateur, as well. How this movie has such a high rating here is beyond me.

","The series of films featuring the character of Jason Bourne can be thought of as a modern-day interpretation of James Bond, but without the baggage: they feature a cool super-agent, and lots of high-tech action scenes, but without the sexiness and silliness that have come to define the movies about the English spy. Indeed, one might even suggest that 'Casino Royale', the most recent Bond film, was at least half a nod in the direction of Bourne. The last two instalments of the Bourne series have been directed by Brit Paul Greengrass, who made his name with drama-documentaries; but here, he proves himself surprisingly adept at the action game. He shows a clear preference for high speed zooms and pounding music, devices to ratchet up the tension that normally I find merely irritating; but in 'The Bounre Ultimatum', there is sufficient action such that this way of highlighting it does not seem excessive, and I watched many of the sequences on the edge of my seat. In some ways, this is a textbook action film, so why the low rating? The answer lies in the way that the film also possesses all the textbook limitations of action movies, namely non-existent characterisation and little plot beyond ""lots of people want to kill Bourne, but can't"". Of the actors, Matt Damon does his job in the lead role, Julia Stiles is utterly implausible as a secret agent with permanently coiffured hair, Daid Strathearn's villainous C.I.A. agent is potentially more interesting but seems to exist purely to be outsmarted by Bourne at every turn.

When I first walked through the theater doors, I hadn't heard much about Ultimatum, nor had I followed the series. I watched it, and was completely spellbound. My jaw dropped in the middle of the movie because the screenplay is so sharp, so intriguing that it will do just that. Obviously we see that some people have a talent in this business. Matt Damon is a perfect actor for Jason Bourne. He provides the look, the feel of a person who is lost within himself, confined within his own world which is unfolding itself more and more to him every single day. The situations he is put in get the best performances out of him possible. I saw him in Ocean's 11, 12, and 13 as a minor character but I never saw him like this. My hats are off to you Damon. Spectacular performance. The shaky camera angles also help you get the vibe of constantly being chased, forced to be as alert as Jason Bourne on an everyday basis. Whether it's in a motorcycle chase scene or a one-on-one brawl with an adversary of Bourne's, you will find your heart about to jump out of its place! And that, my friends, is the Bourne Ultimatum in a nutshell, without any spoilers. A down-to-Earth thriller and action-packed combo. if I've ever seen one! You won't want to take your eyes off of the screen once it's over, I can promise you that. Get it in time for Christmas; it's a movie you will watch over and over, and believe me, you will find something new to gape at every time around!"

","After the first Bourne Movie came out, I was massively impressed. I went off and read the books - by Robert Ludlum. I was then a little surprised by The Bourn Supremacy, which deviated greatly from the books. Personally, I always feel that not enough characters of depth are ""casulties"" of war. The Bourne Supremacy definitely satisfied my expectations, and I thought it impossible to make another film of the same story into such a block buster, especially when it had to compete with the ingenuity of its predecessors.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum, is a: fast paced, clearly distinct, precise, excellently shot, spectacularly directed, acted superbly (made extremely hard kept up with the changing scenes/ countries), AND clever thriller.<br/><br/>Top Top Top Notch Thriller."
"rlowe30","10","0","1","11 November 2007"," Oh Baby, Then it fell apart . . .
","Fantastic storytelling here, and dammit, now I've got a man crush on Matt Damon. All three chapters of the Bourne Trilogy hold up exceptionally well to multiple viewings, in fact are enhanced by doing so. As much as I hated to see Franka Potente exit downstream in ""Supremacy"", Julia Stiles is excellent as a forgotten paramour. She communicates volumes with her eyes. As in any terrific movie, the supporting cast is exceptional. The soundtrack absolutely rocks: you definitely want to hear these movies with headphones on. Greengrass keeps the action moving, with moments of close-up silence, deftly brushed with Damon's soft dialog, sweetly enhancing the tension. Thanks Bourne team."

","Black Ops Amnesiac/Killing machine Jason Bourne(Matt Damon,as grim and efficient as ever)has once again re-surfaced,this time in Russia,still not entirely sure of how he became who he became,but now with a better idea of who he is(a la the previous two films). He is starting to put the pieces together,particularly the connection he has with a project named ""Greenbriar"". He finds his target source in an investigative reporter in England named Ross(Paddy Considine).<br/><br/>Meanwhile,back in the states,the NSA gets word of Bourne's re-appearance and this time,a mid-level counter-terrorism director named Vosen(David Straithairn,as effective as a humorless,undaunted bureaucrat/villain as he is playing more noble characters,if not more so)agrees to try to eliminate Bourne,viewed as an embarrassing remnant of a project they'd just as soon forget they'd chartered. Chargfed with oversight of this project once again is PAmela Landy(Joan Allen,tall,stately dame extraordinaire),who has a better understanding of who Bourne is and how to handle him. Naturally,she is ignored by Vosen,who chooses to merely smoke him out and terminate him and,predictably,fails at every turn.<br/><br/>As Bourne gets closer to what he wants to find,he encounters another familiar face: Op Low-level techie Nicky Parsons(Julia Stiles,with progressively more in this film than she did the previous two),and she aids him along. It's of little surprise that her aiding him makes her as much a target as he,and the tension mounts as he has to both protect her as well as get himself out of the cross-hairs of some determined and skilled assassins.<br/><br/>Having seen the previous two films,and the memories of the ad campaigns from this summer,I got no surprises in seeing this film. Having waited until this made it to dollar films(and I'm not sure exactly WHY I waited for it. Money,I suppose),I feel like I have little to complain about if I found any shortcomings or deficiencies in it. I didn't(for the most part)and thought this was executed faithfully,effectively and competently. While the entertainment value of this movie and the series(which is bound to happen with ANY sequel)depreciating some--I mean,face it,the element of surprise and revelation seems to get smaller with each film,this time involving a previously un-referenced top level government Doc(Albert Finney,sounding a lot like Brian Cox in blurry flashbacks)--this is still a satisfying watch. Director Paul Greengrass returns to this franchise(having garnered impressive reviews for 2006's United 93)and employs the elements of moving,shaky camera to an effect I could appreciate. Instead of playing the action as something to be impressed by,the filming of the movie's action scenes are done more to an effect to give an element of confusion and de-romanticize the violence in play.For the most part,that impressed me,if it didn't always enchant me. Tehe element of suspense manages to build to a crescendo at the 2/3 point of the movie,with a particularly effective chase through a maze of apartments in Tangiers. THe screenplay by Tony Gilroy and Scott Burns is pretty lean,preferring let the verbal interplays between characters simply frame and take backseat to the action.<br/><br/>The one common trait of all the Bourne films(And perhaps for most,if not all,Robert Ludlum novels and their adaptations) is still plenty of frenetic violence,choreographed and yet raw. Put simply,when you sit down for a Bourne movie,I think it goes without saying that you're gonna need to ""buckle up"" for the ride.As such,I found this ride quite satisfying,albeit a bit routine and bumpy."

","Bourne Ultimatum turns out to be one of the best action movie ever. Every aspect of the movie is great. director Paul Greengras has delivered it in style. In fact this movie comes as a relief from all the typical visual effects fueled Very poorly made action garbage which is generally made these days.<br/><br/>Direction in this movie is undoubtedly cut to perfection. Director Greengras managed to hold the movie very well even if the movie was rocketing in full speed. The pace of the movie is very fast indeed. But then too there is no moment when the viewer gets confused or the plot goes very hard to swallow. Action sequences in this film are awesome, as expected from any movie of the Bourne legacy. The are no stunts which defy the laws of physics, or there is any use of hi-fi computer effects, or any Slow motion. But the action keeps u biting your nails.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has given one of his best performances ever as no nonsense, highly focused, sharp and of course stylish assassin. It seems there would have been no other actor who would have played the character in this way. He doubles the enjoyment of the film. Other actors in the movie have also done justice with their respective roles. <br/><br/>In fact everything in this movie is perfect. A must see."

I would really like to know what the outcome was...<br/><br/>It does not surprise me anymore that so many teenagers nowadays cannot focus for more than a micro second.

","Just like everyone said...This is a exceptional film.Made specially for the lovers of the speed,fight,drama,weapons,movies and... Spiderman???(short of). <br/><br/>Bourne is definitely the best action character that I ever seen. Not just because he can fight,drive,maneuver or reason better than any other action hero , beside, he got something that I hasn't seen in another one, and thats could be possibly the humility. I mean, Jason is a murder but he doesn't want to be it anymore and thats why I love the drama of this and the other two Bourne movies.<br/><br/>By other way,its true that the photography stile of the movie, just sometimes don't allows the audience to see the fight or race scenes, and even when is a great stile of shoot a movie, is really annoying to be moving your head like a maniac to see the action and YES... I drop a big guffaw of emotion in just a scene of the whole movie and that was when Bourne protects him self from Desh hits with a towel, but,in fact, I didn't watch a comic scene in this movie.<br/><br/>But,beside that,there is nothing wrong in this movie and no-one really cleaver can refuse that. This is a terrific film and is obviously the best movies as the year so far and the best of the Bourne saga.Well, is the best and i think is really great but,personally, Im still loving more the Supremacy.<br/><br/>And to conclude as I always said... I think that Paul wont hurt anyone if he chose to make one more Bourne movie...or two,or three, but he made something funny, he made a final that could be taking like a definitely closing, but also can be continued and still be perfect, so...Please...think about it Paul"

","I watched this movie because I liked the first one and the rating of it was high here. When I have seen the second one I thought this is the worst direction and it can't be beaten. I was wrong and here is the proof. You couldn't see the actions in the Supremacy because this camera shaking mania. Now the focus is gone in the third so you see less. I didn't see any sharp image in the movie. It was so annoying. The director didn't stop here. Now you can't see the action, it's done. What should I do about the conversations? Maybe I can show the talking character's backs and voilà. You see half faces, great! It's also done. The car chase seen also ruined. Actually you can't guess what's happening right now. What's the meaning of a char chase seen if you can't see it??? To say some good things about the movie. The story was exciting, Matt played his role well. The characters usually were intelligent. One thing was really dumb. The car stealing. Hollywood really should drop this wire sparking stealing technique. It's so outdated. We are in 2007! It could be a nice movie though if the direction doesn't ruin it."

","Missed chance for the Bourne vehicle. Great is Damon's believable performance of Bourne, although one might expect a bit more emotion after a three year run from everybody. Second best thing is the action which is spectacular but, unfortunately, in such overwhelming abundance, that it starts to annoy. Besides that, the story is... well, what IS the story? After two Bourne-is-on-the-run flicks, this is just a third. There's a bit of recap at the beginning and some wrapping up at the end, but it's just not satisfying enough to explain three years and three films of running and waiting. Too bad, for something that started from such a great story by Ludlum. But then again; what's the objective? If you're in it for the action, there might not be a better series so far. But if you're looking for a bit of a decent story, you might as well go back to the 1988 mini series with Richard Chamberlain. Might look a bit dusty, but great story."

","I liked this movie because it followed the plot in an unexpected way. It's pointless to watch it if u haven't seen the first two. But I couldn't get over some repetitive scenes like the car chase that ended as in Supremacy. Bourne seems to prefer strangling as a killing method and those jumps over the balcony through a glass window weren't too realistic. Bourne gets a girl again, out of the blue Nikky is in Madrid. As for the camera, I liked it. It's not art in any way, and I hold no grudge against those who find it disturbing.<br/><br/>As a tip for finding good movies: try to see who hated the Bourne Identity, Supremacy and watch the movies that they hated.

"mmxmmx2","5","0","1","6 October 2007"," Just non-stop action is not enough
","I liked the first Bourne movie when I saw it for the first time and remembered it as a well made ""nonstop thrill ride"". When I saw it for the second time, it was not much more than just an average action movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this was also the case with part 2 and 3, which I also saw recently and for the first time. There was no real story, because most of it was already told in part 1. The action and car chase scenes where quite good, but sometimes a bit _too_ fast paced and therefore a bit annoying, they might have been better without the ""shaky camera"" all through part 2 and 3. However, just the same scene over and over again - someone tries to kill him, and then a chase scene, is not enough for a good action/thriller movie. This is no real trilogy, as most of the story is in part 1, and the rest is just a collection of some action sequences.<br/><br/>I really don't understand the high rating compared to part 2, as it was basically the same. Some say that this is the ""new Bond"", and the latest ""Casino Royale"" was also a bit disappointing compared to other Bonds, but I really have seen better secret agent movies."

","After watching the Bourne Ultimatum there is just one thing that I need to get off my chest: One of the things that got me hooked on the Bourne movies was the fight scenes where you could actually see the action, which was pretty impressive in both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy. In the Bourne Ultimatum, the fight scenes are pretty much spoiled by the shaking and focusing in & out of the camera. (actually I can say the same for the car chases).<br/><br/>I would've awarded 10 out of 10 if it wasn't for this.<br/><br/>P.S.

"DunkelheitVZ","5","0","1","21 September 2007"," nice movie, but shaky cam makes the experience foul
","I have seen the movie yesterday and because of the ""to be expected"" shaky cam, my expectations were low. <br/><br/>Many friends told me that the movie is intelligent and I wondered why. Bourne is quite clever, he solves his problems with force most of the time (come on, no funny Star Wars jokes now)and he always seems a tad ahead in regards to his opponents. Does that make an intelligent movie?<br/><br/>The movie itself is not intelligent. There are no surprising elements, you know who is good and who is bad from the beginning and after 5 minutes I already knew the ending. Despite of these facts, Bourne ultimatum is a rock solid movie, it goes by too fast to let you think too much of it.<br/><br/>So far, so good... I would rate the movie 7 or 8 stars, <br/><br/>BUT let us speak about a feature which finds its way into more and more movies, the ""shaky cam""<br/><br/>I did not like the shaky cam in ""the shield"", I did not like it in Bourne 2 and because of this I was prepared for the worst (so I thought): So you make this Big Budget movie and you want to make it look like an amateur has filmed something with his mobile phone camera. Why?<br/><br/>The cam zooms straight in the faces till you can see even skin irritations. You have one cut in like every second. Maybe to show how ""hectic"" the situation is. But this makes the viewer think of the situation, because he cannot really see what is going on.<br/><br/>Let us take Bournes brawl with the agent in Marocco. You don't really see something of the fight, you don't know, who is superior, you cannot even see why Bourne wins the fight at the end. Was he just luckier or was he smarter or stronger? Only the ""shaky cam"" knows.<br/><br/>But while this fight is OK made and the chase above the roof tops of Morocco is quite OK, the car chase is just a bad joke. In no scene you can really tell who is driving where and from what direction someone is chasing. Hell, at the end of this chase, I don't even know if Bourne is pulling some clever stunt or the other agent is making a mistake. I just see Bourne taking his safety belt and ducking and Bourne is conscious again faster. Why is that?<br/><br/>A good movie shows a nice composition, well shot pictures, good fighting moves and interesting cuts. Bourne has neither of these elements. If a movie is shot similarly and I get to know about it, I will stay away from it, simple as that.<br/><br/>I could bear the ""shaky cam"" if the director would use it in some situations, but in the whole movie, it is just annoying and looks like it is shot from an amateur. Maybe the ""shaky cam"" is good for low budget movies. You can save some money and still make fights and car chases so shaky that the viewer cannot really judge if it is well done or in a bad way. But in a big budget movie like Bourne, an interesting part of the movies, the action scenes, loose my interest, because you cannot see what is going on.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know what you are going to say... the director uses the ""shaky cam"" to show how hectic everything is. You know what? A soccer match, is hectic, too, but if they are showing the matches in this way and I only see some trousers, hands and dirt flying around, only interrupted from some shaky shots to the audience that are happy about a goal, I stop watching soccer. If you like it, good for you, but when I have to think 90% of the time about something that does not even belong to the story, this cannot be right.<br/><br/>I really tried to be open minded about the style and the movie. But my opinion is firm now. A cam should be, like the score of the movie, be there to help the mood and the movie, but not be the main focus of my first view.<br/><br/>What a pity, Bourne is a nice movie (it does not belong in the IMDb top 250 though), but I have to take away 2 points for ""shaky cam"". Seriously, if you are a director and read this... stop this, thank you. We don't like it, it does not make the movie interesting, I hate it and it makes the movie annoying. Salt makes a meal taste better, but if you add to much to it, you ruin the meal and when you take as much as ""shaky cam"" in Bourne, it can even be a danger for your health."

","I watched the Bourne Ultimatum. Actually, I was hoping for a bit of Daniel Brühl, and that's all I got. Why bother hiring a brilliant up-and-coming young actor like this and then not give him any screen time? The movie itself was okay--pretty standard spy vs. spy stuff. What bothered me was the camera work. Can't anybody in Hollywood hold a camera steady these days? The cuts were so quick, you couldn't really make out what you were watching half the time. I guess that's the point; the loss of detail covers a multitude of sins and is a special boon to the stunt-persons, who can step in and out of the action practically without being observed. Just turn the sound effects up and no one's the wiser. That being said, I did enjoy parts of the movie. Matt Damon is very effective when he doesn't have to act (think of his Thespian turn in last year's The Good Shepherd). Julia Stiles had the best moment in the film, when she finds a reason to smile. The villains were interesting, especially the hit men, all of whom, like Brühl, deserved more screen time. So, I liked the film; I just don't understand why critics think it's the second coming of the spy genre. Producers, please note: three Bournes were at least two too many. That well is now officially dry."

","I'm obviously way out of step with the majority of people that have seen this film, but I can only imagine the cinemas are putting something in the popcorn. I enjoy a good action movie, and Bourne Identity is a very good example, but Bourne Ultimatum for me just completely loses the plot. Literally. There isn't one. It's just a continuous chase from the opening second. It's very difficult to develop any interest in the characters.<br/><br/>Poor Matt Damon looks old, tired and disinterested throughout, and frankly overweight for the character of Jason Bourne. Julia Stiles is thrown in the middle in what I can only guess is a desperate attempt to relieve the monotony, and the poor girl looks completely out of place and irrelevant. The comical ""government agency"" villains in charge of the piece just wander around the whole movie giving out inane commands to their subordinates, the latter seemingly able to miraculously pull up absolutely any information in seconds except when it doesn't suit the action. Joan Allen's character adds a little sanity to the proceedings, but still the overall contribution is incoherent.<br/><br/>Yes, yes, the action sequences are good, but surely a movie needs much more than this to warrant such high ratings?"

I think so, but I can't be sure because I'm focused on a tire, a headlight and part of a steering wheel in quick two second cuts worthy of an MTV video. These are linked together with long rapid pans that leave nothing but a blur racing across the screen.<br/><br/>Okay Paul, we get it. The shaky camera is supposed to subconsciously evoke the tension and excitement we feel watching news or documentary footage from war zones, riots or political conventions. How about evoking those feels with better scripts, better writing and better story telling? Too challenging?

","This is the trilogy of Bourne series. I had read the first novel about two decades ago, and the thrill of the imagining oneself as Bourne still remains with me, so I was excited to see what this new Bourne movie is to deliver.<br/><br/>The story line is wafer thin. CIA Government agents want to kill Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) who is trying to find out about his past. This leads to a global chase from Moscow to London to France to Berlin to Madrid to Morocco to New York (a side mention of India  just in talks). Obviously, in the end Jason Bourne remains unhurt and a winner  super hero! Director Paul Greengrass has maintained the same tempo as Bourne Supremacy. He uses hand held camera work (jarring and giddy) and quick edits (straining and blinding) to communicate a fast pace, but it leaves especially our eyes strained a lot.<br/><br/>As there is no story  there is a lot of actions. So actions lovers would love this movie. The feel one gets after seeing Jason Bourne is a resemblance to James Bond movies (but those have a lot of substance to it). Matt Damon is okay, a bit puffy faced.<br/><br/>Like Indian Bollywood movies  once we keep our brains outside the theatres and being empty-heads, watch this movie  this movie is somewhat enjoyable. Otherwise to accept those stupid globe trotting, easy sneak ins, child-play stunts, scratch-less hero, clichéd villains, perfect predictions of our hero - of cc-TV camera movements and people who follow him, etc. There are so many moments  where you shake your head and say to yourself  okay, this is a stupid movie silly, so do not use your gray cells!

"cartman_1337","6","0","5","14 September 2007"," Not what I was hoping for
","After reading the rave reviews this title has gotten everywhere lately, I must color myself a bit confused. Didn't anyone notice the extremely poor camera work in the action sequences throughout? Didn't anybody else get bored along the way in the way overlong chase sequences that seemed to dominate about half the movie? Didn't anyone else cringe at the lack of reality in some of the key action sequences in the film? Especially since the two first movies were far above the Hollywood par in this respect. Didn't anybody else notice the rather lackluster acting from most of the central ""bad guys"", probably due to their rather pointless characters, obviously written into the script to make the plot's obvious farfetchedness seem less far-fetched? Breaking it down I'd say the action sequences are utterly disappointing throughout. Story wise the first half is rather dull, with very little driving the plot forwards. The second half is a lot better, when things finally start to entangle. Ultimately the ending sums things quite nicely up for the whole Bourne trilogy. Then again, the series could well have ended with the nice, open ended, ending of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" too, and be all the better for it... There certainly doesn't need to be any more sequels in this franchise! Without a doubt the weakest link in the trilogy, but I have to admit it's not all bad. Especially the second half makes the film watchable. Still - it's not what it could, and should, have been, and I really don't see where all the praise from other users and critics are coming from. This is most certainly not one of the 250 best movies ever made (ref. it's #84 on the IMDb Top 250 at the time I'm writing this comment), let alone the best in the Bourne series. I feel kind of nice when giving it a 6/10. That's my first impression, anyway."

That was no reflection on the story (which was moving too fast for me to spot any gaping plot holes) or the acting (which I'm pretty sure there was some, although briefly) or the all-out, non-stop, in-your-face action (of which there was aplenty, much of it shot in close-ups so close that it was hard to tell exactly what was happening- but it was fast, and it was loud, lemme tell you).

In both cases, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I thought the first movie in this trilogy had a good thread throughout, but was a little inconsistent and rough. But, with the promise of at least one sequel, I figured that the people who made the first film would see the flaws, strengthen them, and produce a really good second installment.<br/><br/>They didn't.

I can see where the critics were coming from and I guess that as 'action' movies go this one certainly delivers but whilst it entertained it failed to engross me to the extent that I did NOT question as it was unspooling rather than later just HOW Bourne was able to travel so easily and quickly from country to country with - presumably - no passport and little or no money. In a similar way I queried the 'cheating' in the way that director Greengrass shot certain episodes, usually those involving high speed chases/fights etc so that, with the best will in the world, it is impossible to know just WHAT is happening; in other words we are unable to follow a given person and/or vehicle from A to Z and trace the trajectory. What we get is something like A to about F then it turns into alphabet soup before stabilizingng round about X, Y or Z.

"Chris_Docker","7","0","1","4 September 2007"," Leaps across clichés as easily as buildings - but entertaining anyway
","Don't you just love a good action thriller? Maybe with Matt Damon as the unassuming CIA agent - again, in search of his lost memories. Earlier episodes showed us brainwashed Jason Bourne (Damon) in search of answers or exacting revenge. In Bourne Ultimatum, he wants answers with a capital 'A'. And the CIA want to kill him off. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Supremacy) is to be applauded for keeping this series alive in the face of fresh James Bonds or smug Mission Impossibles. And although the Bourne Ultimatum is spy-thriller-by-numbers, it is still a polished production and does keep you on the edge of your seat for the length of the movie.<br/><br/>All this comes at some cost. Bourne leaps from roof to roof of conveniently spaced buildings with the same ease that he traverses worn clichés and the well-established Bourne plot. A pretty world tour of photogenic hot spots will have an establishing shot of say, London Eye, followed by hectic chases captured by hand-held cameras. Generic shortcuts are acceptable as long as we are being entertained. If we get time to catch our breath, we can even enjoy spotting some.<br/><br/>· Cars, even modern ones, and motorbikes, can invariably be started by touching two conveniently located wires. These also neutralise the steering column lock. But it's only a movie  we need such things.<br/><br/>· As the high tech CIA computers locate their prey, they will make little chirping noises. This is in case we miss any plot development. The same computers explain what's happening in large type, in case any visually-challenged observers miss the point.<br/><br/>· Jason Bourne accurately judges the space between two buildings when taking a running jump. This is acceptable as we expect the hero to survive.<br/><br/>· Vast numbers of innocent bystanders' cars will be trashed in each location. The newspapers don't notice anything amiss until needed for our story.<br/><br/>· Top journalists won't use shorthand (because then we couldn't follow their notes).<br/><br/>· When a highly trained hit man appears, he will pause long enough to be talked out of it. Highly intelligent Jason Bourne will always witter long enough to bad bosses to gloat about his real location. So they can come back and look for him in their office. This provides enough wry humour to make him likable.<br/><br/>As you can gather, The Bourne Ultimatum is one of those spy-flicks that looks great first time round and far too silly to ever watch again. It's point is to entertain you at the time. The CIA has been updated to look slightly out of control  Jason's hunters also handle borderline illegal stuff like renditions. Britain has more CCTV cameras than anywhere else and this is handy for the CIA that can instantly control all of them.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles maintains a nice unrequited love interest without make up or low cleavages (the Bourne trilogy is aimed at 'intelligent' viewers). Paddy Considine, deprived of the larger roles he had in Summer of Love or Dead Man's Shoes, is swept along convincingly  his acting shining all the more when he doesn't say too much. Acclaimed veteran Albert Finney has one of the best scenes as he calmly stalls our enraged Jason. Cinematography uses effective contrasts between open spaces, close combat, and all the great locations that money can buy.<br/><br/>""You start down this path and where does it end?"" asks spy-boss with-a-conscience, Joan Allen. Paranoia aside, I fear it will be more movies of this ilk: definitely worth the price of popcorn but just as disposable."

","The Bourne movies always deliver and they get better each time. This third installment is even better than its predecessor on many levels. The action sequences are spectacular, the drama and storyline are well presented and the characterisation is quality writing and top notch performances.<br/><br/>The only downside of this movie, as I would've given it a 9/10, is the decision by Greengrass to shoot the film on a very shaky hand-held camera style. The actions and settings of this movie are already well planned and executed. The shaky camera trick however reduces the coherence and clarity of these scenes. It does add a feeling of disorientation and rush to the whole movie, perhaps much like what Jason Bourne himself would be feeling throughout the ordeals.<br/><br/>However, it defeats the purpose of planning and executing such brilliant action and drama sequences. You can hardly follow what is going on, as the camera jolts, jumps and cuts sideways and from different angles often.<br/><br/>Other than that, this movie rocks!"

And a little more heroism would be nice too, but without overdoing it by exaggerating (showing he can do something that's impossible). The more realism and heroism the better.

","Back to days when I was in university, I was used to spend $0.80 to watch 3 action movies a day, in China. I am spoiled by good ones, especially great action movies directed by John Woo. For a long time, I don't think Hollywood really know how to make good action movies except spending money in CGI, inventing imaginary hitech weapons(like in Bond films), or showing muscles. The problem I have with those movies is that those directors simply did not respect audiences' intelligences, in terms of concentrating on action exhibition without wishes to say something more. Paul Greengrass certainly inverted the prejudice. The shaky technique is now a Bourne movies' trademark to drag audiences into the situation. However, it's not the point I like most. I think he is a good director knows rhythm. He carefully controls the time he could express some his own feelings like sympathy, and leave enough spaces for audiences. About the ending, although it's an old trick, I still have to say it's really well-done, especially in terms of establishing the connection with the beginning of the whole trilogy. From my point of view, it's the all time best action movie made in Hollywood. Good job, Greengrass. Well done, Hollywood!"

"EUyeshima","8","0","1","27 August 2007"," Breathless, Suspenseful Action Really Shows Greengrass' Mastery of this Genre
","As director Paul Greengrass proved with United 93 last year, he has an uncanny ability to tap into something viscerally powerful with his films. His extensive background in documentary film-making really comes to the fore when it comes to the ultra-lean storytelling, propulsive pacing and superbly rendered action sequences in this genuinely suspenseful 2007 film. Densely conceived plot turns are swift and sometimes contrived enough for eye-rolling, but Greengrass knows how to keep a viewer enraptured with his pure cinematic technique. As the third and presumably final entry in the Bourne series, which update Robert Ludlum's nail-biting novels from post-Vietnam War to the far more ambiguous post-9/11 era, this one picks up immediately where 2004's The Bourne Supremacy left off with CIA assassin Jason Bourne still struggling to recollect his past as he dismantles conspiracies emanating from the senior operatives within the agency.<br/><br/>Bourne has become the CIA's most-wanted. Regardless, despite a number of cunning assassins on his trail, he is intent on finding out who he is amid muddled flashbacks of mysterious interrogations. He gets help from fellow CIA agent Nicky Parsons, his former Paris contact, in Madrid where they end up in a diabolical chase through the alleys and rooftops of Tangiers. Both returning from Supremacy, Christopher Rouse's kinetic editing and Oliver Wood's hand-held camera-work make a powerful impact on this scene by making the action feel compellingly claustrophobic. The action all works toward a head-turning series of twists that bring Bourne closer to his real identity. The elaborately constructed screenplay is credited to three writers - Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi - who know how to play off our own paranoia about security and U.S. intelligence. Playwright Tom Stoppard apparently also had a hand in the final script. A sharp, Grade-A cast has been assembled, though this movie is obviously not an actor's showcase. Matt Damon returns as Bourne, all cool physicality with enough non-ironic humanity to allow us a rooting interest in his fate.<br/><br/>Bringing her natural authority to the role, Joan Allen also makes an effortless return as Deputy CIS Director Pamela Landy. Her philosophical adversary at the agency is the Machiavellian CIA official Noah Vosen played with surprising relish by the usually low-key David Straithairn. Paddy Considine makes the most of his few scenes as the understandably confused Ross, while an avuncular Albert Finney shows up late in the film with menacing subtlety as the key to Bourne's memory. The one weak link continues to be Julia Stiles, who maintains her poker-faced petulance as Parsons from the previous films and remains only marginally interesting as Bourne's female foil by default in this go-around. However, it's really Greengrass' craftsmanship that shines brightest here. A perfect example can be seen in the extended breathtaking chase sequence with a British journalist Simon Ross being tracked through London's particularly busy Waterloo Station for a planned rendezvous with Bourne. If there is one drawback to the third film, it is the presumption of some understanding of what happened in the first two installments. It just makes some of the set-up a little harder to follow. Otherwise, this is bracing, often enthralling entertainment for anyone who loves this genre of cinema."

","Following not one great movie but two with a sequel of equal quality is extremely difficult to achieve. You only have to think of 99% of the movies with a '3' in the title to realise that, in the majority of cases, by the third instalment most franchises begin to show signs of saturation. Not so here.<br/><br/>With The Bourne Ultimatum we have a fitting conclusion to the series that fully justifies its place in the franchise. It not only provides long-awaited answers to questions asked in the earlier movies, but manages to include action sequences that live up to - and in some cases outdo - those of its predecessors (think back to the sequence in the mini from the first Bourne movie or the scenes in Moscow from the second). There is an urgency here and Bourne is always moving which keeps the audience on its toes. Every scene has momentum and its this thrilling pace which ensures your eyes are constantly glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Matt Damon, as before, is the heart of this movie and his portrayal of a desperate man capable of utilising any item as a weapon (the lengthy fight scene here with a fellow assassin outdoes similar scenes from the first two Bournes) means that you're constantly rooting for him. However, Damon is not solely responsible for the quality of this film. Paul Greengrass - responsible for the last Bourne movie and the stunning United 93 - proves himself yet again as one of the best directors in Hollywood today; choosing his shots carefully and improving on the realistic camera-work of the previous movie.<br/><br/>If you have seen the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed here. In fact, this will be essential viewing for you. For all others, I would say this: I would not recommend viewing this movie without seeing thevprevious instalments. It is designed to be watched as the final part ofva trilogy and, by seeing The Bourne Ultimatum first, you will be doing yourself a great injustice. <br/><br/>My final verdict: Brilliant."
"stephen-chalmers","9","0","1","25 August 2007"," Unique in its genre.
","In general I steer clear of shoot-em-up, all-action, violent movies, but Bourne is different! The third in the sequence (last?) still makes heavy use of the hand-held camera and in the heavy fight and action scenes you are never quite clear who is winning till a body drops eventually! But because of this it is unique, and unlike other hand-held camera movies like the Blair Witch Project which did not work, in this case it was a great success. Right through to the end you were rooting for Bourne and it even managed to build in the audience an anti-CIA, anti-establishment sentiment of which Bourne was the champion. The prevailing worldwide surveillance capability, even in far off places like Tangiers was awesome, if somewhat unbelievable. I felt the lack of tangible love/human interest which could have been developed, indeed the character of Bourne himself, especially since this was the last (?) of the trilogy. I felt this was as strong as the first two of the series and was sitting awestruck right though to the end, which came rather abruptly I have to say!"
"sullibrandon","9","0","2","22 August 2007"," Thriller Perfection
","The summer's most solid action pic is here. Matt Damon is back as super tough amnesiac spy Jason Bourne, who once more travels around the globe in an effort to find his identity. In this film, Paul Greengrass's jerky documentary style camera movements, combined with Damon's perfect performance, and a storyline that refuses to ever stop, all combine to make a sleek and solid action thriller that has no equal. In this one, Bourne is finally coming to grips with who he is as he unearths a trail of clues that have him racing around the world in a globe-trotting movie that takes us to New York, Spain, Italy, and more, all within less than two hours.<br/><br/>This is a perfectly paced movie and fine tuned down to the tiniest camera shot, the most basic punch, the most simple cat and mouse scene. Everything about is kinetic, quick, visceral, and pounding. If your pulse isn't going a million miles a minute while watching this movie, you should speak with your doctor. Paul Greengrass, once again using his in-the-moment, in-your-face trademark camera style, places us squarely in Bourne's world, and the herky-jerky camera ups and downs serve their purpose perfectly in getting us into the mindset that this is a real ride, and we better strap ourselves in if we're going to survive this nonstop roller-coaster. This is not some CGI-fest with animated cartoons flying at us from all directions. This is real - I would be very surprised to learn that there was even a second of CGI in this film. It feels that real and that amazing. Even Live Free or Die Hard, which prided itself on going back to basics with its stuntman work and minimal CGI, felt a little extreme and fake sometimes. Sure, the car crashing into the helicopter looked cool, but nobody for a second could possibly believe it would actually happen. In Ultimatum, however, every single blow, every single hit, every single savage throttle feels truly and deeply real, and a lot of this is due to Matt Damon's wonderful performance.<br/><br/>There is a beginning, middle, and definite end to Jason Bourne, and if anybody less than a stellar actor had been chosen to play him, it would have failed. Damon brings Bourne emotionally full circle in a climactic final showdown that rivals its two predecessors because of how wonderfully it concludes. The ending does not feel contrived, cheesy, tacked on, or artificially extended. It fits perfectly with what came before, and doesn't overstay its welcome for one second. The resolution happens, and then we move on. We don't spend ten minutes with Bourne giving us some kind of deep monologue, thank goodness. There is no bold character revelation or deep moment of truth. It's straightforward and subtle. No annoying final pontification here. (I'm looking at you, Sandman.) What makes Bourne Ultimatum so amazing is that is stands tall in a sea of summer mediocrity. Yes, I know, I did enjoy Transformers, Live Free or Die Hard, Spider-Man 3, and Pirates 3. (Shrek 3 not so much.) But the reason I love and respect Ultimatum more is because it exemplifies the true definition of a trilogy. I sincerely hope they do not come out with any more Bourne movies. I believe this character's journey is done - in interviews both Greengrass and Damon say that they don't see a sequel on the horizon. Good for them. A trilogy that firmly closes and insists on staying closed is one that should be respected. I love the Bourne movies because each film is solidly encased in a box that makes it enjoyable if you just see that one movie, but watch them all together and they become a beautiful painting of one man's need to discover who he truly is. It's a metaphor for all of us - as Bourne questions his morality and past when he discovers he's been responsible for assassinations, and as he is confronted with the stark reality that he has just killed a man, the pain and tragedy etched across his face speaks more powerfully than any five minute monologue could. (Er-hem, Trinity in Matrix Revolutions.) Bourne must make the difficult journey of finding out who he is. So must we. And because of this, we sympathize with him. Bourne is human. He's flawed. We understand him. He is not James Bond, not even close. The Bourne movies have been said to be a smart man's spy-thriller, and they are, in every sense of the word. They don't disregard audience intelligence and throw us loud explosions, cocky winking dialogue , and voluptuous drop-dead gorgeous femme fatales at every turn. The main character doesn't callously pop off bad guys right and left. When he kills, it hurts him, deeply. There is a moment in the movie, that I won't give away, that I believe defines Bourne's distinct separation from Bond. Bond can stick with his fancy gadgets and toys and cocky attitude. Sure, that's enjoyable popcorn, but Bourne is actual substance. He's a feast, not just crunchy food that you eat in a theater and then leave half behind not ever finishing it.<br/><br/>To use the analogy of food from my other favorite movie of the summer, Ratatouille, Bourne is a dish to be savored. It can be enjoyed for its visceral thrills and nonstop chase, but there's human drama there too, a deep one, and it makes every single second on screen that much more compelling. If there's one thing that may be flawed about this movie, it would be its repetitiveness, but I find that completely forgivable. If I weren't a critic I wouldn't even bother to notice it. The Bourne Ultimatum finally gives us what we've all been craving. The conclusion to a satisfying trilogy that only got better as it went along, the final installment a capstone of thriller perfection."

","FU Bond, James Bond of England.... we got Jason Bourne MFs! Honestly though, I felt this movie makes a huge political statement about our government and how little the ""people"" actually know. I have always wondered if there have been ""Black Ops"" and those with a degree of power that is unimaginable to anyone in the world. Just recently I read (or maybe heard it on the news) two aspects of how the US government has the power to invade a citizen's privacy: 1. Even if your cell phone is off, the government has the ability to turn on a small microphone in your cell and listen in on your conversations, and 2) there currently are a series of investigations being done to find out about certain government agencies that can cause mental/physical pain to the point of almost death to find out whatever information they want from a prisoner. I wonder how much information is kept from us and how much of what we hear is the truth. I wonder how many aliens (not immigrants) have touched down on earth and how many people are actually who they seem to be. It's sad and scary, but very true that everything one may see, hear, or feel just may not be in actuality, REAL!"

They just had to add in a 20th car chase, shooting, explosion,fight to the death etc etc to keep happy the largest summer movie-going population segment- teenage boys.

","The first test a movie has to survive for me is whether, after having seen any movie I feel I got my money's worth. The Bourne Ultimatum just about survived that test. Yes, its an action movie with a lot of crash bang wallop, but some chase scenes dragged out for far too long. The story is simply not advanced by seeing yet another jump from one building into the next, by dodging another spray of machine gun fire - while these scenes were playing I found myself checking the position of the loudspeakers in the theatre and the fabric of the seat in front of me... in other words, I was bored and the movie could certainly do with some severe cutting... but then maybe there wouldn't be enough story left to fill 90 minutes. However, at least at the end of the movie we know a lot more about Jason. The other test for a movie is whether the wife liked it and here it failed too.. essentially no romance, nothing. OK, the movie survived the ticket price check but only because I did not buy any goodies in the theatre but sneaked them in in my pockets..."

","(In my comment I'm going to point out some of the weak moments of the movie, but I don't want it to be understood in a wrong way. I don't mean it's not worth seeing, on the contrary I do recommend it as a good pastime, I just aim to explain why I'm a little bit disappointed.) For me The Bourne Ultimatum was one of the most awaited releases of this summer but I must say my expectations were not quiet satisfied. Without any doubt this sequel was executed in the best traditions of an action movie - it is extremely dynamic and intense, it doesn't allow you to tear off your sight from the screen even for the slightest moment. Rapid changes of the frames and episodes, constant skipping between numerous streets, houses, offices, roofs and apartments in different parts of the world create the sensation of realism and volume of the surroundings. However after about an hour of watching the movie you realize that the meaning of all this motion is minimized to two broad phrases ""We have found Bourne"" and ""We have lost him"". Sadly enough all the positive I have mentioned above converts into some perception of emptiness - everything turns out to be too simple and mediocre. And of course the most disappointing thing about the movie is letting Bourne alive. Not only it looks unrealistic, it also deprives the whole trilogy of the deepness it could have had."

","The music was weak, almost inexistent and although I like Moby's one, it sounded recycled. In the first Bourne there was the pen, then the magazine now the bath towel OK I got it, you can bloody use anything to fight the bad guy, no need to keep on repeating the concept again and again and again. The fighting actions, again nothing new there, were fast, some almost too fast, hard to be seen see. The car chasing again was fine but just the same stuff. The plot, the story, the girl, the CIA, the bad the good the neutral the technology everything was again and again seen before. There was nothing new or particular in this last.

"stuclark","10","0","1","16 August 2007"," The best Bourne yet...!
","First off, let me get two things clear: 1) I hate ""shakycam"" 2) I love the Bourne trilogy<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is, without doubt, the best of the Bourne trilogy. It's got the best storyline, and is the first Greengrass directed Bourne that I've actually got on with from the cinematography angle. (i.e. even I forgave the shakycam in this film)<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, as everyone should go and see this film, the storyline of Ultimatum entwines very closely with that of Bourne Supremacy. It is important to see the films in the correct order, as otherwise you won't get the best out of Ultimatum. There are also a couple of hints back to Bourne Identity (in story as well as flashbacks).<br/><br/>Matt Damon's acting in this instalment is possibly his best yet in a Bourne film, he really has made Bourne his own character and it is now impossible to think of any other actor playing this role. However, in Ultimatum, Damon's character almost takes a back seat comapared to his excellent supporting cast, primarily the two leading ladies...<br/><br/>Julia Stiles is just fabulous; her role is much increased in Ultimatum, as it has needed to be since the start. Her character, Nicky, travels a long, emotional journey through Ultimatum, and while a lot is left to the viewers imagination, Stiles manages to pull of her trademark ""looks"" to tell far more than is ever said - in more than one scene with Damon she says more with her eyes and expressions than she does with her mouth - in fact, she's silent for quite a lot of her time in the film! <br/><br/>Joan Allen is back as Pamela Landy - the CIA boss who was trying to kill Bourne in Supremacy. We find out a lot about Landy in this film, a lot of it good, and ultimately we're reminded that she, at the end of Supremacy, is the good girl in the CIA...<br/><br/>Ultimatum is being touted as being the last in the Bourne trilogy, however there's ample room for a fourth film to be made in this franchise - the story is there to be exploited, with Jason Bourne, Nicky Parsons and Pamela Landy all surviving Ultimatum. The link for a fourth film is also there - the final scenes of Ultimatum set this up perfectly. <br/><br/>I do hope they decide to make Bourne Legacy!"

","This film starts and ends great and it has everything you want in great acting, ruthless violence and fast paced storyline.<br/><br/>Its only flaw for me personally it should have been a bit bloody especially with that beautiful fight against Desh. You cant really include blood in a 12. The fight was brutal and when he struck that women everyone felt her pain and said ooh.<br/><br/>Thankfully the story did not deviate and Jason Bourne remained ruthlessly intend to succeed without due care for who he puts at risk.<br/><br/>Good sequence great acting and great delivery.

","I haven't seen any good movie for over two weeks. So i was glad that i had an opportunity to see something new. Bourne is old story for a lot of you, pupils, but this was my first encounter with Bourne. <br/><br/>Here it goes. At the beginning of the movie, i thought - it looks like its another ""Die Hard"" style movie, good guys against the bad guys. However, this was something else. In this movie, one guy thinks he is the good guy and fights for the truth. Other side, very serious agency, thinks they are the good guys and that what they are doing is OK for their country. So this movie was somehow special. There were no good guys as everyone is bad or have done something not really good. Also we cant say, that all the guys are bad as some are complaining, how terrible their colleges are. Yes, Bourne would be the bad guy, as he kills everyone in his way, however, he's not a bad guy nor good. He saved the life of the only nice girl in the movie. <br/><br/>Concluding this, i only could clap in the end. The Bourne Ultimatum is not an usual action-romance movie, it has tremendous fights, duels and even.. charismatic actors... Go see it in the theater, believe me, its worth it."
"paul_overall","9","0","1","15 August 2007"," Bourne is back and better than ever
","Jason Bourne takes the best parts of James Bond and John McClane and creates a hybrid action icon. He has skills bordering on superhuman all the while remaining grounded in reality, unlike many action stars of the past relying on the some kind of force field of invincibility. Bourne is a breath of fresh air in a genre often stifled by that ""it's just a movie"" mentality and not going the extra mile for their fans. The third installment of the series is directed, acted, and delivered beautifully. You couldn't ask for a better film this summer. Needless to say i recommend this movie strongly and will be seeing it again as soon as possible, i suggest you do the same."
"Jay_Exiomo","9","0","1","15 August 2007"," Unrelenting action and gritty realism effectively punctuate a superb series
","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" eagerly assumes its position as not just the best in the trilogy of super CIA assassin Jason Bourne's search for his identity, but it's also hands down the best action film of the year.<br/><br/>Just as with the previous two installments, Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to trot around the globe as he attempts to weave snippets of his memory to determine his true identity and how he is what he is. But a covert operation will stop at nothing to make sure Bourne doesn't know the truth, and will go even as far as eliminating him altogether.<br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass (""The Bourne Supremacy,"" ""United 93"") brings once more to the screen what made the first two films successful - doses of action that never lets up. From the chase scenes in the Waterloo to the climactic car chase scenes in New York, the stunts, which have been one of the main selling points of the series, do not disappoint. Here is an unrelenting adrenalin rush with the auteur's trademark gritty naturalism - the apparent abhorrence for Steadicam, rapid cuts, and unorthodox framing of subjects.<br/><br/>Damon brings believability to his character of the highly skilled but troubled Bourne. He provides the obligatory machismo that renders him believable as one who is capable of doing what he does, while not lacking the required emotional depth to provide the human drama of his persona. Returning cast members Julia Stiles and Joan Allen give a solid support for the main character, while newcomer David Strathairn as a CIA official works as the new chief villain, nicely stepping in the shoes vacated by Brian Cox from ""The Bourne Supremacy."" <br/><br/>Ultimately, Bourne gets his answers and audiences will finally breathe a sigh of relief. Finally our hero gets what he's due. Yet there's that lingering disappointment that it may be the last we see of him."

","What cumulative set of infidelities are now committed against Ludlum's books now that the movie series has come full circle? I suppose it doesn't matter. I don't think setting a story around present day would have warranted a premise where they could include Carlos the Jackal and the original era that concerned the novels. Nonetheless the Bourne trilogy films will remain to be one of the most solid action-thrillers around.<br/><br/>Except that the later 2 films have the fault and problem of dense camera-work, where you can't appreciate the action fully most of the time! Ultimatum has a lot of its moments. Most memorable are Bourne guiding the targeted journalist with his superskills and wit in intelligence and evasion, or the rooftop jumping sequences that ends in a brawl with Desh (?) the assassin. As in Ludlum books, even outside the Bourne series, a trademark of characters is hand-to-hand grappling and disarming, much of these are used in Ultimatum and we become habitutated to them, but nonetheless we can not be in awe with much of the action because of Greengrass's decisions in cinematography.<br/><br/>Like the previous 3 films, Ultimatum not only features an exceptional script, but some of the best acting in an act-tion film, the woman Pamela Landy switches roles to being Bourne's protector as her role as antagonist was absolved and is replaced by David Strathairn. Those who have seen the 2nd film by the way will appreciate how parts of it were INTEGRATED into Ultimatum, such as the last scene of Supremacy, which turns out to be one of the major turning points in this film after all!<br/><br/>If the sins of Greengrass on camera-work can be redeemed, perhaps it is with the final scenes, the last shot that perfectly adds a sense of cohesion, closure and symmetry as it is a visual parallel to the opening of IDENTITY, if you watch the film you'll know what I mean when I say it harbingers Bourne's very essence as a trapped and tragic character, and after Nikki Parson's character smiles and Moby's song plays - the visuals shift to symbolizing Bourne's freedom from it all at last. (?)<br/><br/>4/5, because of very good direction, script, acting and I guess the lousy photography won't be so scathing after all because of those good points.<br/><br/>Extreme Ways are gone at last!!!"

","The Bourne Ultimatum could have been a great movie. Unfortunately, it was marred by the director's affinity for the Blair Witch Project. While not as bad as the second movie, the camera shakes again marred what was otherwise a very good movie. The plot, script, action, were all very tight. Casting was great and everyone did their part very well. Matt Damon is oh, so convincing in the role of Jason Bourne and he is, again, the highlight of the film. He carries it through the weak areas and when the action is high, he's in the middle of it. There's plenty of action but much of it loses its punch because of over-editing. Paul Greengrass did a better job on this one than the last, making this the second best of the three. Let's hope he gets over his case of the shakes before someone else trusts him with another script as good as this."

If stunt men could get awards - this would be a winner - hands-down! They used a cadre of stunt performers that would blow any high-action martial-arts movie out of the water. Great camera-work too. Some of the actors roles were limited to accommodate the plot line. Everybody was hoping that the director of the unit would give way to more of the story than to the action.

","Warning: spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>Make no mistake: I love the Bourne series. In the past, I have explained my love for these movies with the fact that the protagonist is attractive, brilliant, and always winning. The third film lived up to the legacy set by the first two, which surprised me, as trilogies are rarely so consistent. Even more, however, I found this film to be the most overtly philosophical and even theological of the three; the depth of film, combined with the superficial reasons I so deeply enjoyed the first two, make it the best of the three in my book.<br/><br/>The themes of identity, vengeance, and atonement have pervaded the series; the third film was no exception, but never have these themes been so clear. Bourne is on a mission to avenge the death of Marie, but that same mission answers very fundamental questions of who he is and how he came to be. The more he learns about himself, the more he despises himself; he remembers killing people and feels tremendous guilt, but he has no idea why he did these things. In a scene with Nikki, he tersely discusses how he has tried to do everything he can to atone for his wrongs and find that he cannot. Only by getting back to his beginnings as Jason Bourne can he understand why he is the way he is, why he's done the things he's done, and only after this can he put an end to Jason Bourne and find freedom and redemption.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I found remarkable parallels between this film and the picture of humanity espoused by Christianity. Man is trapped in a life of doing wrong and feels the weight of these wrongs; he tries to atone for them, but he cannot. Only by getting back to his creator can he understand how he came to be, and only then can the self that he despises be put to death and new life and redemption be found. I found these similarities to be striking and thought-provoking, and I thought that Greengrass made an interesting commentary about human nature in the process. It was a brilliant way to end the series, if this is the end (though the box-office gross may suggest otherwise), tying together very profound questions about identity and vengeance with the same finesse of the first two films."

First there is a ""Goofs"" area on IMDb and they left one off of the list: In the opening scene where David Strahairn is entering the building, his hair is fluffed and wind blown...but while walking down the hall from entering, his hair looks gelled or stiff...but putting all of that aside, the fight scenes were chillingly executed with finesse and fake fighting is like my other passion:""dance""...must be performed correctly to appeal to the masses, no matter how unbelievable.

","After all the summer films glutted with special effects (""Spider-man 3"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3"", ""Transformers""), it's a relief to see one film that has real ACTION instead of CGI eye candy.<br/><br/>After the three May-release three-quals that didn't quite live up to their originals, it's refreshing to see this trilogy end so well.<br/><br/>And why does it end so well? Because the Bourne trilogy builds on itself and explores its characters more deeply with each installment. By this movie Bourne's grappling with his unknown past has reached a fever pitch. It explores more in-depth his reaction to the death in film 2. Characters like Pamela Landy and Nikki give performances that are more than just repeats--they actually become deeper.<br/><br/>The action is amazing. Unlike the other big-budget films of the summer (except perhaps Harry Potter 5), there is no CGI to clog the screen. We are not diverted--we are ENGAGED. From the motorcycle sequences to the sniper incident to the car chases (what Bourne film isn't complete without a car chase that goes against traffic?), this movie glues us to the screen in a way that no other action movie has quite managed to do this summer.<br/><br/>The ending is perfect. The emotional ride leading up to it was so intense that I actually cried (which is a VERY rare thing for me to do during an action film). In this movie (and throughout the whole series) the dialogue has been more economic than any movie ever. The words are spare; characters rarely string more than a few sentences together, and they don't need to. Each line has a point, and each word delivers its intent. There is no monologuing; each ""slow"" moment lasts just long enough to give us a respite from the fast-paced action.<br/><br/>The Bourne Trilogy has, in the past few days, become one of my favorite movie trilogies ever. I haven't seen a third installment this good since ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"". I'm sad to see the franchise come to a close, but the ending's good.

","If ""The Bourne Supremacy"" gripped you with its spiraling melodramatic mixture of suspense and tension, then its white-knuckled sequel ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" will have you hanging by your fingertips during most of its harrowing 115 minutes. Reportedly, this installment represents the final cinematic outing for novelist Robert Ludlum's death- proof, ex-CIA assassin Jason Bourne in his one-man war against the Central Intelligence Agency and his never-ending quest to regain his true identity. In many ways, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" recalls a number of post-Watergate spy thrillers that appeared in the 1970s, such as ""Three Days of the Condor"" with Robert Redford, ""Scorpio"" with Burt Lancaster, and ""The Killer Elite"" with James Caan.<br/><br/>Three things you should know about ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" before you see it. First, if you have to excuse yourself from the movie, you'll miss loads of important information in an elaborately orchestrated plot that gathers momentum with each scene up to its hair-raising car chase finale. The noisy car crash is probably the most outlandish thing in this nimble, no-nonsense espionage epic that deplores the above and beyond the Constitution freedoms that the CIA seeks to curtail. Second, director Paul Greengrass doesn't let things lag for long in this hyper-kinetic, adrenalin-laced thriller that globe-trots around Europe and the U.S. This movie piles on tons of information and doesn't give you any time to sort it out. Usually, the hero stays a step ahead of you. Third, if you skipped either ""The Bourne Identity"" and/or ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" the spy-vs.-spy skulduggery taking place inside the CIA will knit your eyebrows into knots because you haven't been adequately briefed. For example, the tape-recorded confession in the first 20 minutes of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" happened near the end of the second ""Bourne"" movie. The character, slippery, shifty-eyed CIA superior Ward Abbott (Brian Cox of ""The Glimmer Man""), had committed suicide. On the other hand, the neat thing about watching ""The Bourne Supremacy"" again (if you have the time) is that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" literally resumes the action in mid-stride with an injured Matt Damon limping away from a dead hit-man. <br/><br/>At the end of ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" Bourne took time out to visit the daughter of a Russian couple that the CIA had ordered him to kill when he was an assassin. Apologizing for their deaths, he explained that the wife—her mother-- walked in unexpectedly on them and Bourne had to ice her, too. In ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" our amnesiac hero visits the brother of his girlfriend from the first ""Bourne,"" Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente of ""Anatomy""), and he apologizes to him about his role in her death. No sooner has Bourne said and done this than he finds out that an English journalist, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine of ""Hot Fuzz""), who may have information about his origins. <br/><br/>At this point, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" turns into the Will Smith thriller ""Enemy of the State"" with its dazzling array of intelligence gathering devices. CIA surveillance technology hones in on the same London newspaperman when the unsuspecting reporter utters the word ""Blackbriar"" during a cell phone conversation. Blackbriar serves as the code name for the organization that has replaced the murderous 'Treadstone' outfit from the ""Bourne Identity"" that trained Bourne as an elite assassin. The chief villain in ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" black- ops CIA chief Noah Vosen (David W. Straitharn of ""Dolores Claiborne""), vows to track down Ross and he is prepared to liquidate him without a qualm if it is the only way to maintain secrecy. When he learns that Bourne has contacted Ross, Vosen labels Bourne a threat to the CIA and gives his government gunsels orders to shoot the ex-assassin on sight. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles of ""Mono Lisa Smile""), a CIA analyst from the first ""Bourne,"" literally stumbles in on Bourne after he has searched the office of her London-based CIA superior, Neal Daniels (Colin Stinson of ""The Jacket"") who funneled secret information to Ross about Bourne. Briefly, Nicky joins Bourne on the run, but she doesn't behave like the usual, blithering female Girl Friday who can only scream, sprain her ankle, or shed her wardrobe for sex. Neither director Greengrass nor his three scenarists keep Nicky on hand for long before they banish her from the action. Another ""Bourne Supremacy"" alum, top CIA supervisor Pam Landy (Joan Allan of ""Face/Off"") returns, but Vosen confines her to the sidelines as an adviser about Bourne's method of operation. Predictably, Pam doesn't act like a team player. She wants to invite Bourne back into the CIA with open arms, while Vosen prefers to shoot first and hold an séance afterward for any questions. <br/><br/>Watching ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is like watching a PG-13 car accident. Paul Greengrass, who helmed ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" keeps the action as genuine as possible as he did in the previous ""Bourne,"" and he provides us with a front-row seat for all of the mayhem. Jason Bourne is a MacGyver style hero who has to rely on his wits to get him out of his predicaments. He is not allowed to conjure up a handy gadget at the right moment like James Bond might. The thuggish hand-to-hand combat scenes in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" are collisions of flesh & bone, and Greengrass stages them with hand-held cameras so that you will feel the intensity of each body blow, even though you'll never see any contact. In another scene, our hero plunges through several large windowpanes and the sounds of broken glass will make you grimace more than anything that you see. People are shooting people everywhere in ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" but Greengrass presents the violence in a narrative fashion. The shoot-outs, the fisticuffs, and the automobile chase propel the plot forward without halting it in a pageantry of digital special effects. Altogether, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is sober-minded, often realistic, but humorless adventure thriller that keeps our resilient hero dodging bullets while negotiating a challenging obstacle course of hazards."

","What I feel the message of the movie is is that you may end up getting tricked into signing up for something you don't believe in, as is what often happens when you join a government agency. In the case of Jason Bourne, he realized he was a killing machine serving the interests of a few, when really he signed up in the hopes of saving American lives. It is the same with American troops and the Iraq war, something that has now been proved to be a war based on fictitious premises. I like the quote from the movie when the top guy trying to kill Bourne says, ""it ain't over till we win"" when the women CIA agent is questioning his policy of exterminating everybody that poses a threat. I see a lot of parallels between that and the war on terror, something i think was intentional by the writer."

","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is like no other film I've ever seen. It takes the precedent for action film-making set by ""The Bourne Identity"" to a whole new level. <br/><br/>This is an action film in the truest and purest way. It consists almost entirely of marvelously choreographed fight scenes, chase scenes, both on foot and in cars, and so on. <br/><br/>While the first two films focused on story and character as well as action, ""Ultimatum"" throws the former two out the window and elects instead to take the latter and run, nay, sprint with it to the finish line of this fantastic trilogy. <br/><br/>Director Paul Greengrass, most notable recently for the painfully intimate and real ""United 93"", proves with ""Ultimatum"" that he is one of the most capable action filmmakers around. This being his second contribution to the Bourne series, after ""The Bourne Supremacy"", I essentially see his ""Bourne"" movies as two parts of the same film. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a smart, fun, and exciting time at the movies, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is it."

"eastbergholt2002","9","0","1","5 August 2007"," Great Action Movie
","The Bourne Ultimatum is the best action movie I've seen in some time. As we all know, Bourne is an amnesiac former CIA assassin who is chased around the world by his previous employers. The film's director Paul Greengrass does a masterful job and delivers two hours of non-stop, frenetic action. Bourne doesn't like violence and yearns for a quiet life, yet he is forced out of hiding for another adventure. As you would expect there are amazing car chases and brutal fight scenes. Plot wise it's very similar to the last film, but like the Bond films, the predictability of the storyline is not a drawback, although this may change with Bourne IV and V. <br/><br/>The film starts with the Guardian newspaper in London receiving leaked information from within the CIA. They publish a story about Bourne's former activities and the agency insanely executes the reporter at a busy railway station. This brings media attention and increases the pressure on the agency to kill Bourne before the press catches up with him. Bourne wants to find out about his past and when he reads the story tries to track down the Guardian reporter. The chase is on and Bourne becomes both predator and prey. He remains humble, earnest and unbelievably resourceful. The CIA women folk (i.e., Allen and Stiles) seem drawn to him and they try and protect him from their macho male colleagues. Bourne is smart and has a track record of terminating CIA careers, yet he is underestimated by the new guys at the agency, who are quickly made to look dumb and out of their depth. <br/><br/>There is even a moral message that killing people is bad, and not good for your mental health. The acting is excellent, especially Damon who is first-rate at making Bourne believable and likable. Scott Glenn and David Strathairn represent the dark, brainless side of the agency. The movie is ultimately preposterous but it's a lot of fun and highly entertaining."

","I've always enjoyed action movies and yet some disappointment me. They can't be silly, cartoonish, or lacking in plot for me to be thrilled. The fourth die hard movie was OK, but I wouldn't watch it again. that having been said, the Bourne Ultimatum is BY FAR the best of the three Bourne movies (and I loved them all). I read all of the books and was predictably slightly disappointed at what was left out of the first movie, but even a Ludlum fan has to eat up this movie. they used some great film making techniques i don't remember from previous action movies. In most action films, a car crash for example will be run in slow motion, or rerun from different angles. In Bourne, each action sequence was run once, at full speed in real time and in linear time sequence. It actually made it difficult and sometimes impossible to know exactly what was happening, which way in the building or scene you were facing, who was winning, etc. You might think this would be annoying but in fact it caused me to feel the emotions of actually being in the situation (versus watching entertainment). While even great action movies are usually far fetched, this was as realistic and believable as you get because of the Director's film making techniques. Take all of the my favorite action movies (Die hard, Raiders, Lethal Weapon, pale rider, Terminator 2) and not only does this beat them all, it beats all sequels in besting their originals (including term 2). The only possible reason you wouldn't like this movie is you hate action flicks."

","After 3 disappointing 3quels, Ultimatum dodges that bullet. The concluding movie to the smart, and kinetic series doesn't disappoint and left me satisfied. Though I STRONGLY recommend for those who see it on opening weekend to get to the showtime early and find a good seat. My friends and I got there as it started and were stuck with the front row, uncomfortably looking up at giant screen. This kind of movie is the worst kind to see in the front row. Halfway through i started to get nauseated from the shaky camera, and lightning- fast editing. But it soon went away, which allowed me to enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>Bourne is on the run again, in fact thats all he does. Inching closer to finding his identity. The synopsis is pretty predictable, until the climax, but the journey to the ending is quite invigorating. The action is dizzy, kinetic, fast, obscure, which is quite a portrayal of what it might be like in that kind of action. Greengrass gives the movie a documentary feel, trust me its not boring, putting the viewer right beside bourne. Call this and Supremacy a ""Actionmentary"" The political, moral subtexts/allusions also complement the movie making it so much more real and extraordinary. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie delivers what it promises with something extra on the side. However, the movie lacked emotion, it was too caught up in the action. That's why I think Identity is the best, it balances Ultimatums kinetic cinematography, and mystery, and brooding emotion. Supremacy is a close second, and Ultamatum a respectable third. Definitely worth the atrocious $9.50. <br/><br/>8.6/10"

","The Bourne Ultimatum is an intense thriller. It is action packed, well acted, and moves at a brisk pace that never slows down for very long. It is definitely one of the best movies of the summer so far. <br/><br/>Matt Damon returns to his role as Jason Bourne. He is still running from the government and even more dangerous assassins. All of which are out to kill him. He is also still searching for information on his past for which he only remembers bits and pieces in hazy flashbacks. This has been the point of all three movies, and the conclusion to this fine trilogy left me very satisfied, especially the final scenes of which I will say no more.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has made the role of Jason Bourne his own. I couldn't see anybody else in the role. Joan Allen also returns as Pamela Landy, the same person who had been searching for Bourne through the first two movies. There are some twists on her character this time around, but I will not spoil it for anybody who wants to see the movie. Julia Stiles also returns as Nicky Parsons. The acting was very good all around, including the smaller roles. David Strathaim in particular has a good part as the slimy CIA agent Noah Vosen who wants Bourne dead.<br/><br/>Like I said above, this movie is all out action with great fight scenes and car chases. The director Paul Greengrass keeps the pace moving. It rarely slows down, and when it does it is only for a short period before the action starts up again. <br/><br/>His use of steady cam for many scenes was incredible, and I know there are some people who will say the use of the steady cam was headache inducing, but to me I think it worked perfectly. It added to the frenetic pace and made the movie seem more realistic. The fight scenes and the car chases where the steady cam was used the most worked splendidly. The final car chase scene is one of the best put to celluloid.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is not quite perfect, and I think it's because there was no witty dialog and it lacked a sense of humor. Most action films usually have these things, but then again none of the Bourne films have ever had anything that resembled that. It also fumbled a little near the end. However, putting these tiny flaws to the side, I would still say that The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best films of the summer, and you can't go wrong there."
"Rogue-32","10","0","1","4 August 2007"," Bourne, free
","The Bourne films have operated in an opposite way than most sequel movies, which tend to lose steam the further into the series they go: the first one was good (and it was clear that Matt Damon was perfect for the part), the second was fantastic, and this one, the third in the series, is better than the first two combined.<br/><br/>The thing I've always appreciated about Damon, in this role, is how everything his character does (or has had to do) is done without ego. He merely takes whatever steps he needs to take to accomplish his mission; namely, finding out who he is and what the hell happened to him. His training (and his obvious innate abilities) have made him smarter, faster and stronger than all adversaries, but he never once takes any smirking pride or glory in this, he simply does what needs to be done, in a matter-of-fact sort of way. This has served the project extremely well, and it gives the third installment - where the answers are revealed - a huge boost because we really care about this guy and his plight.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum delivers on so many levels, and it's hilarious in ways you wouldn't think, or at least to me it was: I found it exceedingly laughable how stupid David Strathairn's character, Noah Vosen, was - he kept trying to catch Bourne (or at the very least catch UP with him), who was always way ahead, but Vosen never adjusts his attitude or mentality to try to think like Bourne; he takes everything Bourne says on face value, which becomes really funny near the end of the film, when Bourne is talking to Vosen by phone, FROM VOSEN'S OFFICE, while Vosen is in a car waiting for him to appear where he said he'd be. Hilarious. The film has no overt humor, no funny dialogue (as in Die-hard, for instance), nothing to destroy the seriousness of the mood and the mission, which of course is the right choice, so this character-based Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner relationship between Vosen and Bourne really serves the production well.<br/><br/>Genius casting, too, with Albert Finney in the doctor/brainwasher role - even before we meet his character, toward the end, just from seeing his picture (and witnessing him in the flashbacks we're shown), we know that he could make anybody do anything he wanted, regardless of whether they'd volunteered for it and had misgivings afterwards or not.<br/><br/>The finale is perfect as well, leaving it open to the possibility of a fourth film. And the cool closing credits (and music) are excellent too. Just a pleasure from beginning to end, this one."

I wonder about these other reviews that rate this so low...did they expect ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia""?...I am a lover of very deep, serious movies, but I appreciate the best in every genre...and this movie is one of the best ever in the espionage/political thrillers...I'm not so articulate as many on here, but all I know is the crowd was audibly cheering on Jason - especially at the end (no spoiler..ha ha) - sometimes the real measure of a movie is how good people feel coming out of it...if that is our measure the 8.9 rating on IMDb is a conservative rank...DON'T miss this!!!!"

","Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner.<br/><br/>The Bourne Ultimatum is, in my opinion, the best action film of the year so far. It brings to the table so much that has been taken out of action films that we've seen recently.<br/><br/>First off, since this is an action film, we'll start with the action. One of the best parts of the entire ""Bourne"" series is that it doesn't try to drown you in over the top action. The fight scenes give you a sense of realism, as does the absolutely amazing car chase scenes. Nothing seems to make you scream out how unrealistic it was, instead giving you something incredible to watch. Not to mention the genuine tension that you feel throughout the film.<br/><br/>Next of course is the acting. Damon once again gives a phenomenal performance as the amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne. The calm and stoic, yet unstable and edgy character that he has brought to the big screen continues to impress. While he won't get nominated for an Oscar for the film, he should. Bourne is far more impressive that just a simple action hero.<br/><br/>It doesn't stop there though, as Joan Allen and David Strathairn continue the great acting the series has had. Also, Julia Stiles gets an expanded role with her character Nicky Parsons, and keeps her own with Damon. The under-appreciated Stiles does a fantastic job and really gives you great genuinely human moments with Bourne throughout the film. Even when her character remains silent, it seems more intriguing than pages of dialogue.<br/><br/>The story continues where the previous films left off, with Bourne chasing his identity. Throughout the film, the story does seem to take a backseat to the action, but it never gets overshadowed and when it becomes the focus of the scene, it is given great care and doesn't disappoint. It's also great to see the many throwbacks to the first two films, including a splendid usage of the final scene from ""The Bourne Supremacy"".<br/><br/>The one problem is the cinematography during the action scenes. The shaky camera sometimes gets in the way of really seeing the entirety of the fight scenes, but it doesn't make the movie any less of a great thrill ride.<br/><br/>So to recap, the action is awesome, Damon and Stiles are brilliant, and the story is well crafted. This is what an action film should be. Fast, Smart, Remarkable. The best action film of the year, and one of the best films of the year, period. A must see."
"Eaglegrafix","9","0","2","3 August 2007"," A ""Nice"" Way to End the Story
","I'm a huge Jason Bourne fan. I read the books as they came out, enjoyed the attempted TV Movie in 1988 even though it was mostly because of Jaclyn Smith. This third in the Matt Damon/Bourn film is very welcomed and unexpected. Some of the ending of the Bourne Supremacy was re-worked into Ultimatum with changes. No matter, the story is promising from the very beginning. I knew that however it was going to end, it will be good and I would be satisfied. There is a great deal of updating from the book simply because we are in a totally different world with technology than in 1980 when the first Bourne book was published. All that matters to me in respect to the story is that Jason keeps his character and spirit and drive he has in the books while the events and action shots in the movie are no where to be found in the books. Damon plays Bourn with the same finesse as he has the other two movies but I think he is less frightened, less confused and less timid in Ultimatium - he has matured and that is good for what happens in this movie. The action is good, varied and creative. Just about when I thought it was going to be just another clichÃ©, it takes enough of a twist to keep me fixed. The more intense fast paced scenes are broken up with intense but more deliberative scenes. Bourne very rarely loses control of himself even though he is stymied again. The action is very much in your face and might be over-the-top and would be unbelievable if it were anyone other than a Treadstone trained asset. If you watch Identity and Supremacy, just before viewing Ultimatium, realize that it was not planned as a three set. Much of the ending of Untimatum was injected into the end of Supremacy which was going to be the end...but thankfully it was not and that does not in any way spoil Ultimatum...It still has wonderful surprises for those who do not know the story and love a good spy action movie."
"gene5008","10","0","3","3 August 2007"," Outstanding movie!!!!
","Man what a movie. This is definitely the best of the three. It sums everything up and makes a great ending. There was lots of action to keep you on the edge of your seat. I think that Matt Damon did a great job. I like how they brought Stiles back into the scene. It almost look like she had thing for Jason. Overall this was a great movie. It answers all the question you had when watching the first two. You are not left guessing about what is the deal with Jason. Though it did leave it slightly open. You don't know what he is going to do next. He may go back to Nicky and try to settle down and have a family or something. But I think thats great. I hope they do not come out with another one and ruin the great ending. I do so again, this is a GREAT movie. I would definitely recommend on going and seeing this movie."
"watcher-13","9","0","6","3 August 2007"," Excellent action flick
","I liked almost every aspect of this movie, which I deem the best of the series. The only bad part was the camera work, at times making some people in the audience almost sick. During one of the big car chase scenes, after the crash has stopped and everything comes to a halt, the camera is still shaking like the stabilization on it wasn't working (or it was an earthquake). Some of the action scenes like the fight in the building was nothing but a bunch of blurry scenes. I can understand that the action is intense and their motions would be blurry and quick in the hand-to-hand shots, but even the background is blurry because the whole camera is moving in sweeping motions. It just seemed distracting to me, and I actually heard one lady in front of me say she couldn't watch, it was making her stomach queasy. Other than the camera work in spots, a very good movie, nice plot, and I loved the scene from the Assistant director's office (""We'd be having this conversation face to face!"")"
"LILITh-12","8","0","6","3 August 2007"," Excellent, but something missing
","Don't get me wrong. Ultimatum is far-and-away a worthy successor to the previous two films. There are many ""hell yeah"" moments for the audience, and there is even an action sequence that was so glorious it made me want to cry: Jason Bourne steals a police cruiser while being chased by black CIA cars, and then proceeds to ram his way through downtown NYC traffic in it. It brought back all my wonderful memories of epic car chases from Grand Theft Auto III.<br/><br/>But still, something seemed missing from this film.<br/><br/>The lead characters to me seemed to acted too dryly. David Strathairn is too much of a cookie-cutter bad CIA guy. There's a couple of times when his delivery just seemed too contrived, as if over-rehearsed. As for Damon, Jason Bourne never even cracks a smile, or seems to have any sexuality to him, even when a hot chick is caressing his hand after he just kicked someone's ass. I mean, come on dude. They could've at least made out. It wouldn't have made the movie cheesy. Matt Damon just seemed stuck in one emotional gear through the whole movie, with the occasional Captain Kirk ""ahhhrgh"" flashback moment. The sense of real anger that drove him in the second film seemed replaced by a robotic feeling of, ""I must learn my past,"" which just seems hard to identify with.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles also seems out of her league in this role... her face, too babyish and expressionless. Where is the next Sigourney Weaver or Meryl Streep for a role like this? Some actress with a taut, wiry bevy of expressions, and a convincing look of real mortal fear? I kept getting the feeling Julia Stiles was on her way to Starbucks and had to pee, not that she was being chased by a trained hit-man through the convoluted streets of an Arab town.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the acting kind of reminded me of Star Wars Episode I, although without a Jar Jar to utterly ruin it, of course. My guess is that the director was too strict and left the cast thinking, ""I better not even bob my head too emotionally"" -- which they seemed to try and make up for by not using any tripods when shooting facial close-ups (you know, that close shot where the camera intentionally wiggles around to give the shot a tenser, more real feel). Thankfully, these dry performances really didn't seem too out-of-place or unexpected here, since it's not too far off from the previous titles. And it by no means ruins the film, but it did take it down a notch or two from ""almost perfect"" to just ""pretty damn good."" <br/><br/>And partly, Ultimatum just seems less realistic than the other two. Sure, it's a Hollywood action movie. But the one thing I loved about the previous two were their lo-fi, gritty, realistic approach. Ultimatum stays mostly true to this, but some of the stunts were maybe a bit overdone. For example, at the end of that epic car chase, Bourne's vehicle gets rammed into the barrier of a highway underpass at what looks like about 50 MPH. It looked like the kind of wreck nobody would walk away from without a broken neck, except maybe Wolverine. Or, apparently, Jason Bourne. Just a BIT unrealistic? And then there were the dozen or so glass windows that he jumps through without a major cut of any kind. What is this guy, the Terminator? I kept waiting for him to rip the flesh off his right arm and reveal the TRUE nature of Treadstone! <br/><br/>That said, this was still a far more realistic actioner than Die Hard 4.0, or the most recent Bond flick, and everyone should go see it :D There is a lot to love about this film. The hand-to-hand combat sequences are fantastic. The chase sequences are great. It's not too long. And I'm looking forward to the next sequel, The Bourne Revelation: Judgment Day, where Matt Damon fights against his evil counterpart, the B-1000..."
"Strider_1978","9","0","6","2 August 2007"," A very entertaining, if ambiguous film.
","Well, I just returned from an employee screening. Part of me was a little skeptical due to certain dislikes in the second Bourne movie by the same director.<br/><br/>For the first, I'd say twenty minutes of the film I wondered if I was again going to be completely put off by the shaky, home made film approach. But as the film progressed and I began to figure the style, I began to get more and more entertained.<br/><br/>This one, quite literally from start to finish has you. I don't remember how long the film was but let me tell you, never a dull moment. They kept it 'real'. The acting was strong throughout and my senses were perked. I don't really have anything to complain about, bar the usual cell phone in the audience routing that happens every single time we watch a movie. <br/><br/>It's not a ten, it's a very strong nine. I think I would have liked to know more, but then again, even the strongest answers often lead to further questions .. and more $ to be gained from another film, if they choose to make it.<br/><br/>Go see it, you won't be disappointed."
