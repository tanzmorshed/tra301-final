","Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. <br/><br/>In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.<br/><br/>The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. <br/><br/>It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.<br/><br/>Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.<br/><br/>The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. <br/><br/>Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. <br/><br/>I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10"

","I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.<br/><br/>The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional ""team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho."" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.<br/><br/>The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.<br/><br/>I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE."
"lucyyy","10","48","68","30 October 2014"," Avengers is an amazing movie with an amazing cast
","""The Avengers"" brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and sassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki Laufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights and capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is done by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New York City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house in the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the unsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else. This is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time."
"NORTHPOINTMJM","Null","438","708","19 April 2012"," They balanced everything masterfully. As Good As It Gets!!!
","If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.<br/><br/>Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.<br/><br/>There's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.<br/><br/>I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.<br/><br/>It's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream ""BADASS!"" and mean it.<br/><br/>I'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!"
"CalRhys","Null","102","155","12 July 2014"," A Stunning Visual Effects-Driven Spectacle
","'Avengers Assemble' ('The Avengers') is a truly enjoyable superhero film that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four of the greatest superheroes to connect in this mega-blockbuster extravaganza. Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon."
"biochemist","9","659","1111","16 April 2012"," LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)
","LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of 'The Avengers' on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it's release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little ""Justice League"" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening. <br/><br/>I've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. <br/><br/>Capt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn't understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn't been the Hulk in two years (What's his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen. <br/><br/>The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.<br/><br/>So who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark's) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I'd watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role. <br/><br/>Overall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars."
"thefilmexpert","1","1213","2074","30 April 2012"," Are movies so bad now that a film like this is considered great?
","Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like ""The Avengers,"" is heralded as an exceptional film?<br/><br/>Sure, this film hits all the marks and has some good one-liners, but once we expected films to be refreshing and new. ""Star Wars,"" while having obvious flaws, provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts, worlds, and even its own theology (the force). Its first twenty-minutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic English dandy (C3-P0) argue with a chirping rolling trashcan (R2-D2), but amazingly enough Lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining. The plot of ""The Avengers"" is just your run-of-the-mill comic book story-line. Compare its plot to that of ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"" or even ""Back to the Future"" or ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative. You have no idea where they are going. You always know exactly where ""The Avengers"" is going. <br/><br/>Along these same lines, ""Psycho,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. provide classic twists--Norman has gone insane and has, in his mind, become his mother, the film's apparent killer; Darth Vader, the film's main villain, is revealed to be Luke's father; the first half of ""The Matrix"" turns out to have transpired in a totally false reality. Nobody expected these twists. What unexpected occurs in ""The Avengers""? Even its minor twists have appeared in other recent films. Its most significant--Loki allowing his own capture--comes straight from ""The Dark Knight.""<br/><br/>Gangster films before ""The Godfather"" were just pulp. ""The Godfather"" transcended the genre just as ""Unforgiven"" did with Westerns. The same is true about ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Avengers"" doesn't transcend; it regurgitates a done-to-death plot. Unlike ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark Knight"" was more than a comic book film. It was entertaining, compelling, yet it explored complex moral ideas, and its plot went in innovative directions. Did anyone know that ""The Dark Knight"" would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the Joker and Batman for Harvey Dent's soul, a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the Joker or Batman really won in the end, a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be? And did anyone NOT know that ""The Avengers"" would end with a huge battle with the Avengers ultimately triumphant? Uncertainty about how a plot will be resolved is what once kept the audience hooked, not the continual spectacle of fights and explosions. In fact, look at the IMDb Top 250. With how many of these films would you know exactly how they'd end if you were seeing them for the first time? In fact, apart from the cartoons, is there a single entry as totally formulaic as ""The Avengers"" is? <br/><br/>And let's not forget, did you ever worry that any of the Avengers would not survive? If not, then where was the real dramatic tension? One of the things that made ""The Dark Knight"" so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed. And did anyone expect what happened to Rachel Dawes, Harvey Dent's girlfriend? One of the things that made ""Psycho"" so dramatic is its main protagonist dies halfway through the film. Great films--serious or fun--must make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake. <br/><br/>And do I even have to go into how voting to give ""The Avengers"" a 10 places it on par with the all-time great works of film art--""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Citizen Kane"", ""Vertigo,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""8 1/2,"" ""Manhattan,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" etc.? A vote of 10 for a film like this diminishes the worth of these works of art that explore the deepest issues concerning the human condition.<br/><br/>Though I've brought up some films that are darker than ""The Avengers"" or more serious, that is not my complaint about ""The Avengers"" at all. ""Star Wars, "" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" were fun movies, but they also had plots that went in unexpected directions, had surprising twists, introduced us to unique characters. The elements I've listed here are what make a film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating. Just a well-done totally formulaic movie like ""The Avengers"" simply does not deserve the praise it is getting. Of course this film does not deserve a 1 out of 10. I would really give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, which is equivalent to a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the IMDb rating scale. However, until others don't alter their votes to put ""The Avengers"" more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining films of history, my vote will remain a 1. <br/><br/>Go watch ""The Avengers"" a few more times. Once you've gotten used to the 3-D, the special effects, the digital surround sound, you'll see that the film is predictable, the jokes are so-so, and the violence of the fights and of the long climactic end battle actually gets kind of boring.<br/><br/>If you're a teenager still reading comics or a lover of comic books who's always dreamed of watching Hulk fight Thor, Thor fight Iron Man, then this movie is what you've always been waiting for, but for the rest of us, ""The Avengers"" is not the tour de force it's been made out to be. <br/><br/>Oh wait a sec. <br/><br/>I just learned that there's a movie based on ""Battleship""--you know, that dull board game for eight-year-olds. I guess movies really are that bad. If you compare ""The Avengers"" only to garbage like that, I guess it really does seem great.<br/><br/>Never mind..."
"facebook-124-955845","10","873","1488","20 April 2012"," The Avengers assembled flawlessly
","I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiative¬Öin that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to ""hulk out"". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+"
"alindsay-al","10","38","55","21 October 2014"," a fabulous film that proved the dominant superhero films
","After all the films leading to this one we were promised the Avengers on screen and this film gave us that big time. This film sees a group of big personalities having to come together and defeat a mad man and his army from enslaving humanity. One of the most important parts of the build up to this film was Robert Downey jnr's performance as Tony stark/iron man, and he is just as awesome in this film. His character grows in all these films but he is still the narcissist that we love. Also Chris Evans as captain America was really important as he is the leader and comes across as the moral compass of the whole film but he isn't boring which is great for the character. The rest of the performances are great as well, first of all is the recasting of Mark ruffalo as Bruce banner/hulk and he was the biggest surprise in this film. He was great in both roles and the hulk has absolutely never been better then this film. Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor and this guy is absolutely seriously movie star and makes this character a great character full of personality. Scarlett Johansson returns as black widow and she is sexy and tough while also proving that she is also the best female in these superhero films around. Samuel L Jackson is back as Nick fury and he is great as the character and squeezes the most he can out of this great character. The one member of the team that isn't really developed is Hawkeye, he isn't really himself for the most of the movie but even then the last battle he becomes great. What is important in a film like this is having a great villain and Tom hiddlestone as Loki definitely succeeds at that. He is just so fun to watch and you buy that he could pull off all this destruction. Sometimes simplicity is best for a story and this is one of those times, it has happened before that a group of combustible elements have to team up but this film gets the most out of it and adds real drama to the film. The script is the best part of the film and the dialogue between the characters is what makes this film so enjoyable to watch because it makes all the characters feel unique and there own personalities. The style of this film is great, the action is all enjoyable and the film looks great but I have to mention the show stealer that is the incredible hulk. This is the best interpretation of the hulk and he looks better then ever and he is possibly the best character in the film. Overall this is one of my favourite films ever and this is a comic book fans dream."

And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.<br/><br/>Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.<br/><br/>While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you don't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.<br/><br/>The actors' performances in ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.<br/><br/>All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring. Ten out of ten."

","Knowing a little bit about comic books, and knowing some about Avengers Assemble it made this film The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, even more enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>When Earth comes under attack by Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in his pursuit to get the Tesseract, it is up to S.H.I.E.L.D. to pull start up The Avengers. After a small town is almost completely destroyed by Thor on a previous visit to Earth S.H.I.E.L.D. decided that they needed something that could take on anything that was not from ""this world"". So when Nick Fury calls on some of the biggest heroes Earth has ever met: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarelett Johansson), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), and of course Thor (Chris Hemsworth).<br/><br/>The theme of this movie in my opinion would be Man vs. Man. This is because throughout the entire film there is some sort of conflict going on. The first and main conflict that appears is Loki attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. takes control of Hawkeye and Dr. Selvig in order to steal the Tesseract and use it for his own purposes. A second conflict that appears in the film is between Thor and Loki. When Thor still considers them brothers Loki retaliates and says that he is not really his brother and that he should still be the ""true"" ruler of Asgard.<br/><br/>With the costumes that have been chosen for this film it helps to create the aspect of the heroes being more than a normal human. Even with Hawkeye and Black Widow, Black Widow had been trained pretty much from birth to become a killer, and Hawkeye has advance skills in marksmanship. With Thor's costume he is wearing something that helps to prove that he is not from Earth and from another world. Now for Iron Man, he made his own super suit that could do almost anything, which includes keeping him safe from being torn up from the roaders on the ship that S.H.I.E.L.D. was functioning from after an attack from Loki and his minions.<br/><br/>Finally, in the final attack with Loki and The Avengers, Thor takes Loki back to Asgard to deal with his faults there where the intention is for him to be properly punished.<br/><br/>This is a must see film especially if you are a comic book junkie!"
"BiiivAL","9","126","208","8 June 2018"," ""I'll free you."" - From what? - From freedom.
","I think any viewer, buying a ticket for this film, is aware of what he expects to see on the screen. Recently, the film industry has been criticized for the abundance of projects of a purely entertaining nature, including the ""Avengers"". However, if you look closely - it turns out that there is not so much really good and quality entertainment cinema. Some films are boring, some are bluntly stupid; and, for the most part, it turns out that ""entertainment"" can be called only a few luxuriously shot scenes, and at other times the viewer is forced to entertain himself with popcorn and cold cola. So the ""Avengers"" is a completely different case.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of comic books, and the attitude towards this genre is rather negative, because of its total zashtamovannosti and uncompromising pathos. However, seeing such a spectacle as the ""Avengers"", it's hard not to leave your sarcasm aside, and fully enjoy the proposed attraction. Director Joss Weedon, in the beginning, caused me to distrust, in spite of the mass of laudatory reviews, his ""Mission Serenity"" did not impress me at all; However, in this case, a clear and confident direction is felt throughout the film. Weedon is also responsible for the script, and here I want to note how competently it is worked out to fill the picture with action to the eye, not forgetting about the meaningfulness and clear drawing of the characters' characters. It is a balanced scenario that makes the film look ""in one go,"" and the characters look so charismatic, as necessary for a positive perception of the picture.
Undoubtedly, Marvell approached the project very seriously, presenting ""Torah"" and ""First Avenger"" last year, these films being technically quite successful in themselves, at the same time became an effective prelude to the main movie event Marvel. And the creators did their best to make the film truly an event that surpassed its historical predecessors. Since almost all the characters are familiar to the viewer, and the story itself is simple and understandable - it makes it possible to fill the picture with spectacular action to the point that it seems unbelievable how all this can fit into one film, even if it lasts more than two hours. At the same time, this is not the case when the entire film is thrown at different locations, trying to diversify the action in this way. The bulk of events takes place on the ship Nick Fury and in New York, but everything is done so qualitatively that not how much it tires. The scene of the massacre in the city in the final is fascinating, although the ""scene"" is not called the language, because of its wide time frame. For a very long time the heroes will fight the enemy; everything will jump, fly and explode; and all this in an excellent high-quality 3D. And although the film is not without pathos, I was pleased that the question of the police ""Who are you to command here?"" Captain America did not begin to pronounce his name, which the Russian viewer perceives with his teeth, but simply showed in deed.<br/><br/>Of course, there is a lot of humor in the film. However, if, for example, in the same ""Sea Battle"" creators used humor as a saving thread, literally pulling the picture from the abyss in certain places; in ""Avengers"" it is, albeit an obligatory, but an equal part of the overall structure, which works in a complex. This is not the option when you close your eyes to some flaws due to some pluses (an abundance of humor, for example) because there are no obvious shortcomings in all parameters of the production of the film. And the humor itself - yes, sometimes even stiff and sarcastic, chuckling over the heroes and reducing the extra degrees of pathos. In this regard, it is not superfluous to mention that Joss Weedon also had a hand in creating the scenario ""Huts in the Forest"", but here, of course, everything is in a softer framework.<br/><br/>To say that ""Avengers"" is a typical entertaining movie would be fundamentally wrong - in fact Marvel was removed practically by the standard representative of the genre, which uses every minute of its timing as effectively as possible. Mass of spectacular action, magnificent picture in high-quality 3D, wonderful soundtrack, sarcastic humor and nice characters. It is this film that should be considered a grandiose opening of the summer season of blockbusters, as it really sets a very high level."
"Kia00","Null","393","691","14 April 2012"," I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion and payoff.
","This remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film... Stark now knows he's not the only superhero in his world and it's as big a treat for our real world as it gets. Seeing the ""Avenger Initiative"" in action is as great as I would ever have hoped! Hell, who am I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who would've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a film and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene one and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced. Truthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every studio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really think most will agree if they see it with an open mind. I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion and payoff. I honestly can't wait to see it again with the rest of the world later. Right now, I'm simply basking in the greatness I just witnessed!"
"Al1899","10","31","46","28 March 2015"," The Avengers (04/27/2012)
","After watching the film today, I decided to review this film because I am literally on the edge of my seat for the sequel and every time I wake up for university or for work, I view all three trailers and get even more excited and emotional for the film!<br/><br/>I watched the film on 04/27/2012 when it was released in Scotland and for me to see all the heroes and supporting characters brought in from their respective films together into one film was dream come true for me. I always hoped for a Justice League film consisting of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), The Flash, Hawkgirl & J'onn J'onzz, but I have to admit that DC are rushing things for their cinematic universe. From the introduction to each hero to their developing relationships to the funny moments between each character and to the amazing visual affects, there is not a dull moment in this film! The Avengers is FANTASTIC! <br/><br/>We know who the characters are and their origins developed from the preceding films - Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011) & Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen was extremely fun and boisterous. <br/><br/>Many fans of the superhero genre want a balance of fighting, explosions as well as intelligent scenes and Joss Whedon and Zack Penn do just that with their vision and imagination. <br/><br/>The scenes are entertaining and hilarious especially when the characters are interacting with one another during the film such as Captain America meeting Iron Man after the confrontation with Loki, Iron Man mocking Captain America and Thor, the chemistry with Bruce Banner is poetic in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier conference room and finally, the scene between Thor and the Hulk is hilarious especially when Thor is sucker punched by the Hulk. Also, the scene when Iron Man thrusts the energy onto the shield of Steve Rogers to annihilate a Chitauri fleet foreshadows events in Captain America 3 or better now known as Captain America: Civil War. In addition, it's a shame that Edward Norton didn't return as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Mark Ruffalo nailed the scenes in his first film in the role bequeathed to him by the former. Ruffalo portrays Banner in a phlegmatic manner managing to control his impeccable rage only to easily let it out when in the Hulk mode, his performance is AMAZING!!! <br/><br/>The best part of the movie for me would have to be the moment when Tony Stark as Iron Man introduces himself as a team player near the climax - after being lambasted by Steve Rogers/Captain America earlier - when he intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet destroying the mother ship. <br/><br/>However, the stars of the film for me would have to be Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Hiddleston. Both actors are superb in their roles as Iron Man and Loki, respectively.<br/><br/>Marvel and DC both have a variety of rich characters and even a brilliant number of story lines, however, in my eyes, Marvel will always be number one because they have implemented their films with careful planning and precision. In the end, when it comes to Marvel Cinematic Films, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness and we all know for a fact that Marvel will up their game and will ALWAYS deliver for their loyal fan base."
"flblueeyedboy","10","39","60","21 January 2015"," Greatest superhero movie in history
","Saw the preview at the end of Thor back in 2011... had to wait almost a year to experience the global phenomenon first-hand. The theater experience wasn't something to forget.<br/><br/>All in all, the title of this review says it all. 'Marvel's The Avengers' is quite possibly the greatest superhero movie in history. The combination of hardcore assassins Widow and Hawkeye, reclusive Banner, arrogant Iron Man, leader Cap and the Norse brothers Thor and Loki mixes itself together into a concoction of personalities and superpowers which guarantees to impress.<br/><br/>Marvel has set the bar high for themselves. Since its release, only a select few superhero movies have compared to it. And all of them have been Marvel!"
"dreamerboi23","9","433","778","14 April 2012"," Nothing Short of Amazing
","I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.<br/><br/>First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story. <br/><br/>You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like ""Wow this guy/chick is a badass"" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it. <br/><br/>If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought ""Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity"". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass. <br/><br/>In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!"
"MR_Heraclius","9","39","63","23 February 2020"," Great
","Are you a fan of epic adventure movies? Then this is your dream come true! Truly this is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's executed perfectly. Props to the filmmakers for taking the time to design it to be more than just a superhero film packed with action scenes and adding depth to each character."
"scotts863","Null","228","420","21 April 2012"," A Flat out Exceptional Movie Event. (Best Villain in Years!)
","I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.<br/><br/>Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event."
"Allswell007","Null","317","609","14 April 2012"," Exceptional! Oh my God. Oh. My. God. My mind is blown.
","I just loved Marvel's Avengers. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.<br/><br/>I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!"
"rachel-673-19946","10","70","124","27 April 2012"," Best. Comic Book Movie. EVER.
","This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. It's the pinnacle, the ultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action, tension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype ‚Äì years and years worth of hype ‚Äì might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS MOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.<br/><br/>Maybe even better.<br/><br/>The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies IRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the scientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.<br/><br/>Man, it's awesome. AWE. SOME.<br/><br/>Oh, it's by no means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines ‚Äì especially the final line ‚Äì feels a little off-kilter. Flashing up a computer image of Natalie Portman's Jane (Thor's love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette Smoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly clich√©.<br/><br/>Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a doubt incredible.<br/><br/>Just for fun, let's talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey Jr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award for Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it he surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renner's relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman's bow and arrow. Clark Gregg's mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thor's resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by Tom Hiddleston.<br/><br/>Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Aren't you funny and great?<br/><br/>Of the newcomers, I will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward Norton's turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey, mild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How I Met Your Mother's Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little ‚Äì enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.<br/><br/>Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing like this one, who wouldn't already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have ever seen (and I've seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year ‚Äì whew! I was so hoping BATTLESHIP wouldn't continue to hold that title for too much longer ‚Äì and one I cannot wait to see again.<br/><br/>Avengers assemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say! And assemble, and assemble, and assemble again¬Ö<br/><br/>(And make sure you stay through the credits for the now-expected next-movie teaser¬Ö Buffy and Angel fans will be particularly happy, even if they don't quite get the somewhat obscure comic-y reference¬Ö)<br/><br/>-- This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine - www.geekspeakmagazine.com"

","I'm not going to spoil anything or get very technical here. I don't usually write reviews. I did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie did.<br/><br/>Sure, it's not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from a cinematic or storytelling point of view, but it delivers perfectly.<br/><br/>The wit, conflict, adventure, heart and sense of wonder that I once found in my crazy uncle's attic, slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty Marvel Magazines - populated with super-soldiers, handsome flying scientists, Norse gods, green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather - are here.<br/><br/>As I grew up, I somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness. These characters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along. As the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.<br/><br/>I watched this with my 10 year old nephew. I don't know if that makes me the crazy uncle, but it sure was great to be back in that attic, even for a while. I always knew Hulk smashed. Now I know he always will."

"billygoat1071","10","65","119","25 April 2012"," A Fan Service
","The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.<br/><br/>Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.<br/><br/>Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.<br/><br/>There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen."

","I initially had a feeling that this movie would be a too much superhero overload for my taste. But then I saw the positive reviews on IMDb and RottenTomatoes and also the comments Youtube etc... and I felt I had been wrong and they might have pulled it off really well! So I went to watch it.<br/><br/>But I felt completely cheated after watching this film, how could IMDb ratings be so misleading?! The only reason this film might be remembered could be because it would become part of the case study ""How a below average film could be made into blockbuster by hyping it up on internet and social networks."" I don't write reviews in general, but forced to do it for this film such a a letdown and waste of time even though it's got one of the best ever ratings on IMDb.<br/><br/>If IMDb rating is actually true I feel worried for the people who can't see through the actions and special effects.<br/><br/>Overall, you might enjoy this Film if you have enjoyed Micheal Bay's Transformers, if you didn't you might find it very difficult to sit through this movie as well."

If you look closer and compare the text of those ""best movie ever"" reviews (or variations of that, such as ""i did not expect much, i am not a superhero fan, but this was greatest beyond belief"" ) with reviews written at other moviegoer platforms, you will find a lot of equal phrases and text blocks.<br/><br/>I guess that IMDb is aware of that cheating and they support it. <br/><br/>This movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula. Superheros need super problems to solve, so that they can shine. Each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to his/her individual super powers. They only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team. But suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread, as you can guess, and only towards the end they find together again and etc., etc.. A story for retarded eight-year-old's, flavored with as much CGI as you little brain can swallow in the time.<br/><br/>A stupid movie with a stupid story, stupid characters with stupid attitudes, stupid CGI and a stupid ending. If super stupid means blockbuster, then here you go."

Oh yes, they are morons. Its the only sensible conclusion to draw. How anyone can rate this movie amongst the pantheon of great titles is beyond me.<br/><br/>So trying to find something constructive to say about this title is hard...I enjoyed Iron Man?

"DAZINPARIS","1","386","800","11 May 2012"," A consummate failure - here's why
","Here's why ""The Avengers"" fails so badly.<br/><br/>1. Wrong, wrong director - Joss Whedon is a TV Director. ""Serenity"" worked because it was essentially a TV movie. And he has here made ""The Avengers"" a TV movie. Bad move, this should have gone to J.J. Abrams, Bryan Singer or Brad Bird.<br/><br/>2. Dreadful miscasting - only Robert Downey Junior can hold his head high. Chris Evans is as wooden in this as the flat ""Captain America"" film. Those playing Thor, Hulk, Black Widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed.<br/><br/>3. Weak, weak villain - Tom Hiddleston plays a slight, camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else. This film needed a ""General Zod"".<br/><br/>4. Too much obvious CGI - come on, it's 2012, there's no excuse for the George Lucas-y effects like the flying Shield craft graphics.<br/><br/>5. No drama, tension and a script so obviously flat that Whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone.<br/><br/>For anyone growing up with Marvel comics in the 70's (chime with me on this), we deserved SO much more. For younger audiences, it will pass I'm sure.<br/><br/>Really can't understand though the positive reviews. Am I alone in this ?"

","Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didn't expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best comic-book movies ever ‚Äì Iron Man. If it wasn't for DC's own Billionaire playboy superhero would've champion Iron Man as the best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1 & 2 were good but didn't exactly capture the essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless. Last year's motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their respective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the silver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitive's proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvel's motion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008's The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the franchise.<br/><br/>Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits like Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005's Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos, handling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys ‚Äì to be honest, I wouldn't have entrusted him with a fraction of the $200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie ‚Äì Bryan Singer (X-Men & X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class) while Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming X3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.<br/><br/>Let me say it out loud: <br/><br/>JOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD. <br/><br/>Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You are wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don't crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything it's the Hulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he absolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and every character gets a fair amount of screen time. I can't find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects are spectacular but it's the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines ‚Äì not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully ‚Äì I've never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and I've watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking man. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie ‚Äì they were wrong. From now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza ‚Äì Yeah I'm slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon would've done justice to the franchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now. <br/><br/>Final verdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids. Go watch that movie!!!"

"brandon_lee420","9","63","120","24 April 2012"," The Avengers - one of the best superhero film so far!
","Believe me when I say that 'The Avengers' was my most anticipated movie ever. I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The movie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This movie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live in Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie was over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it was 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the $13 to watch it.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor, wants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. It's up to the Avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are just f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.<br/><br/>The music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of action. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in awe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where Stark and Loki have a confrontation ('We have an Army' , 'We have a Hulk'). That scene was what did it for me.<br/><br/>If you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for TDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect! <br/><br/>'Over and Out.' 25 April 2012"

","When my friend asked me to see the Avengers with him I thought he meant the Steed and Mrs Peel Avengers . Unfortunately , it was the comic book Avengers . While I am not such a big superhero action movie fan , I did enjoy the Batman and Watchman movies . However, the Avengers is one film I could have easily passed up . After first battling each other , the Avengers unite and join forces to save the world from the same common enemy . A lot of the action takes place on a gigantic flying aircraft carrier ,No.64 ( not the CV-64 USS Constellation ). This movie consists mostly of very fast paced CGI's and cheesy Iron Man Robert Downey Jr one-liners . Our heroes and (super villain) are practically indestructible as they are beaten to a pulp but always manage to bounce back time after time . I don't know what the Black Widow's super powers were except martial arts and pistol shooting . Some unintentionally funny moments came when Iron Man Downey was speaking from inside his metal suit . It looked like a talking head from inside a goldfish bowl . It just looked so silly ! There isn't much chemistry between these cardboard characters either . If you are 10 years old or an adult with the maturity of a 14 year old boy , who is obsessed with reading comic books, and are addicted to video games, I'm sure the Avengers is your cup of tea . If not, you will be thinking of the 143 boring minutes you just wasted or what other movies were playing next door you could have seen . If you do decide to see this movie , select a seat in the last row to avoid nausea . I would like to see movies that rely so much on CGI's to be made into animated full length cartoons instead . At least the unaware movie goer has a better idea of what is in store for them when they purchase a ticket . <br/><br/>This film was definitely not for me ! .... NOT HOT ... pwh"

","This film is is an empty shell covered with dazzling lights. Sure, it does look pretty but that is as far as it goes.<br/><br/>Nothing interesting happens in this film (by interesting I mean plot wise, not a standard fight scene with new people copied and pasted into it) the 'plot' is horrific, to the point in which you wonder if there actually is a one. Hollywood seem to use the same script for every action film they make, only they replace a few of the more minor details so hopefully people won't notice. <br/><br/>In an attempt to keep at least some of the male (and select female) audience awake the director decides it is time for Scarlett Johansson to pop up on screen to show off her, lets say defining costume in such an obvious manner. It is just a cheap, cheap film full of filler material that you will enjoy if you have an inability to think for yourself.<br/><br/>I really have no idea how this film got into the top 100 of all time, there is really no reason for it to be there. <br/><br/>The only plus sides are that the acting and cast are superb, it is just a shame that they were not involved in something where their talents could have been used in more fulfilling roles."
"maverick-352-622235","10","58","112","24 April 2012"," A Marvel-ous experience
","The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.<br/><br/>You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:<br/><br/>1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)<br/><br/>2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?<br/><br/>3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it. <br/><br/>4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it. <br/><br/>5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!<br/><br/>6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!<br/><br/>You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!<br/><br/>If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.<br/><br/>The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.<br/><br/>All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen."

The cinematography was gray and cloudy, the editing incomprehensible, and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar. Simple, human emotions, which used to be integral to a movie are now so rare. Noise and all-too-familiar mayhem have been substituted.

"sacflyzone","10","64","126","16 April 2012"," Beyond Excellent. Avengers Hits At The Highest Level!
","Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.<br/><br/>Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.<br/><br/>I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is just that good"

But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. <br/><br/>Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.<br/><br/>The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.<br/><br/>As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)<br/><br/>I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I will say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history. <br/><br/>Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT."

I was disappointed because, surprise surprise, it felt EXACTLY like every other superhero movie that had ever been made. Even more so since its a combination of all of the previous heroes into one film. So really, it's not original, or different, or exciting, or moving, or anything. It just IS."

","At first when I heard of this show, I was kinda excited about it. But when I went to the cinemas yesterday to watch it, I was tempted to leave my seat already at the early part of the show. It's not the characters or actors that is horrible, it's the director to be honest. I don't know how the script writers come what with this or even how the director approve it, but the lines and conversation were so fake, blunt and seriously horrible. It lakes emotions, feelings or even creativeness. Let alone, the whole plot is too predictable and boring. No doubt the action scenes is good and the graphic is awesome, but the plot and horrible lines just make this show right at the bottom of my list for shows in 2012. I rather watch ""The Dark Knight"" anytime rather than this horrible show. Even friends of mine who are crazy about DC and Marvel comics were absolutely disappointed in this show. In fact, they leave the theatres during halfway of the show. This is just an example to show how horrible it is. All in short, this show to me is not worth watching or buying and was a waste of 143 minutes of my time."
"sanddragon939","10","37","70","27 April 2012"," Avengers: An Assembly of Sheer Awesomeness!!!
","From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!<br/><br/>Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.<br/><br/>Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.<br/><br/>On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!"

","As a reviewer, I don't mess up often but, just like the line where Stark is ribbing Loki, sometimes even an IMDb top reviewer can have performance issues.<br/><br/>My first view, I was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling. Although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.<br/><br/>By my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these characters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I now know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.<br/><br/>So what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films then de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.<br/><br/>And wrote a script to die for. By the third time around I was actually listening to the film instead of just watching, and boy can that guy write.<br/><br/>Like the line I posted as the title of this review. It took me 3 viewings to catch it. It is sly, it is sexual, and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action. But I was on the floor laughing.<br/><br/>So there you go, it is fun, action packed (last hour), written at an Oscar level, the characters are perfectly cast (except the Nick Fury I grew up with was Caucasion, but I guess no one remembers) and, to keep the suits happy, not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchise.<br/><br/>So that's a 10<br/><br/>***********************************************<br/><br/>ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND -- ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND<br/><br/>Just watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review. As of this year (2017) this is, at the same time, one of the best ""action"" films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films. I believe Joss received only one award for the screenplay, which is a pity, because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre. The little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue (""I'M ALWAYS ANGRY"" ""PUNY GOD"") are a Whedon trademark, and massively under-appreciated. I will also suggest that nothing with the Marvel brand that has arrived since Avengers I has been this good -- and I am including all their TV and other off-cable projects in that comment. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY one, is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of ""politically correct"" followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes ... for being superheroes. Personally, as a superhero fan for over 60 years, I think that entire arc sucks and one day Marvel will figure that out. Otherwise perfect film!"

","""The tesseract has awakened."" spoken in the opening scene, picks right up where 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Thor' left off. S.H.E.I.L.D director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is forced to call upon earths mightiest hero's to stop the self outcast Asgardian Loki.<br/><br/>Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, along with Black Widow and Hawkeye, are the only hope to save the world from an invasion, and boy do they in an instant superhero classic. Possibly the best thing about The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble in the UK) is that each hero has grounded powers the exception being Thor (unless you count Hulk's strength as a super power), which makes the Marvel hero's more believable than their DC. counterparts.<br/><br/>There's drama, action, comedy, and some amazing CGI, and thankfully doesn't fall into the same category as the not so fantastic Fantastic 4 movies. Mark Ruffalo, replacing the underwhelming Ed Norton, excels as Bruce Banner/Hulk, which is without a doubt the best on screen version of the iconic hero after the awful 2003 'Hulk' movie and 2008's slightly improved 'The Incredible Hulk', as well as Ruffalo and co star Robert Downey Jr. Playing Tony Stark/Iron Man for the 4th time, having some fantastic chemistry in a scene on-board the Hellcarrier.<br/><br/>Chris Evans plays Captain America perfectly as the man out of time, Chris Hemsworth is believable in his role as Loki's Brother (like in Thor) Scarlett Johansson is the surprise of the movie though with a lot of the action revolving around her Black Widow, the only major disappointment with The Avengers is that Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is underused. That being said every hero gets decent screen time to justify their appearance as well as everyone having a big part to play in the fantastic final sequence.<br/><br/>However, The Avengers towers over every superhero movie in recent memory with the only real challengers being X-Men and The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joss Whedons hit is sure to please Marvel fans and the everyday movie goer. Next up for Marvel studios, Iron Man 3, cant wait.<br/><br/>Best quote in the movie: Loki:""How desperate are you that you call upon such such lost creatures to defend you?""<br/><br/>If you enjoyed watching: X-Men, Fantastic 4, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, you'll enjoy watching The Avengers (Avengers Assemble)."

I love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans. I can't find any flaws in this movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action, comedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and Scarlett Johannson is amazing as Black Widow. My favourite is Samuel L Jackson as the tough but amazing Nick Fury. All in all WATCH THIS FILM."

","Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares, anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next,Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!<br/><br/>I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation! <br/><br/>But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air! <br/><br/>The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time! <br/><br/>The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck!"

"Kane20","9","30","56","1 July 2012"," Review - The Avengers
","I saw The Avengers on May 17. Personally, I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I quite enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, The Avengers is a pretty good and entertaining movie, and it's a good theatrical experience. James Berardinelli wrote in his review, ""The Avengers kicks ass."" I agree.<br/><br/>Over the last few years, five movies have been made - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America - which have built up to, and became prequels to, The Avengers. There were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected, and now this movie confirms it. The Avengers are all assembled in this film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Yes, they're all played by the same actors, and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the ""prequels"" mentioned above. The villain in the movie is Loki, who was the villain in Thor, and who now plans on using the Tesseract, a powerful energy cube, to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army. The Avengers are called together by Nick Fury, who runs an agency called S. H. I. E. L. D., and they must stop Loki from carrying out his plans. There's more to the story, but I won't give any more away.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie. However, it's really not worth it, given there are so many good things about the movie, and the entire experience is very enjoyable, so I'm not going to bother with an in-depth review/criticism. In a way, the film is sort of critic-proof (for lack of a better term). So here's my advice: don't dissect or overly analyze the movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. That's not to say that it's a total Transformers-like junk movie or anything. It's actually halfway decent.<br/><br/>The actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters, and the interactions between the characters are good - the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well. The story is pretty solid, and it's coherent and appropriately paced. The visual and special effects and action scenes are great. Alan Silvestri composed an effective score for the movie. Overall, the movie is halfway decent, it's smart, and it's entertaining, and, unlike many junk films like Michael Bay's, it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement, and it has a good, wise balance between story and action/effects. The two-and-a-half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me. So, while I don't think this movie is great, it's definitely entertaining and worth seeing, and it's a very good theater experience.<br/><br/>My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)"
"adlion944","5","73","151","22 August 2012"," Avengers represents everything that is wrong with blockbusters
","I'll preface... I'm not a comic book reader. I enjoy fantasy, as long as it makes sense in its own self-created universe (Star Wars and Trek, Harry Potter, Superman). But the Avengers is awful, and even worse considering how highly rated this junk is on IMDb. It has a couple moments of delight (but so did the Phantom Menace), and the effects are state of the art, bar none. But, this is the 50th movie in a row where the photorealistic effects impressed me. Now, I'm afraid I need a real movie to use that CGI to good effect.<br/><br/>The Avengers fails for me due to the character combination. I didn't read a single comic book, but Universal released this huge budget movie knowing they will need to attract 10 new people for everyone who read the dusty old comic books. The Avengers are a dumb assembly of heroes. Captain America is an idiot character. He is from a different time, isn't good at anything modern (like why is he barking orders?), and has no powers whatsoever. Ditto for Black Widow and Hawkeye. I mean, the latter shoots friggin arrows. Cappy had a shield and punches guys within 5 feet of him. They are just plain lame. Thor is a GOD and the Hulk is invincible. They're immortal. Unstoppable. And Iron Man, with his impossible-to-believe suit which might as well be magic-based is also nearly invincible. Who needs the other 3? Why isn't Spiderman in this group? Or some of the X-Men? As for the humans, why do we have a city-sized aircraft carrier? That flies and looks amazingly like the big aircraft from Avatar? Why build a ship that flies? Okay, now the plot. I don't get it. This movie is 2:22 minutes. I don't even understand Loki's motivation or plan. Loki wants to blow up Earth? Why? Why do those Aliens/Clash of the Titans monsters want to blow up Earth? Why could Thor and Loki get to Earth but they can't without the magic portal? Are those monsters magical or technological? And that cube - seriously, they used the same lame McGuffin from Transformers. Which is a movie very much like this one. I mean that as an insult. What was Loki's plan, crumble the outer shells of buildings in NYC. Shoot a lot and not hit anyone? Not one human even seemed to get hit with all the devastation.<br/><br/>I hated it. My wife and kids hated it. My 9 year old son hated it. That says it all. It made no sense, was utterly talky and boring for a huge chunk of it. The Dark Knight wipes its rear end with this blu-ray disc. Avoid at all costs unless you liked Transformers 3, John Carter and Clash of the Titans."
"dannymcdandy","9","33","63","29 April 2012"," The most anticipated superhero movie of all time doesn't disappoint.
","The Avengers is quite possibly the most anticipated superhero movie in history, but does it quite live up to the hype?<br/><br/>I know that this is the Marvel movie we have all been waiting for. This is the movie that all the others made by Marvel Studios has been leading up to. This is what they have been aching to show us.<br/><br/>I was pleased to learn that I would be given the chance to see the movie before its May release date in the United States, but despite my privileged opportunity, I went in with relatively low expectations. (It's just another superhero movie, but with a bunch of them at one time, right?)<br/><br/>Wrong...<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Marvel, superheroes, great CGI or just all-around intense action films, you MUST see Marvel's The Avengers. <br/><br/>The CGI was the best I've seen in a long time, the fighting as intense as ever, and the plot is top-notch. But these things aren't the only aspects of the movie that make The Avengers great. For me, it was the characters. <br/><br/>Yes, we've seen all these characters before. We've enjoyed their specific movies, but having them on screen together worked better than I could have imagined. <br/><br/>In fact, that was why I was apprehensive at first. I had been afraid that perhaps one hero would take away more screen time than another. (We all have our favorites.) But this wasn't the case. <br/><br/>Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), provided his much expected wit and humor for the film, causing the crowd to laugh on many occasions. The banter between Stark and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) flowed well and added a lot to the character depth. <br/><br/>I wasn't sure how Thor (Chris Hemsworth) would be playing his part either. I thought he actually might be taking too much screen time from the others since his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), was the main antagonist, but this wasn't the case. <br/><br/>I found myself most excited in the movie when Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) came on screen. His character was done so well for this movie. I found myself thrilled and even scared in some of his scenes.<br/><br/>I must also mention here that Ruffalo did a superb job of taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. If there's one thing that annoys me about sequels, it's when they change actors, but I actually enjoyed Ruffalo better in this role.<br/><br/>Of course you can't forget about Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Each of them played their part of the story wonderfully, though I found Sam Jackson's acting to be a little stale.<br/><br/>I would say that if you haven't watched the other movies made by Marvel Studios that you might want to watch them. Most references will be lost on you if you don't. <br/><br/>As far as screen time, it felt like every character got their time in the light. No one person stole the show, and just as Marvel intended, they ALL stole the show.<br/><br/>There is one particular scene that I enjoyed where the camera panned to each hero, doing their own special moves, though it's hard to explain further than that without giving anything away. However, there were moments in the movie where I had to lean over to my wife and ask what someone was talking about, but these instances were minor.<br/><br/>Obviously, if you care anything about Marvel movies, you're already planning to see The Avengers. If you haven't seen any of the other Marvel Studios films, take a weekend, watch them. Then go see The Avengers. I don't think you'll be sorry you did."

","Ugh! ""Avengers"" wore me out. Lets begin with this spoilfest review. The character I was most looking forward to being fleshed out was Hawkeye, who starts out as a zombie.... Loki has a good entrance, but his alien-buddies are never fleshed out, named, or given any character development whatsoever. Apparently, their ""advance warfare"" includes just really-drunken aerial driving. Thor was a pure letdown. He had no swagger, wasn't boisterous, and his costume changed without rhyme or reason. PLUS, he just *poof* appeared, and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of ""THOR"". PLUS, PLUS, he didn't even try to find Jane, or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything! Maria Hill was just annoying eye-candy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plot-points. And Captain America was lackluster. Black Widow was okay. Hulk was funny, but it was kind of creepy how he went after Black Widow. He spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy, then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that, oh, golly gee, I can do this anytime I want to. And Pepper Potts as a daisy-duke wearing penthouse babe? I don't think so. The worst continuity of the series fell on Iron Man. At the end of ""The Incredible Hulk"", it was setup where Tony Stark was forming the Avengers, then we find out in ""The Avengers"" that he wouldn't even be accepted? No Odin, No Jane, No tender flashback scene for Cap's love-interest... I felt the movie really could have benefited from some roller-coaster ride, instead of all peaks. I was surprised to see ""Jenny Agutter"" listed in the credits, apparently she was an unnamed council-member who was so poorly lit she didn't stand out. The best part was Agent Coulson who died (wtf?). And who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke New York? No hints at future teammates.... No real philosophic underpinnings like X-Men had... It was kind of just DisneyWorld on Crack, but it was fun to see on opening night...."

","The Avengers ‚Äì CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie is undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great performance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction. Highly recommended in 3D."

Everything, from the writing to the action to the humour to the chemistry between characters to even the pacing feels like it was pulled straight from the pages of the lavishly ludicrous, and having one of the gods of cult sci-fi/fantasy, not to mention a comic book writer, at the helm of this movie was probably the only way this movie could have possibly met with everyone's expectations.<br/><br/>4-5 years of build-up to this movie, and it more than just pays off; it wins the jackpot. I am yet to find a person who didn't like this movie, and I can fully understand why. I honestly TRIED to find something about it to even nitpick at, and found nothing. This is the ultimate comic book movie; I highly recommend this to any lover of action, superhero or sci-fi movies, as well as to any avid comic book readers.

After the Avengers at last sent the Space Phantom back into limbo where he belonged, the Hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle. He gave the Avengers his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknown.<br/><br/>This never would have happened in the JUSTICE LEAGUE.<br/><br/>During the showing I attended, after the credits were done, there is a scene where the Avengers are sitting together in a restaurant eating. The expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else. When I first saw it, it appeared a little non-sequitur and just something added-on to pique interest. But then I went to my Volume 1 of the ESSENTIAL AVENGERS which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga. I decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review. When I got to page two of Issue Two, there it was right at the bottom! Essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the Avengers movie. Oh, the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent, but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie. A bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each other's presence! It's the American Experience reductio ad absurdum. It is also the Human Experience should you wish to wax philosophical about it.<br/><br/>Reminds me of something I once heard Jesse Jackson declare during a speech and I believe he was quoting Martin Luther King; ""We have to learn to live together no matter how painful, or we'll die apart as fools."" <br/><br/>Suffice it to say that for the Avengers working together and living together is particularly painful at times.<br/><br/>No, Robert Downey Jr. would not have ordinarily come to mind as Tony Stark AKA IRON MAN, with his yuppie insouciance, but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes, so there's no use asking ""-where have you gone Errol Flynn and Ronald Coleman?"". They're probably having lunch with Joe DiMaggio. Downey, in his own way, does more than represent with IRON MAN.<br/><br/>Knowing this genre intimately and well, this time I may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it. There are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit, but that's the glory of the Marvel Universe. It is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony, rhythm and balance. As Edward G. Robinson once said in THE CINCINNATI KID, ""-sort of like Life-"".<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson has no real business being in the AVENGERS doing his usual scenery chewing, channeling bits of 'SHAFT' and 'HAWK' and the Black Man's angst about wanting in on the American Dream. For one thing, the original Nick Fury was a white World War Two hero who headed a squad called Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos. He would probably be in his nineties by now, but only a time chosen few would know that. Besides, that's the beauty of this fantasy scenario. Nobody really questions what or who these super-powered characters are supposed to be avenging. Actually they're more like the FINAL GUARDIANS than AVENGERS. Anyway, you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning. Here are all these odds and ends of personality and death-defying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this ain't your universe. It's the MARVEL UNIVERSE and you're just living and thrilling in it. When you look at it that way, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gets down and gets back, and redefines the American Dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to be.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon and Zak Penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the Marvel Universe. They have written a tale to celebrate. Joss Whedon's direction is Marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with Sam Rami's SPIDERMAN movies.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Tom Huddleston as Loki, Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do. They are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all that's left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction. And yet, the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselves.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Marvel Age of Comics in Cinema!"

","THE GOOD- I was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie off. The visual effects were all very clean. The characters were portrayed by the actors very well. This movie was loaded with action keeping everyone's attention glued to it. I was so impressed, I went to the theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone. I was very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their characters in this. THE BAD- Most characters.... The hulk was my big issue here. Mark Rufflo was good with the Bruce Banner character but the graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie starring Edward Norton. But it was not so bad that I could not look past it and really find enjoyment. I will most definitely go see another installment of Avengers."

","The movie is certainly marvel's best till now and has great effects. Though little childish at times it is very good. As I expected it was one of the best films with descent, comedy parts. The acting was above average and the dialogues were really mind-boggling. It was a bit lengthy but was touching every single minute. The story was very good and the superhero's were described nicely. Bruce Banner very polite when he was not Hulk, Captain America very serious and all that. It was defiantly worth watching and is one of the best superhero films.

","Loved this movie, even at almost 3 hours long it didn't drag. Joss Wheddon (Firefly and Buffy) effortlessly out did all of the battle scenes in every Transformer movie with the climatic showdown. there are even two or three seriously laugh out loud moments, mostly concerning The Hulk, but don't worry the film takes itself fairly seriously so you can escape into the story and immerse yourself.<br/><br/>Fans of Ironman, Thor and Captain America will not be disappointed. Every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of course, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the movie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real 3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice before paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production. Go HD you'll get a better experience."

Do we really think this will be in development hell? This is The Avengers ""EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES!"" This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse.

In 2002, was the year of the Spider.<br/><br/>After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse.<br/><br/>Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.<br/><br/>But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next.<br/><br/>Now if DC & Warner Bros. step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen."
"dee.reid","10","27","51","9 July 2012"," ""The Avengers"" (2012)
","As you well know by now, ""The Avengers"" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>P.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp? Weren't they part of the original Avengers team line-up (before ""The Avengers #4"" when Captain America became team leader, marking the character's Silver Age debut)? This was my only real complaint about ""The Avengers."""
"rayrodgpa","10","27","51","12 May 2012"," Beautifully Done Masterpiece
","I'll admit it, I was extremely doubtful about this film. I've loved Joss Whedon's work my entire life and I had enjoyed all the previous Marvel films that led up to this one, especially Iron Man. But the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew that Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my favorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon did a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with happiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done. I am extremely delighted to say that Joss Whedon has done the impossible and made one of the most entertaining movies ever made."

There are also some who are so enamored and in love with The Dark Knight that they will pounce on any film that is considered ""better"". For me, I've never been a big comic book guy but I do enjoy a good film adaptation of them. I can love The Dark Knight AND Iron Man. I don't have a bias. I enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company, brand, or filmmaker. <br/><br/>For me, I absolutely love The Avengers. It brought out the little kid in me. At 33, cynical and disgruntled, that's a major compliment. I understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun. It made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again. But again, I'm 33, so I mean that figuratively. I just really had a blast with this and this is the best theater experience I've had since seeing a Star Wars movie. I loved it and can't wait to see it again. <br/><br/>So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense.

"Leemsn-co-uk","10","27","51","28 April 2012"," All in all, one of the best films I've seen in a while.
","Cannot find too much fault in this film, apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related films, luckily I had seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor, so I knew the back story from the get-go.<br/><br/>I feel all of the characters were given enough screen time, I would have maybe liked to see Thor a bit more, I think he was underused, he could have done a lot more with his massive power, like killing one of those massive lizard things on his own, the character of the Hulk was brilliantly well played by Mark Ruffalo, he portrayed Banner as a very calm and collected man and very laid back which is needed for him, it created a newfound interest in the character for me, as I was never a great fan of the Hulk. As always Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job of Iron Man, with the majority of the film's funny lines coming from him.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth borough back the mighty Thor and did so tremendously, like I said I think he could have been used a lot more, the Black Widow was also a nice addition, even though she had appeared previously in Iron Man 2, (although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol.) I found it incredibly hard to stop looking at her behind, but luckily I was wearing 3D glasses in the dark so nobody could tell.<br/><br/>Hawkeye was really well played, for some reason the actor looks a LOT like Gerard Butler to me, I don't know why. But regardless he is a great character and I found it very funny when he asked Iron Man for a lift up to a roof of a building, and Tony Stark replied ""Ok hang on then Legolas"". Little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lot.<br/><br/>The humour of the film mainly came from Iron Man/Tony Stark, also quite a lot of funny moments came from Bruce Banner/The Hulk. I was a bit confused as to why he can suddenly control the Hulk, when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on. There were deep and meaningful thoughts about Bruce's alter ego, but there was a lot of humour to be had from the Hulk as well, (particularly when he smashes Loki on the ground again and again).<br/><br/>One small annoyance I had was the continuity on the level of strength and toughness each character had. In the film Thor, he was made to look like the most powerful being ever, with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air, but in this film he only whacks them back about ten feet, which is exactly the same distance Captain America and Iron Man can hit (which it shows in the fight scene involving the three of them). It's just an annoyance of mine but I found it hard to figure out which one of them had the most strength, fair enough Steve Rogers is a super soldier but Thor is a demigod, you would think he would have a lot more more strength in comparison, one second a whack from Thor's Hammer can knock the Hulk ten feet away, but it doesn't even leave a scratch on Captain America's shield? And yes I know the shield is made with some indestructible material mentioned in the Cap film, but the Hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completely.<br/><br/>I also kinda wished they fought directly next to each other more, you never see all of them at the exact same place, they're always scattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team, throughout the film I was waiting for some epic bit where all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them, but the most I got was two or three of them in the same place in the final battle.<br/><br/>But all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely frightful, you get some empathy for Bruce Banner, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it, I was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it."
"prashanta_guha","10","25","47","7 May 2012"," A superhero film true to its name.
","Let's be honest. All the previous Marvel films leading to the Avengers were great - story wise, acting wise, effect wise etc. Iron Man I & II, Thor, Captain America all turned out to be (surprise) box office hits, and one can see the point. So, when at the end of every movie, a post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned, the expectations were raised pretty high.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon (Firefly, Cabin in the Woods) took into account that set expectations, of both comic book fans and non-fans alike, and put together a superhero flick that'll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors. The screenplay writers, the VFX studio, the actors (Robert Downey Jr. has always been my favorite) all deserve credit.<br/><br/>An action packed, blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering, The Avengers is one of the best movies this year. A must watch, even if you're not into this stuff. 10 on 10."
"cyasin95","1","16","28","28 August 2012"," Most overrated movie of all time
","The movie was absolute trash. Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 8.5 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie. So if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up Watchmen, X-men first class, Spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy."

","UK title ""Avengers Assemble""/ Rest-Of-World ""The Avengers"". Just like ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", this film was eagerly anticipated by fans, such as myself. I could not wait for the film to be released on 26th April. Unlike ""TF3"" however, this film live up to the hype. It surpassed my expectations (and I expected a lot). It didn't feel forced and certainly did not feel like a sequel to one particular lead-up film. It felt like a well-made sequel to ALL the films.<br/><br/>The final battle wasn't just an all-out brawl - it seemed integral to the story and characterisation of the film. <br/><br/>Every character had their ""time to shine"" and they were as you remember them from their ""build-up"" films - Tony Stark was cocky, witty and likable, Steve Rodgers was patriotic, a ""man-out-of-time"" and focused on the mission and Thor was a demi-god warrior. <br/><br/>Then there's the Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo instead of Ed Norton this time around. This Hulk/Banner was perfect. Ruffalo brought a sense of humour to this famously angry character and really helped pull-off the Hulk where others have either tried and failed (Hulk 2003) or tried and only just failed (The Incredible Hulk 2008). <br/><br/>We also got a brief look at Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson)'s background and her relationship with Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Even next to their super-powered team-mates, these two proved their worth to be part of the team.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston as Loki was brilliant, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury was what you'd expect from this actor, Clark Gregg was once again great as Phil Coulson and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill was a good decision and while her performance was good I feel she was underused. <br/><br/>This film has and amazing soundtrack, brilliant actors, likable characters (even Loki), great 3D effects, an enjoyable story and epic action. Congratulations and thank you to Director Joss Whedon and the rest of the crew for putting together a masterpiece."

","Action movies will now have a new leader as Avengers assemble by Marvel raises the bar to an entirely new level.<br/><br/>The hype made by Marvel in 2011, by Introducing Thor and Captain America to the audience in quick succession just as a precursor for the Avengers ,is lived up and surpassed with what will be one of the beacons in modern era action movies.<br/><br/>The boasted budget of $220m,is well spent for the movie expectedly satisfies you as a visual treat with what i think,one of the best CG effects.Also,this one does deserve a heads up to be watched in 3D, unlike annoyingly many in the recent past.Though,the first half has a few more than necessary scenes shot in the dark,but it gets better as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Though the plot is pretty straight-forward,there are so many characters in the movie to keep you entertained in their very own signature fashion.Each and every character is given nearly equal importance and nobody is left out,which is an effort to appreciate. They have really put a lot of efforts in the new Hulk to bring him up to join the party with others,and Boy! it does pay off exceptionally well.Iron Man's powers are tested to a very new level and being the most skilled avenger,they had to be.He has got some new moves, watch out for them!.I am really starting to like Captain America and the way he handles the situation. The time transitioned character of his, adjusts surprisingly quickly to the new scenario.Black Widow and Hawk-Eye who had brushing references in previous movies are full fledged avengers now, but i wish marvel to bring them up in singles.There are a few much needed subtle humorous moments exercising your jaws sideways in between a lot of fantastically choreographed action scenes keeping them dropped down for most of the time.<br/><br/>Bout the cast, Downey Jr. undoubtedly stands out as an actor, with his amazing comic timing and the way he carries the arrogance of Iron-Man. The search for Bruce Banner has ended up giving the most subtle hulk yet,with Mark Ruffalo.The Rest of the cast looks just supportive. Cobie Smulders was supposed to be the eye candy,but Scarlett Johansson steals the show in that aspect, not to mention in her alter-ego superhero moves too.<br/><br/>All in all, an awesome summer blockbuster with wholesome entertainment. The Avengers is surely one of the best action movies to watch before you leave this dimension."

","The Avengers is a clean-burning, six-cylinder entertainment - a wall-to-wall action bonanza, executed with a fluid coherence. It laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to follow.<br/><br/>Following on from the first Thor flick, the demi-god's evil brother Loki (a deliciously fiendish Tom Hiddleston) is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that'll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. Trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the Tesseract is appropriated by Loki, who with a nudge from his magic assegai brain-zaps a snap marksman Hawkeye (a competent Jeremy Renner) and a top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (the ever reliable Samuel Jackson), the head of the covert peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. who sets about uniting the world's superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up our titular team - Iron Man (a hilarious Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (a subversively charming Mark Ruffalo), Thor (the charismatic Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (a sincere turn by Chris Evans) and Black Widow (the sexy but earnest Scarlett Johansson) ‚Äì hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts. Problem is, they're a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a gigantic, green loose cannon. Now, with a global catastrophe looming, they must subsume individual will to the collective good. But Loki isn't called 'the god of mischief' for nothing! Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet ‚Äì or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?<br/><br/>The Avengers doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast, largely because of Joss Whedon. He weaves all of the powder-keg moments into a story that is meaningful and always makes sense. The point in The Avengers is to bring six separate characters together as a team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and Whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play. Whedon's script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue, high stakes and balls- to-the-wall action spectacle. If you don't believe me, check out the thrilling alien-bashing finale on the streets of Manhattan - it is a pure fan boy wet-dream. <br/><br/>Smart, funny, pulsating and surprisingly cathartic, Joss Whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase. From ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character, The Avengers is utterly stimulating, satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment. The Avengers make us do something increasingly rare in these over-franchised times - root for a sequel. Go smash!"

Many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films - Captain America, Thor or Iron Man, for example - so we already had a good idea of how they would perform, but I feel they all exceeded expectations. Robert Downey Jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted Tony Stark/ Iron Man, and Chris Evans was brilliant as the confused, out-of-time Steve Rogers/ Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, the newbie of the cast, stepped into the role of Bruce Banner/ Hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability. On the other side, Tom Hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain Loki, whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywhere.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent, and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic.

The Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America movies were more enjoyable on their own. I thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together, but I think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didn't get a chance to understand any of them individually. Special effects were great, don't get me wrong, and the 3D was cool, but that wasn't enough to save the movie. Storyline was too stretched out. Underwhelming opening.

It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.<br/><br/>Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like ""IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,"" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left behind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so far. <br/><br/>Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I consider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.<br/><br/>To say anything more would be a waste of time. Just go and watch it."

","Six (super heros) versus one nemesis!! Otherwise usually it's one against one. The fact is this film is over-hyped and doesn't live up to what it claims to be nor does it complement the critics' excitement, which is to rave the first action movie of the summer - like a ritual and to be quoted in the ads. While watching I asked myself how many times have I seen done to death special effects like a gaping hole in the sky? The aliens raining and attacking New York? Technical jargon supplemented by devices and gizmos? Some huge contraption passing for a space station floating in the sky? And so much executed and projected before that I felt fatigued! The 3D effects are absent where they should have been in your face and more - like when the black widow holds the gun at a character and the nozzle is out of the frame! The cohesive factor, and which keeps it going is the (tongue in cheek) wit, which everyone is blessed with! So much so such dialogues appear to be out of a MAD satire! And to think of it when Thor knew Loki so well or his psyche, then why send for the other five?"
"hakrames","10","4","5","23 March 2018"," One of the best Superhero films to date
","""The Avengers"" is the first 'team up' movie for the MCU combining Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. Alongside with Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, and of course, The Hulk. To fight the maniacal and oddly comical in all the best ways, Loki, Brother of Thor and part Frost Giant. And this movie is everything you could ever think you would want in a super hero collaboration film. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon wrote and directed this film to perfection. With the team up of everyone being seamless and interesting with various conflicts throughout and the almost certain that they could never work together ever until the end. Each character feels used amazingly with comedy being brought in perfectly, drama at the perfect times, and a whole hell of a lot of action in this 143 minute film. With expanding on a lot of the small quirks of each character and the nail biting tension throughout the film done by the fantastic direction and great feel of this film. Joss Whedon put in all he could ever do in this film and executed it perfectly. <br/><br/>The writing by Whedon is also flawless. When I first saw this film in 2012, I honestly thought these actors were real with how fluent and smooth their dialogue was combined with the A+ acting done too by each and every cast member, even the 'one scene' actors shown throughout. Not a single actor had any opinion in the writing of the film and with solely Whedon writing it, you can see how well of a writer he is and how smooth he can make the conversations in this film. Especially my favorite parts of the dialogue are the small on going jokes throughout the film with each character, it brings the light out of some of the darkest scenes and can make each and everyone as memorable as possible. I remember quoting this film like it was a religious text or something with how well written it is. <br/><br/>The acting is once again perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays once again a flawless Tony Stark with either his smooth and slick execution of every line, to him hiding snacks throughout the sets to add to his quirky character that the audience has grown to love and appreciate in the film. New Comer Mark Ruffalo in the MCU also kills it as Bruce Banner/Hulk with his uneasy performance and social awkwardness too. Everyone else, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson also do amazingly with their roles with a smooth balance of comedy and seriousness in each of their scenes. The casting in this series is still flawless and I don't want to change a single cast member with their respective roles. <br/><br/>The Avengers is a fantastic movie that will be put down in history as one of the best superhero movies to ever exist and should deserve its popularity and praise for its technical accomplishment and storytelling milestone. <br/><br/>The Avengers gets a 10/10"
"hendry-robert","2","33","68","27 January 2013"," Dumbed down irrelevant nonsense
","Honestly, I like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in Willy The Wonka who has to have all the chocolate. <br/><br/>This production (sic) treats the entire audience as low IQ zombies (no offence to actual zombies intended). There is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest. At no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger. At no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm - well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes - obviously. And why even bother having humans with no super powers - Oh I forgot, the humans in it are the most magical, unbelievable fighting machines. They just stand there wasting anything in their path, and Im not talking about the super heroes here. Rambo is but a beginner compared to them.<br/><br/>Every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish. Its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win.<br/><br/>Technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental. The action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears (seriously) and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding. I'm sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy - but the reality is their mix doesn't translate well across systems. Bad sound isn't the problem, its the post mixing. I hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films.<br/><br/>The acting by some of the cast is decent, considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with. But in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years. This is a money and profile job - nothing more. Even then I do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it?. The directing is amateur hour. His/her (I don't know and don't care) focus is squarely on action and FX - so why not just have the FX team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job. I do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actors?<br/><br/>Anyway, I cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene, aimed at a dumbed down populace - then this is for you.<br/><br/>PS I cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews. I certainly smell a rat."

"kuckunniwi","1","38","80","25 February 2013"," IMDb ratings no longer reliable
","First of all, let me just establish the follow IMDb film ratings as a reference:<br/><br/><ul><li>A Clockwork Orange: 8.5 - Aliens (1986): 8.5 - American Beauty: 8.5 - Full Metal Jacket: 8.4 - Chinatown: 8.4 - Fargo: 8.2 - Donnie Darko: 8.1 - A Scanner Darkly: 7</li></ul><br/><br/>These are the kind of movies that get (and should get) 8+ ratings. They have real content. They're innovative, original, intelligent and thought-provoking. They're timeless classics.<br/><br/>But the comparison may not be too fair, being such different genres. How does it REALLY stand up to Batman Begins (8.3), Watchmen (7.6), or any of the X-Men series, none of which reached and 8? These are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target: comic-book fans, adrenaline-pumped teenagers and action-yearning males. Yet they are aeons away in terms of originality, depth, story and execution from 2012's The Avengers.<br/><br/>I don't really have much of a gripe with ""The Avengers"" itself, as after seeing Captain America, I expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster. Even so, it's pretty bad even for a fill-in-the-villain/superhero/threat formula movie. A ridiculous super villain, flat characters, no excitement (as you know how things are going to turn out)¬Ö<br/><br/>My disappointment is mostly with IMDb. I'd trusted their rating in the past, but it seems as if that reliability is no longer. Either all the reviews are now being written by 10-year-olds, IMDb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace, or something's pretty fishy¬Ö.<br/><br/>How many reviews that are titled things like ""Awesome! Blew my mind!"", or ""Coolest superhero movie ever!"", that you'd expect to be full of teenage adulation, grammatical mistakes and tons of slang, are actually very articulately written, displaying profound knowledge of script, direction, acting, and character analysis? I thought our education system was going down the drain! Where are all these lucid, eloquent, youths hiding out? And, being so instructed and discerning as they are, why the hell are they giving such a poorly made, mediocre movie such high scores?<br/><br/>It looks like the industry's eye has finally set on IMDb's viewer-decanting power, and is corrupting it's authenticity beyond recognition. From now on, I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for real, trustworthy reviews."

"chkadz","3","22","43","26 April 2016"," Utterly Formulaic and Totally Predictable. Way too Overrated!
","SHORT VERSION(Because of the IMDb word limit) Go here for the full version:-http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/id/974206291/ratings<br/><br/>Ah! The Avengers! How I hate this movie! It is overrated and over-popular beyond words and has nothing which makes a film great. The only things it has are good special effects and a nice soundtrack - factors which are only superficial in nature and cannot make anything good. It's story is filled with plot-holes and characterization and character development is below sub-par. The story doesn't even try to explore any themes and the whole thing is just one huge galore of special effects.<br/><br/>The visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing about the movie which is good. The explosions, spaceships, villains, weapons, Iron Man's suit, everything looks realistic and wonderful. Of course, that is to be expected with the technology of today. The sound section is also nothing to complain about. The sound amplifies the action and makes one excited about it. Other than that, I found it quite forgettable. The acting is decent. Robert Downey Jr. as always, speaks as fast as a cheetah runs which is why people who are not so great at English may need subtitles. Not that the things he is saying is deep or meaningful.<br/><br/>Now that I've finished with the good parts of the movie, I can now explain why the story and characters are s**t. I have already said that the story has zero innovation and is totally formulaic. The story is about the trademark superheroes fighting a villain bent on conquering the world with the power of a magical object. So original, right? The heroes find the villain who separates them but they come back together almost immediately and fight the villain and his huge army in a large metropolitan city. <br/><br/>Even if you have not seen the movie, you should be able to tell how the movie is going to end. As mentioned earlier, there are a large number of plot holes and plot conveniences. <br/><br/>And this movie was nominated for Best Writing in a particular award ceremony! In fact, one whole hour was spent in pointless battles and the destruction of a major city where only the ending mattered. The ending was a total cop out which saw the death of an entire army due the destruction of a single spaceship. Why? Because the movie has to end sometime! That's why! <br/><br/>Now that I've established how bad the story is, I will talk about the characters. It may seem that the movie has no need of character introduction and development as each character has a movie of it's own. This is partly true. However, the characters are STILL not developed. The Avengers include - a billionaire who fights in iron suit, a god, a soldier from the times of World War II and a scientist which can go Super Saiyan an becoming angry. How relatable!<br/><br/>In each of their respective movies, they have to fight a villain having similar powers as them (yes, they have similar powers) while building their romance with girl X. They do not face any other problem such as getting divorced, going bankrupt, etc. Any such problem will only be a backdrop. The end of the movie will see the villain defeated , the hero victorious and the hero and the girl in a strong relationship. The hero will not be seen in any other problem such as failure(except if they are fighting the villain for the first time), loss, change,etc. All problems mostly revolve the external force(i.e.the villain). This makes them completely unrelatable.<br/><br/>In case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie, The Incredibles had it's main character fired from his job and The Dark Knight saw Bruce Wayne's ideals being challenged. No such thing is seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>I'll admit that Iron Man and Thor had development. However, they were the only ones. The characters then developed into very similar archetypes. As individual movies, that was very good, but they were a part of a larger universe. Thus, characters being fully developed there was a bad thing because it finally made the characters (in the Avengers) quite boring as they were all good and had absolutely no bad qualities. The heroes were just 'good guys' and that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie. <br/><br/>The villains are mostly faceless mooks who are only there to cause destruction and be defeated by the heroes. It is not even known who they were. Loki ,on the other hand, is the best MARVEL movie villain. That's a great thing, right? No. No it isn't. He's just the best looking thrash in the garbage bin. Having more backdrop and personality makes him better than the rest of those idiots who were just there to be defeated by the hero.<br/><br/>And the s**t still doesn't end there! I can go on about how everyone's powers are broken (yes they are broken!) and how Loki was an idiot for keeping the main energy source on top of Stark Tower and how the heroes grieved over the death of a secondary character saying ""He never showed you his Captain America Vintage Card Collection"". That character too was bland beyond words and received no fleshing out or development (except maybe in the T.V. series)<br/><br/>VERDICT:-It's s**t and doesn't deserve any of the popularity it gets! The applause it deserves is for it's visual effects (which is the only thing for which it has gotten awards). Other than that, it is bad and I would not recommend it to anybody!<br/><br/>VISUAL SCORE=10/10 SOUND SCORE=8/10 STORY=2/10 CHARACTERS=4/10 <br/><br/>OVERALL=3/10 (I don't take the average of the above)"

Like when Batman and Buzz Lightyear climbed your parent's bookshelf, Godzilla splashed and murdered The Lego figures in the bathtub filled with foam, or when He-man saved Barbie from The Street Sharks? Well ... It must have been that kind of games that Joss Whedon was playing that made him think of this extremely embarrassing and bad idea of a movie.<br/><br/>The Avengers is the definition of what a bad American action movie produced in Hollywood is. I understand why Marvel emptied out the whole toy box when they made the comic in the 60's so children could have something to read when they pooped on the toilet so it stank mashed potatoes with spinach, but who comes up with the idea to make a movie today, in the beginning of the second millennium, which is about a soldier from the 40's waking up from a coma after several years, only to discover that The Hulk, Ironman and some damn archer wants to fight gangsters and monsters with him. And not to forget! a god from another planet with a big hammer. So what's the plot? Exactly, what is this movie about more than that all these famous cartoon characters meet each other and it's epic for the win? Apparently that they are going to stop the mischievous Loki and his alien army from enslaving humanity. Wow! That sounds almost as exciting as if Scrooge Mcduck built a large magnet which robbed humanity of all the money in the world and The Avengers were forced to team up with Donald Duck and his nephews. A movies like that would break the roof on Box Office in no time. Because that's what it's all about, to make money and sell more toys to children. If you want to see animated characters get together, you might as well see The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones or House of Mouse instead.<br/><br/>This is the worst and most embarrassing movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie was as disgusting as eating at McDonald's after a long road trip filled with vomit and radio music.

","Guess I expected more but shouldn't from a comic book company. I did think that much of the acting was above par and quite good in many instances. However, the poor relationship to obeying or at least extending the laws of physics was just inexcusable. I'll try to precisely explain my sentiments: 1) what's the logic in having an aircraft carrier fly? A runway on a ship that's supposedly capable of flying? If it's possible to make a ship like that fly, then wouldn't it also be possible to have other flying craft that don't need a runway? Get a scientist to review your scripts before hand!<br/><br/>2) The scant one-liners from Robert Downey, Jr's character were annoying at best. Guess he's an ADD/ADHD character trying to appeal to multitude of ADD/ADHD fans?<br/><br/>3) All the hand waving over and around computer screens reminded me of the bad attempt at impressing the viewer that occurred in ""Minority Report"" Make the hand waving meaningful and minimal. If those screens were really needed, then Dr. Banner/Hulk would have gotten some use/knowledge or gained something from all his hand waving over supposedly touch-sensitive screens. Yet, both he and Mr. Downey (and others) seems obsessed with waving their hands around - for what? <br/><br/>I did enjoy Samuel Jackson's character when he responded to the lame navigator's excuse ""the navigation system is reinitializing..."" and he says is the ""Sun up, then put it on your left"" That was the most genuine moment in the whole film.<br/><br/>I expected the superior plot and complexity of ""Thor"" but was sadly disappointed with an rehash of ""Independence"" style special effects and a lame story of alien invaders. <br/><br/>All this mediocrity probably didn't impact the title's earnings. I just won't be so enthused about catching a sequel. <br/><br/>Maybe worth a Netflix or video store rental but not a theater ticket!"

"MaximumMadness","9","19","37","7 May 2012"," ""The Avengers"" is finally here... There is no other way to say it: This film is AWESOME!
","For the past four years, Marvel Studios has been building a cinematic mythology based on their comic books, for the first time combining different franchises into a single canonical movie-universe. Starting in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", to 2010's ""Iron Man 2"" and finally last year's ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"", there have been five films building in anticipation to this result- the ultimate crossover experience. In addition to those four heroes, we are also given Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, bringing our team of heroes to about seven. (Although Fury isn't a direct player, so I suppose the team stands at six)<br/><br/>This movie had a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>It succeeded. By god, this was an awesome movie!<br/><br/>Directed and co-written by Joss Whedon, 2012's ""The Avengers"" is perfect payoff for fans who have been anticipating this film for over four years now.<br/><br/>Beginning with Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arriving at a SHIELD HQ, the Tesseract (the Asgard artifact used by Red Skull in last year's ""Captain America), which has been under lock-down for testing, opens a portal, allowing Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the outcast brother of Thor to arrive on Earth. He steals the Tesseract and uses his powers to brainwash several SHIELD members (including Hawkeye, portrayed by Jeremy Renner). It is revealed that Loki needs to the Tesseract to open a portal to allow an alien race to invade and conquer Earth.<br/><br/>Realizing they are in over their heads, Fury calls out to unite the three Earthly heroes- Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). After the team apprehends Loki, his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent back to Earth, completing our team.<br/><br/>When Loki escapes and is finally able to open the portal, the four heroes (joined by Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow and a redeemed Hawkeye) must band together, despite their differences, to defend the world in an ultimate battle.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is outstanding. This really begins with our four leads. There is no need to speak about Downey, he continues to play the role to perfection. Hemsworth and Evans also are given a lot of good material to work with. In particular Evans, who gives the character of Steve Rogers subtle pain and pathos this time around despite having to be strong. But the real revelation is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I thought both Eric Bana and Edward Norton had given fine, first-class performances. Particularly Norton, who really made the role his own in a big way. But Ruffalo surprisingly blows them both out of the water. He makes the role of Bruce Banner (and the Hulk thanks to motion-capture technology) his own, giving him humor and an incredible depth. Ruffalo is OWED his own Hulk movie now.<br/><br/>In addition the supporting performances are incredible. The gorgeous Johansson is given a lot more to do in this film, and she breaths a great life into Black Widow. To be honest, Black Widow was at times more compelling than our four leads, and Johansson proves once again to be a phenomenal actress. Clark Gregg reprises his ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" role as SHIELD agent Phil Coulson, and provides some great comedic moments, in addition to being the shady government type. Hiddleston is menacing and dark as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard and Gwenyth Paltrow return in small roles as Erik Selvig and Pepper Potts, and although their scenes are minor, both ground the film emotionally. The only slight problem I had was with Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. I will say, he gave a fine performance, but his role seemed... somewhat underwritten in comparison with everyone else. He felt a little too expendable a character and shoe-horned in. But Renner was still good in the role.<br/><br/>The script by Whedon (from a story he co-wrote with Zak Penn) is tight, concise and an absolute blast. There is a lot of humor (and I do mean a lot) and a ton of action, although it never feels forced, contrived or unneeded. As fantastical as the story is, it is grounded in it's own sort of reality and logic, and feels natural. This is an extremely well-written, fun and generally light-hearted film.<br/><br/>The visuals are a blast. Whedon's direction and camera placement is fun, kinetic and serves as a good companion piece to the other four directors who had previously helmed the individual films. The effects are outstanding. The sound design is great. The score by Alan Silvestri is fun and memorable.<br/><br/>This is just a competently made film, and a darned-fine piece of entertainment!<br/><br/>I will say that this isn't necessarily the best film in the series (I think the first ""Iron Man"" felt a tad more fresh and unique), but this is still an absolute blast, and you cannot afford to miss it on the big screen!<br/><br/>I give ""The Avengers"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10! Assemble in line at the cinema and see it, now!"
"fatal_coates","10","19","37","1 May 2012"," THE AVENGERS (9.5 out of 10)
","As AWESOME as expected. An immense lineup/casting, decent story and visuals that put Transformers blur to shame. Iron Man does take a fair chunk of the limelight, as expected (It felt like this was his third film, before that has even been released) but the others do get their fair share and have great entrances.<br/><br/>Oh..the movie is very funny!! Iron man starts off initially, but Hulk sees to it, that he gets the last laugh.. and his latter scenes do dominate the tail end (Mark Ruffalo does a pretty decent job) Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (seen briefly in Thor) makes Oliver's Green Arrow from DC, look pathetic. This movie along with his role in Mission Impossible 4 is definitely a precursor to his taking over the role as Bourne, and he's pumping up for that too.<br/><br/>Speaking of the muscles in the film. ""Cap"" appears to have lost weight?? Chris Evans must not be working out as much, but Thor seems to have taken over in the gym as he's even bigger. Hulk is obviously the biggest but thats what CGI does for you.. Oh, and Iron Man appears bulkier?? like his suit needs to compete??! Scarlett Johannsson's ass get's a cameo in this film, I wonder how she felt about the camera's angle in all the 3D glory in one scene..<br/><br/>Another new member to the cast, and good to see another Avenger's regular ~ Agent ""Maria Hill"" appears, played by a very fit looking Cobie Smulders (Robin from ""How I met your mother"" fame) She gets a fair chunk of the movie and action herself. Stellan Skarsgaard returns from Thor along with the villain most would have seen in the trailer, Loki. Potts & Coulson cameo.<br/><br/>The ""one on one"" battles of many of the heroes is a sight to behold and are really a delight to watch. You get to see them throw everything at each other as you see them match up their strengths and their weaknesses. Also watch for the Cap / Iron Man combo towards the end of the film, memories from the past! Loved the film. Will no doubt be seeing it again.. Check it out!"
"jrwilson7","9","19","37","27 April 2012"," Take note....fan boys CAN make decent films
","Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. <br/><br/>For those of you who don't know who this man is, he's been around a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films like Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to directing big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spin off movie, Serenity. But, this is Whedon's first big feature film, it's also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a long time coming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding it (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task. Each character has their own successful film franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.<br/><br/>In the first issue of the comic , the team are assembled to fight Thor's brother Loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction. Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.<br/><br/>The story is over the top, but not enough that you find yourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds, aliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedon's script is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, ""Let's dance"" as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes! The first act sees the assembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from Shield. Later Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for attention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage ‚Äì a lot of damage!<br/><br/>It is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.<br/><br/>The script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust ""fan boys"" with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of references to the ""prequels"" and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite. It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show (spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his ""I am a God"" speech, but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular. <br/><br/>At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, considering the scale and grandeur of the film's final act ‚Äì the near destruction of New York. Although there are hallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense, but doesn't get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.<br/><br/>The production flawlessly merges CGI and live action together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am surprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didn't pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.<br/><br/>I have long appreciated Whedon's film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many fans will appreciate, but most will miss.<br/><br/>The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.<br/><br/>This is the BEST comic book ‚Äì SUPERHERO ‚Äì film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by."

","Joss Wheddon can't direct, wish Jhon Favreau had been given the creative freedom he requested.<br/><br/>It makes X-men: The Last Stand look good, which is not a good compliment.<br/><br/>The cast is good, but the dialogue is terrible, interactions between characters are bad, people don't talk like real people, somehow all feel out of character, they talk like people throwing jokes to an audience which is painfully awkward to watch. Dangerously close to self parody territory, I refuse to believe parts of the movie happened.<br/><br/>Fails on having a plot of it's own. Also fails as a sequel to the previous movies, and If you were doing, a marathon I would tell you to skip this as somehow despite featuring so many characters the plot is irrelevant to all of them. <br/><br/>Half characters are portrayals is inconsistent to the previous movies: -Hulk has new actor and personality, the character is so rebooted it doesn't even feels like it happens in the same Cannon as the Hulk movie. -Loki goes from trying to become King by deceiving Thor out of Asgard, to making a genocidal killing spree on Earth (How does killing people on Earth helps him to become King Asgard? ANswer: It doesn't), Thor is told his brother kills people he says his bro is adopted (That's just awful dialogue, if Thor takes it as a joke, how am I supposed to take the movie seriously? There's no emotional conflict). -Captain America it's just there, but never does anything. -Ironman starts as a douche and by the end isn't, for the third time, the same transformation he experienced on Ironman 1, and also on Ironman 2. - The arrow guy is brainwashed, so he never really gets to talk, and the girl is a generic though token girl, that never gets developed.<br/><br/>Somehow the army on the climax, looks CGI paper weight, they don't even put up a fight, makes it seem like even a normal civilian could hit and destroy them, with such a weak evil army why even bother in the first place. There's no twist, no stakes, never anything feels at risk. The heroes have the upper hand through the whole movie, they win without never ever making any effort. The action is disappointing, because it's just stupid hits, no stunts, no creative fight set pieces.<br/><br/>The Dark Knight deserved the Oscar Nomination, given to this film, Ironman Armor, and Hulk look good, but the CGI Army looks fake generic awful.<br/><br/>If you watch it might entertain you, but movie is awful, if this becomes the future of Superhero movies, then the genre might die soon. <br/><br/>Feel free to disagree but I think, Avengers it's so overrated I do sadly think Disney paid critics."
"morefshpls","1","54","122","16 May 2012"," Kinda boring, no, yaaaawwwwn, very boring! Zzzzzzzzzzzz
","How I would love to have championed Joss Whedon for this. But alas, no.<br/><br/>The Avengers is not a great movie. Avengers is a boring movie.<br/><br/>OK, I saw it in 3D. The only other film I've seen in 3D was Avatar and - this may also indicate to you I'm not a movie snoot - I rather thought Avatar was OK, unlike many who say it's awful. You would be right therefore, to infer that the novelty of 3D hasn't exactly had a chance to wear thin on me yet.<br/><br/>Let's just get the 3D out of the way: for me, it was like watching a holographic projection, very unreal. Often there were only 2, maybe just 3 planes of focus and sometimes this made the focus too oddly focused!, e.g. a wobbling briefcase in the foreground that looked like something out of Toy Story. Also, some of the action with Johanssen is frantic CGI cartoony acrobatics, and in 3D this just looks even more of a mess, anything but exciting! I was cautioned not to see in 3D - that person was right. The print isn't compensated for by the darkening effect of the glasses. I think it affected me too. Eye-fatigue, plus the combination of how those glasses make the film so dark, plus a major major flaw in the film, caused me to give up on consciousness and spare my eyeballs more than once.<br/><br/>Yes, in 3D at least, this film is too dark to see what's going on. Detail becomes elusive and the 3D focus only allows you to see one or two parts of the screen - everything else is often deliberately way out-of-focus. This makes the film visually uninteresting (especially for us 'autistic' background viewers ;-).<br/><br/>And the major major flaw.. Oh, I might have already let that slip: this movie is boring! Surely I can't be so bored that easily by a film I've never seen before! It's impossible! Avengers: yes, there's some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me: yaaaawwn! Honestly, I was expecting to enjoy The Avengers, especially since I kinda liked the Thor movie (nothing to do with Portman, who does very little for me). And also, my total non-appreciation for The Avengers goes against what I'd hoped... that I could say something great about this film, and be able to champion Joss Whedon for a new era of Sci-Fi movies. Serenity was good, very good - albeit with forgivably TV-movie quality. Unfortunately, it seems, budget wasn't the limiting factor and I've now lost interest.<br/><br/>Duncan Jones, do you hear?"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","18","35","7 May 2012"," Believe in Heroes in ""The Avengers""
","Back on Earth through time and space, imperially arrogant god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) says, ""Freedom is the great lie¬Ö"" Thor's half brother will make the world his new kingdom. The brave souls, who stand in his path, are The Avengers. Director and Writer Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" convincingly assembles solo superheroes and super egos to battle Loki and his alien minions in one of the year's best movies. Think of Whedon as Coach Phil Jackson, but for superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. as brash Tony Stark threatens Norse god Loki, ""If we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it."" ""The Avengers"" is awesome.<br/><br/>The classic hero story requires a commanding villain, and that is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston is charismatic evil and sympathetic sadness. He evokes certain pathos for Loki, feeling betrayed by his foil half brother Thor, strong and compassionate Chris Hemsworth. Thor fights with all his might against his brother, out of love and honor. Blond maned and shredded Hemsworth balances aloof charm and conviction as Thor. Whedon's ""The Avengers"" is timelessly inspiring: We believe in heroes who believe in themselves and others and would sacrifice their lives for the noble and just cause. I think the captivating leads of ""The Avengers"" are Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Downey Jr. brilliantly hides beneath Iron Man's Tony Stark's cynical narcissistic veneer, a caring man wiser than his smart ass punch lines. Evans is surprising. Aside from looking amazingly chiseled he embodies in Steve Rogers (Captain America) a self doubting relevance, while the inspired leader emerges. His Rogers is the frozen super soldier who awakens 70 years later into a new war.<br/><br/>The cool Stark and the solid Rogers clash passionately. Stark mourns a fallen friend. Rogers asks if this is the first time he has lost a soldier. Stark screams, ""We are not soldiers!"" Whedon and Zak Pen's story is kinetically driven, with the foundation laid in character. Powerful egos and intentions must coalesce and foster value and respect‚Äîas some sort of functional family tasked with saving the world.<br/><br/>Whedon generates amazing performances, and infuses welcome wit and humor. To that end, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Director of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D., maybe the sinuous plot device. After making a career of cameos in previous Marvel superhero movies, Jackson fleshes out his bad ass Fury. He brings a refreshing gruff self awareness, after all The Avengers was his initiative so that these heroes would fight the fight we couldn't. However, is he the tough love patriot or calculated manipulator? Jackson cannily walks that fine line. Beautiful and idealist Cobie Smulders as loyal Agent Hill is Fury's social conscience. Stark, Rogers, and Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discern Fury's possible other motives shrouded in National Security.<br/><br/>Exiled Loki brokers an alliance with the warrior alien race, the Chitauri. The Chitauri will let him rule Earth, if he brings them the Tesseract (Hyper Cube). The Tesseract harnesses the power of the galaxy, and is mysteriously tied to both Thor and Captain America. Loki uses the Tesseract to escape exile and breach S.H.I.E.L.D. Obtaining Tesseract, he brainwashes brave Agent Hawkeye (solid Jeremy Renner). Loki has a grand scheme. Expert straight man Clark Gregg as reliable Agent Coulson must call upon the team to protect the world. Scarlett Johansson is hot and deadly as Agent Natasha (Black Widow). She dispatches Russian mafia captors with Muay Thai and jujitsu in Jason Statham like style. She heads off to Calcutta to find Dr. Bruce Banner, and his raging green alter ego The Hulk. Ruffalo adds an understated brilliance and goofy charm that humanizes. We really believe that he has made his peace and controlled the ""other guy"". Coulson calls upon Stark (Downey Jr.), who is in the midst of clean power sourcing his Stark Tower. Stark has a playful relationship with his partner Pepper Potts (funny and beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow). Too bad Paltrow isn't leveraged more in ""The Avengers"".<br/><br/>Of course assembling a bunch of super powered heroes is not immediate team building. Whedon orchestrates spectacular clashes amongst themselves. Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America battling in the dark forest is visually stunning. The Hulk taking on Thor is wild and strangely comical. The Hulk gets the prize for his cage match with evil Loki. The audience exploded in applause. Ruffalo is amazing. His casual nerd nicely bonds with Downey Jr.'s impatient genius. Renner as Hawkeye is solid and edgy, and plays nice. Johansson looks awesome in the black body suit. Even more impressive she shades the darkness and nobility of Natasha. She has a killer scene with Hiddleston at the story arc.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" delivers with the explosive visual spectacle as our heroes risk their lives battling the powerful aliens as they pulverize New York City. Whedon is masterful with the action and the characters. He makes us believe in heroes in ""The Avengers""."
"Avenger-Mike","10","18","35","25 April 2012"," Epitome of a Comic Book Movie
","**SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM**<br/><br/>So last night I attended the Australian premiere of ""The Avengers"" and yes, this was the most entertaining and impressively ""THORsome"" movie that I've ever seen. Like most comic book fans, I was looking forward to this since Nick Fury's appearance at the end of ""Iron Man"", so there was great hype and expectation. This movie is the epitome of a comic book being brought to life - the action scenes were surreal, the emotional content was tranquil, and somehow, Joss Whedon managed to add in a mere perfect story line and a charade of comedic lines for each of the amazing characters.<br/><br/>Sublime performances were put in by all the main actors, but special mentions must go to Mark Ruffalo, who in my opinion, played the perfect Bruce Banner (I was never a fan of Edward Norton - sorry), and Tom Hiddleston, who's Loki was devastatingly cruel and yet charming in the same manner. In the case of Banner, Ruffalo portrays him in such a way that we are reminded that there is a darker, more sinister side to this man than the calm and reserved doctor in the room. Of course Robert Downey Jr.'s presence is always felt on screen and nothing changes in this movie, as he delivers most of the hilarious dialogue (at one point he even recited Shakespeare while fighting Thor in the forest). <br/><br/>There is not one single dull or wasted scene in this movie, every single one has its purpose, whether it be filled with witty dialogue or explosive action. An example of the aforementioned dialogue: Thor: ""Loki is beyond reason, but he is my brother"" Black Widow: ""Your brother just killed 80 people in the last two days"" Thor:"".....he's adopted..."" At which point everyone in the cinema erupted with laughter. Of course my favorite was Thor, who engaged in an intense battle with the Hulk on board the Helicarrier.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""The Avengers"" takes us on a roller coaster ride, through emotional highs and lows of all the characters. One of the interesting components was seeing how members of the team would react when they were in the same room, and the portrayal of ego clashes did not disappoint. SPOILER ALERT: It takes a while for the dynamics of the Avengers to settle, catalyzed by the death of Agent Coulson. But once they assemble, the ending action sequence is simply awe-inspiring. The Hulk proves there is nothing he cannot smash (including Loki), Chris Hemsworth's Thor gave most of the audience a massive ""THORgasm"" by summoning all that thunder and lightning from Mjolnir, Captain American/Black Widow/Hawkeye more than hold their own against a formidable foe, and Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man steals the show by proving that he is a team player and sacrificing himself to nuke the portal of the Chitauri. <br/><br/>And what Avengers movie would be complete with that circling camera shot of the team preparing for battle while standing in a back to back formation, with Iron Man initially hovering over them. The background music made that moment PERFECT. If I did have one complaint, it would be the lack of background narrative showing how Thor returns to earth, although Loki does deduce that Odin must have conjured dark magic for Thor to return. However, the mid-credits scene was mind-blowing, revealing Thanos as the mastermind behind Loki's invasion and setting up a possible storyline for ""The Avengers 2"". In conclusion, this was one of, if not the best movies that I have ever seen. Thanks for reading and enjoy the movie!!! =]"

","Not much to say about this one that hasn't been said millions of times before. Brilliant comic-based movie that is, for me personally, the second best Marvel movie ever made, right behind Howard the Duck (kidding, kidding the first Iron Man film obviously). Joss Whedon further proves, as if any more evidence was needed, that as a writer/director he's amongst the top of his field. This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films. Bruce Banner is the stand out, but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments, save for Hawkever whom is woefully underused and I hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut.But really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between. Loved this film."
"ThomasMagnumPI","Null","21","42","22 April 2012"," Great Movie and Easily the New King of the Genre
","Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was anything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe it's because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case, EVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good. If you define those films as good then you'll define Avengers as great. It's a unified step up and I didn't think that possible. What's also amazing is that I think this movie works without having seen any of those other films. Then, the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didn't care about the other movies. The depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe. What they've done is transcend any other of this genre's films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with Oscar caliber performances. Again, easily the new king of the genre."

","The 21st century has seen more superhero movies than I can count. This year alone has already seen ""Black Panther"". I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. ""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.<br/><br/>It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London""). I'd like to see a crossover between this movie and John Landis's horror movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's not the ultimate masterpiece, but undeniably fun."

I loved Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and the 2008 Hulk, so I knew Hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw Avengers. Tony Stark was just flat out hilarious. 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was not the greatest Marvel movie. I still liked Cap. America, but I just thought it was too in the 40's (kind of boring). I loved the Thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene (like the Avengers). The Avengers tops every Marvel movie I've ever seen and I can't wait for the September 25th Blu-ray/DVD release! I LOVE THE AVENGERS!! It might be hard for The Dark Knight Rises to top this film."

But Mr. Whedon knew what he wanted from the story and has clearly demarcated his territory.<br/><br/>This has to be the best superhero movie till date. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man / Stark) has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery, Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is, well, strong and manly, Chris Evans (Captain America) has acted like a true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between all the action and a surprise, Hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too, for a delightful change. I really think Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk) is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and excitement to this amazing roller coaster of a movie.<br/><br/>I delightfully give this a 10 out of 10 (I hope there was a 11 possible) for allowing me to witness a 2 and a half hour roller coaster, without a break!!!<br/><br/>Watch it, if you want to know how Superhero movies should be!"
"Joshua_Barry","10","17","33","26 April 2012"," A Perfectly Crafted Super Hero Movie
","So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They don't exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up, starting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has been a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this point.<br/><br/>For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at the bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life character who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With a great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a great cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was not quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture. Captain American, as a movie didn't work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not enough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach, I was quite bored by the end.<br/><br/>Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With the much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a gigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the above and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and 'the other guy'. The special effects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings. With the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not quite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outing.<br/><br/>The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and this really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon constantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a perfectly made comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel from Marvel! Go Joss!! filmnotion.com"

","With a simple plot, each character gets to shine (brilliantly) and despite all the previews there's still plenty of wit and action to keep you grinning from beginning to end. It's an incredible feat that Joss and all the team have pulled this movie off. There's one very minor little criticism, where two scenes noticeably seemed to cut off the characters heads.

","Reading the other reviews, it seems everyone is quite excited about this movie.

Considering that Joss Whedon wrote this, I have to say I'm quite disappointed by the result.

","This is worth at watch but just once. The I wouldn't watch this again. Sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesn't help a weak story.<br/><br/>This screenplay is weak - it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads. The weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason. It just felt a bit contrived and isn't very involving. Don't feel for any of the characters.<br/><br/>There is some wit and humor from Scarlett's deadpan Black Widow and Robert Downey's rather lame one liners. <br/><br/>What happened to the charm of the old action hero movies?"
"OneMovieLover","7","20","41","2 August 2012"," Mostly entertaining popcorn-flick with amazing action; not much else
","'The Avengers', first of all, is a good movie. While sometimes overlong, it's entertaining, and the action scenes are amazing. However, it doesn't have enough depth to be another one of those ""classic superhero films"". The reputation instead should be ""enjoyable superhero flick"". First off, if an effort is made to assemble all of MARVEL's Avengers, that effort must be made with a little more success than this. <br/><br/>'The Avengers' ends up feeling like more sequel than spin-off, instead of studying and developing each character. If we're supposed to care about all these superheroes...give them noticeable differences, more display of emotions, and a distinctive background. Just because they're superheroes who have some funny one-liners doesn't mean the viewers will automatically think they're the best people who ever lived. In other words, the characters have too little depth. Something that bugs me is that a few people have been saying this is better than Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, yet the latter is a perfect example of a series of films that have greatly influenced (and perhaps even transcended) the superhero genre. <br/><br/>In 'The Dark Knight' there wasn't a single character who was ""just there for nothing"". Meanwhile, Loki is an uninteresting villain and doesn't hold a candle to Heath Ledger's disturbing, brilliant portrayal of The Joker (who, on the other hand, actually seems like a villain even when he's just not doing anything). How come 'The Avengers' all have to work to defeat Loki and his army, while Hulk can simply toss him around like a plastic spoon? That said, the long action sequence where the assembled Avengers all defeat Loki's army is quite outstanding, and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part. <br/><br/>It contains amazing cinematography, like a minute-long shot that steadily observes each Avenger and sees how they're doing with the aliens. Of course, the rest of the action scenes are also top-notch, considering there's fighting for most of the movie. The sequence with Black Widow running away from The Hulk is especially memorable, and displays arguably the most likable Avenger here, along with Iron Man. The two that we care the most about.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that 'The Avengers' could have been cut about 20-30 minutes short to flow more as a superhero film. I had hoped for more character development, since there were so many characters to pay attention to. I loved the action, and was pleased with the clever action scenes, especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with Black Widow. It's undeniably entertaining, and while it's not transcendent and genius, it's a great popcorn-flick. Would I see it again? Yes, but not my #1 priority."
"Staffenburgen","4","20","41","22 July 2012"," A Disappointing Waste of Talent
","Immediately after watching The Avengers, I was confused. All of my friends seemed to love it, the theater roared its approval as the credits rolled, and most of the reviews I've read are overwhelmingly positive. For these reasons, I'm not entirely sure I watched the same movie as everybody else, but I'm perfectly willing to comment on what I saw. <br/><br/>The film opens with Loki stealing the Tesseract, an all powerful energy device that poses a significant threat to Earth's security. Thankfully, Nick Fury assembles the ""Avengers"", the group of superheroes who are the focus of the film. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Mark Ruffalo all reprise their roles of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Incredible Hulk, while Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner portray the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Every single one of these characters (Loki included) is entirely one-dimensional and frankly, boring to watch. With the possible exception of the Hulk, they are straight-forward, flawless superheroes, who have absolutely no trouble dispatching anyone who crosses them. This makes the prolonged action sequences particularly difficult to watch; you never doubt who is going to prevail. <br/><br/>As for the central story of the film, it is a complete mess. It's an action movie in the truest sense of the word; every aspect of the plot is twisted to encourage more fighting sequences, which really prevents the film from moving forward at all. The story doesn't provoke further thought in any way, and really just serves to provide mindless action and downright terrible dialogue. In particular, Downey Jr. relentlessly delivers sarcastic insults every few minutes, which just aren't that funny (in my opinion). Once or twice, I found it amusing, but by the end of the movie I was sick of it. The other characters aren't much better, with the exception of Thor, who had a few funny moments. <br/><br/>Despite everything I have said, there's no criticizing how the film looks. The CGI sequences are stunning, and the various locations in the film are visually pleasing. It doesn't break any new ground, but it's still entertaining. <br/><br/>Overall, this is not a good movie. The characters are flat, static, uninteresting people portrayed by uninspired actors. The story is atrocious and riddled with holes. The action sequences are painfully long and predictable. And perhaps worst of all, when it was trying so hard to be funny, it simply wasn't. <br/><br/>Looking at all the names that contributed to this movie, I am frankly shocked at the finished product. Joss Whedon is a brilliant director and writer (I loved Firefly), and most of the actors (particularly Downey Jr., Renner, and Ruffalo) are usually enjoyable. So I'm not quite sure where everything went wrong, but hopefully they can produce a more thoughtful sequel with their next efforts. <br/><br/>RATING: 4/10"
"brefane","4","20","41","9 June 2012"," Passable time and brain cell killer.
","Loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through. Likewise, the conflict and plot don't really seem to matter, and there is no tension, suspense or pacing. Each scene is on same level as the one before; you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order. This thing totally lacks momentum. The expensive cast does well enough, but the film's length and one-dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing. The Avengers is not particularly recommendable, nothing about it is memorable or original and it's not a film I feel any need to revisit. It's a passable time killer; nothing more."

","Avengers Assemble is a big budget summer blockbuster that's action packed & perfectly cast, it's so Awesome to see these heroes we all grew up loving on screen together in a big adventure fantasy Thriller!!!<br/><br/>Avengers has the right amount of seriousness & light humour, the action scenes are Awesome!!!
It's amazing seeing Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron man together fighting side by side & we also have the Awesome Hawkeye & Black Widow joining the fight.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, we have the legendary Samuel l Jackson as Nick Fury the guy who Assembles the Avengers when a threat against earth rises.
Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers aka Captain America he's my favourite of the Avengers team & one of my favourite Marvel characters ever along with The Punisher & Daredevil.
Evans has the perfect balance of lost & weary old school soldier & also in control tough & confident leader when needed, he's a fantastic complex character.
The whole cast is perfect though, Thor is fun, tough & loyal & that's down to a great performance from Chris Hemsworth!!!
Robert Downey Jr is perfect as rich guy super hero Iron man, he's playful, funny & super smart it's a fantastic performance.
Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the big mighty incredible Hulk, another perfect performance bringing nice guy scientist Bruce Banner to life & the big green beast within.
The absolutely beautiful Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as extremely tough & super smart Black Widow, she's extremely Dangerous & extremely brave.
Also we have the excellent marksman Hawkeye played perfectly by Jeremy Renner who is probably my 2nd fave character after Captain America, Hawkeye is a Cool, tough & loyal warrior.
This first Avengers film is truly OUTSTANDING!!!
A big piece of pure fantasy entertainment & a near perfect super hero film.
Director Joss Whedon is a Genius, he writes this BRILLIANT stuff & directs it."
"nirome","10","2","2","26 April 2019"," Best Superhero team up movie to date
","And that is all mostly due to all the previous ground work laid out by Marvel Studios. Pay attention, Warner Bros!!. This is how it's done!! . In order for this to work, some character development has to be put into place in the form of stand-alone movies giving the chance to each and every one of the team's member characters to shine and for us, the audience, to get to know them. Whether all these stand-alone movies have been up to snuff or not, is irrelevant. What it is relevant, is that the audience has had a chance to know them and therefore, care about what happens to them. And in that, this movie excells. Not only are all the characters given a chance to shine, but it also shows what a talented group of crew members and director can achieve when all the stars align. Very well written story, strong performances, an epic score by Alan Silvestri, state-of-the-art special and visual effects and a very fast, but not one bit rushed, pace, make this the best Avengers movie to date. Great entertainment."

"educallejero","10","2","2","10 April 2019"," Game changing (at least for about 10 years)
","Even if the movie, the story, wasn't that great, this movie changed cinema (for better or worse), creating a path to serialized ""event"" movies, all ""important"" to have the whole picture of the insane 23 movies arc of the Avengers. Without this movie being this fun, well paced and put together, we wouldn't have the MCU.<br/><br/>And it pretty much delivered on what it promised. Without the need to introduce the main characters, the movie ditched the typical structure and started with a bang to never slow down, really. With action from the start, connecting every single character already presented (the six heroes, their recruiter, the villain). The movie assumed we all knew the characters because we saw the other movies (making them literally a ""must watch"" to savior all the details and enhance the experience), which was the best decision ever. They didn't follow the rules (they created their own, which will be become stalled later) and made the best possible ensemble movie.<br/><br/>But it wasn't just pure action, because with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they started (and would continue in the next movies) their philosophical (lightly philosophical, but still) exploration of war against an exterior threat. And they still managed to give the others moments to shine (if not really arcs of their own). Thor and Hulk with their powers; Black Widow's smart spy mind; Fury's uniting the team, etc.<br/><br/>The action is insane and the CGI ridiculously perfect. Loki is perfect for a first villain and the dialogue is funny with the needed exposition done well.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the second act could be better and parts a bit too childish or just stupid (Loki vs. Hulk; Hulk ""I'm always angry""; Hulk vs. Thor). But ultra minor things. Amazing movie."
"ezrahugereview","10","24","51","15 April 2012"," The Avengers - Better than The Dark Knight?
","The Avengers has been in development for years. Ever since I saw Iron Man for the first time and saw that after credits sequence for the first time, I knew something huge was about to happen. Now four years later, it is finally happening. Marvel brought together Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to form the Avengers. The film is written and directed by Joss Whedon who is known to be a legend with TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Angel, and Dollhouse. Now this has been my most anticipated film of 2012 for a long time and every trailer has gotten me more pumped than the previous one. Well, I finally saw it at the New York IMAX 3D fan screening (one of 10 that was being held across the country) and I have to say that I may make some bold statements in this review, but I fully believe in them. The Avengers is gonna be a really tough film to beat for not just the best superhero film of the year, but the best film of the year in general.<br/><br/>I really have nothing but praise for The Avengers. It's everything that I wanted it to be and more. After four years of following Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, Marvel and Joss Whedon brought everything full circle for whats sure to be a critical and financial success. It's funny, emotional, a visual spectacle, and just everything that makes a perfect superhero movie. I cannot wait to go see it again on May 4th.<br/><br/>Overall, I give The Avengers an A+"
"MartinHafer","7","14","27","12 May 2012"," The world loves it, though I still think the original ""Iron Man"", ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" were my favorites.
","At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth..."
"batleh","4","16","32","27 May 2012"," No Fun for a Non-Fan
","As someone who has not read Marvel comics, has not seen the films ""Captain America,"" ""The Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" or ""Iron Man II,"" this film failed to pull me in. As a standalone movie, ""The Avengers"" feels like a mishmash of rapid surface-level character introduction and way too much action. Little attention is given to character development, as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with a degree of knowledge. <br/><br/>However, this is not to say that I think the film would be great if I did have some knowledge of the backstory. There's little in the way of a moral here or a deeper meaning, as this is just a good-GUY-saves-world plot. It's one that (like many superhero movies before) makes me ask if character development or THOUGHT, for that matter, really are being extinguished by money-driven action. I wouldn't even call this a ""popcorn movie,"" as I found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience. <br/><br/>I like action movies, but I need to be drawn in to the characters in order to CARE about the action. ""The Avengers"" didn't even try to draw me in, it just said ""here are the heroes, now watch them fight!"" If the first hour had established some human element for the heroes, I might have liked the action. As it stands, the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants, and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility. I must ask - why should I care about action when one side can't lose and I haven't been told otherwise? Why should I root for the Yankees? (The only reason I can see is because the ""bad guy"" Loki wears a ridiculous looking costume). <br/><br/>I keep attempting to find redemption in society's reception of this movie. Maybe that's why I hope that I'm just missing a big part of the backstory. I'm a big Whedon fan, and came into ""The Avengers"" hoping to see some more of his magic. I was rewarded with a two-and-a-half hour snooze fest of CG action. My only sincere hope is that the millions he makes off of this movie funds ""real"" projects of his in the future."

I admit, the first time i saw this movie in theaters, i was having a blast and enjoying it very much. However, the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second watch. The film is centered around Loki(played by Tom Hiddleston), who wants to take over the world, while the avengers work out their ways to stop him. It is as generic and lazy as it sounds. The film barely has any story or even character development/interaction. It's nothing but one liners and action. None of the characters have a defined personality. Tony Stark is a one dimensional clown, Thor is has the charm of a wood that speaks in a Shakespearean way, black widow and hawkeye are nearly the same, only their gender are different. Hulk has his moments, and captain America is one of the most boring comic book characters i have ever seen in this movie. It's basically a Michael Bay movie minus the women objectifying, but same level of obnoxious and out dated film making. One of the most overrated trash movies i have ever seen.

","My view on this movie is very simple. This movie is kind of a sequel to other Marvel movies. Avengers is a movie that brings 4 Marvel heroes together and they combine their supernatural powers to defeat the enemy. To get full effect of this movie the viewer must have watched 2-3 of the characters movies separately to get a view of the character and what their powers are. I would recommend this movie to all age groups, its a movie the family will love on a Friday night out. I would also say this film is a 'feel good' film, this is because as the ending of the movie turns out so well, the stress of the dilemma in the movie calms down at the end and leaves a triumph' feeling at the end. This movie would not be recommended to people who don't enjoy a fantasy theme. But it would be recommended to people who understand the powers they have. <br/><br/>My opinion of this movie is that it is one of the best films i have seen,(i've seen a lot of movies) it is also a movie that can be watched over and over again. I don't have complaints about this movie other than its a very fast pace movie. I would recommend you all to see it in 3D or if you've missed it at the movies to buy it and make the most out of it because movies like these, don't come around a lot!!!<br/><br/>Hope I helped, My regards to all, Yash Ahmed"

It wasn't interesting at all, fell asleep at least 3 times while watching it. In fact these moments of sleep/ half sleep are the moments I will remember best when thinking back of The Avengers. I like looking at movies a lot and can enjoy very different genres and qualities, but falling asleep while watching is something I usually don't or cannot do. So this movie -especially in its genre- must be a complete failure. <br/><br/>What do I remember after a few days? A bad guy that really wasn't scary, some super heroes that had to fight together to stop that bad guy (and some more I guess), some images of them being on a space ship, and that's it! That's all! <br/><br/>What about the end? I'm sure I was awake at that moment of time but I simply can't remember. It could have only been the heroes winning the battle but how and where? I think they saved the earth and have been trying hard to do so, but at least it happened without any unexpected or original idea. So for this movie, there is even no chance of writing a review that contains spoilers! What could possibly be there to spoil?

Than Loki saying something and gets interrupted by the Hulk who smashes Loki into the ground afterwards saying ""puny god"" was another exact replica off the comic book hero I so love and enjoy. Just seeing this in that movie made the movie 8 out of 10. The two extra stars was cause the rest of the movie was just brilliantly put together, with the mayhem, the jokes, the storyline, the depths of most characters! Yes, I know people wanted to see more depths in the storyline, but come on, you got 6 Avengers with all different stories, the villains who have there story, and you need to make a movie that isn't to long to let it stretch to much, but still contain every ingredient to make it a good movie. No, not a good movie, an excellent movie, like a true superhero movie should be. Don't compare this movie to other superhero movies!!! There you only have 1 character and 1 villain to explain and rest is story. Compare this when you saw the previous story lines of the main characters. So watch Iron Man 1 and 2 and The Incredible Hulk (with Edward Norton, not as good as Mark Ruffalo, but you will know the background better for The Avengers) and Thor and Captain America first! You will have enough knowledge to see this movie and rate it excellent. Don't go here to expect a high intelligence movie or rate it with The Dark Knight (who was good, but stand alone and DC comics, not Marvel, different studios, different styles!). Im waiting for The Dark Knight Rises, cause I love those movies as well and the comics and Hulk and Batman are my two out of three most favorite heroes.

I was happy the movie ended, all around me there were people applauding and telling each other what an awesome movie they just saw. My plan was just to go home and put on a real movie. With plot twists and character development, both things I missed in the avengers. You could say it's fast paced but if the story doesn't grab you by the balls, it's all irrelevant. The only thing the movie had going for itself was that it was hilarious, to bad it didn't mean to be. <br/><br/>I knew after five minutes that the movie wasn't going to live up to the hype. And it was only downhill from there to be honest. The last sequence was the worst in my book. The alien invasion was so stupid, we were all wondering what was going to come through the black hole. And what came to wipe out all of humanity? A few hundred Chitauri, wow... is that an invasion? Six avengers got their stuff together and mobbed the floor with them. That was a huge anti-climax!<br/><br/>I think this movie is very overrated and only worth a view if you're tired and want some brainless 'entertainment', other than that it really is only for the comic book geeks. And maybe teenagers who've been brainwashed with years of Asian (fighting) cartoons. Oh yeah, the movie I watched when I got home was snatch!"
"hardcoreconkerfan26","6","12","23","18 January 2013"," A Big Super Hero Fan Setup
","This movie was simply 6 letter's in 1 word, ""Boring"". Why you may ask? Well, it's best to start from the beginning. <br/><br/>I was expecting a great movie featuring several different superhero in 1 screen, I was so hyped that I got as many friends as I can to see it but some couldn't go so I only invited a few. God the movie was so hyped that there was a huge line and I mean huge and all of those people were gonna go see the same film that I was gonna see. So once I walked in and waited for almost 20 minutes for the movie to start, that is when the big disappointment began. Such a boring introduction and lame character revilement. No creativity, no second thought, no built up, nothing. Feels more like an introduction to Jersey Shore and Transformers than an actual Marvel Film. But I got to admit, the begging scene where Thor's brother appears reminds me of halo (atleast the first one) so that's pretty cool but too bad the scene itself sucked no matter what. The other negatives that made this film a disappointment is the lack of any real character imitations. Thor brother was the prime example of this along with the childish predictable jokes you hear from them. The acting and written for Thor's brother was pathetic and pointless that without he's mighty powers he's nothing but a wimp or the actor himself was just a wimp from the beginning. He looks to be about 50 years old and doesn't resemble any appears of Thor what's so ever, all they do is just put on the costume and that's it. So what about the clich√©d jokes I mentioned? Well, there stupid, childish, out of place for a movie that is suppose to be quality entertainment (then again it was terrible and nothing new) and once you hear the first joke, you will automatically know that all the jokes will be the same kind of thing threw out the whole movie. I will admit that I did laugh at some moments but it struck me to be unpleasant and very lazy for a movie like this or any other. In fact, I was so bored and unpleased that I wanted to leave right when black widow appears cause it was so boring. But I didn't cause I wouldn't want to hurt my friends's feeling's that I invited them to a movie and wanted to leave once we began watching it. So I stayed and watched the rest of the movie. It took about half of the movie just so all of heroes can appear and an interesting note I might add is that Edward Norton who played as Bruce Banner in the incredible hulk (2008) was replaced when I was expecting him to be in it. So I was disappointed with that cause he was great as Bruce Banner. The ending climates with the avengers and Thor's Brother was lame as well. Sure some of the action is cool but some other action scence suck and it used special/sound effects from transformers and that sucks. When I think of action from the avengers I would predict it to be Dragon Ball Z without energy waves or teleportation. But no it just felt dull. So, what I did I really think of the movie overall? Well, to put it short and bluntly this is what I said in my mind when the movie ended ""THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!! WHAT A SETUP FROM MARVEL TO DISGRACE SUCH HEROES THAT WERE GOOD TILL THIS MOVIE CAME OUT! MARVEL MUST OF KNEW THAT A WHOLE BUNCH OF MARVEL FANBOYS WERE GONNA GO SEE THIS MOVIE CAUSE IT HAD THEIR FAVORITE HEROES IN ONE BIG SCREEN! NOT A SECOND THOUGHT ON HOW IT WILL PLAY OUT, ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS WHO'S IN IT?! Wow, what a waste of money and time I wasted on such a worthless movie like this. FIRST THEY RUINED SPIDERMAN AND NOW THIS?! WHAT A SETUP!."" That's how I really felt like when I finished watching this movie. And you want to know what was the saddest part about it is?! A bunch of people said it was amazing and the best movie of the year! B******! Worst movie of the year you mean! And worst super hero movie I've ever seen in general. I recommend you all take my advice and don't waste your time on such dread cause it's not worth it. Don't Listen to what to the people who liked this movie cause they're only saying it cause there just so depended on Marvel that they think anything with their superhero will be good. At this point and on I don't really like Marvel at all anymore. The Avengers ruined it for me. Time to official move on to DC like everyone else would do. And the ones who haven't, wake up and see reality that your pointless Marvel Heroes are Zeros. My god this movie was so Bad when I think about it I feel embarrassed that I sat down and really watched the whole movie and didn't leave right when I felt like going to sleep like everyone else would. But I give this movie a 3/10 just because the beginning reminded me of Halo. But besides that the movie itself was so incredible boring and very unoriginal, don't forget it was predictable too. In fact when I was watching half of the movie I completely forget what the plot was really about. Another thing is that the movie feels more like a sequel to Thor than actual teamed up superhero movie. So, don't see The Avengers but go watch The Dark Knight Rises instead. That was a far better movie than The Avengers. Thanks for reading and I hope you take my advice. Good Bye, Your gonna need it."

","Boy, am I in trouble. Because I thought it was just plain silly.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I haven't seen Thor. Because I found Tom Hiddleston so ludicrously miscast as Loki that I couldn't maintain suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>First, this deity who arrives in an awesome burst of netherworld energy, and carries a scepter capable of slaying whole armies, has to escape sitting awkwardly in the back of a pickup truck for God's sake. And then when he stands up in his silly horned costume and tells a crowd of people to kneel to him, his complete lack of gravitas in the role just set me laughing.<br/><br/>I couldn't watch it after that."
"Robosk","6","12","23","21 August 2012"," Not that good
","I have never reviewed anything here on IMDb but after watching the Avengers for the second time I just felt the need to say something. <br/><br/>Very well, after watching the Avengers in the cinema you don't reflect very much of the bad things, it's all special effects and 3D stuff going on. But after watching this alone at home, I just felt it's not that good. The story is clich√© as many has mentioned, but I felt that there are a few things that are unclear.<br/><br/>I just can't figure out how strong are the asgardians, they are supposedly demi-gods. Still the hulk threw Loki around like nothing, I just felt that scene was unnecessary. I don't want the bad-guy to look so crappy. I just couldn't take Loki seriously he got tossed around a lot. Don't get me wrong I enjoy some of the humor added to this film, it's just sometimes it's not timed right it just seems wrong to me.<br/><br/>The most annoying part about The Avengers is that the Bad Guys didn't stand a chance. And I didn't like Loki for being a bad guy again."
"musback","2","14","28","27 August 2012"," Special effects for special people.
","Where to start. Me and my wife watched this movie yesterday, to forget about the drama called 'battleship' (don't get me started.) But it's hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two. This one had some okay jokes in it, but like many people said: you don't feel any threat, you don't feel any story, you just see special effects and ""UHMERICA F* YAA"" 2hrs straight. The effects were good, and the Hulk smashed like he never smashed before, but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die. (Lord Of the rings anyone?) and when legions of 10x more bad-ass alien monsters are killed throwing a chair at them or blind-aimed headshotting them with a bow on a spaceship going 300mph, you know you're just wasting your time. Anybody with the very least amount of self-respect, stay away from this movie, How this garbage achieved to get 8.6 on IMDb is more entertaining for me than watching that movie. Says a lot about IMDb and what it has become compared to what it used to be."

","OMG Scarlett Johansson looks good in tight black pants!! OK, enough of that. This is as good a translation of comic book to film as any of us are likely to see - ever. Each of the actors chosen for the roles draws their character on like a glove, and the fit is perfect. This is what separates The Avengers from most other movies in this genre - the characters have depth, their interaction with each other is real and eminently believable, and the willful suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this type of movie is so effortless as to be unnoticeable. The CGI effects are spectacular, as is to be expected, and kudos to the designers for some really over-the-top bad guys and hardware. If I have one minor quibble, it is that I wanted more from Colbie Smulders as agent Hill. Her screen presence is so intense that I kept waiting (and wanting) more from her than to just be Samuel Jackson's aide-de-camp. Ah well, maybe next time."

"Anurag-Shetty","10","14","28","27 April 2012"," What's better than a superhero movie? A movie with six superheroes of course! The Avengers, is a masterpiece!
","Could anyone imagine that the likes of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), & Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) would come together for a movie?! Well they do, in The Avengers! The movie opens with a bang, as Loki(Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and wreaks havoc at the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters. Loki steals the Tesseract, an energy source of unlimited potential. He puts Professor Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard) & Hawkeye under his control & leaves with them. After the incident at the headquarters, Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) decides that he has to reignite the Avengers Initiative, a project that had been canceled, only recently. In comes Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form The Avengers. First, she recruits Bruce Banner aka the Hulk who, until then, had been hiding in Calcutta, India. S.H.I.E.L.D needs Banner to check the potential of the Tesseract. The new recruit is Captain America who had been frozen for quite some time(these events took place in Captain America: The First Avenger) & woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years. After that, S.H.I.E.L.D recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Thor joins the gang shortly thereafter. However, before the team can take on Loki, the heroes have to solve their personal issues & cut down their giant egos & work together as a team. Problematic? Yes! Iron Man's sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation. The way he makes fun of the others is hilarious! <br/><br/>First off, I want to say something. The Avengers is the best movie of the year, so far! Be it the story, the superhero vs. superhero battles, or the sheer epic scale of the film. Loki, is the perfect super villain who is, evil & menacing. The 3D effect in this movie is just eye popping! You will literally duck down every ten seconds. The cinematography is brilliant. The way they've shown Calcutta is authentic. The battle in New York City is outstanding! A note on the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Iron Man is my most favorite character in the film. Chris Evans is impressive as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is great as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is simply wicked as Loki. Even though he's the only villain in the movie he's pulled it off superbly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill & Stellan Skarsgard as Selvig are superb as well. So, grab your 3D glasses, buy some popcorn, sit back & relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times! Don't miss this on the big screen no matter what people! Now, let's see if The Amazing Spider-Man or The Dark Knight Rises top this one. The bar has been set very high though!"

","This is an OK film. There are some good things, some awful. But this is by far the most overrated movie of all time. Characters The characters are good. I didn't attach to them even though I had seen lots of the other MCU movies. The performances are good but nothing amazing. RDJ is good as Iron Man but I just don't like the character. I didn't care about any of them and Coulsons death was boring and I didn't care for the character.<br/><br/>Villain Loki was good but not great as a villain. He is by far a good villain but isn't very threatening which is the main point of the villain. He wasn't even a threat until the Chitauri turned up and they could have been taken down by the army. Plot This is the main reason that this is overrated. It has no plot. It is very simple but still has plot holes. The main threat of the movie is actually very easy to take down so the Avengrrs aren't needed whatsoever. They could have been defeated but the army and if they were a threat to the world why didn't they even make it past ONE CITY. Most of the time plot holes are created by us not thinking right and using common sense but these plot holes are gigantic. Summary What I liked: characters, villain, effects and action What I disliked: plot, music and villains army. Overall this is very overrated and so it gets a: 5.4/10"

Too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards... 3D did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plot.<br/><br/>From the beginning it was clear to me that the movie won't jump high enough and come up to my expectations, all I had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be - explosions, dorky costumes, pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded Hollywood. <br/><br/>Surely when the Avengers came out and I saw the rating (8.8 ?!), I assumed that I was wrong. Such great score! I just had to see this magnificent, most brilliant movie ever. <br/><br/>Time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly. Not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture, but they could have added a little bit of originality too. No matter how I look at it, some scenes and ideas resemble Transformers 3.<br/><br/>This was not brilliant at all. Perhaps when overjoyed comic lovers settles down the Avengers will reach its true rating and be remembered as another common Hollywood's trash.<br/><br/>As for now I can only weep for my money."

The Avengers has virtually no character development or plot. It basically is non stop chase scenes and things exploding, with an extreme amount of loud noise. I don't think there were more than several quiet, dialog times the entire movie. I kept thinking that the movie would settle down and get to a meaningful story, but it did not happen. I even was watching it in 3D but that did not help. If one wants to go see continual actions stunts and things exploding, then this is the movie for you.

"anthonypape","6","16","33","2 June 2013"," I knew it couldn't live up to the rating
","I missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because, from what I could see from the trailers and elsewhere, it looked a bit 'silly' for want of a better word, kid's stuff perhaps. We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there."

I understand that people are fans of the comic book series. I understand that this film will have it's fans. I just don't see it as holding any cinematic merit. The acting is by the numbers and I think we've all seen enough of CGI films to last us another century. If I were 12 I would probably have enjoyed it."

Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it.

"jonasw_89","6","13","26","20 August 2012"," Nowhere near what it's cracked up to be
","This movie is the definition of being over-hyped: Hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years, be it acting, special effects, fighting scenes or plot. In my opinion, it falls far, far short of that benchmark. The visual effects are very good, sure, but then so are the effects in Battleship.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly impressive either. The few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing. Platitudes, one-liners, soundbites and trailer lines are constant. Much of it makes no sense at all: Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is cautious about ""the other one"" and seems to dislike people knowing about it, yet he constantly references this. It's as if the writers thought ""We haven't shown Banner as the Hulk yet; better make him allude to that in his every line so people don't forget.""<br/><br/>The largest problem with the movie, without a doubt, is the plot. The bad guy never feels threatening, his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways, and the plot holes are too many to count. For instance, in one scene we see the Hulk being a mindless beast, destroying everything in his path, but later we see him taking orders. Add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of super-aim misses whenever the script calls for it making his on-screen superpower ""is really good with a bow and arrow"". In one scene he misses half a dozen shots from a distance of 12 feet.<br/><br/>On a related note, what is Captain Americas superpower compared to the others? Patriotism? Other Avengers are superiour in every single way. Ranged combat, close combat, mobility, intelligence, strength... Even his weapon is a worse version of Thors hammer. Not that Black Widow is any better, but at least she has some use in the plot.<br/><br/>This movie is like The Expendables, only it takes itself seriously and has better acting. It is thoroughly unimpressive and how it currently has a rank of #57 of all time movies is truly baffling."

Have to go to a theatre, and when you watch it and go to theatre it is absolutely as good as they it is. Loki is a very awesome character indeed. He completes the movie with his shear charisma, the armor he wears is MINDBLOWING!!! The Hulk is an essential character as well, he completes the comical aspect. The Black Widow, this smoking red hot beauty is a burst of adrenaline, Captain America is probably the least noticeable of all. Thor played a really flash, in completing the storyline of Loki. Last but not least the ""Rockstar"" brought to you by AC/DC Tony Stark the witty multi-billionaire playboy is the parallel equivalent to Bruce Wayne. What can we say Folks?

It is oddly strange that the movie opened a week early in different parts of the world. It should have opened first in the USA before anywhere else. To top it off, I only paid around $6.50 to experience the movie in 3D and inside an IMAX Theater.

"djscottyfox","10","13","26","27 April 2012"," Spoiler-Free review of an Awesome flick!
","The movie touches on all bases that a good super-hero / fantasy movie should. A fantastic story line, solid action, good humor, and amazing visuals.<br/><br/>The story is a bit much, kinda out-there (literally) but it is in keeping with the nature of the Thor / Asgard storyline. You cant include a Norse God without accepting some magik / fantasy elements. Plus the Avengers always tackled those issues in the books. Even the pacing was right on; at no point does it get slow or bogged down in exposition. Bottom line: it works.<br/><br/>The action is solid on all levels, and some of it is just breathtaking. Even the face-offs are surprising, and fun to watch. Best action in a superhero movie period.<br/><br/>The humor / emotion: the movie is hilarious without being stupid or directed at 8-year olds. Lucas / DC Comics take note! You don't have to make lame, childish jokes to be funny. Think more Joker with the pencil than anything in Green Lantern. Downey Jr is the driving force of this movie, and his Stark is turned up a notch. There a some literal laugh-out-loud moments in there, and some moments where the theater became deathly still. They pull strings without making you feel like a puppet.<br/><br/>Finally, visually the movie looks amazing. ILM outdid themselves, and the one spot I'm sure everyone was worried about, the green one, just looks sick. Not a lot of shake-the-camera fake action, but some great scenes, even a few surprising choices of vantage points.<br/><br/>The cast was perfect, Ruffalo IS Banner. A throwback to the Bixby days, instantly making you forget Norton or Bana. Evans owns the Cap / Leader / Good Guy role. You want to follow him. Johannson is a bad-ass in her role, Hemsworth is good, although Thor is kinda one-note. Hawkeye is an intriguing character, and Renner has the same great smirky tension he had in Hurt Locker. Agent Coulson has a much-expanded role in this, and his parts are special in themselves. And of course, Downey is king.<br/><br/>Im not a huge Avengers fan, never was. X-Men or The Justice League were always my favorites, so I'm not total fanboy, but I think this movie captured every element a true comic fan would want to see on the screen, and casual fans can just enjoy it as well, because it stands alone as a great movie. Probably the best since First Class, maybe the best since Dark Knight. I know I walked out feeling like I did after Return Of The King. It's that good!"
"big_ryan15","10","15","31","25 April 2012"," Be ready for a HULK sized experience.
","I've waited with baited breathe to see this movie for 4 years, ever since Sam Jackson turned up at the end of Iron Man in 2008 and uttered those words that made Marvel fans around the world weep happy tears: ""I'm here to talk about the Avengers initiative"". After 5 films I can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to high enough.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist: Loki. It's all pretty usual stuff from here. But once the heroes come together, the movie becomes something more. There are a lot of big egos flying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. It's in these heated rows and witty banter that The Avengers becomes something that I really wasn't expecting: a family comedy. All these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be had by bouncing them off each other. The fish out of water gags at Captain America's and Thor's expense are great (""Easy there Point Break"") with Tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults. And in the film's climax, Hulk gets most of the laughs as he smashes everything around him. The Hulk could easily have been the film's main weakness, Marvel had already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success (Ang Lee's 2003 version being one of the most underrated superhero movies ever) but he ends up being one of the film's biggest strengths. Mark Ruffalo makes a great Bruce Banner as he actually gets to play both Banner and the Hulk through motion/performance capture (the first time ever that an actor has played both Banner and his massive alter-ego) and it works SUPER well. There was a huge cheer and applause when Chris Evans delivered the line: ""Hulk, SMASH!"" and Hulk proceeded to do so with much gusto.<br/><br/>A few of the new characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow gets to do more kicking (looking good doing it) and is given a love interest in Jeremy Renner's unbelievably bad-ass Hawkeye. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4 Marvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with Marvel. Cobie Smulders (one can not measure her sex appeal) of How I Met Your Mother fame gets to show off her action chops as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and the Stan Lee cameo is present of course.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the film's action sequences. They are astounding.Like Transformers 3 astounding. Each one better than the last. An early 3 player bout involving Iron Man and Captain America try to take down Thor is great, but an aerial fight between Thor and the Hulk is better. But then there's the climactic ""glorious war!"" which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team. The problem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies, is that the film makers are limited to the adversaries to give their hero. Iron Man has just been fighting other men in suits, Thor monsters, etc. But now you can throw any enemies you want at The Avengers.<br/><br/>The plot is relatively tight and clever, but the screenplay is the real hero; brilliantly written with some cracking dialog. Joss Whedon's directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster mold. The perfectly cast actors are all 100% comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other and uniting to fight as a team. The action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being dumb or ""kiddy"" (Richie). In terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to personal preference. But in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight wins out due to it's better story and villain) but is still one of the best action movies ever made.<br/><br/>My one BIG problem with the film was the untimely murder of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) at the hands of a rampaging Loki. I felt like this was merely a tool to evoke an emotional response (adding to his character arc) from Tony Stark, whom throughout the film mentions numerous times he wasn't even aware that Agent Coulson had a first name, but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of relationship with this character? I have LOVED every scene Agent Coulson has ever been involved in and I feel it was a large mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage Captain America collectible cards. One can only hope.<br/><br/>Make sure you stay after the credits also, for those of you not in the know... be ready to google ""Thanos"" and the ""Infinity Gauntlet"" when you get home.<br/><br/>All in all it was GREAT fun & I honestly can not wait for Whedon's Directors's Cut. A fun fact i read this afternoon involves Kevin Feige (Producer of every MARVEL film) already having plans to incorporate Spiderman and the X-men into future Avengers films, once they regain the film rights to these characters.<br/><br/>REALLY looking forward to more Avengers. Fingers crossed Joss Whedon keeps his diary empty for many, many years to come.<br/><br/>9/10 Well and truly Assembled."

","I have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while, but this one deserves it. After seeing a screening of the film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make me think like this is that I didn't love all the individual films of the characters.<br/><br/>Captain America was right, Thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the second Iron Man was awful.<br/><br/>This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon style role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more fun.<br/><br/>Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing stamina.<br/><br/>I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an experience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other people.<br/><br/>Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.<br/><br/>Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.<br/><br/>And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I expected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics. A subtle phrasing full of a meaning that only comic books fans will understand."

"merdiolu","3","23","52","22 July 2012"," Superhero Pollution in Hollywood
","Actor John Cusack once said that there are no more big production studios anymore. There are just a bunch of banks which provide funding/credits for projects and approve which script would be produced according to box office profit it is projected to generate. ( because Hollywood mentality became like : more money , bigger stars , bigger budget , bigger marketing , bigger blockbuster , bigger box office income that's all it matters ) Since comicbook / superhero genre is the newest and biggest market to be milked in popular culture for Hollywood in these harsh economy ; is it surprising that The Avengers , a childish intake about a bunch of ridiculously costumed ""Superheroes"" with one dimensional immature behavior getting together to repel an alien invasion ( AGAIN ! I think any actual alien seeing these alien invasion movies would not even close Earth ever again. Our ""always winning despite odds"" thing would be silly to them ) ? Unfortunetely not. This is another shallow seasonal product , another ""leave your brain at theater door"" movie aimed for Comic Con Convention fans. And I admit it is a BIG market.<br/><br/>Just like most movies in this genre ( there are a few exceptions ) it has its own clich√©'s and tropes like they are coming out of a factory assembly line. At least director Joss Whedon ( a great TV writer/producer. I was a follower of Firefly and Dollhouse ) does not deny them and recognizing what they are , wears them at movie's sleeve. Bickering superheroes ( that's fine amusing with Whedonesque humor but humor got overwhelming and made ""superheroes"" childlike not multi dimensional characters ) , threat from outer space from a sneering arrogant enemy with another comic book costume ( at least Tom Hiddleston performed as well as he could with material he was given , but what the hell was Loki's motivation in conquering Earth ? ) , his boss with a digital voice , super secret ( American as usual ) military spy agency ( I can never understand American film industry's fetish of military - for a nation devoid of conscription ) , national stereotypes ( Russians are evil you know ) , hot ass kicking super agent babes ( Scarlett , Scarlett are you so desperate ? ) , Aryan looking superheroes from WW2 era ( Thor , Captain America , blond blue eyed , with whom we were fighting with anyway in that time ? Did you realize that there were no other ethnicity among these heroes like Oriental or Latin ) , Tony Stark rich jerk , Hulk a Doctor Bruce Banner marked with tragedy ( Mark Ruffolo is the only actor with proper character material and performs admirably in this ) , Hawkeye with baby faced Jeremy Renner ( I never warmed to that guy as an actor ) , and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury big boss of agency with an eye patch ( no fake protez in nowadays ? ) because it looks cool , a final battle with lots of laser rays and CGI explosions without casualties in another American urban area ( this year it is New York City's trashing time ) , good vs evil , government made the mistake of launching a nuclear missile , it is averted , heroes are victorious blah blah it is the end....<br/><br/>After all this sequence of predictable events where no protagonist was harmed and good guys win , what do we have ? An empty blockbuster which will make a big Box Office hit , probably a franchise but at the end an empty film. I can not wait in 20-30 years our grandchildren asking ""Is this the stuff your generation was watching ? No wonder everything really mattered like environment , economy , politics or simple psyche of human or society condition all of them gone hell. Your visual arts stopped reflecting them !"""

","And that is exactly what we have with The Avengers. Sam Peckinpah, the master director of mayhem, action, and blood-letting who broke down these Hollywood barriers in film over forty years ago recognized the necessity of character development for any action to have emotional meaning. As technically well-done as the Avengers is in all the action sequences, it lacks any human emotional qualities. Nobody but the most simple-minded that like mindless explosions and destruction will find any interest in this movie. A MOVIE is simple entertainment that will not past the test of time. A FILM is a work of art with quality and intelligence that will endure through the years. The Avengers is a 2-1/2 hour movie."
"classicsoncall","7","16","34","5 May 2012"," ""The world has gotten stranger than you even know.""
","Well how do I put this across so it doesn't sound like I'm trying to trash the movie? I've been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man, and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if that's what you're all about, you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players, Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He's out there, he's serious when he has to be, and he's a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he'd wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life, the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.<br/><br/>Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog, the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects, exceptionally well done of course, but gosh, how much can a city take? Which by the way, is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man, Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? <br/><br/>Say, I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks, so I was glad to see he showed up here, even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It's going to be a sad day when Lee won't be around any more to make these appearances.<br/><br/>And now for my final rant - as I write this, ""The Avengers"" has, in just two days, made it to #31 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495, so in less than a full weekend, movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this picture? Personally, if I were making the rules, I'd allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release, but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it's come out. OK, maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system, and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn't have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.<br/><br/>Back to ""The Avengers"" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they'll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I'd bet on it."

","It seems like besides Nolan's Batman and The Punisher, I am doomed to never appreciate the dull action/super hero films that seem to sweep the film world and produce millions of misguided teen action junkies. This would be a gem for cinema experience of huge 200 inch TV's but there is a reason these films never gain academy awards genuine ground breaking respect aside from budget and ratings. <br/><br/>The point of this review is just an opinionated rant to quarrel with the repetitive plots and average performances that people seem to just eat up and refuse to expand fantastic cinema experience because they're long and to them 'boring' <br/><br/>I can state what's boring, A hero is at the height of their average power, suddenly they encounter an ability or change that makes them more powerful and nearly worshiped (Iron Man, Thor, Cpt America, Batman, Spiderman) Now a girl or love interest that comes along and makes them vulnerable or around the time where they become vulnerable because typically, these films have to take their powers away. (Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Batman, Spiderman, Wolverine and Superman) Now they are usually hated at this point because they can't protect the masses or their loved ones or are just in doubt if they should pick up their dusty war torn mantle. (Iron Man, Batman, Hulk and Wolverine) And the bad guy is defeated, the girl is usually saved except poor old batman. (Wolverine, Iron Man, Spiderman, The Hulk.) DO you see where I am leading too? Do people like watching the same stuff just wearing a different cape? (metaphore for the smarties out there)<br/><br/>I am a fan of Kurbick, Tarentino, Del Toro (whoops I am a Hellboy fan), Scorsese, Finch, Mendes, Aronofsky, Eastwood and Anderson fan among others, and I know the guidelines between a film for fun and a film for what is described as 'moving art' or groundbreaking visual emotion and plot. Oh for a suggestion for some pretty slick action films that have earned respect, try Leon the Professional, Heat, Bunraku and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Black Comedy as well)"
"lilantman10","10","12","24","10 December 2012"," Wow
","Finally the Marvel Franchise reveals it's coup de grace and it's everything that we hoped for. Before I totally kiss this movie's butt for a while I'm going to delve into the negatives first.<br/><br/>Just a warning the first 25 minutes are a little slow, which is to be expected when telling such a large story. Lord of the Rings needed a whole movie to build up to the adventure to put it into context. Some of Loki's dialogue is a little hard to understand at times because of the Norse language dialect, but that's easily fixed with second viewings. Other than that and some nitpicks the movie delivers.<br/><br/>This is the movie we all made playing with our toys as a kid. Wheedon has done a fantastic job and I really don't think this movie could've worked as well without him. All the characters fit in this movie. I never thought a conversation between Loki and Nick Fury would work on screen but it does. Every character gets to shine in this movie. At time it's a Black Widow movie, then an Ironman movie, then a Thor movie, then a Captain America movie it all just fits perfectly. This movie has the best editing I've seen all year and some of the best acting to go with it. This movie is a culmination of several geek movies in one. It's got the ear turning and self reflection of Scott Pilgrim with the ensemble aspect of Star Trek (2009) with great dialogue. <br/><br/>I'm going to say character a lot because that's the focus. The story is a little weak because it comes second to the characters. I've always described superhero movies are character pieces with big budgets. A lot of people complained that it's a comedy or that it's just a loud mindless movie with explosions like Transformers. Since when does having great humor make something a comedy? All the humor is in the witty dialogue and a few physical gags which are hilarious and also unique to the characters. And Wheedon adds lots of little subtle setups to the ending to make the movie more cohesive and smarter than it is. It's not a bad story it's just a simple character driven one. The only superhero movie I know that has more emphasis on story is The Dark Knight, but this blows that out of the water. 6 heroes are better than one. That's why Lord of The Rings, Star Trek, and Toy Story are so great. The Team or The Ensemble. <br/><br/>There are so many ways this movie could've been ruined. Maybe they got the writing right, and the action is choreographed well but is filmed with shaky cam or is incoherent. All the action scenes in this movie are great and easy on the eyes and even have lots of character in them. The best scene in this movie is when the avengers are all arguing in a room. And the acting is the greatest. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. This movie is so much fun and if you don't like it it's probably because you didn't want to so anybody with an open mind should love this 10 out of 10"
"BottomLineReviews","9","12","24","10 December 2012"," A MUST see!
","You can think I'm jumping on the bandwagon or whatever you want - this movie was AMAZING. I would give it a 10 out of 10 if Cobie Smulders hadn't been so poorly miscast. Go back to Ted, Robin, you don't belong here. I would be hard pressed to find anything else wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>The best scenes are not when the Avengers are working together to fight the enemy, it's when they're fighting each other - with words (hilarious!) or with weapons (bad***!). Some might say the beginning of this movie starts out too slow and there isn't enough action - I'd say they are dead wrong. Dead wrong. This is a movie that doesn't insult the audience by assuming that all they want are things to go crash and boom. This is a movie that cares about developing their characters and cares about an actual storyline. Sure, they're all superheros, but they're all also human. Don't worry though, there's still plenty of action to go around and each of the characters in this movie pulls his (and her!) own weight.<br/><br/>My only piece of advice is to first see Captain America, Iron Man (at least the first), and Thor. Especially Thor since the entire premise of this movie is based on Thor's brother Loki - Tom Hiddleston is RIDICULOUSLY amazing in this movie. Avengers does a good job of catching you up to speed if you haven't seen these other movies (or read the comic books, which I admittedly haven't) but I would still recommend seeing them.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If I had the money, I'd be paying to see this movie in the theater every day."

Very few films have made me beam and laugh and cheer and clap so much. Terminator 2. Batman Begins. Iron Man. And a select handful of others.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a little bit of a slow burner, but with delightful ingredients on the screen, it makes for a fabulous, explosive and tasty finish.<br/><br/>I'd have to say, it was superbly orchestrated from start to finish, and the highlights must go to the Thor/Iron Man scuffle, and the grand finale which has - surprisingly - The Hulk as its main and certainly best attraction. After two average Hulk films, THIS one more than compensates for them, with humour (""I'm always angry"") and punchiness (it stopping one of the megamonsters and slapping Loki around as it he were a Barbie doll - awesome!).<br/><br/>Other highlights are the Cap telling the NYPD what to do and Loki's masterful interrogation by Romanoff.<br/><br/>All in all, the best action I've seen in a few years.

"rishabhnarula","10","12","24","14 June 2012"," The Avengers
","It took four years to make The Avengers, by Joss Whedon but it was well worth the wait. The story takes place in New York, in 2012. The Avengers are made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner). The main antagonist of the movie is Loki (Tom Hiddleston).¬†The movie is an Action/ Comedy / Adventure/Sci-fi film. The movie is two hours and twenty three minutes long and by the end you don't want it to be over. In the beginning we find out that Earth has found the Tesseract, an object that can provide an unlimited source of potential energy. It suddenly activates and opens a portal to another world where Loki comes out of. Loki threatens to wage war upon Earth. Now it's up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to find a way to stop him. He is part of an organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and he brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to save the Earth from Loki and his army. Along the way The Avengers get into arguments, which allows Loki to get away. Loki ends up opening the portal again and his army is able to come to Earth. Will the Avengers be able to stop Loki and his army? You will have to see the movie to find out.<br/><br/>I loved the acting in this movie. I think that's what made the movie what it is. I don't think I could choose one favorite, but if I had to it would have to be between The Hulk and Iron Man. The Hulk is my favorite because he is a genius when he is ""normal"" and he smashes everything when he turns into the Hulk. The funniest part of the movie would be when The Hulk punches Thor while fighting Loki army. The only thing I didn't like was that he only became The Hulk two times throughout the entire movie. Iron Man maybe my favorite because he is funny and cool. He is funny and intelligent thought the entire movie. He is funny, for example, when Captain America asks Iron Man, ""If you take off you armor what are you?"" which Iron Man responds with, ""Uh... genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.""<br/><br/>Another thing I really liked about this movie is the story. Not for one second did I find the movie boring or unenjoyable. I kept my eyes glued to the screen. The movie has all the things a movie needs. For example the movie has humor, action, and an amazing cast. Also I think all the characters have the right amount lines and everything is distributed evenly, not one actor is more superior to the other.All in all I think the story was amazingly written. <br/><br/>After reading this review I bet you understand that I loved this movie. Everything about this movie, in my opinion is perfect. I would recommend everyone to see this movie and not only at home but go to the theater and see it there. You will not enjoy it at home as much as you would in theaters. I would give this a 10/10, or a must see movie."
"aaronjbong","9","12","24","6 May 2012"," Awesome and Amazing Avengers Assembled
","After years and years of anticipation, we finally get to see some of our favorite superheroes meet and fight together as a team. Creating a movie like this is difficult, considering that it would be hard to combine the different superheroes' story lines and merge them into one storyline. However, Marvel pulled that off easily by strategically releasing movies over the past four years about each of the heroes to serve as prologues and create anticipation for this amazing, awesome, action-packed ""The Avengers"".<br/><br/>In the first 45 minutes, we see what has happened to our favorite Marvel superheroes in their own respective lives. Iron Man is forced back into action when he was in the middle of a date with Pepper Potts. The star-spangled soldier Captain America has woken up from his 70-year-old frozen sleep and has a lot to explore in his new surroundings. The new fresh revamped Bruce Banner has been helping sick kids in India. Black Widow is taking a day off by taking another mission when a call from Agent Coulson requires her to return to normal business with Nick Fury. Thor comes a bit later on and we meet newcomer master archer Hawkeye.<br/><br/>So what's the danger this time? It's none other than Loki from ""Thor"". To answer some of your questions, No, he didn't die (the post-credits scene from ""Thor""). So even if he didn't die, how did he arrive on Earth when the bridge connecting the different universes has been destroyed? Apparently, Loki was saved by another alien race called the Chitauri. He offers a deal with the Chitauri leader; he will command the Chitauri army in an attempt to subjugate Earth in exchange for the Tesseract. So Loki arrives through the Tesseract (which has the ability to build portals) on Earth and starts to execute his plan.<br/><br/>While Loki was doing fine in the early stages of his schemes, the heroes didn't get along so well in the beginning. As reality would suggest, the members of the team get into some fights (there's one action-packed scene where Iron Man fights against Thor with Captain America caught in between). There's a lot of dispute between the superheroes, much to Loki's favor, all due to either rivalry, jealousy, suspiciousness, or many other reasons. This gives the heroes more humanity and possibly some vulnerability which really make the movie more realistic. This is just one of the highlights of Joss Whedon's flawless script.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon also successfully blended the different universes of the different superheroes and made it into one film. This is rather difficult considering the natures of the superheroes. World War II to Captain America seems like yesterday and he still has a lot to catch up with (he doesn't know who Stephen Hawking is). Thor, who is of mythological nature, is still used to Asgardian lifestyle. Joss Whedon successfully pulled this off and so the interaction between the different superheroes seem sensible, not awkward. The dialog is perfect and natural.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about this movie is the action. By giving the characters the sense of vulnerability, the fight scenes seem more risky and more heart-pumping. While it may be heart-racing, the action scenes are also fun to watch, especially when we see the Incredible Hulk in action. The Hulk is just a mindless monster (although he suddenly becomes aware of himself towards the climax) who wrecks havoc at anything that he considers a potential threat. His role in destroying the enemies during the climax was very entertaining. That said, the climax and finale of the film was one of the best and one of the most thrilling I've ever seen. It offers brilliant visual effects and conjures up enough awe to satisfy anyone seeking intense sequences of action. By the end of it, you'll be satisfied but will still be eager for more.<br/><br/>The performances were very convincing. Robert Downey Jr. played the role of the quirky Tony Stark to perfection. His dialog, his performance, everything about him was just perfect. Chris Evans also had a strong performance playing the role of Captain America. He was able to exploit the Captain's inner feelings. Chris Hemsworth also did justice with Thor, Samuel L. Jackson did a commanding job as Nick Fury, Jeremy Renner played a determined Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson played a sexy and deadly Black Widow, Tom Hiddleston portrayed a malicious and manipulating Loki. However the main star of the show was Mark Ruffalo as the incredible Hulk. He was able to portray a calm, tranquil Bruce Banner but also showed signs that Bruce Banner can, at any time, become the Hulk.<br/><br/>The humor is heart-warming and very well. Every now and then, there's always a little bit of humor to cheer up the audience. While one might expect that most of the humor would come from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr., actually the humor is divided equally among the characters including Loki. Why I love this is because every character has a chance to shine and steal the scene.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" is a must-see and a great movie to start the summer movie season. It's got the interesting premise, the operatic action scenes, the great jokes and many more to offer. This is absolutely one of the best, if not, the best superhero film of all time. It offers a great deal of fun for a broad range of viewers. Just get up from the couch, head to the nearest movie theater and watch ""The Avengers"". It's great and 3D is a viable option. Oh, and once the credits roll, don't leave yet. There's two post-credits scenes you don't want to miss, and one of them involves the Chitauri leader.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""The Avengers"" is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films of all time and is guaranteed to blow audiences away with plenty of action sequences, outstanding visual effects, a powerful script, and solid performances."
"connorallen2606","9","12","24","29 April 2012"," Just WOW!!
","I have no idea how Joss Whedon has made this film work. Not only does this work, but this is one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. Surprisingly the script isn't as biased towards Iron Man as I thought it would be and every character gets a good amount of screen time and their chance to shine. Black Widow and Hawkeye more than hold their own and they aren't just in the background whilst the other superheroes dominate the screen and have all the action, Widow and Hawkeye do some unbelievably awesome things, and are crucial to the story. The dialogue is consistently witty and hilarious, every character gets to deliver a good punchline before the film is up. The final battle in Manhattan lasts a good half an hour at least, and I didn't want it to end, the action was of an epic scope and was absolutely jaw dropping. But the real surprise and best part of this film by far is the Hulk. After 2 so- so films they FINALLY got the Hulk right, and dare I say it, he's my favourite avenger after this, and this will probably be the case for most of you when you leave the theatre. This film was action packed, but it wasn't Transformers, this film had heart, intelligent dialogue and a cast of brilliant actors playing conflicting egos and colourful characters. Every actor is spot on in their respective roles, Tom Hiddleston makes for an excellent villain playing Loki, Thor's brother, and Robert Downey Jr. is much better here than he was in Iron Man 2. The only problem I really had with it was that in the middle it dragged on ever so slightly, but this was forgotten by the time the credits rolled. It has to be said though, if you haven't seen any of the Marvel films before this, you won't have any idea what's going on, and you probably won't really care for the film until the last hour or so kicks in. <br/><br/>Make sure you stay through the end credits, it's not over just yet!!"

I can' believe how people actually like this stuff, maybe they slept all the way through it, I can't say. This movie brings absolutely nothing new or interesting to the big screen. It's totally predictable and not funny, it contains so many lame jokes that it makes you feel a bit nauseated at some points. The action is stupid and seen before in older and better movies. The plot is... Wait a second, what plot? The only positive thing in this movie is Robert Downey Jr, but he alone cannot make up for all the flaws that exist in this movie. Certain points in the movie feel very long, and I assume this is because of the actors lack of talent, they are dull and have no feelings. And I laughed every time captain America was show on the screen, his mask looks absolutely hilarious. And I laughed even harder when some of the evil space dudes pulled of his mask, because I'd bet that even the film crew found him looking ridiculous in that outfit.<br/><br/>I guess The Avengers is a good movie if you find trouble sleeping one night, just put it on, and you'll be sleeping in no time"

","Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki ""was adopted"" was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clich√©d and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called ""first-person shooter"" games but are nowadays referred to as ""first-person action"" games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their ""big get-togethers"" when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...? I think John Carpenter (THEY LIVE) and George Romero (LAND OF THE DEAD) had it right: we have seen The Enemy, and He is Us. Give me RODNEY CECIL, PSYCHO HERO any day."

","... but is the ultimate fan of Joss Whedon. <br/><br/>I came to this film with virtually no background in the Marvelverse, so I was a bit confused at first. My husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when I had questions, but I have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details. This is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development, courtesy of Joss Whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece. Do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence? He has to know that at some level that he, once again, did the impossible. He took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold. He created a movie that was fun, and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the Marvel Movie Universe and gave each character their time to shine. It has great acting; quippy dialogue; tons of very well done action; and a decent, if underplayed, level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters. They worked individually, they worked collectively. It had lots of Ultimate Alliance moments. Hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and Thor hammers it into his head, Thor brings his hammer down on Cap's shield and causes a huge shockwave, Thor shoots lightning at Iron Man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400+% giving him a supercharged shot. I love that all of those moments were added. I also love how Joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie. Thor vs Hulk, Thor vs Cap, Thor Vs Iron Man, Hawkeye vs Black Widow, Black Widow vs Hulk. You can't help but love each and every fight. <br/><br/>Will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about Citizen Kane? Probably not. But Whedon accomplished in the 2010's in making a film in which I was completely engrossed for two and a half hours, had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled. And isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place?"

Why was the main antagonist Loki? And how did it made sense that it took so many super heroes to defeat someone who was ""technically"" one of their own?

","It may be mildly entertaining, but it's still just other very long and slow mix of tired battle scenes and some wooden, masturbatory, borderline cringe-worthy dialogue, all leading to a predictable ending. There were a couple good laughs but that doesn't really make up for the fact that this was over two hours and twenty minutes. Robert Downey, Jr. was the best part because his sarcasm is great. It's too bad I can't really say much about the rest. And keep in mind, I genuinely like the Iron Man movies and Captain America.<br/><br/>Here, everyone's already established and undefeatable. What's the point of having characters that you can't root for, and therefore you don't care about the outcome? They never hit rock bottom, therefore there's no end to the second act, therefore the whole film is completely unsatisfying. And again, it's boring. Two and a half hours leading to an obligatorily happy and sequel-welcoming ending. Dear Lord, change it up.<br/><br/>Why was The Dark Knight Trilogy good? Because it had human characters that had legitimate weaknesses, therefore carrying on the plot that had the characters grow, and if they died, we felt sad. Why? Because we cared for them. Why did we feel bad for James Bond in Casino Royale? We believed he loved Vesper and the third act was made with an emotional punch. Why did we care for Silva in Skyfall? He was a great villain because he was funny, menacing, fantastically portrayed by Javier Bardem, and his motives had a believable character background. M captivated our interest, and it was a well-developed, terrifically-acted character that had great mother-son chemistry with Bond. The Avengers has none of that, just pretty cities that go boom, slapstick humor and throwaway lines, all on repeat. The characters interact with each other like annoying small children, and the same dialogue constantly put on repeat made me so bored.<br/><br/>4/10, bad, below average, horrifically overrated, two thumbs down, etc."

OK there needs to be movies for teenagers and I am fine with that, but that does not mean it should be praised as much as The Godfather.<br/><br/>The Avengers, really, can be summarized as two hours of four superheroes fighting each other over the location of some blue cube because Loki wanted it so, just like drunken guys in any tavern, and who finally come together to fight (again) in a huge alien battle on Manhattan against aliens who can't shoot straight, have fragile weaponry, and who are led by a demi-god, Loki, who ends up being simply beaten up by Hulk with his bare-hands, no questions asked, just as if Batman would destroy Superman because it makes for a funny ending.<br/><br/>If anyone can add anything of substance to what I have just described, only with sarcasm I admit, I am willing to hear about it.<br/><br/>This was a poor movie, and how well it was received by critics shows how big corporations like Disney now control the industry with propaganda in order to create mass hysteria.

","The Marvel's movie The Avengers is an action packed comedy sci-fi movie all in one. It has everything and everyone in it. All of the Marvel characters in one brought together by Nick Fury because Loki stole the Tesseract that was found in the Captain America movie. It has Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America. All the characters are extremely different, which made it very difficult for them to come together as one team against their other worldly foe, Loki. It takes the super heroes to get past their own egos and accept each other's help. It's difficult for the characters to come together because they're personalities are all so different, and they're also used to being the stars by themselves so that makes ten times more difficult to come together. There is a lot of inner conflict with the characters too. To start off with, the inevitable Iron Man. He is still the same Iron Man, a genius with a lot of money and a huge ego. Captain America just has came back from being frozen since the World War II times. He isn't used to all the technology that is used to really enhance the movie. That causes a conflict because Iron Man refers to Captain America as an ""old man"". Then there's Thor who is Loki's brother, there's more conflict. He comes to help because he is against his brothers antics. Loki believes that a world shouldn't have freedom like ours does. He comes to be the ruler and demands it. Then there's Natasha or the Black Widow, to me the typical woman in a super hero movie. She's almost seductive. They have her in tight clothing and she's manipulative. I am surprised that she can hold her own. I figured they would have made her more of a damsel in distress because she is the only woman in the movie really. Her friend Hawkeye becomes under Loki's spell trying to defend Loki from getting the Tesseract. He ends up having to fight Natasha and then comes out of the spell the help in the end. Then there's Hulk who has been trying to hide and stay away pretty much from people so he can keep calm. He hates becoming the Hulk, but when he does, he doesn't care who or what is in his way. He fights the other characters and tries to hurt them without really being aware.<br/><br/>Disregarding all of the conflict the characters all come together in the end to take on Loki in the typical attack area I feel for a superhero movie, New York City. It has to happen in a big city to show the impact that it had on the movie. All around the quality of the movie is amazing. The way all the movies were tied together really worked. It was all around a great movie."

It's the kind of movie that left us happy afterwards, that made us want to discuss it at length and made us leave reality; in every sense an aesthetic experience. I loved the action scenes, special effects, and all, but I suppose what I loved best about it were the hilarious one-liners that literally had the entire cinema laughing out loud. There were so many of these, too many to count with my fingers, in fact. There was also one moment when I actually cried, but then that was just me. I tend to cry over everything. *Sheepish smile.*<br/><br/>I was initially afraid that so many characters in one movie would result in one convoluted mess, but the writers managed to make a script that somehow gave each character their own screen time without making it appear too contrived, or as though they just forcibly slotted a story in just so a certain character could appear. The entire story actually made sense and flowed naturally into one cohesive whole.<br/><br/>I was also initially afraid that so many hunky heroes in one movie would make my heart or brain explode from confusion as to which one to 'ship, as I had fallen in love with each one of these heroes when I watched their individual films in the years past. (Okay, not all of them, just Iron Man, Thor and Captain America.) But here's what I realized - The Avengers makes for an interesting study in finding out what a girl truly finds attractive in a man, depending on who she loves most among the heroes. Is it Captain America, the handsome and wholesome boy next door with the hero's noble heart? Is it Thor, the fierce, masculine man with rippling muscles, facial hair and deep throaty growl? Is it the Hulk, the reserved brainiac with a surprisingly endearing shy smile? Or it it Iron Man, the witty genius billionaire playboy philanthropist (in his own words)?<br/><br/>I am not going to recap the story, just go watch it yourself!

The one liners are a keeper, and it comes with some great performances as well, particularly with Robert Downey, Jr and Mark Ruffalo. The film entertains in action, succeeds in comedy, and manages to be one of the greatest films we're bound to see this summer, and potentially one of the best films we'll see of the year. And an end note, if you do a sequel, please keep Joss Whedon. Without him, expect The Avengers 2 to be less entertaining overall."

","""The Avengers"" is a great exercise in the art of fantasy movie-making. Its exemplary and superior production value, great performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes, clever and witty dialogues (albeit with some nonchalant sarcasm thrown by RDJ as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end technology and sophisticated gadgets), superb pacing nary a monotonous moment, adequate and sufficient background information for the uninitiated (those who haven't seen Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk & The Iron Man franchise) but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences, magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing VFX, profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant, tight-knit plot giving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters, makes this as the best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with Batman:Dark Knight as possibly the greatest Superhero Movie, comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly MARVEL's finest effort till date. Director Joss Whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job. A must watch movie, which is surely going to be an Epic. It's an amazing movie full of heart, gravitas, emotion and depth. The On-screen chemistry between all the lead characters is uncanny and unparalleled. 10/10, a must watch for every Hollywood movie buff & Superhero aficionado."

","Simple-minded live-action comic book extravaganza uniting Earth's resident superheroes to thwart Thor's adoptive brother Loki and his faceless army from destroying the world. The 3D effects aren't terribly good, though the film looks expensive and is top-heavy with crushing destruction (taking place in Manhattan, somewhat disconcerting in the post-9/11 years), coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects. Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual panache to the fore as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Chris Evans is a wonderfully well-scrubbed Captain America, but others in the all-star cast (particularly Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo and, in a cameo, Gwyneth Paltrow) just appear to be slumming. The script (by Joss Whedon, who also directed) could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who haven't been comic book fans for very long. It's a mechanical enterprise for audiences looking to be uplifted by the sight of buildings (and people) being obliterated...and the patriotic revenge therein. ** from ****"

","This is one of the most overrated movies I have seen. I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I did enjoy Spiderman 1, 2, and 3 as well as Ironman. I've never seen Thor or Captain America so I know I'm missing a little backstory, but I doubt it would add a lot to the experience in this movie. The story was sub-par and very predictable. There is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible, which is why I tend to avoid superhero movies. Action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99/100 times. I laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys. Do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats? Yes, the visuals are decent but that's not what makes a movie. When comparing this film to Guardians of the Galaxy, it's no contest. GotG had drama, humor (that wasn't forced), a decent story, and fantastic visuals. If you are a Marvel fan, you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters. I was looking for something other than mindless action and unfortunately I did not get that."

I feel like everyone is bringing their A-game here, Ruffalo stepping in for Norton and doing an excellent job.<br/><br/>The story and pacing is good and even the action scenes are not confusing (a la Transformers) and really spotlight every single hero and their unique abilities.

","I, along with thousands of others, grew up a huge superhero fan. Film makers capitalized on the superhero fandom by making franchises off of the most popular heroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spider-man. I remember as a kid loving those movies, but I would think, ""Man, how cool would it be if they made a Justice League or an Avengers movie!"". But it was just a dream. Until 2012. After Iron Man started the MCU in 2008, superhero fans and movie fans everywhere witnessed a legendary event, when The Avengers graced the big screen. And boy was it good!<br/><br/>Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger introduced us to all the main characters in this movie, so there was no need for dumb intros *cough*cough*... Suicide Squad... What's great is that each of our heroes are at different places in their journeys and it shows in their roles in this film. The casts does an amazing job of playing a group of very different heroes coming together, not because they fit well together, but because they have to, in order to save the world. <br/><br/>The plot may be simple, but it works. The film is fun, action-packed, and evenly paced. Loki is my favorite MCU villain to date... I know I know ... Thanos ... he's great and all, but there's something about Tom Hiddleston's Loki that is so likable without downplaying him as a threat.<br/><br/>Infinity War may be remembered as the greatest Avengers movie, but this movie will always be my favorite."

","To keep this short, I love this movie. All of the characters are amazing and the actors playing these characters are also doing an amazing job of really capturing the way these characters should be portrayed. I think that Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was a great casting choice as he is able to show the loving and caring side of Tony Stark and also the cocky, arrogant and snarky side of him. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was also amazing. Some of the lines that he had with the other Avengers were amazing and Hemsworth is good at making it seem as though Thor has no idea why humans do what they do. Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers was somewhat a save for the actors Marvel career, as the last time he appeared in a Marvel movie he played The Human Torch in the very disappointing Fantastic Four movies. He also does very good at acting as though he's from the 1940's. All of the other performances were outstanding but the one that stands out is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He was a compelling villain, intimidating and funny at times. <br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie is all around amazing and is definitely my favourite MCU movie so far."

Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man once again, and he gives another uniformly perfect performance. Chris Evans is Captain America, and he too is outstanding as this superman-like individual fighting for truth and justice and the ""American Way"". Mark Ruffalo plays Dr. Bruce Banner/ The Hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, and he too is exemplary with his performance. Of course, there is Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the leader of this brave crew. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, is very convincing and an extremely tough ing√©nue in a film which is not directed by Woody Allen. Joss Whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3D, and I advise that it be seen with this medium, since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality. Don't miss this remarkable Marvel comic piece. It is worth the effort for you and all the youngsters in the audience who will be glued to the screen."
"RedTarkus37","8","12","25","5 May 2012"," Spitting in the Faces of Serious Movie-Watchers
","An article I read summed up The Avengers as ""The Anti-Dark Knight,"" which is NOT a bad thing. It's just about as quality, but rather than being dark and gritty, this movie is fun with hilarious, yet intelligent dialogue. This is the truest comic book film. No, we're not given a bad pun about the villain's costume in the middle of really intense scenes. The movie is intense, intelligent, hilarious, and fun, which is a very odd combo for a movie one would expect to be very Hollywood.<br/><br/>This movie spits in the faces of more serious movie-watchers. Even they will get absorbed into this movie for many reasons. Usually, in a Hollywood movie with the success this one was expected to accumulate, you'd see more sex and idiots on screen twisting the plot in the most ridiculous of ways. Well, Scarlett Johansson is not used for seduction on other characters or sexual appeal to viewers. She is here to play Black Widow and be a crucial part of the film! As for idiots, there are none. The characters in this movie are all smart and necessary to the story. All of them do a great job! Even Mark Ruffalo, whose presence will make you forget the great Norton was even the Hulk first.<br/><br/>The story is just about as well-balanced as one could hope for between intelligence, action, tension, and flow. The characters' backgrounds are all tied together very well, and the story isn't centered around one character too much more than another. The main characters all get equal screen time and importance to the movie's monumentally huge and intelligent plot. For those who complain we're not given enough depth on characters, we were given a good amount of depth. If we would've gone any more in depth on any one of the characters, the flow of the movie would've succeeded less. We see enough from everyone.<br/><br/>To cap this movie off, the action was superb! It's always exciting anytime there is fighting sequences, which are plentiful. The special effects are really well-done, which is expected from a movie with such a budget as this one had to work with. The money was all put to good use. Great action, great actors, great directing, great plot, great dialogue, great movie!!<br/><br/>The only complaints one could have is ""They didn't stick with the comic books"" or ""These guys weren't the original Avengers."" This is a film. You cannot directly copy a comic exactly when making a comic book movie. It's a movie. It stands alone. Other complaints are just a few bad lines that are easily pardoned with how much the rest of the script outweighs the few bad lines.<br/><br/>This movie spits in the faces of serious movie-watchers. It surely did in mine. I didn't think I'd come across a movie with such an ominous plot in which the manner of the characters isn't totally serious. This is the one great film that was able to do that and still maintain a level of greatness that it does. This is one of the greatest 2000's films. I rank it right up there with The Dark Knight, Return of the King, City of God, Inception, etc. One of the greats of our time."
"Absolem","8","12","25","26 April 2012"," Very entertaining. Superhero ensemble done right.
","Over the past five years we have been exposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has introduced us to a multitude of characters. Finally, it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble. Following the arrival of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston), S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of six of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat. However, their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot of friction in the group. Many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character, with the rest simply playing supporting roles. They needn't have worried, as each Avenger is given an appropriate amount of attention. Returning to their roles from the previous Marvel films are Robert Downey Jr. as the pretentious yet well-meaning industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as the recently resurrected World War II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Norse God Thor (Loki's stepbrother) and Scarlett Johansson as enigmatic spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner expands upon his brief cameo in ""Thor"" as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, by far the most interesting member of the group. Replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk is Mark Ruffalo, who fills the role surprisingly well. Badass as usual is Jackson as Fury. We also see quite a lot of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who makes his most memorable appearance so far. Returning in supporting roles are Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Introduced in this film is Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), who doesn't really get enough screen time to make a proper impression. While the entire cast is solid, the best performance by far is by Hiddleston. As the film's primary villain, he cuts an imposing figure, peering a death glare at the audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes' heads. Director Joss Whedon, the man behind ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"", once again shows his ability to create a well-made ensemble piece. Following in the footsteps of Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Louis Letterier and Joe Johnston, he was the ideal choice for this film. Whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas, from the emotional impact of the death of a major character, to the film's many moments of humor and the many heart-racing action scenes. Another triumph is the film's special effects. The motion capture used to create the Hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous live-action portrayal, Loki's army of Chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are created that could never exist in reality. Furthermore, Whedon alumni Alexis Denisof is unrecognizable as The Other, a mysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes (and what will come to the front in future installments). While it won't win any Oscars, The Avengers succeeds in all of the intended areas. A character-driven story with heart, action and humor, it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice, and will thrill audiences from beginning to end."

","I don't usually write reviews and I am not an expert on analyzing all that cinematographic stuff or how god of a job director did. All I can say is that I had a time of my life. It was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it. When I first heard about the avengers, I was very happy yet skeptical about it. My biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development. Even after seeing it I have no idea how they did it, but they not only did it they smashed it. Right from the start I was taken to a ride of my life, I could not take my eyes out of what was going on. In terms of special effect, it was top-notch as it was expected no question about it. People are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it, I have to say I am not a fan of comedy, but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time. Having to see Hulk smashing Loki or Capitan America patronizing Iron-man, or Iron-Man fighting Thor, was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid. But having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations, and trust me I had very high hopes for this film. Well, sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing, I just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that I have been provided with watching this amazing film. It's an epic masterpiece, and seeing it on the big screen is a one of those things you have to do before you die, that's for sure."
"geometroid","10","10","20","7 May 2012"," 1000 words isn't long enough!
","Speaking as a fan of Iron Man and the rash of other constituent superhero films in the last few years AND a fan of The Avengers AND as a fan of Joss Whedon I can say that I was really pumped to see this film. Add to that the early reviews calling this film the greatest Superhero film of all time and I was ready to go. <br/><br/>Having seen it with a VERY participatory audience on Friday night I was blown away, Joss Whedon delivered on all the promises that had been made. But the BEST superhero film of all time? Really? <br/><br/>Well, I still think Watchmen deserve that particular honor. Realizing that I might have offended, well... everybody with that comment it must be said that there a couple of qualifiers here.<br/><br/>I think as a FILM discrete from any other films or comics (thus cutting out the graphic novel in Watchmen's case as well as the mountain of literature involving the Avengers and it's many characters) Watchmen takes it, its structure and tone are more adult oriented which lowered the box office figures and since the best cut of that movie is the director's cut that hurt it too, but I believe it is a better film. <br/><br/>Having said that and having gotten it out of the way I now proceed to what The Avengers brings to the table that makes this film MORE FUN than Watchmen. We add back in all the connections to movies and comics and POW, you have a mythos that everyone is aware of and has been awaiting for four years or more and The Avengers wins hands down just for its cultural impact. Everyone may not know who Doctor Manhattan is, but if you are reading this (or are breathing) you probably have heard of the Incredible Hulk or Iron Man.<br/><br/>One of the things I like about the Marvel universe is that the heroes in its world FIGHT EACH other. This is one of the reasons I was attracted to Watchmen<br/><br/>The Avengers themselves are directed to glory by Joss Whedon who had the overwhelming task of first making these guys fight each other and then come together as a team. This problem alone would have made most directors run away and hide under the bed but he does it. He is helped by the fact that he did not have to tell ONE SINGLE origin story, this had all been taken care of in the earlier movies. This also creates the disadvantage that the characters have to now meet each other and not bore the audience with redundancies. Not only that he does it without making the characters look silly or rather, more accurately, makes it so the silliness of a hammer throwing Norse god coming to blows with a soldier from World War II dressed in an American flag is not an obstacle but becomes the path to common ground. <br/><br/>The job of getting these guys to work together in the film falls to Nick Fury, played by an irreverent Samuel L. Jackson. One aspect of Fury's character is that being a spy/soldier this guy can look into his superior's faces and say ""I understand you made a decision, but since it was a stupid ass decision I decided to ignore it"". It is not hard to figure out why Nick Fury would be the one to be the one to conceive of the Avengers Initiative in the first place. <br/><br/>The group he gathers to save the Earth consists of an egomaniac, a megalomaniac Norse god, an old time American soldier with testosterone in abundance, a very hot girl who can get information out of anyone (and, it must be said should get her butt its own show) and last and certainly not least a guy who has ""breathtaking anger management issues. <br/><br/>The actors also step up to the job as well and since my memory for actors' names is rather sketchy you'll forgive me for taking the quick route. Robert Downey Jr. is the same Iron man he's always been. The Hulk... well I'll save him for last. Thor manages to deliver one of the funniest lines in the film while simultaneously causing my wife to form a puddle of drool in her lap (the guy is FREAKING GOOD LOOKIN' what can I say?) which is okay because I was lovin' Scarlett what'sherface's Butt. Captain America makes up for the deficiencies of his origin movie by playing his role with a mixture of frustration at his circumstances and the loyalty of a soldier. There is also a star turn from Clark Gregg who acts in a redshirt capacity. Then there is Samuel L. Jackson who just has to stand there and look cool.<br/><br/>Now for the Hulk, I got excited originally because I am a fan of Edward Norton. I watched that movie because I was a fan of Edward Norton and when Avengers time came I expected Edward Norton to be there to round out a perfect cast. Instead I was informed that someone named Mark Ruffalo was taking his place. Now, while he did extremely well, I was waiting to see Edward Norton and Robert Downy Jr. play off each other, I think if there is one severe disappointment in the acting it is this one.<br/><br/>I began writing this review because fans, in the ebullience of the opening weekend, called this the best superhero film ever. I disagreed, here's how it breaks down. <br/><br/>Pure movie making (strictly movie to movie) goes to Watchmen Storytelling goes to Watchmen Beauty goes to Watchmen Mass appeal goes to the Avengers Pure fun goes to the Avengers Intellectual Satisfaction goes to Watchmen Action goes to the Avengers Character is a tie Pure satisfaction upon finishing the movie goes to the Avengers.<br/><br/>I think the Avengers wins."

","As one of the seemingly few who's not a fan of the Iron Man character or his films, and after seeing the trailers for this film, I had my reservations about The Avengers. Was it going to be Iron Man 3, guest starring the rest? Well, yes and no. It's clear who Joss Whedon's favourites are, as they get the most character development. Those who come out on top - Tony Stark (of course), Black Widow and - surprisingly - Bruce Banner/the Hulk. If you're a fan of these characters/the actors who portray them, then you should be satisfied with the amount of screen time they get. Captain America gets his moments of leadership. Hawkeye & Nick Fury do alright for themselves. Even Agent Coulson gets a fair amount of screen time/development. Sadly, Thor gets the short end of the stick...or hammer. I'd thoroughly enjoyed Thor in his solo movie and Chris Hemsworth in the role, so I was hoping he'd get the respect and focus he deserved as part of this ensemble cast. It seems Tony Stark's one-liners and the Hulk beating the crap out of characters for laughs were more important, however.<br/><br/>Fans of Tony Stark, who don't mind his attitude and want nothing more than him spouting snark aplenty and blowing crap up, should be happy. Annoyingly, even his love interest gets to be the sole love interest to appear in this film (too bad for Jane Foster or Peggy Carter - both of whom I prefer as characters. Though at least we get to see a picture of them each, and thankfully it's mentioned that Jane's safe. I wish Thor had been allowed to reunite with her before he left again). RDJ does his thing, and he's naturally fine doing it, but I'm probably in the minority who prefers him as Sherlock in the Sherlock Holmes films.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson gets to kick sufficient arse as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. She also does a good job of subverting the obvious - something Whedon is a fan of (that and scenes where everyone yells over the top of each other). There's a few moments you think she's showing signs of weakness, but then it's turned on its head and you see she's smart and more than capable/not to be underestimated. There's not really any 'beauty taming the beast' thing that the trailers may have led some to believe in regards to her character and the Hulk. Quite the opposite. <br/><br/>Speaking of the 'other guy', as Bruce calls him, this Hulk looks better than the two previous movie versions, thanks to motion-capture allowing Mark Ruffalo to actually portray the not-so-jolly green giant. Hulk's face even bears some resemblance to Ruffalo. Bruce gets to be all brooding and restrained for the bulk of the movie, but when he eventually Hulks out, he does plenty smash-o-crash. The Hulk is also played for some rather annoying laughs at times, like when he punches Thor after they've just teamed up to take down a baddie (why? Because it's funny!) or he cuts Loki off mid-speechifying by pounding him into the floor repeatedly, thus kinda undoing all the time & effort Tom Hiddleston had been spending making Loki menacing. There's a few moments where Loki really shows why he was the best villain to use in this film, despite the Hulk taking care of him pretty easily.<br/><br/>Cap thankfully gets to retain his likability and calls Tony out on his BS. These two come to blows verbally on more than one occasion while Thor resorts to fisticuffs with Iron Man and the Hulk...and yet he never seems to be allowed to have a true victory. This is the real disappointment of the movie - a character who had undergone a true hero's journey in his film, and deserved to be taken seriously, is disrespected/treated as a joke more often than not. Sure, he & Mj√∂lnir get to kick a fair amount of butt, but not nearly enough as they should have. He doesn't even get to be the one who takes down Loki in the end or saves everyone. That would be the Hulk and Iron Man. Tony winds up being the one to save the city, he and Pepper in the Stark building are the last ones we see before the movie ends (not counting the mid-credits scene, that is. And no, there's no scene after the credits. At least not in the version I saw). Such a shame that Thor gets screwed over...though he does get at least one good line. It'll be interesting to see the next Thor film pick up where we leave Thor & Loki at the end of this film.<br/><br/>Hawkeye fans might be a tad miffed that he spends most of the film as a 'bad guy', but he does eventually return to the side of good and has a back-story between him and Natasha explored. Nick Fury gets to be all sneaky/manipulative and jumps on the 'Let's blame Thor' train. He also shoots some stuff, as does his offsider Agent Hill (Cobie Smulders)...when she's not providing exposition or miraculously escaping death. The one actual good guy casualty of the film? You can probably guess.<br/><br/>Having said all this, and my few qualms aside, the film is actually exceptionally well-made. Whedon proves he can do action with the best of them, and his direction is blissfully free of overuse of shaky-cam. It's quite the feat, bringing all these characters from different films/universes together and actually making it work, but he does it. Splendidly. Not a dollar of the movie's considerable budget has been wasted. It's all up there on screen. Some of the humour works. All the actors do well in their roles, but I personally am looking more forward to further individual adventures with Thor and Cap in their own movies than I am the inevitable sequel to this movie. Though I wouldn't say no to seeing The Avengers reassemble."

Many other movies like The Dark Night or Iron man 1st movie where great cause of the sum of action but in this movie i think the producer should think a again to use all those stars wisely .

","Very short counter review from a long-time movie-freak (not so much a superhero-freak, although I read a lot of comic books).<br/><br/>The Avengers is completely overestimated in my mind. Why? It mostly reminded me Transformers 2 and Transformers 3 --- which were both god-awful movies. Very similar pointless action and destruction without any weight. If compared to Nolan's Batman -films, this is very cheap storytelling without gravity.<br/><br/>Also: I almost slept watching The Avengers. There is no threat what so ever. The villains are plastic robots. Very boring. No tangible psychology behind it.<br/><br/>There's no story. The flying ship is hugely boring. Most of the so called heroes are sissies in thighs (Thor, Loki, Arrow-Dude, Captain Boring etc) with exception of The Iron-Fellow who wears steel.<br/><br/>Anything good? Not really. I give one star from male-perspective -- Scarpetta Johansson (as it's nice to call her) is surprisingly watchable when trapped in her chair. Cheap trick, but works. Also other male star --- Hulk is interesting those few seconds he got reasonable sequences.<br/><br/>All in all. Two stars. There's only few seconds of interesting stuff to watch during this overlong 2,5h film. I try but fail to understand all the hype. Hopefully you can accept my reasoning."
"p_lesner","1","43","114","6 May 2012"," I'm sorry did I just see another Transformers movie?
","Just like with transformers movie(s) I started to get very bored half way through it; it's as if the special effects are so overwhelming that the plot is lost. Now that I think about it what was the plot? ah yes... a bad guy (with a bad script) leading an alien invasion through a gateway/wormhole above a major American city (New York). Did that not happened in the last Transformers flick? ah yes, but the city of choice was Chicago. I went to see it because the rating was high, I was fooled. I still believe a good movie deserves a good plot. If you like movies that look and feel like a video game with the cheat mode on this is for you, but if your IQ is above 80 or you're more then 12 years of age and looking for a plot don't look here."

","I find it hard to believe that a film which was mostly made on a computer has such a high average rating. Does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making? Avengers is 95% CGI, with a plot that is staggering in it's stupidity and unoriginality. Two of the so-called 'super-heroes' have no 'super' qualities at all - unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped-up arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers. All Black Widow does is what Emma Peel did 45 years ago - and half as well, i.e. kick ass. Even worse, the two best and most interesting Marvel characters, Iron Man and Hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them. Every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable, the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is Samuel L. Jackson'e uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take a stroll through, without making the least effort, and pick up a fat cheque at the other end. Now THAT IS a super power."
"tedg","Null","11","23","10 June 2012"," Other Worlds
","From time to time, I have the gift of unique movie audiences. I've watched ""The Brady Bunch"" in an after school audience of teen and preteen LA girls. Down the road from where I live is the Pat Robertson school of film where most students believe they are in a fight with the devil and film is a most powerful tool for Jesus, and I can feel that in the response to certain films. My home theater is in the midst of a significant military area, so I sit next to warriors and their families when wondering about the war movies I see. This includes the so-called seal team six, and all the navy pilots in the mideast.<br/><br/>But the most precious of shared dark space is when I am in Shanghai. I saw this film there, the only nonasian in the crowd ‚Äî other than the 7 year old I was with. Then after a period of reflection, rewatched 'The Empire Strikes Back.'<br/><br/>So I saw this film about the clash and merger of different worlds and dimensions while in full swim with that dynamic myself. (Chinese officials block access to IMDb, so this comment will be posted on my leaving.)<br/><br/>The Star Wars films, the first of them anyway, demand only two extensions of the universe beyond a projection into the future. We assume that the future (or we did then) would include large machines, space travel and expanded notions of universal governance. There is no particular need to modify what we accept as the world we live in on that account. The notion of the force, and how it is woven into Jungian family dynamics was the big leap, the thing that forces us to stretch our universe. I think I understand the appeal of this across ages and cultures.<br/><br/>The Marvel universe requires a different set of expansions. The time is now, yet we have world government and massive military machines and the same anachronistic limit on weapons. (There has been no advance in weapon technology: guns and swords.) We no longer need monsters to be designed to that actors can suit up, but even the CGI characters inherit this limit. But because they have to engage in hand-to-hand combat, we'll be asked only to assume beings more or less like us (but ugly) and big machines. They have the same notions of weapons (swords, guns, blasters) we have in both the real world and the cinematic sci-fi world.<br/><br/>These limits ask little of us, but they limit the battles to be that same old crap we have seen hundreds of times before. The only thing Marvel could have brought was competence. Whelon does that.<br/><br/>Where Marvel asks us to extend our universe is in the acceptance of complete, independent other worlds. These are not just different planets with the same physics, but different dimensions with (as much as the comic artists can imagine) different physics. This is a big assumption, and I suppose only a few enterprises (religious ones) can pull it off, because you have to take the space to define the different laws of the other dimensions.<br/><br/>Marvel had a crew of different artists and writers, and they did not start out with a combined universe in mind, until a few managers until they combined several weak characters to sell more comics. (Stan Lee takes the credit for this, and I do not know the history well enough to dispute it.)<br/><br/>So we have Tony Stark who really asks that we believe that the reach of technology will expand. We have several Marvel characters that also require only that we accept normal scientific accidents: radiation-based usually. The main disruptive device here is a crystal that asks only that we believe it emits some unknown radiation. This is only a cousin to the mysteries of the LHC. That takes care of Fury, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. Hawk and Widow are just spies with extraordinary training (along the lines of Batman).<br/><br/>Thor, Loki, Asgard and the creatures from yet a third dimension are what expands this. We are asked to believe in an open, manyworld universe. Not other planets (as with Superman). Not humanmastered magic (Harry Potter, the Jedi, Dr Strange), but other worlds. I credit Lewis Carroll with making this possible.<br/><br/>Having said that, what Whelon does is allow the character interplay to be a reflection (that is, folded) commentary on these assumptions. Everyone among the 8 or so members of the team looks at and questions the worlds of the other. This is where the Chinese context comes in. I suppose in the US, Captain America is seen as partly a joke, what we shorthand as only a ""cartoon,"" but here that distinction is lost -- especially as the actor is encouraged to take his role seriously. Here, what we have is Team America taken seriously.<br/><br/>What is seen here ‚Äî and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market ‚Äî is a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command. He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even ‚Äî and no one should be surprised by this ‚Äî has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here.<br/><br/>Oh and the redheaded girl, with the spotty past, guile and commitment to do good.<br/><br/>I have no idea what effect this will have on global audiences. The Marvel franchise is now as powerful as that of Star Wars and Potter, and much more able to be mapped to current events. Fury even references them. But I can tell you that this was a thrilling experience, to see this with the additional fold of the audience, some of whom looked away from me when leaving the theater.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"michiganfan","6","11","23","26 May 2012"," Didn't Get the Hype
","I went into this movie with high expectations. I avoided reviews and went in unspoiled. I am a fan of the Iron Man movies, but I didn't see the newest Hulk movie, Thor or Captain America. This movie seemed to be lacking in character development and back story that make movies like the first Iron Man, X-men and The Dark Knight exceptional. It felt like I should have done my homework before seeing this one. This movie had a lot of action, but I never felt connected to the characters I hadn't seen before - Captain America, Thor, the Scarlett Johanssen character and the Jeremy Renner character. The Hulk was very inconsistent as well. In some parts of the movie he was uncontrollable, and in other parts he was a team player. And how did Hawk Eye take so long run out of arrows??? My idea of a ""great"" movie is that you get to know the characters through the movie itself. I shouldn't be expected to watch four or five other movies to get it. I enjoyed it, just not as much as I would have expected. Both my wife and I needed to get to the credits see get the character names of Black Widow and Hawk Eye. I'll go back and watch those other movies and maybe I'll appreciate it more."
"McGrit","Null","11","23","24 April 2012"," It gets everything right! What other movies will be measured to in the years that follow.
","Marvel's Avengers is everything a movie should be, and more. It goes without saying that it's the best film of the year to date. There's a serious subtext to the story and great characterization throughout but its focus is on the amazing. As an adventure film, it really has no parallel. When a movie reinvents a popular genre, it speaks volumes. This movie does just that and accomplishes what they've promised us since the first Iron Man movie... giving us that ""bigger universe"" in all its glory. <br/><br/>The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting coupled with the writing. Meaning that every character has the perfect dialogue and every quality actor inhabits the hero they portray perfectly. Downey has Stark down cold but we knew that already. He's just given the right stage to shine here. Evans finds his pathos and his chops in this film as Steve Rogers. The Boy Scout all-American has an edge this time around. Hemsworth's Thor has understandable rationale for joining and doing what he does throughout the movie. His inner turmoil and guilt is exquisite. Tom Hiddleston certainly has the acting chops to hang with any movie villain EVER and he's perfect because this is no one dimensional character and his motivation and progression since the Thor film is seen and felt. Samuel L Jackson actually has something to do in this movie... PRAISE BE! Jeremy Renner is a nice addition and even with all the big guns chewing up every scene, he shines. Movie goers will want to see more of his character in the future guaranteed. Scarlett Johansson adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the complex yet sexy female lead and a match for any male on screen. Would you expect any less from a Joss Whedon film? The interaction, conflict/turmoil and the relationships all work well and is definitely one of the highlights of the entire movie itself.<br/><br/>Add some of the best kick-butt action sequences that I've ever seen and Avengers is what other movies will be measured to in the years that follow."
"MtnsOMadness","10","7","13","21 August 2012"," Bar-None Best Super Hero Movie Ever
","Joss Whedon pulled off what many said could not be done. He created a super hero epic with a team of super-heroes. Many excuses have been used over the years (It will be too expensive and never recoup the cost, too many plots to tie together, every actor(ess) will want to be the major focus and blah blah blah), but now everyone knows it can be done and done well.<br/><br/>The scope of this project was years in the making starting with Iron Man back in 2008, followed by The Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor. These movies filled in the back story for all but three of the characters in the Avengers (Hawkeye, the Black Widow and Nick Fury even though Nick Fury shows up in all of the movies and Black Widow and Hawkeye make guest appearance in Iron Man and Thor respectively). This ""back story"" allows Joss to focus on the plot of this movie instead of having to explain how all the heroes came to be.<br/><br/>There is not an actor or actress in this movie that didn't pull off their role excellently. I am not sure whether this is do the quality of actors or Joss Whedon's devotion to comic books and his directing prowess. I think the surprise in this film though has to go to the Hulk and Bruce Banner played by Mark Ruffalo. He had just the right amount of innocence and hidden angst as Banner and his one liners as the Hulk were spot on. Another discovered gem, although we saw her before in Iron Man, was Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow. Her ability to use her supposed feminine frailty as a weapon was a surprise each time it was used.<br/><br/>The villain Loki played by Tom Hiddleston was outstanding as well. Loki and the alien menace he contacted were the perfect combination to threaten the entire planet and bring together the worlds greatest heroes to defend their home.<br/><br/>If you do not know this it probably means you have been living under a rock in movie land. Almost all Comic Moves now have a ""hidden"" Easter egg after the credits. This movie had two such Easter Eggs.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this movie so if you haven't seen it and you consider yourself a comic book fan then you should be banned from all geek fest's hence forth until you have seen this movie. For all the rest of you out there .... Go See This Movie.<br/><br/>The Panel votes: Cthulhu: 10 out of 10 (Thanos is awesome. I am so excited, I killed 300 dreamers on the cruise ship Atlantis when it floated too close to the lost city of Rlyeh) Fuzzy Toad: 8 out of 10 (Comic book violence is high and children under 8 might get scared of the Hulk and alien invaders. If they are a fan of Comic books however I am sure they will love it.) Mouth-Breather: 12 out of 10 (OMG! OMG! Best movie ever.... And I told all you losers Hulk could beat Thor.) Frat-Boy Bob: 10 out of 10 (Scarlett Johannson is delicious. The action was awesome. ""Puny God"" LMAO...) The Queen in Yellow: 7 out of 10 (Still tired of Comic Book movies but this one is very exciting.) Azathoth: Googol out of Infinity (Whispers of madness in the dark) (************Super Spoiler Alert*************) For those of you who have not seen the movie do not read past here.<br/><br/>I think one of the best part of the villainy is who was revealed at the end of the movie. The true menace to mankind and a power that dwarfs that of Loki and quite possibly the Avengers themselves.<br/><br/>The first Easter Egg showed us who the villain behind Loki was in this movie and who will be the villain in the next movie. That villain is Thanos the lover of Death herself.<br/><br/>The second Easter Egg you have to see for yourself."
"ElSofoque","9","7","13","2 June 2012"," The best superhero film since The Dark Knight
","I watched it for the fourth time yesterday in theaters on 3D and damn¬ÖI love this film to bits and it just keeps getting better with each subsequent viewing. It is hands down the best experience I've had at the theater in years.<br/><br/>Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Loki, Fury, Hill, Widow, Hawkeye, Coulson, etc; having all these larger than life characters in a single movie can be a daunting task and could have gone wrong rather easily. But the film manages to make it work perfectly by balancing all the characters so that none of them feel like filler or as being disregarded due to undue attention being given to other characters. All are presented and introduced well, have their chance to shine and to show us about themselves and they all ad something of substance to the film. From Maria Hill to Nick Fury to Thor and Iron man, each one of them has their moment in the film and are portrayed in such a way that the audience can relate to them.<br/><br/>While the story is indeed simple, to critique the film on this aspect is to miss the point as the purpose of the story is to get everyone together to fight a common goal, which is the driving idea behind the Avengers initiative. On that count, the story works wonderfully and the drama and tension is rather created by the characters who are the focus and forte of the film. Their interaction, chemistry and motivations are what drive the film and draws you in. They are all drawn and presented so well that you end up loving and actually caring for these characters and like a good friend whose company you enjoy, you just want to see them again and again, something which plays into the replay value of the film, which to my mind is incredibly high.<br/><br/>For a film that depends so much on it's characters, it is essential that the actors portraying them do a good job and on this front the movie excels as well. Everyone brought their A-Game to the film and did a wonderful work with their respective characters. Robert was great as usual as Tony stark and Ruffalo with his very nuanced performance is hand down the best Banner/Hulk to ever grace a film. His chemistry with Robert in their scenes on the Helicarrier was amazing as well. Hiddleston shows an incredible range on his portrayal of Loki, most noticeably in his scenes with Thor in the mountains (Hemsworth is also great here) and with Black Widow when he is captured in the Helicarrier. Scarlett in particular surprised me, after a bit of a one note performance in Iron Man 2, she brings more depth and a more human side to her character in this film; specially in her scenes with Banner/Hulk, where we see her show a fearful/vulnerable side of her character. Jeremy is always great and this doesn't changes with his portrayal of Hawkeye as was Jackson with Nick Fury. All in all, everyone did great in terms of acting in this film.<br/><br/>The heroes in particular, whom we first met in their respective solo films, are shown here to have evolved since we last met them. From Captain America's feelings as being a man out of time who is trying to find his own purpose in this new world he just woke up in, to Thor's more mature albeit still conflicted nature due to his love for Loki, to a Loki who is confident, more menacing and determined than the confused Loki we left in Thor, to Tony Stark who is now in the clean energy business and is more than meets the eye to a Banner who is now in control of his ""other guy"" but who wonders why he survived the incident, all the heroes show more depth and complexity than they did in the previous films. You add to this the humanity of Black Widow, Fury, Hill, Coulson and Hawkeye and you have an incredible rich and wide palette of texture within the film; and like a great painting, it is all balanced out perfectly.<br/><br/>This great balance between the characters that the film achieves is seen as well in it's action sequences. The film has two big action scenes, the one in the Helicarrier and the other in the City, and in both we can see all the heroes jumping into the action and even achieving something worthwhile. The action sequences are also very well choreographed and edited, with none of the mindless, fast cut editing or excessive slow-motion clich√© that is so common in many of today's films. You can easily follow and keep track of what's going on during each scene. One of my favorite parts is the virtuoso sequence during the final act where the camera continuously follows the action from one Avenger to the next, starting with Black Widow, then following Iron Man who joins up Captain America, then Iron Man passing through Hawkeye whose arrow then the camera follows to where Thor and Hulk are fighting. It truly shows how all of them are working together, fulfilling their respective roles as The Avengers.<br/><br/>The script of the film is fantastic as is the dialog and along with the film's pacing very tight. All scenes have a purpose and feel like mini pieces that could stand on their own, specially the ones during the first part of the film where each of the heroes is being introduced. The scenes lead beautifully to one another tied in by the dialog and at no point does one feels like the film is dragging or that some particular scene is filler.<br/><br/>The Avengers has it all, the film manages to provide an amazing mix of action, humor and drama that keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end and when the film ends, you just feel like watching it all over again."

","This movie is meant for those 8 and up. It is also meant for those who like SciFi Fantasy. The Avengers, a group of single comic book heroes, get together to save the world from Lokki. Samuel Jackson, the head of the Earth's protective forces, plays his role well. The characters are shallow, but let's face it, it's comic book time. It is fast paced and contains interesting toys and gadgets. It works as a great party movie. I loved the sets, the colors, and the characters, all in one film. Thor even comes to the rescue. All in all, the movie is very entertaining and is well worth its greater than 2 hour booty killer time. Get a bowl of pop corn and a group of friends, turn this movie into a SciFi party.

","The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.<br/><br/>Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.<br/><br/>I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.<br/><br/>I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.<br/><br/>Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10"

","With all the positive reviews and word-of-mouth about this movie (not to mention the box office receipts) I went into this movie expecting to be wowed. I'm talking wowed along the lines of what I was having left the theater the first time I saw The Dark Knight. I waited and waited and waited. I was never wowed.<br/><br/>Now, this wasn't a bad movie by any means - it just didn't come anywhere close to being as good as it was advertised. Iron Man and the Hulk were scene-stealers, Hawkeye, Capt. America and Black Widow were OK and every time Thor had to utter a line, it made me want to cringe (his character was so overacted by Chris Hemsworth). But most disappointing of all, the villain was a total wimp - not scary, not menacing and not cool whatsoever. (Not to mention the regurgitated plot lines: alien takeover, yeah didn't see that in the final Transformers installment; Loki being captured, wasn't that part of the Joker's plan in TDK?; etc) Overall, not a bad movie - but lower your expectations. It's fun and entertaining, but not a whole lot else."

","One thing that I do not understand is how people could hate on this wonderous mash-up in film history. First time it has ever been done on a comic-book scale like this. The story has a working heart, tons of action and a sense of humor all around a basic-comic book story (which some people tend to rebuke). However with the basic plot, it preserves the film's sanity, for with a complex and darker plot, the film would contain that of a messy fashion. Hands down, one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, being a DC fanatic and a comic-book reader, I acknowledge the greatness that sparks out of this film. Don't listen to what some mistaken others say, watch this amazing movie and watch it at the proper guidelines expecting a simple, action-packed cinematic MARVEL. The main villain Loki provides some of the best villainy I've seen following Heath Ledger as Joker."

"ticket_for_one","9","9","18","29 April 2012"," this is why I love movies
","Finally the Avengers have hit our screens. It's taken a long time to put this movie together. This idea is apparently 15 years in the making. I collected Marvel comics back in school. And the idea of having some of my favourite superheroes in one film was a celluloid dream I wanted to become realised. 20 years later that dream has been realised. I am more than happy to report that Marvel has surpassed my expectations with this Goliath of a superhero film. The Avengers is an excellent movie. One I recommend you see more than once (if you can afford it) in the cinema.<br/><br/>Each of our heroes has their own introduction. From Black Widow beating up her captors after an interrogation to Thor surrounded by lightning hijacking a plane to take his imprisoned brother Loki. We more or less know who the heroes are, but it would help to watch the previous Marvel films to avoid confusion regarding the story behind the antagonists and protagonists. When the team finally assembles as the title suggests. They don't all get on with each other. Cap has an issue with Iron Man, Bruce Banner does his best to restrain the power of the Hulk, Nick Fury has a hidden agenda and Thor thinks everyone is petty as well as tiny. It takes an attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D HQ and a major tragedy before they decide they must band together to fight Loki and the Chitauri.<br/><br/>So where do I start? From start to finish every one of the heroes gets their moment in the sun. But If I were to list my 3 favourites, it would be Hulk, Iron Man and Captain America. Hulk for starters is just classic Hulk. 'HULK CRASH' and 'HULK SMASH'. Everything we saw do in The Hulk in the first two films and more as the Hulk is given full reign to let loose on the bad guys. One scene in particular where the Hulk takes on Loki will have you laughing out of your chair. Mark Ruffalo does a great job as Banner. He shows a wittier side to the character than any of the other actors in the previous Hulk films. In fact he's more reminiscent of how Bill Bixby played Banner in the TV series. Robert Downey Jr continues to affirm why he was chosen as Iron Man/Tony Stark. He's naturally a funny man and I'm sure Joss Whedon allowed him to improvise some of his scenes. Just great in every scene, funny, charismatic and handles the dramatic scenes with such ease. Chris Evans as Captain America is perfect casting. Brought a natural leadership quality to his character, but at the same time he makes clearly evident that Cap is still learning and adjusting to the new world he lives in. Evans is growing as an actor and his performance in this won't do his CV any harm at all.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth owns Thor. His walk the way he talks and how he interacts with his team. Again Hemsworth like the rest showing his was the best choice to play his character. Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson get a lot of screen time. Hawkeye and Black Widow are the only non powered heroes but are very good at what they do. In this interpretation they are agents for S.H.I.E.L.D who have a history together. The chemistry between the two is great without there being any sexual tension. They two work well together and really brought depth to their characters. Samuel L Jackson (my favourite actor) just owns the Nick Fury character and has such presence it's a shame he misses out on the grand finale. The grand finale is just awesome. I'm talking first Transformers movie awesome. Almost the whole of New York gets decimated whilst the Avengers battle the Chitauri. This is where you see the team finally come to together and bring the fight to Loki. Who by the way is played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston. A really nasty piece of work and quite mischievous too, especially with the way he plays with Avengers like rooks on a chess board. A great villain played by a gifted actor. The set pieces are just well filmed and well executed. Joss Whedon the man behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly has just outdone himself here. Avengers has a good story and such a wonderful well balanced script and it's also very funny. You'll probably find that this is one of the funniest films of the year. Zak Penn's writing just works well with the story and Joss Whedon's direction is perfect for a film such as this. Even in scenes where you might sense a little drag. The dialogue is good enough to carry those scenes. No shaky cam scenes, bizarre off tone moments or any Ang Lee story board action scenes like the first HULK movie. It focuses on the characters, their personal battles and the jobs they have to do to keep the world safe.<br/><br/>There's nothing I didn't like. Apart from one corny cringe-worthy scene involving Iron Man, but everything else was fine, just fine. All in all The Avengers is the superhero movie I've been waiting for 20 years to happen. Marvel has done an amazing job with all these films. And the scene mid credits just made me want even more. So I really hope the sequel happens and I hope Joss Whedon returns to film it. I can't praise this movie enough and I recommend highly. For Fan Boys and those who love movies in general. Films like the Avengers Assemble are why I go to the movies and why I love films. GO SEE THIS NOW! Also love the Soundgarden song at the end."
"wats-up-lol","9","9","18","29 April 2012"," Best Superhero Film Ever
","The best superhero movie ever. Its entertaining, fresh, humorous and clever. All the superheros who appear in the film are fantastic, they are all included in the film equally so you don't really get the sense of a main character which is good.<br/><br/>Captain America was awesome, he takes leadership of the team during the end fight scene which is really cool, we see him really kick some ass in this film but I felt his costume looked a little rubbish compared to his original costume in 'Captain America'.<br/><br/>Thor didn't fail to impress, his costume was awesome but would of liked to of seen him wear his helmet in both the avengers and his own film like he does in the comics. His fight scene with Hulk was crazy, so good!!! Iron Man was awesome, he provided witty sarcasm that lightened the mood, he had some incredible action scenes and the special effects of his costume attaching itself to him in mid air was incredible.<br/><br/>I didn't think after watching the film that the Hulk would be my favorite character but he was, the film really changed when the Hulk was unleashed, he was destructive and powerful and was a force to be reckoned with in the film. The fight scene between him and Loki was hilarious! (well if you call it fighting, it was more like hulk playing with a toy) Black Widow was wicked, had some bad ass fighting moves which contributed to the film massively. And she was super hot! And had some kick ass fight scenes.<br/><br/>I didn't really think the movie needed Hawkeye but I was wrong, he was a really cool addition to the film and featured in the storyline massively and had some awesome action scenes at the end. I didn't think there was ever going to be a superhero movie which rivaled that of 'The Dark Knight' but there is and its called 'Avengers Assemble'!!!!!"
"sinfieldl","10","9","18","28 April 2012"," Entertaining? I prefer EPIC!
","Avengers Assemble. As a 21 year old Marvel fan/Comic fan i've been looking forward to this movie since the announcement of its production, and i'm happy to report that my excitement wasn't in vain. I've always said that an epic movie must make you want to immediately see it again, and the Avengers has done just that.<br/><br/>One of the many things that i loved about this movie was that it is obvious that the production team has taken time to research Avenger comics and cartoons. I have seen many criticisms made by the general public of a certain character (Hulk) and about how he is different from the last two films. What these people don't realise is that the way the Hulk is portrayed in the Avengers is the way he was created by Stan Lee & CO, if anything the Hulk is proof of the hard work and dedication that the production team has put in to making this movie.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the film, but i'm not. I just recommend everyone to see it in cinema. Perferably in 2D as 3D suck (in my opinion)! Avengers Assemble is the best film i've ever seen. . . so far. Stay tuned for Dark Knight Rises!"
"uncle-scrooch","10","9","18","27 April 2012"," Truly Perfect Superhero Films..
","I went into this movie with very high expectations cause I watched all the trailers about 30 times each. I will say from the very first 10 minutes of the films I was instantly blown away by the action and the course of the story. All the characters in this film get an equal amount of screen time, which is usually the problem in a film where you deal with multiple characters such as in this film. I applaud Joss Whedon for making this Marvel Masterpiece, the way everything fits together in this film is truly amazing and its close to impossible to find any holes in the story. Mr Whedon was the perfect person to have dealt with telling this story as he's a comic book fan, he nailed it 100%. I believe i'm going to see this film again tomorrow, it is just that awesome. Hulk will give you a fun time in this film, watch out!"
"Various_Things","10","9","18","27 April 2012"," Gloriously entertaining, and extremely well-balanced across its large cast of characters
","Avengers (all right, ""Avengers Assemble"" if you insist) is really quite extraordinarily good. It's pretty much everything that's fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen - I was hoping for as much from Joss Whedon and he delivered.<br/><br/>Like Serenity and the Buffy season 5 finale, it's extremely well-structured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes; I can't think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so well-balanced between them all, and all the different combinations of arguments and team-ups between them.<br/><br/>It's also extremely funny (but *mostly* not in that trademark Joss Whedon ""Buffyspeak"" way that some VERY WRONG people find ""precious"" and annoying). It has better Tony Stark dialogue than either Iron Man movie! Having said that, the funniest gags are visual ones that involve the Hulk...<br/><br/>I often complain that superhero films' weakest parts tend to be their climactic action sequences: the stakes are raised, and believability is strained. Well, for once we have a superhero film whose best action scene comes at the end. It's one of the best-sustained action finales since The Matrix - and much better-directed than the incomprehensible shots of The Dark Knight. It's constantly spectacular and contains countless satisfying moments in both action and dialogue - most of which also happen to be very funny.<br/><br/>But the best *single scene* in the whole film isn't an action scene! A standard phrase Joss Whedon has used in promotional interviews is ""I wanted to figure out why all these different characters should even be in the same room as each other"". Well, that scene where they *are* all in the same room as each other turned out to be the film's absolute highlight. Scenes like that are what I'll look forward to on subsequent viewings. There have been lots of action films that I've enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to re-watch because that they didn't have much else going for them (Avatar comes to mind) - but this isn't one of them.<br/><br/>The film's plot isn't exactly intricate: it's extremely tightly focused around the MacGuffin from Thor and Captain America. However, this isn't a bad thing: in a film of this scale, ensuring the characterisation and action is satisfying is an ambitious balancing act as it is, without adding a complex twisty-turny plot to the mix as well.<br/><br/>The film doesn't carry any sort of larger real-world message; it's really just a movie about these specific characters - about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other. But as far as movies about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other go... well, it's hard to imagine how they could get much better."
"leahawke","10","9","18","27 April 2012"," Quite possibly the best comic adaptation I have ever seen.
","I am a HUGE Marvel fan. While I haven't read most of the comics in years I still enjoy the characters. Stan lee is a genius and it is wonderful to see his creations coming to the big screen and NOT be a poor, bad acted, cheesy, knock off. This movie, says it all. It shows everyone exactly why they love these comics. And that is simply that we can all be more than the sum of what we are, or perceive ourselves to be. <br/><br/>The prior movies are also very close to my heart. Iron man sold me on Robert Downing Jr. again as an actor and someone who can rise above. RDJ personifies Iron Man perfectly, there is no other actor that could ever come close. The turmoil he has in this movie, the battle between his ego and doing what is right despite personal loss is, well, it's a work of pure art. <br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth once again shows the world that a man can play a god. He does it with grace and strength, and with my humble opinion; a human element, knowing that while he is stronger than all of his counterparts physically (except Hulk) he is also weak. He gives a character that could have easily have been a ""I am better than you because I am a god"" a sense of humanity and humility. Thor is a protector of earth, and he protects her with a fierce resolve. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo, while I was a bit disappointed that Ed Norton would not be playing Hulk, I was happy and thrilled with the choice. Mr. Ruffalo shows all aspects of the Hulk with smooth, fluid motion. The anger he has to contain, the control he has, he should teach a class on anger management. He shows what I believe to be a true Hulk. The human that fights the beast within. Who among us can say we don't have a little of that in us? <br/><br/>Chris Evans, he was the Torch, a cocky, show off that loved the lime light. I was worried about him being a soldier, THE soldier. When I saw Captain America I was blown away by his scope. Something he continues to bring to this movie. He portrays The Captain as a soldier, a soldier out of time. And yet he is quick to adapt, and lead a group of people that you wouldn't imagine could be a team. He honors Captain America with his portrayal of him. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, I haven't seen many of his movies, but the ones I have I have enjoyed immensely. He took a character that could have easily been just a side note and made him shine. Showing the elements you would expect to see in an assassin. I truly hope that we get to see a solo act for him, I think it would be worth it. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson continues to portray The Black Widow with skill and grace. She is beautiful and deadly, the perfect Black Widow. Maybe a movie with her and Jeremy Renner? Something to think about. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was inspired. And in this film you actually get to see more than just Nick Fury popping in for some advice giving and then popping back out. He shows that Nick Fury is a bad ass to be reckoned with. Even standing up to those in charge when he knows their decision is wrong. <br/><br/>Clark Gregg, aka Agent Coulson, I will tell you the truth here, I thought he was nothing more than a filler, but he nearly stole the show for me. He did an incredible job, and has in all of these films. He shows an agent that is direct and very much a ""man in black"", but then you find that he, well, he has the biggest heart. And he delivers it with a fantastic dry wit. The entire movie was bound together effortlessly with poise, and that sense that we as lowly humans will not back down in the face of impending death, but will fight it until there is no more of us.<br/><br/>The last person I want to mention is Joss Whedon. I LOVE this genius, this man who can seamlessly put danger, action, and humor together. He did it with Buffy, Angel, and Firefly. I admire his work to the point that I will watch anything, and everything of his. He was the perfect choice for this, and I can' wait to see what he comes up with next.<br/><br/>The overview of this movie is simply, words can no do it justice. It was not just a movie, it was truly an experience. You are sucked into the story, shown by so many different aspects. I have been disappointed with some of the comic movies, X-men:Final Stand, comes to mind (someone please tell me, WHERE in the X-men comics did Charles die? Last I checked he didn't). And with those disappointments comes that lingering feeling of doubt that the movie will not live up to it's hype. I was thrilled that not only did The Avengers, live up to its hype. It surpassed it. <br/><br/>I have only one humble request, that the next one have Spider-man, and Wolverine. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone, as it is the personification of why we go to movies, and why this business is a multi-billion dollar one. That we all need to escape our tired lives for a little while and be swept away to a world where, just for two hours, everything makes sense. The bad guys always lose, and the good guys win, with style. :)"

Nick Fury convinces them all to join the Avengers Initiative ,which later leads to confusion brawl and Fights on the inside¬ÖAll is taken lightly until the realization and attack on the Base which proves that the whole world is at stake. The Screenplay as well as the Storyline is Amazing, every scene handled with perfection. The Story is well explained and gives a break from the Action which keeps you In the Movie. The Cinematography is Awesome and Exceptional with the Direction and Special Effects Justifies the Storyboard and is Realistic...All the Action Sequences are well Coordinated, Engaging and with popping 3D effects well in place it's a treat to the eye. The Screen Space is shared equally and handled well between the Large Cast... About the Soundtrack it's Average, nothing Extraordinary or Provoking. The movie just misses out somewhere on the Emotions. The Previous releases have already made the Superheroes Familiar and this avoids much confusion. Well Edited and Brilliantly Adapted screenplay makes the most of the Storyline and even handles the major challenge that could have been faced of making Order of Chaos. The much Hyped movie has definitely met the expectations and is perfect blockbuster. Even watch it from some fresh Action from Hulk, Black Widow, and The Hawkeye who don't disappoint you at all. Mark Raffalo's performance and Character is noticeable out of all the other Star Superheroes. No doubt the best superhero movie this Decade. 3 time watch for Comic Superhero Movie fans. 2 time for Super Action Fans. And at least a onetime must watch for every other Hollywood Movie Buff out there."

Coming to the cast Robert Downey Junior is impressive..he can be termed as ""The Jack Sparrow"" of the avengers with his cheeky lines.. Chris Evans,Chris Hemsworth,Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are impressive..but the biggest surprise is Mark Rufallo as the Dr.Bruce Banner a.k.a the Hulk(""the other guy"")..he Delivers probably the best scenes in the movie and oh boy he steals the show big time..!! never enjoyed anything on big screen as him(The Hulk)..coming to the others Tom Hiddleston is good as a much formidable opponent to the group of superheroes, slimy and evil in equal measure.

Joss Whedon takes four different visions of directors and makes it his own. This is the ultimate pay off for marvel's five years of planning and hard work. The team dynamics Whedon captured perfectly in ""firefly"" are in full display here. Every person has motive and a relation with the other. Special mention to the HULK. You literally don't see anything when he is on the scree. This is the peak of entertainment. The stunning action, the witty dialog makes it irresistible.<br/><br/>Avengers makes it fun to be a geek. If you like intelligent humor, thrilling story and larger than life action in your movie, then Avengers is for you. There were claps, cheers and shouts all around in the cinema.

"DarthVoorhees","5","12","26","29 May 2012"," Essentially 'Transformers:Dark of the Moon' if it were made competently...
","'The Avengers' is a brilliant cartoon with tremendous flair, style, and more than it's share of silliness. Director Joss Whedon is allowed free reign to present a massive spectacle of action and destruction and it is often very visually spectacular and often more than fun. Is 'The Avengers' the comic book masterpiece awaited for years by geeks everywhere? No. It isn't even Marvel's best offering as an independent studio. The only level 'The Avengers' really succeeds on is being a huge cartoon. It offers nothing truly unique in realm of dealing with these characters or their mythology. If the modern day comic book is a romanticized colorful dissection of hero worship and good and evil as I and a great many comic book fans like to think it is than Joss Whedon has ultimately failed in respecting that and using it to give his audiences something to chew on. In a great many ways I found myself brought back to the horrendous experience last summer of watching another huge action spectacle, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. 'The Avengers' is in many ways the same movie, neither have any sense of stakes other than to make sequels. Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor are here to sell toys and tickets.<br/><br/>Epicness is what is on the table in this film and Joss Whedon surely does deliver an epic action packed film. Delivering an action packed film isn't all that hard to do though. There are no stakes to 'The Avengers'. Missing is a sense of dread and threat. I wanted our heroes to really be tested by something bigger than themselves and they aren't. I sing the praises of Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and you know what Jon Favreau's first 'Iron Man' film because they truly brought our characters to a point where they had to question what made them heroes and if being a hero was more than just paraphernalia. Both films created tremendously strong villains which served as representations of all that could be corrupted and made evil within the title heroes. The threat in 'The Avengers' comes in the form of a pretty lame mcguffin. We find out next to nothing about the tesseract cube other than it can blow stuff up in a Michael Bay-esque fashion. The threat to our heroes is pretty dull and lackluster. Often our heroes have to spend time reminding us they are saving the world because we forget. I wanted to be reminded that our heroes bleed and can die. Kill off a sacrificial lamb and keep me interested. (I know the retort here about Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson and he is a very fun character but he merely serves as a second rate sidekick)<br/><br/>I think every actor in here is having a blast in their roles and I love seeing it. I don't necessarily think they are all taking their roles seriously but I do think they are engaging all the great things that make these characters pulp icons. My favorite performance has to be Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Loki isn't all that rounded a villain or character but Hiddleston loves the comic book nature of the character. Saying you want to take over the world often is a silly empty threat and yet if someone says it the right way it is fun.<br/><br/>The final battle scene is grand as promised. Is it fun? Yes. That is something I do want to reiterate because the film is fun. There is something to be said about enjoying eye candy and things blowing up. 'The Avengers' is a masterpiece if that is what we are concerned with. Does the battle go on too long? I didn't check my watch nearly as much as I did during 'Dark of the Moon' but yes it is drawn out. I think I wouldn't feel this way though had the problems mentioned earlier been addressed. The chitauri are just plot pieces and even though we see our heroes take some hits never do we see any real toil this has on them. What is 'The Avengers'? A cartoon. The kid in me was satisfied with all the action but the adult in me wanted more.<br/><br/>I think with 'The Avengers' we have a cinematic Rorschach with everyone getting something they want out of it and rating it much higher than it truly deserves. I saw it opening weekend and have pondered over it amidst the fanfare. Is it a good film? Yes, if you hold it up as a summer blockbuster it is an exceptional fun filled ride. Is it a substantive film? No, if you want a substantive comic book film than see 'The Dark Knight' or 'Iron Man'."
"zepereboide","10","12","26","14 April 2012"," More than a super hero movie... A super hero epic!
","I could say that the footage we all have seen from Avengers doesn't do it justice. I mean, you could thought that i'm lying, but... Hell no! I have to say that I was truly skeptical about this film, but I was damn wrong! Joss Whedon has pulled off one of the best superhero flicks i've ever seen. It does not hit The Dark Knight, but it's the best Marvel Studios film so far. Anyway. The Avengers was EPIC. Good writing, good performances, good action scenes. My god, it's really great. Action packed that unite Cap, Iron Man, Thor and HULK!!! Hulk really hit it off. One of the greatest surprises of the film. I guess even haters will enjoy.<br/><br/>That is all."
"lulumary123","2","17","40","9 May 2012"," A waste of time, money and Joss Whedon
","As I finished watching the Avengers, the main thought in my head was, why on earth did they get Joss Whedon to write this???? Whedon is a master of witty, earthy dialogue and anyone who's ever watched Buffy, Angel or Firefly knows that he can direct action scenes and powerful interpersonal character connections, often in the same scene. Who directed this bland, one-dimensional shoot-em-up and what have you done with Joss Whedon? <br/><br/>This humorless CGI fest could have been handled by any number of robotic Hollywood hacks. I looked forward to this movie because I was over the moon with excitement at the thought that it COULDN'T be a typical jump-cut, screaming video game, and that's pretty much what we have here. The jokes are flat and the dialogue is embarrassing. I thought Scarlett Johannsson was charming, and I usually don't like her too much. But even worse is how the always incredibly watchable Mark Ruffalo was rendered a total snooze, how is that possible? Robert Downey is sarcastic as always and fun to watch but... God, it was just SO not good, a real letdown all around, like potential greatness flattened and made super dumb by the Hollywood crap machine"
"adamsjost","6","10","21","6 November 2013"," Lacks personality
","While I found the action and story decently pleasing overall, I think the movie spread itself incredibly thin in terms of characterization and as such suffers from a distinct lack of personality. I understand that Marvel thought they could forego character development because each character had their own movie (with the exception of the Hulk, as this version is a reboot), I think that there needs to be a lot more going on in order for the characters to be likable. All of the dialogue is either puns, one-liners, or witticisms, as if the movie is one big joke and the actors are constantly winking at the audience. The action and story are pleasing and well thought out, but the characters are completely lacking."
"darknezzx-594-586065","4","10","21","28 January 2013"," Ehh-- not good.
","Not very good- loosely based on the comic. Character development is poorly done. All these characters just meet and then get to know so much about each other in so short amount of time. External information about the ""bad guy"" is learned to quickly. How can you tell his habits if he has only just been introduced to you a few hours ago..? I was really looking forward to this movie, heard so many good things, but it was a total bust. ANDDD.. the amount of info known about the Hulk before they even meet is a lot- like the security guard when he falls down. This is prefect for a comic- but bad movie adaptation. More time would be needed for the development and information to make sense accordingly."
"joshua-303-92778","4","10","21","21 August 2012"," Very mediocre. Certainly doesn't warrant the current rating on IMDb
","Of all the recent Marvel movies which led to this film, I thought Thor was pretty decent, and the rest were blah. ""Avengers"" is arguably the worst yet.<br/><br/>The film reminded me of Transformers 3, with constant explosions and destroyed buildings, as well as ubiquitous 3D scenes which actually don't look very realistic. This movie is a gimmick.<br/><br/>The plot is utterly clich√© and haphazard. The dialogue, save for a few funny lines, is very bad. No great acting except for Loki, and he seems out of place among wooden performances. Even the editing was pretty lazy. This ""movie"" seems more like a TV serial with forced dialog.<br/><br/>The entire film is basically just a vehicle to watch the different heroes fighting with each other."
"wolveren","10","10","21","17 June 2012"," OK so I got carried away with this one.
","I am a Marvel fan comic or movie. This one really made the year for me in Marvel films. Specifically Robert Downey Jr. He stole the show here with the best performance ever. He got everything down to Stark's arrogance, eccentricity and excellence. Hats off to him. This has compiled every aspect of a total Avenger movie. What can I say, it's got gut, humor, and convincing transitions that keep you glued to the end. And I have got to say this now or never. Finally the hulk speaks. I have been waiting years for that. The one punch liner totally blew me. I will spare Bruce Banner roles as Mark Ruffalo really came out doing a good job here. Chris Hemsworth no doubt is Thor to me and is perfect. Chris Evans is great for a guy lost in time. Scarlett Johansson with her very flexible talent and shine. Who will argue with me on that? Jeremy Renner nailed it. Tom Hiddleston is perfect for Loki. Clark Gregg was cool and had a vital role here. Lastly but not the least, Samuel L. Jackson you are the man. The rest of the cast was seamless for me and they all did a splendid job. The special effects is explosive. It keeps me wanting for more. I'm a sucker for SFX. It's a comic book story and it's what I got and wanted all these years. I can't wait for another Avenger movie."
"jamsm-1","6","10","21","12 May 2012"," Not That Bad
","I enjoyed the movie. Not sure I understand all the platitudes it's getting here. I guess some people are just a bit over stimulated.<br/><br/>The movie could've done with a 20 minute cut towards the end to avoid going into 'Micheal Bay' territory. Maybe this time could have been used to further develop the characters and how they relate to each other.<br/><br/>The plot was also pretty weak, sometimes it was hard to figure out whether it was Transformers 2 or The Avengers, such was the similarity of pretty much everything at the end (including the aliens and CGI).<br/><br/>A solid 6/10."
"wrines","10","10","21","6 May 2012"," Best Superhero Movie Ever Made
","All I can say is ""WOW!"". After watching patiently every superhero movie since the original Superman in 1978 (most of them many times), I realize now that *this* was the one I have been waiting for. To say it was great would be incredibly unjust - there aren't many words to REALLY convey just how special it is. From the casting to the performances to the writing to the fine details to the effects to the dynamic interplay of the characters, this movie is simply hands down the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. I wont give any of it away, and there were too many moments to even begin to describe anyway, but I will for sure be going back to see it at least a couple more times (which I NEVER do)and its one of the very few I will for SURE purchase when it is available. Instant classic, and a defining moment for the superhero movie genre. On the way out of the IMAX 3D theater where I saw it, beyond being simply stunned, I had 2 further immediate thoughts: 1) It was SO mind-numbing, and SO far above any superhero movie I have ever seen, that it reminded me of seeing the 1st Lord of The Rings movie (Fellowship) and how I was similarly stunned and literally dazed upon exiting the cinema... 2) I cant for the life of me figure out WHY the powers that be at DC have not yet come out with a Justice League movie in a similar ensemble fashion - their management is asleep at the wheel if that is NOT in development. <br/><br/>Anyway back to the movie itself: Go see it, multiple times. You will thank me later."
"Meven_Stoffat","10","10","21","6 May 2012"," If you don't even remotely enjoy this movie, there's ""some assembly required"" on your brain
","My inner child is something I value most, and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my Iron Man and Captain America toys, as well as wishing I was the Incredible Hulk. I also remember watching the Hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next Captain America comic books. So as you can tell, I'm a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood, and that being said, it was with great excitement that I awaited The Avengers. Having seen all the Avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu-ray, I remember even watching them all up until Thursday May 3rd, which was when the midnight premiere took place. My buddy and I even wore Iron Man masks to the screening.<br/><br/>I'm most happy to report, to say The Avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement. It may just be the best comic book movie I've ever seen. It shines dozens of lamps on The Dark Knight and it makes the previous Avengers movies (even Thor, which I loved despite not having been familiar with the Thor mythos before seeing it) look like the Fantastic Four movies.¬†<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was pitch perfect. Starting with the script. Joss Whedon had penned the script and it's obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of The Avengers, but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about The Avengers. Everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right- Tony Stark was his usual lovable jerk self, and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love. He was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity. Captain America was his usual kickass self, and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love. Thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with Loki were just amazing. Particularly the scene near the end on Stark tower where he forces Loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks ""Is this what you want?"". Aso, FINALLY the Hulk has had justice done. He's given a sense of humour, which the other movies absolutely failed on. I'm happy to report the movie did not fail there. And who can forget the dialogue? Classic Avengers dialogs, down to the last inch. ""We need a plan of attack!"" ""I have a plan. Attack."" and ""WhTs the matter, not fond of thunder and lightning?"" ""I don't like what comes after.""<br/><br/>The characterization is really what counts here too. Obviously if you're going to a movie called The Avengers for a character study you're going to the wrong movie (and you need to lay off the artsy movies too, as they're clearly doing serious stuff to your brain), but for the type of movie it is, it's done supremely well. Each character is unique in their own right- I've already mentioned the eponymous superheroes, but Black Widow is one sexy and fun character that's hard not to love. Her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory, while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell. Hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when ¬†possessed by Loki, then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some Loki butt.¬†<br/><br/>The movie is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen thanks to lots of clever, Whedonian humour and appropriately placed Comic book style exaggeration. The scene where Hulk smashes Loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 Jump Street and any other comedy this year. And the scene where Hulk sucker punches Thor!<br/><br/>The performances are amazing as well. Pure commitment from all involved, with Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth, as well as Johannson, Smulders, Jackson, Hiddleston and Renner giving amazing performances all, but Ruffalo is the real surprise here. He brought something new to the table here as Hulk- every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling. His monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully. He was the biggest surprise and got everything about the Hulk perfect. Props to Ruffalo for FINALLY getting The Hulk exactly right!!!<br/><br/>I'm going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise. Whedon is my favourite TV writer And he's managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd. Justice was done to the best superheroes ever and I can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again. A big thanks to Ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making this movie possible, and the great success it was. I've seen this movie twice already and I can't wait to see it again and again. Now I've only got two more words to say: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!"
"Shanetmims","10","10","21","6 May 2012"," Isn't it great when a film not only lives up to the hype, but surpasses it!?!?!
","Man, what a ride! And I am not just talking about this movie itself, but the entire journey it took getting here! Ever since Iron Man in 2008, The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a blast, with, addition to Iron Man, we also had The Incredible Hulk(2008),Iron Man 2(2010), and last year's two heavy hitters Thor and Captain America:The First Avenger. Now, it all comes to a head in Marvel's The Avengers, in what is, in short, the best comic book film since The Dark Knight!!!!!!!! The plot is mostly centered around Loki(Tom Hiddleston), who is, after being sucked into the black hole at the end of Thor,coming to Earth after finding a way into our realm. S.H.I.E.L.D has been using the tesseract(the weapon Red Skull used in Captain America)for experiments, and Loki uses this as a way to come to Earth. Using a staff that can cross dimensions, given to him by his new army,the Chitauri(an evil alien race),Loki has a master plan to unleash his army upon the world, and when all has settled, Loki will be declared humanity's new king.<br/><br/>In response to this act of war, Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D(Samuel L. Jackson), decides to restart the Avenger program. Recruiting Iron Man/Tony Stark(Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), along with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), they begin to put a stop to Loki's evil plan. Eventually,Loki's ""brother"" Thor(Chris Hemsworth)shows up, with an intent to take Loki back to Asgard.<br/><br/>Loki is not making it easy, however, as he has converted a number of S.H.I.E.L.D members to his side, including Dr. Eric Selvig(Stellan Skarsguard), a scientist who is designing the portal to let Loki's army through, and Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner),a brilliant marksman and one of Black Widow's closest allies. In order to stop this grave threat, differences must be set aside, difficult choices must be made, and a team will have to come together in stop Loki and the Chitauri army.<br/><br/>Avengers Assemble, indeed! For anyone worrying that this wouldn't be the definitive payoff to four years and five films of anticipation can put those fears to rest, because this was..............INCREDIBLE! There are so many things to discuss and give praise for in this movie, so let's start at the beginning.<br/><br/>First off, the cast is brilliant,with everybody giving a incredible performance. Tony Stark is my favorite character in all of these films, and RDJ is as great as ever! So dry humored and sarcastic, yet so heroic and likable. Chris Evans builds on an already good performance, making Cap even better this time around. Always thought Hemsworth was terrific as Thor, and he still owned the role here! Can't wait to see him again. Scarlett was very good as Widow, and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast. Jeremy Renner is good as Haweye, but is easily the least fleshed out of the characters. Still, likable and has some good moments. Loki is back, and Hiddleston shines again. If he was heart-wrenching and tragic in Thor, he is scary and menacing here, yet still giving some insight into his pain.<br/><br/>The big surprise here is Ruffalo as Banner. I think he was the one that most were skeptical about, as he wasn't carried over for the previous films. However, color me impressed. Ruffalo is fantastic as Banner, having great chemistry with the cast, giving Banner enough a soul so we care for him, and when he is the Hulk(using motion capture and CGI), he has some great, audience cheering moments. All the rest of the cast give great performances,including Skarsguard, Gwnyeth Paltrow as Pepper from Iron Man 1 and 2, and of course Mr. Jackson as Fury.<br/><br/>The action scenes were phenomenal. Marvel's own movies aren't exactly known for the action scenes,and as much as I liked the action in those movies,particularly Iron Man 2,Thor, and Incredible Hulk,the action is fantastic,and easily the best action scenes in any superhero movie ever! The script is well-written and full of action. A lot of people have commented that the film looks like the action scenes from the Transformers movies. But I think something must be said here:the action is far better than in those movies. The characters are actually flesh and blood, which grounds it much more in reality, and puts far more at stake. They may have superhuman skills, but they are still human.Can't say that for the Transformers movies.Plus, the characters are played as intelligent, heroic and full of personality, unlike the characters in those films.<br/><br/>All in all, this deserves accolade upon accolade. Kudos to Joss Whedon,the cast and crew of this and the other five films,and Marvel for making this a reality! Can't wait to watch them all one day in one long marathon! In short(ironic,considering this was a LONG review)although Batman will still rule the summer,for now, MAKE MINE MARVEL!"
"jesseburgess57","10","10","21","5 May 2012"," Eat your heart out AVATAR...
","Don't get me wrong Avatar was really great but Avengers are superb entertainment. The Acting was outstanding and the effects are on the mark and I'm a stickler for special effects.<br/><br/>Best Action movie so far this year, and it will be hard to top. Well worth the outrageous prices they have to charge at the theaters for popcorn and soft drinks (I took my nephew with me, he loves His Hulk with some popcorn and a pop). Joss Whedon did an excellent job especially with some of the more unusual camera angles. The playing off of Thor's GF was smart but might have made for another interesting side love like Tony Stark had with Pepper. All in all I had never been so entertained with a movie in my life. <br/><br/>PS, the comic punches in the movie really HIT the spot."
"KidDrehmann","10","10","21","5 May 2012"," Best Superhero Movie Ever
","There are absolutely no words to describe the full percentage of enjoyment I received from this movie. The Avengers is phenomenal. Joss Whedon beautifully and artfully collaborates all of the greatness and magnitude of all the films leading to this one and directs an near exact adaptation of what Marvel always hoped the Avengers would look like on the big screen. To call this film an utter triumph would be a gross under-exaggeration. Containing some of the best action sequences ever captured on film, the wittiest and most hilarious humor I have seen, and probably the greatest chemistry between both characters and actors in cinema. Comic book fans and creators will leave theaters in an ecstasy of awe and amazement. May 4, 2012 should be marked down in the history books as the day comic book films successfully reached true perfection."
"freakish91","10","10","21","30 April 2012"," This is a modern world ""EPIC""...!!
","The fans of the franchise now, have another reason to smile, this time an even bigger one!! :-)<br/><br/>Ever since the trailer of The Avengers went on air, from that very day I had been watching it daily twice at least. Already knowing that its got to be a fantastic film...somewhere I feared that hype often kills it!!<br/><br/>Thank God!! Nothing like that happened...instead, I, after finally having watched the awesome Superhero flick, feel that this one was under hyped!!!<br/><br/>Its a waayyyyyy tooo goooooddd!!!!! One of the best kick-ass action flicks EVER!<br/><br/>F***!!! I don't have words enough to describe the excitement I'm in right now. Brilliant it is! Anyone who has ever read any Superhero comic book in his life, GO SEE the movie...<br/><br/>Having dazzling set designs all amazingly well crafted into one package, director Joss Whedon to my amazement has given this Superhero feast, a nice new treatment. And that is that The Avengers despite having been put into Genres like Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi, surprise, surprise, it is Extremely funny too...I knew Tony Stark(aka Iron Man) would be delivering some witty lines here and there, but never was I expecting it to be sooo hilarious!! Amazing work!!<br/><br/>6 Superheroes, the earth to save, It has EVERYTHING a fan-boy would ever ask for, even more!!<br/><br/>After having successfully introduced us to Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America in their individual ventures, Marvel studios have done a brilliantly good job by developing this unbelievable spectacle!!<br/><br/>One more thing that I would specially appreciate about The Avengers is that EVERY superhero gets his/her deserving screen space! Nobody was overshadowing.<br/><br/>Iron Man is techy, Hulk is destructive, Thor being a Demi-god it must have been a really difficult task to group them up along with Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are already used to obeying orders. Plus with all that being in place initially they had their egos clashing against one another. Having all that resolved, the enemy is Loki, brother of Thor, there were Supernatural creatures that had to be blended within the perimeters of the world that had been developed. Man, this would have been one hell of a tough job!!<br/><br/>Spectacular, jaw dropping action, excellent fun, smart and witty dialogues make this Superhero extravaganza a treat to watch!! Exceeds all expectations.<br/><br/>I'm still working on believing it! It was that good... And well, I don't know if I should tell this in public but I, literally was sitting on the seat like a little child, clapping, whistling and laughing my lungs out, enjoying every scene of the movie.<br/><br/>There is sooo much to write about but that would be unnecessary i guess, so only one suggestion in the end.....Don't miss this!!<br/><br/>This definitely couldn't be any better. Hats off to Joss Whedon, the cast who delivered their performances with a panache and to the Marvel crew!!!<br/><br/>This was by far the most entertaining memorable movie I have seen in my life!! Will cherish this for long..... I wish I had my friends with me...huh!! Nevermind..!! ;-)<br/><br/>The Avengers.....Go!! Go!! Go!!!"
"bendi_in_luv","9","10","21","29 April 2012"," Loki for an Academy Award please
","I read a few of the other reviews, and while some mention the incredible performance Loki gives, none capture the true brilliance. I expect Tom Hidelston to win an Academy Award for his role in this story. Loki is not evil. Not purely sickeningly evil. Heath Ledger takes top honors for that portrayal as the Joker. Loki is different. He has goals, motives, desires, and pride. He is above all else mischievous, cunning, and calculating, as he attempts to and temporarily succeeds in turning the world's greatest heroes against each other. He truly delivers one of if not the best performance of the movie, and in particular shines a little after an hour into the movie, when Black Widow confronts him on the carrier: ""Your ledger is dripping, its gushing red, and you think saving a man no less virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer‚Äî pathetic. You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors; but they are a part of you, and they will never go away. "" All other main characters give stellar performances as well. The Samuel Jackson (an actor I usually despise) brings back all the greatness of Pulp Fiction, except this time bald and with an eye patch. Captain America dominates every moral issue, and though one of the weakest of the team, is the greatest unifier and leader among them. Thor brings back the elegance and civility of a bygone age, combining with Iron Man's sarcasm and cocky swagger in just the right ways to leave everyone grinning. And Bruce Banner finally gets a chance to shine as a brilliant yet conflicted man more than as a raging green beast. Even Black Widow and Agent Caulson have their moments. The only slightly disappointing acting was by Hawkeye, but most of the time he's not fighting, he's brainwashed, so you expect him to be acting a little strangely anyways. And the ACTION. Incredible. Once the final battle starts, there is no letting up. It is brilliant flash after brilliant flash, punch by punch, hit by deafening, glorious, hit. It never lets up, and it is almost impossible not to cry out in excitement. I felt like a little kid all over again. Each team member gets their cameo time fighting off hordes against all odds, and then comes scene after scene of team work. At one point, you follow Iron Man as he blazes a trail, literally, through the oncoming horde, pausing briefly to help each hero as he rushes by. Captain America leads the ground assault, Thor dominates the skies, and Hulk smashes with such agile speed and deadly efficiency you are left squirming in your seat. I am an action junkie, and while I found the opening salvos somewhat dull, especially the car chase, I loved every mini hero battle and almost cried in delight through out the finale. The only Marvell movie I think that stands up to The Avengers as best comic based movie is Woverine: Origins. While Avengers did have better and more exciting action, including the finale, Origins had a more heart wrenching and slightly better told story. The end of Origins, when Wolverine's love dies in his arms, I have a hard time not choking up. That gut wrenching, heart tearing, happy-and-dying-inside-all-at-the-same-time feeling, that make movies like Spartacus and Romeo and Juliet so great, that helped make Origins great, never once came to me in Avengeres. For that reason, I think Avengers did not appeal to me as much as it could have. I just did not feel it inside like I have other stories. Overall, an excellent movie. It started a little slow for me, probably because I was so anxious to see the heroes fighting an alien army. And while I did find the movie very funny at times, I think the trailer kind of ruined it for me: there were lines I remembered loving from the trailers that, in context, were much more serious, and hearing all the laughing in the theater, even though they were lines I laughed at when I watched the trailers, seemed somewhat inappropriate. I rarely give out 10 stars, but I'm still riding the adrenaline from the finale, even without which, I'm not sure I'd lower my score to a 9. Out of 100, this movie definitely scores somewhere in the 90's."

One by one: Iron Man a braggart, but risky and a little action selfish ever even thinking of a end ""highest"" and love of Gwinnett. A naive Captain America, but with a great inspiration and strategic capacity, almost a child in battle, wonderful. Thor, a demigod but assessing human vulnerability, with a fine sense of humor and war. Hulk, as ever, fun, with a great sense of humor reflects his intelligence and his other hand focused on what we love in this kind of series: destruction and unpredictability. Scarlet, divine, but not greater role as Hawk, but no matter, they accompany and adorn in a dual process between a shady past and a debt to the world.

The overall story is simple (evil guy wants to dominate earth), but it doesn't matter because it still carries depth due to the previous movies which are tied together seamlessly with this one. The chemistry between the actors are perfect, and skeptics don't worry, Caps suit is not bad looking at all and there is a perfectly fine explanation for why it does not look as high tech shiny as the rest of The Avengers, but for that one, you need to watch the movie.

The 3D effect is marvelous.<br/><br/>Avengers is the squeal to Thor (I am very sure) , unlike Battleship uses John Woo's style slowly cooking the oven (too slow sometimes), Avenger is like a hot knife cutting the butter ----> straight to the point, I just love it.<br/><br/>To watch this movie is like riding the world's best roller-coaster, I guarantee you that you will love it as well!"
"changmoh","8","10","21","24 April 2012"," Definitely A Masterpiece by Joss Whedon
","This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over soon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where the action in 3D can be overwhelming.<br/><br/>I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"") can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of 'six against one (Loki)', wouldn't that be overkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of its US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order! You can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.<br/><br/>Those who have seen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.<br/><br/>To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various 'superheroes' on his massive 'helicarrier' in preparation for war against Loki's forces. These include Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) makes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.<br/><br/>The climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien invaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Man's quips when he first meets Thor: ""What's this, Shakespeare in the park?"" and ""Does your mother know you're wearing her drapes?"" Indeed, the punchlines are more powerful - and memorable - than the real punches.<br/><br/>Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are already familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jo's Black Widow are 'introduced' in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent Coulson on hold.<br/><br/>I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away with the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being 'persuaded' by Natasha to join The Avengers. On board Fury's helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - ""you must have been doing a lot of yoga"" someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel Comics' Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.<br/><br/>One of the 'misses' of this film is that Natalie Portman's Jane is left out of Thor's story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six superheroes, Hiddleston's Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.<br/><br/>It really isn't about whether you're going to catch ""The Avengers""; it's how many times you will want to see it."
"moviexclusive","10","10","21","19 April 2012"," Beyond brilliant and beyond awesome, this perfectly plotted and skilfully assembled blend of wit, humour and jaw-dropping action is undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever
","A colossal wave of fevered anticipation has preceded the arrival of 'Marvel's The Avengers', the culmination of five incredibly successful standalone films over the last four years. Not only has helmer Joss Whedon not cracked under the immense hype, he has amazingly managed to surpass the loftiest expectations with a movie that towers over the rest that have come before it, combining jaw-dropping action, tongue-in-cheek humour and poignant drama into a dazzling piece of summer blockbuster entertainment. <br/><br/>Proving that the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts, Wheedon has distilled the best elements of each of the preceding movies into this assembly of Marvel superheroes- Iron Man is wiry and snarky as ever; Thor is just as Godly in his might but Human-ly in his compassion; and Captain America is still appealingly old-school. The Hulk, or Bruce Banner in his human form, is quite something else altogether though (being the only character to have a change of actor from the aforementioned films) and very much all the better for it- but we'll save our gushing for later.<br/><br/>It shouldn't come as any surprise that the one movie which 'Avengers' is most intimately associated with is 'Thor', given that both share the same villain- Thor's adopted brother and fellow Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston)- and that Wheedon did shoot the post-credits scene with Loki and S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Opening with a recurring character from that movie, Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is now assisting with experiments on the Tessaract which has quite unexpectedly displayed a life of its own.<br/><br/>Turns out that the fallen Loki has been drafted by an alien race to lead its invasion of Earth, using the same Tessaract as a portal to cross over from their universe to ours- and his arrival not only leads to the decimation of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, but also the takeover of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr Selvig to do his bidding. With the fate of the world in the balance, Fury activates his 'Avengers' initiative to gather the aforementioned superheroes with two others- Black Widow and Hawkeye. <br/><br/>Even from the outset, it's clear that there is organic spontaneity in Wheedon's storytelling, as he fluently weaves together the recruiting exercise by Fury and his trusted agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the participating superheroes. The best he saves for last, so even though Thor only first appears half an hour into the movie, his is a spectacular entrance befitting of that for a God, crossing paths with Iron Man for a thunderous one-on-one clash in the middle of the woods.<br/><br/>True to the spirit of the books, the assembly of these superheroes begins on a fractious note- chiefly due to Stark's distrust of Fury and disdain for the star-and-stripes-outfitted Captain America. Instead, Stark teams up with the only person he deigns as his intellectual equal- Bruce Banner- to locate the Tessaract and uncover what dirty secrets Fury has been keeping from the rest of them. The answer to the latter isn't all too unexpected, but kudos to Wheedon for tying this little detail nicely with what happened in 'Thor'. <br/><br/>It will take something colossal to jolt them out of their self- centredness- and believe us when we say that game-changer is certainly massive, counting for the first of two action setpieces in the movie that will undoubtedly qualify amongst some of the most spectacularly thrilling stuff you'll see on the big screen this year. And just when you think it couldn't get any better, Wheedon tops it with an even grander and absolutely breathtaking climax set in the heart of New York City.<br/><br/>The reason why the finale works so brilliantly is the same as why the entire movie is that awesome- Wheedon loves and respects each and every superhero character just as much. Wheedon gets the action pitch-perfect through reinforcing the individual powers of each one of the superheroes before uniting their strengths to form an even mightier coalition. It is nothing less than pure ecstasy when they join forces as a team, and you'll find it difficult to resist getting up from your seat and cheering for them at various points throughout the remarkable finish.<br/><br/>This review however won't be complete without a special shout-out for the Hulk, many fans of whom have been disappointed by both the Lee Ang and the later Louis Leterrier iteration of it. Here, Wheedon has finally gotten it right, blending both the character's brains and brawn to crowdpleasing effect- even more so through some clever plotting that ensures Banner's eventual transformation from man to beast is as rewarding as it should be. <br/><br/>Indeed, there's really no reason why you shouldn't be running out and catching this the first instance it opens. Calling it the perfect summer blockbuster is probably not enough to do justice to just how brilliant it is, and well deserving of every superlative we have lavished on it thus far. Filled with wit, humour and incredible action, it ranks as one of the most- if not the most- entertaining and exhilarating experiences you'll have at the movies this year."
"KoreanPenguin","9","6","11","19 December 2012"," Joss Whedon is a human tank, like Thor.
","The Avengers was the first movie I saw in theaters three times, and for darn good reason. It sets the bar so high for comic book movies. DC is (was) seriously in a lot of trouble after The Avengers came out. If you have seen each of our hero's individual films, you will easily enjoy The Avengers ten times more. You will be also ten times more excited to see everything played out. <br/><br/>I also feel like I need to say that I was very, very nervous when I heard The Avengers was announced. In film, we like to focus on one character, and we like to see that one person change over the course of the movie. It's hard to keep track of multiple characters, which is why the single-hero format works so well. Otherwise we end up with meathead city, like The Expendables. Gross. Luckily, we have The Avengers instead.<br/><br/>So our unlikely heroes team up together to defeat Thor's brother, Loki. Luckily, all of these overpowered world savers are used to having each other as company, PSYCHNOTREALLY. They all have pretty big egos, let's be honest, but we don't see just how big their egos are until they all share one movie together. Jump ahead, they have to learn how to cope with one another, and just barely tolerate each other in order to stop the world-destroying threat.<br/><br/>There is some absolutely wonderful cinematography, put together by Seamus McGarvey. Did I mention how clever the script is? Joss Whedon poured his fricking essence into the pages of writing, and it pays off so very nicely. I don't feel like The Avengers was missing anything that ticked me off. I also have never been so excited for a sequel before in my life. My only hope is that Disney can buy out Spiderman from Fox, and we can get some Spiderman action in there¬Ö But I digress.<br/><br/>The Avengers flat out rocked my socks off. 9/10."

"glen2010","10","6","11","12 August 2012"," A fantastic Marvel adventure
","I've always watched Marvel films but I've never been the greatest fan of them. I find them entertaining but they are often similar and rarely deliver quite such the memorable and action-packed experience that 'Avengers Assemble' offers. Seriously, whether you are a Marvel fan or not, give this film a chance, it may very well surprise you.<br/><br/>I can't think of any particularly large faults to this movie that are worth mentioning, the plot isn't exactly unique but that's not what I saw as the purpose of the film. The film's plot tied together the previous Marvel films featuring heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America very well, it then went on to set up and deliver a roller coaster ride of sci-fi action unlike anything I've ever seen before in a Marvel film.<br/><br/>'Avengers Assemble' certainly beats the previous films in terms of CGI, action, characters and memorability. From the opinions of friends, I know that the film has even appealed to those that aren't directly a fan of sci-fi action. There is certainly something about the film that simply stuns the viewer and impresses them with up-to-date visuals and a fast-paced storyline. <br/><br/>A fact worth mentioning is that, unlike previous films, 'Avengers Assemble' doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not a comedy, or a parody, but it does allow for humorous moments that actually made me smile more than some actual comedies have. This allows you to enjoy the film further I feel, rather than taking away the more serious elements.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film already, make sure to find the time to watch it, it will entertain you in some way or another and is definitely worth at least one viewing. Truly one of the better movies of the past decade."

","The Avengers was a fantastic movie. Yes its been out for a while and I saw it a while ago. But if you have not yet seen it i definitely recommend that you do. The movie's dialogue was fantastic and often hilarious (In a good way). The special effects were also great and fit the film well. Personally though what I loved most about the film was seeing the Avengers learn to work together as a team. In the beginning there was fighting between them as different people they wanted to do things differently. Near the end when the big battle ensues, you really see them start to care for each other. That care also translates to you as you will also start to care for these characters as the film goes along. I loved the movie and I think it's very much worth a watch if you have not already."
"goldwriting","10","6","11","8 May 2012"," The Hulk (and Others) Smash Expectations
","This is what we have been waiting for. The culmination of years of planning, years of filming and years of cross-pollination of characters throughout the Marvel movie universe. The bar was set unbelievably high and I did my best to temper my expectations as I walked into the theater along with the millions upon millions of moviegoers this opening weekend. When the lights dropped, I mentally wiped the slate clean and hoped beyond hope that it was good (at least better than Iron Man 2). As so many other people have said by now, I was more than pleased.<br/><br/>The Avengers follows the beginning of one of Marvel comics most powerful supergroups, as the world finds itself woefully unprepared for an alien onslaught led by the scorned demi-god, Loki. While the various heroes don't play nicely together at first, they come together when the time comes and prove they are much more powerful together than apart. Together, they are unstoppable.<br/><br/>Many of the reviews have been focusing on Mark Ruffalo and his charismatic portrayal of Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk. Originally much of the focus was on him because he is now the third actor in as many films to play the legendary green behemoth. Yet after the release, the buzz stayed on him because he brought something to Hulk that was sorely lacking before, humanity. Arguably Ruffalo wasn't on screen a ton and it's hard to say whether we have been so amazed with his performance if it was ninety minutes or more, but since Marvel and company immediately signed him to a six-picture deal to continue being big, green and angry, we will all get our chance to test the theory out. I've always loved Ruffalo as an actor and I have all the faith in the world he can make this rage monster a dynamic character to watch, but the real gamble will come in the script. We've seen full movies with Eric Bana and Edward Norton already, so this next one (or two, or three) need to bring something different, not just a rehash of those before. Luckily, the Avengers phenomenon also allows the next Hulk picture to skip over the origin story, since it's fairly unnecessary now.<br/><br/>While Ruffalo can rightly bask in the glow of a job exceedingly well done, the rest of the cast deserves praise as well. Everyone up and down the line brought their A-game and they played off each other incredibly well. Robert Downey Jr. can sometimes overshadow people on screen, just due to his charisma, but he did exactly what he said his character of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, couldn't do¬Öplay nicely with others. However, the pressure was really more on Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) and Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) since they were only side jobs in some of the previous Marvel chapters. Each did a great job, with extra credit given to Johannson (and possibly her fight double if she had one) for her intro sequence with the Russian mobsters.<br/><br/>I can't close this review out without bringing up one of the real-life superheros of the story, writer/director Joss Whedon. The man is a living legend in the geek community and this film proves the accolades and unending praise are well-founded. He achieved a perfect balance of action, pace, and story all while managing to encompass the overabundance of characters. Jokes were well-timed and well-delivered and he allowed for possibly risky moments to go all out, resulting in one of the most hilarious and enjoyable scenes in Marvel movie history (you'll know it when you see it).<br/><br/>Sure, there are some nit-picky moments that you can dig up if you're so inclined. Feel free to send me what you think those might be and I'll gladly drop in some of mine. Yet, in the end, the experience is what counts and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face as I left (and not just because the final extra scene at the end of the final credits was pure genius). This movie captured absolutely every bit of the tone and energy of a comic book summer blockbuster and if Whedon was a professor, this would be his Master Class."
"l-rocha77","10","6","11","8 May 2012"," Even with some flaws, excellent and one of the best movies of Marvel Heroes
","I'll make it simple:<br/><br/>Best points: Action scenes, Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man, Hulk<br/><br/>Low points: Captain America<br/><br/>I went to see this movie in 2D because i don't like the 3D, but after awhile i was regretting it because the scenes are awesome and must be really great in 3D, even in 2D the Heroes and creatures seem to come inside the cinema.<br/><br/>Captain America is so wrongly portrayed here, it's a mix of the old one of the comics in the 60's with the new one of Civil War, when the best comics of Captain America were in the 80's and 90's, he's supposed to be a man, not a kid, he's supposed to have a strong voice, not a sweet women lovable voice, he's supposed to be a bulk, not a normal gym guy, he's supposed to have an armor that shows respect and represents dignity, not a plastic suit that looks a carnival suit for kids, he's supposed to throw his shield like it was easy and light for him, and not heavy or with much effort, the shield it's supposed to be an extension of his arm and not his shoulder, He's supposed to be a leader and not someone who tells jokes, he never makes anyone laugh, he's the moral standards of every group, something that no Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, or other hero can do as him, because apart from his serum and special abilities he represents humanity at his best, not a playboy business man, or a God, or a monster, he's representing the best of mankind and human spirit, he's more then a soldier, and last but not least, he never takes a gun and starts shooting! Apart from that(because Captain America is one of my heroes) i can't give a 9 to this movie, all the scenes are great, Loki isn't that good as everyone says here, a god doesn't spit to a glass while talking, you don't even know if gods have saliva, it's not cool, but anyway i think it deserves a 9.5. Because i can't give that, and, although it doesn't respect Captain America spirit right, it's an awesome movie, 10 stars!<br/><br/>Best part of the movie is the scene when Hulk starts fighting the bad guys, you won't get better excitement and thrill then this, not even on the Hulk movies, what a shame for those two..."
"Fields201","9","6","11","7 May 2012"," Avengers Assemble!
","So much build up and it all leads to this: And it's awesome! I know I'm late in reviewing this and everything has been said in all kinds of praise and this movie deserves it. Just see it. Even if you don't like comic book movies: See it. <br/><br/>What I find amusing is that Ironman was never really the top billing of The Avengers. It was always Captain America... until now. Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene that his name is first on the credits. Seriously, he's that awesome. I was also surprised with Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk. He was great! His scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are some of the most memorable. I also haven't seen the Thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character. Hawkeye was cool and Scarlett Johanssen is hot. <br/><br/>Okay, the plot? Bad guy named Loki wants to take over the world and does a really good General Zod impression (Kneel before me!) and Avengers try to stop him. What's funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into a rag doll at the end. Just ask The Hulk. And whatever injustice the previous movies had done to The Hulk certainly makes up for it here.<br/><br/>Just see it! It's a lot of fun and it's what summer movies are supposed to be. It's a great beginning to summer movies. I'm glad I went!"

","Most fun I've had in a long, long time. Yes, FUN. Although this movie was just about 2 1/2 hours long, it was so entertaining and engrossing for me that it seemed like about 1 1/2 hours. The character development was good and each character was given a bit of screen time to develop the character. The action was good and not overpowering, it only added to rather than being the main part of the movie. The comic level was perfect. Not too much goofy stuff said just to try and get laughs. Every line, imo, was perfectly placed (although I'll have to see it again in order to hear some funny lines that I missed due to the laughter in the theater!). By the way, morning matin√©e was SOLD OUT full. Each character was ""in character"" as we know them...Captain America was still the 40's guy; Iron Man was still, well, Iron Man, Thor...perfect, the Hulk - super good, best depiction I've seen, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it fulfilled all my ""likes"" for a movie...good vs. evil and good kicking butt; enjoyable fun time and escape, good dialog, good looking and PG. I've seen enough violence and sex and love the break for some simple ol' good times."
"jeffreyjets","10","6","11","5 May 2012"," Best Superhero Movie!
","It pains me to say that because I was a Spiderman fan growing up and Spiderman started off this Superhero crazed movie run with what was the best movie. What made Spiderman stand apart was that it was a great movie and a great Superhero movie. Well, move over because Avengers did most everything right enough to at least have a discussion of whether Spiderman 1 or Avengers 1 was the better movie. It might have helped that I do not know the Avenger lore as well as I knew others, but everyone else is in agreement. I am reluctant about this statement, because you hear something is the best ever and then it never lives up. I read a lot of hype in these pages before I went and saw it. Now I have seen it and must agree with the hype.<br/><br/>One thing I was afraid of: Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, which I am a little still out on, but I do like Mark Ruffalo, but made Bruce Banner a little too weak/effeminate. It comes together nicely though. Another was ScarJo. Yes, she is sexy enough(understatement) but was she athletic enough to carry it out and she did well enough. Another problem, the bravado/""egos"" of the characters, not stars, but characters of such a movie would demand a lot of screen time for each one to make this work. That would be a problem if it was not accomplished. The movie was very good on this point. Cobie, Robin from How I met Your Mother, was a bit of a distraction for me in a secondary role, but did a competent job. <br/><br/>The most interesting thing for me was that Joss Whendon was Director and Writer. He created Buffy/ Angel, Firefly/Dollhouse. I wondered how he would do with such mainstream fair and he managed to bring everything together almost perfectly. I say almost because there is one bit that is missing. It is somewhat minor, but who taught Bruce Banner the secret to control his angry green side. That is the only piece missing for me.<br/><br/>For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well.<br/><br/>I think you will enjoy this movie, unless you only enjoy completely realistic movies."
"stewyb-1","10","6","11","2 May 2012"," Believe the Hype!!
","I'm pretty sure I had a grin on my face the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes, including the 20 minutes I waited after the film to check that there wasn't a sneak peek after the credits. It's got a great great story, which is relatively true to the comics. Stan Lee MUST have had a lot of creative input into it. Really makes a difference. Shows why his comics have been around for almost 80 years.<br/><br/>Considering how many 'big' characters there are, the character development is fantastic. you really buy in to each of their personal agendas and feelings. The guy who plays the Hulk, is just incredible. Never seen him before, I don't think. He gives you the impression that he is a loaded gun that can crack at any point, fly of the handle and turn into this massive green smashing machine (which obviously he does). The tension is incredible. It's got laugh out loud moments liberally scattered throughout, that was making the whole cinema laugh. Most of them coming from either Robert Downy Jr, or weirdly enough, the Hulk.<br/><br/>I have to say I felt really comic book geeky as there was one line that only comic geeks would have got. I laughed and about 4 other people behind me laughed. Ironicially enough we were also the people that stayed until after the credits.<br/><br/>The last act has some of the best action sequences that have ever been put on film, period. The CGI, which there is a lot of, didn't feel like CGI. You are so engrossed and it is done so well, that you forget that it actually is CGI.<br/><br/>It certainly helps to have a grounding in the Marvel films that preceded it, but it's definitely not necessary. I have seen them all, so I can't be completely certain, but I think you'd do OK even if you haven't. There are some quick flashbacks and some expository dialogue about what's happened in the other films, enough to bring you up to a good enough level to get it, I think. Obviously it's better if you've seen them, though, so if you haven't yet, I highly recommend filling in the gaps. I would say that, in descending order of usefulness, you should see: Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 2, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk.. Adding to that, my girlfriend hasn't seen any of them, I thought she would just think it was a geeky film, but she LOVED it, I was shocked. So much so that we'll be watching Iron Man 1 and 2 at her suggestion.<br/><br/>I read loads of reviews saying that it is not worth watching in 3-D. I have to say, I completely disagree. There is a lot more they could have done with the 3-D element. For example, Hawkeye, with his arrows would be amazing, you know firing arrows at your face etc, but I prefer the subtle bits of 3-D when you do not even realise. When it doesn't distract you from the film. There are bits at the end of the last act, where there are bits of ash just floating about, in 3-D. Very subtle. Very Good.<br/><br/>There is a bit after the initial credits, so stay for a bit, not a lot of people will get the character they show, as it is not a familiar villain, but it does set up for a sequel, which will struggle to top this movie.<br/><br/>It is very rare that a movie lives up to the hype, especially for me, but this will be the movie of the year. Spiderman, Batman, will struggle to replicate the success, if they can, they will be amazing too.<br/><br/>It's the best superhero film ever made, that's not hyperbole.<br/><br/>Oh also Scarlett Johanson is in it and she is my favourite!"
"achyutaghosh","10","6","11","27 April 2012"," The Avengers- Best movie of the year so far. Fans salivate, non fans- prepare to get converted!
","The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.<br/><br/>The Avengers project began over 6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.<br/><br/>The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be ""hilariously out gunned"" and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. <br/><br/>The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist""- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an ""oh so serious"" group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. <br/><br/>However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.<br/><br/>You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- ""hold on"", he seems to say, ""the solution is just round the corner""- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. <br/><br/>To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking out has never been so much fun."

","Despite the ridiculous overrating of 8.2 out of 10 stars on this site at the time of this review, there are some pretty good negative reviews on here. A number of people seem confused why this film is considered good or even outstanding, and they should be confused. Generally, I'm confused why people are so impressed by this type of film over and over. It is simple-minded, predictable, boiling over with clich√©s, ugly to look at, lacking character development, and overblown in just about every way. It really isn't worth the time for a full review, particularly in light of some good ones here already. I'll just list some flaws that I think most people are not acknowledging.<br/><br/>--This film is overly long. It's 2 hours and 22 minutes. A popcorn comic book movie shouldn't make your butt and bladder hurt this much.<br/><br/>--The pacing of this film is uneven. You expect this type of film to be packed with mindless action, but it had a lot of inexplicable lulls. I thought the dull section of the film on the floating ship would never end. The set up also took way too long and was uninteresting.<br/><br/>--This movie spends a lot of time on the pop psychology of its heroes as well as the psychology of their group dynamic. This becomes dull and tiresome, yet for the time spent on it we still get cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>--Why is the story fueled by the Thor story line, the most outlandish and inane of the Marvel tales (close second for Captain America)? Loki is a silly, petty villain. It is hard to relate to any of these heroes, as they all seem inexplicably immortal, but the whole Norse God/Space Alien thing with Thor and Loki perhaps should have been swept under the rug. Maybe there is some sort of comic book tradition reason for this choice?<br/><br/>--This movie looks bad. It is ugly and fake looking. There is way too much CGI that isn't even required by the special effects demands of a scene. The action scenes have a numbing effect after a little while and it becomes easy to forget you aren't watching a video game.<br/><br/>--This film is fueled by clich√©s of every kind. It feels like a used, third hand piece of writing. <br/><br/>--There are some good actors in this film (and some not so good) but they aren't given enough space to spread their wings. The script is also a heavy yoke these actors must try to preform under the restriction of.<br/><br/>--I felt nothing watching this film other than mild irritation. I don't expect a huge emotional impact watching this type of film. That's not why I see this type of movie. Still, I found it strangely empty. It is basically as if the filmmakers have put their focus on all the wrong aspects of their craft. The film quickly ceases to be fun for me, in part because it is so empty.<br/><br/>--I think it also feels empty because it has a 'going through the motions' type feel to it. The plot is one of unsubtle inevitability. 2 hours and 22 minutes is a long film, but it feels much longer if there are few if any surprises, and the basic arc of the plot is so polished that it feels like a one hump roller coaster. <br/><br/>--A blockbuster superhero action film isn't really about subtlety, nor should it be. But this film lacks any moral gray, or tense emotion fueled by uncertainty. It replaces any emotion with bald faced sentiment. And while it is filled with tiny details and references, its themes are mind numbing, characters thin (even if you've seen all the Marvel films) and storytelling cluttered, but full of unimaginative sequences.<br/><br/>--This film is slick. It is a formula that is well greased and polished to a blinding shine. And it is tough to make a film that is presented in this smooth, flashy, yet non-stylistic sort of way. But this confidence of the filmmakers wears on me. It feels like the polish of the film makes it feel more plastic than it needs to, and guts any chance of the film having a soul. And the immense machine that is this film and this series has become so smooth and over confidant that it really does not feel the need to be interesting in any way... like in a way a lot of cheap, low budget and unambitious movies are. It is a plague of our age of filmmaking. <br/><br/>--Remember when a blockbuster used to be something like Jaws?"

","As I missed this in the Theatre, I waited a long time for the Blu-Ray to come out. I knew back in 2008 when Iron Man came out, that The Avengers were Assembling.<br/><br/>I did not understand why Marvel made a second ""Hulk"" film after Ang lee's marvel-ous work, but that Hulk was a stand-alone story, and not worked into the fabric of the Marvel Multiverse.<br/><br/>Each solo Avengers film introduced characters which were to be in this film, Iron Man was the most developed of them all, The Hulk, Captain America and Thor each developed those characters for this film.<br/><br/>There was one more Avenger that should have been included, Wolverine, but at the time Marvel did not have the rights. Even so, Wolverine was not part of that first Avengers comic so long ago where they Battle Loki, and that is what this film was about.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon was the prefect director to tackle this: His work on his Television shows and the Movie ""Serenity"" prepared him for it. I was glad that an Underdog was given the Helm, and he succeeded brilliantly.<br/><br/>After being Bombarded by the first Three X-Men films and the Sam Raimi Spidey Trilogy, it was just time to make this film. The Avengers are that one Marvel Property that has threads into all of Marvel's Super Heroes.<br/><br/>The pivotal piece was Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury - I grew up when Nick Fury was a white guy and he was a much different character. Sometime in the late 90's and early 2000's Marvel recreated all of their Heroes and gave some of them a complete Makeover: But Jackson plays Fury much the same way David Hasselhoff did in the TV Movie. It does not matter what colour he is, white or black, he's the same guy.<br/><br/>It is this one man who spearheads ""The Avengers Initiative"" - Even though his board of supervisors have put the program ""on ice"" Fury finds a way to make it happen, he puts together a ""response team"" to deal with the threat of Loki.<br/><br/>We met Loki in ""Thor"" - Originally he was Thor's ""Brother"" and best friend. In ""Thor"" Loki learns he is actually a Frost Giant (Which is actually part of the Norse Legend) and something snaps in him. The Loki in The Avengers is not the subdued, Quiet Loki we meet in the first few scenes of Thor, he has completely lost it.<br/><br/>This Mirrors the way he was written for the Comic Books, the way I see it, Loki does not really know what he wants, so he is just trying as many bad things as he can think up. In the case of this film, he has made a shaky alliance with some creepo Aliens (We learn exactly who these guys are, at the very end of the film, after the title credits), as ""The Other"" is talking to his boss, who turns in Profile and he is a SKRULL).<br/><br/>The Tesseract, the ""Cosmic Cube"" which has been a huge part of Marvel stories, was seen in Captain America, Red Skull was abusing it, it fell into the arctic ice and Howard Stark grabbed it. After the events of the Movie Thor, Fury assigns Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) to figure out what the futz this thing actually is.<br/><br/>And they find out, as ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) states at the beginning of the film, The Cube is a doorway, and it is being opened from the other side.<br/><br/>In steps Loki and he has gone even more insane, comparing the Human Race to bugs to be squashed via a Boot. Loki manages to turn Hawkeye and Selvig (This is another thing about Loki which came from the Comics), and the entire complex where The Cube was being tested caves in, huge Radar antenna and all.<br/><br/>From this point on, it's Non Stop. We get to see SO much stuff from the Comics, the SHIELD HeliCarrier, the Avengers Mansion (Which was Stark Tower). But the best thing was the interaction of these guys, they don't get along in the Comics, and they don't get along very well at first here. What surprised me was how well Mark Ruffalo made The Hulk come to life, even though I liked Ang Lee's Hulk better: But Rufallo actually ""Acted"" The Hulk, which was something not done in the two Hulk Movies.<br/><br/>From this point on, Avengers sets a Bar for Marvel Movies that will be difficult to reach again, let alone surpass.<br/><br/>This film easily surpasses the quality of the first two X-Men films, without burying them."

","The Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later date because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clich√©d about the film. They establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with Avengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and scene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid not to like an instant classic."

","I must say out of all the marvel films iv seen, including spider man 2 I have to admit this is the best one. The action is brilliant. The director is a very talented person. I was worried that I wouldn't see enough of each character especially hawk-eye but i was wrong. There was a perfect amount of scene time for each character. The jokes were hilarious as well, the audience kept on laughing. This film is a solid 10/10. If you are skeptical about seeing the film, you shouldn't be. Every minute of it was mind-blowing. I wasn't bored even for a second. In my opinion this is BETTER THAN THE HUNGER GAMES. Go see this movie when it comes out. I promise you."
"citizen_8","9","9","19","29 April 2012"," The Avengers Initiative is a successful one
","The Avengers is what we all dream about on reading those superhero comics and watching the movies. We always would love the concept of having all superheroes assembled and fighting for justice and that if such a thing happens, nothing ever could happen to our planet Earth. However, rational thinking would suggest putting them all in one basket would make movie making quite difficult since the logistics of bringing an all conquering villain along with the bonding of the superheroes would change the dynamic of the superhero movie concept and can be a double edged sword if not handled properly. Certainly they cannot make a movie where the heroes are summoned to fight evil and they come and finish the job and they leave. It has to be more complicated than that for the movie to succeed and it is.<br/><br/>Hats off to the director and writers of this movie since they not only have a villain who is manipulative, evil and quite powerful with his own army who can provide quite a challenge to the heroes but also have handled well the tricky scenarios of putting all the heroes in the same room. Hulk, Iron Man and Thor are all used to fighting outside of the law as vigilantes in their own movies. These three would normally have no problem working together. The bonding between Ironman and Hulk was depicted aptly since they are both scientists and vigilantes. However, the presence of Captain America, black widow and hawk-eye, who are all used to following orders and work for the law, within this mix creates a lot of tension in the air when they start interacting. The blame games and one-liners are ON and believe me, the one liners from RDJ are really cracking. All this makes for a compelling first half.<br/><br/>Obviously, the second half is all about how they work together to destroy the enemy. Its predictable, but its fun and visually awesome as well. Visually its a spectacle and must be watched in 3D. The movie is not without its cons though. For one, I really thought, with Loki as the villain, Thor should have had a better role to play. Unfortunately he was severely under utilized. Scarlett is given an expansive role (I should say her body in that tight fighting outfit is awesome. She is hot) which sometimes even outshines Captain America and the rest.<br/><br/>Watch it. Even if its not awesome or amazing or whatever, you will certainly enjoy the ride."
"jinsoncme","9","9","19","28 April 2012"," Amazing mix of heroes, nothing short of sublime
","Here is the movie they were preparing us for. 'Iron Man'. 'Captain America'. 'Thor'. This was where they would eventually go. And brother, it didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon's magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the so-called 'superhero' movies made. The movie featured an interesting mix of Marvel heroes coming together as a team when the Earth is in crisis, to save the world. From a spectacular intro where Loki arrives unexpectedly at SHIELD hq to the brilliant final showdown, 'Avengers' is a thrill ride, never letting go. This is *the* summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see. Lots of action, lots of thrills, superheroes and and a badass villain. Every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction. The one liners are numerous and never seem forced. Iron man's quips are just as well timed as always. <br/><br/>Enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role. <br/><br/>The only flaw I could think up was the Marvel universe as such. I don't understand why the X-men weren't considered for the Avengers program (legal rights to the characters issues). But the movie is a wonderful viewing experience and by all means, a treasure. Must see for the summer of 2012."

","This is a joke of a movie that's far from funny. I can't believe this movie gets 8.3 currently on IMDb? So this is on par with all those classic movies that score an 8.3? Those movies that people will enjoy for decades to come? I'm stunned how well this has been received. Anyone over the age of 7 that has given this film a good review should be ashamed. The absolute saturation of CGI is disgusting, and seems to be enough to forgive the many flaws of this movie. The action is as poor as the humor, which is brutal. I'm not against the Marvel characters, I grew up with them. I know you can't go into certain movies with a critical eye, all I expected from my trip to the cinema was to be entertained. Instead I was saddened, shocked and bored to the point of irritation. I seen the amazing Spider-Man recently, THAT was entertaining. The reason was because there was some thought and effort but into all aspects of the movie, as it should be, to the character and story. It had everything that the avengers lacked."
"blueismycue","3","10","22","19 October 2012"," So overrated...
","The absolute only reason I would give this movie a rating of three is because the visual effects weren't terrible. In all honesty, I had no intention of ever seeing it, but because my father bought it, I watched it. And winced all the way through.<br/><br/>Now, I'll preface this by saying that I'm a fan of darker comic adaptations, and I'm certainly not an expert on The Avengers in general, but in my opinion this was one of the most obnoxious comic adaptations I've ever seen. Quite a long list of specific grievances here: Loki's character was laughably dramatic. Everything was overwhelmingly loud (explosions; hello), the acting (with Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo being exceptions) was sub-par at best, and the few weak attempts at humor literally had me putting my hands over my face out of embarrassment for the writers. I won't even go into the blatant discrepancies between the comics and the film. It was just so... so bad. <br/><br/>Basically, this is one of those movies that's really, really horrible, but everyone wants to believe it's good because of the anticipation buildup, and it's aimed at the idiots who don't actually care about comics or characters but are stupid enough to act like they know everything about them after they see it. I'm angry with the film industry for this one, although, sadly, it turned out to be exactly what I expected: a money maker. That's all it is. If you're looking for any talent, honor, or artistic merit, you won't find it here, folks. Just a lot of explosions."

","What an utter disappointment. Expected so much more substance from Joss Whedon. With so many great characters w/ great stories, you'd think the writers could have put together a good story. But no--that's not what obscenely budgeted films with the sole purpose of setting up a franchise care most about. Everyone's already pointed out all the ridiculous plot problems, so I'll just say that the writers had NO excuse when there's an entire comic series worth of stories to supply all they needed to work things out. A waste of some decent actors and lots and lots of money. (Pretty clear that the only moment Samuel Jackson actually enjoyed was when he got to walk out and blow up one of the jets. He looked bored or in pain for every other mediocre line.) I enjoyed most of the witty one-liners...and that's about it. <br/><br/>Shallow on so many levels...who cares how shiny the CG was or how many things got blown up? The studio may have raked in disgusting amounts of cash based on the hype (and the promise of a great story), but will anything else about this film be memorable? Can't see how Stan Lee would have been pleased..."
"lil_mexx31","10","7","14","4 September 2012"," Marvel Masterpiece
","Since that final clip with Nick Fury and Tony Stark in Iron Man, there was hope that maybe Marvel could really be doing an Avengers movie. 4 years later and 4 movies later (Iron Man 2, Hulk, Thor, Captain America) and we have Joss Wheddon's Avengers. <br/><br/>What makes The Avengers so Engaging and Intriguing is the dialogue between the superheroes. Joss Wheddon should be awarded with an Oscar for the writing and directing of The Avengers. Everyone blended in so naturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy. Everyone felt equal from Hawkeye to Hulk. It is so difficult to balance these personalities on screen and I don't think any other director besides Joss would've been able to pull it off the way he did.<br/><br/>The Action scenes in the Avengers is as Epic as it gets. The last hour is like a marathon of awesomeness. Every action sequence in this movie was perfectly executed and each character had their significant moments. <br/><br/>The cast was phenomenal as usual, but the show-stealer is definitely Mark Ruffalo. His portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on. He was wildly entertaining and I couldn't help but cheer him on when he smashed sh!t. I think what made the Hulk work was because he was used sparingly.<br/><br/>Lo-Ki as the villain was great. I felt he was developed a lot better here than in Thor. He was witty and had an evil aura about him especially when he was interacting with the ""mortals"".<br/><br/>Never have I enjoyed a movie so much as the Avengers. The 2 hour plus runtime flew by easily and I was left wanting more once it ended. Once in a while a masterpiece of a film comes along, and after the hilarious closing scene after the credits, it was clear that this was Marvel's Masterpiece. Back to the Future and Terminator 2 have always been my go- to favourite movies. After this gem, I believe I can the Avengers to that list. <br/><br/>10/10"

","Consider the wit, brawn and pulse-pounding balls of both Iron Man movies and the spectacular Thor. Now consider the flaws and failings of Captain America, Fury and two incredibly average Hulk flicks. What are you left with? A question: where exactly was in-form writer/director Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble actually going to go? Down the pan? Or through the roof? Well, guess what? He's only gone and pulled it off. <br/><br/>Ever since that teasing Nick Fury advent at the end of the first Iron Man, fans and filmgoers alike have been seeing-out the end credits of all subsequent Marvel flicks in hope of something (anything). What they got was everything. All signs pointed to an assemble, all roads lead to an Avengers movie. 5 years in the making? Try 50 for any Marvel mogul worth their salt will tell you a film's been coming since the early 1960's. <br/><br/>And here it is: 4 big-buck franchises rolled into one: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk. Robert Downey-Junior, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and...Mark Ruffolo?! Ed Norton obviously didn't fancy this one but fear not, Hulk nuts, Ruffolo's twitchy turn makes for the best Banner yet. Anyway, throw these four in a room together and you're guaranteed two things; friction and fun. Our heroes square up, square off but in the end...well you can guess where it goes. The story? SHIELD head Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) enlists the fickle four along with Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson) to help save the world from Thor's bad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Zero points for innovation, then. But if you thought Tony Stark suiting-up for the first-time was the coolest thing you've ever seen. Think again. <br/><br/>Skilled sci-fi pen-cum-director Joss Whedon has well and truly arrived with this dizzyingly brilliant blockbuster that's more than the sum of it's fluctuating parts. Believe the hype, Avengers Assemble is a cast-iron hit. It's incredible. It's thunderous. It's furious, beaming, biting and marvellous. But enough puns, let's get down to business.<br/><br/>Whedon has approached this four-way fusion in the right way: a strong and balanced emphasis on plot, dialogue and visuals, character development and chemistry. Too many cooks? Hell no. The big-name players work so well with one another it's actually surprising. The sheer sum and sense of one-liners and put-downs are just as memorable as the brutal, in-house beat-downs. Which is saying something when you consider scenes pitting Iron Man and Hulk against Thor are enough to send an entire generation of comic-book geeks into cardiac arrest.<br/><br/>Downey-Junior's effortlessly cool turn on the sarci' Stark was always going to be the main lure, here, but to say he outshines his peers would be wrong. It's not all about the billionaire ball-buster. Everyone gets their 15 minutes. Both Hemsworth and Ruffolo (in particular) are bang on. Even the out-of-touch Cap' chips in with a few big, cheesy shots and Hiddleston's creepy demigod makes for a sharp villain.<br/><br/>Granted, Whedon's tongue-in-cheek ethos and slapstick-like approach means the Avengers was never going to measure up to any of Nolan's Batman films. How many comic-book films (or films, in general) do!? Which is why there's not much point even trying to compare this breath-snatching Marvel muster to Nolan's Dark Knight rebirth. It's a kick-ass popcorn movie for young and old. Nothing more.<br/><br/>That said, this hulking 142 minute feature is a stimulating affair with a freehold on the brash and the flash and the down-right hilarious. It's an absolute blast. Wildly entertaining, ridiculously awesome, the Avengers' is everything it should be: over-the-top, funny, cool, funny, loud, exciting, electric and did I mention funny!? <br/><br/>Best comic book movie ever? No. Best Marvel production ever? Yeeeeee...no. X-Men: First Class still has that one tied-up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot. Whedon's Assemble may not be the best superhero film out there but it is the funniest and probably the most entertaining. Definitely the coolest.<br/><br/>Sure, there may be a limit to how many times you can watch superheroes kick the crap out of one and all. But you won't mind too much. Popcorn cinema doesn't get much better than this. Joss Whedon and co. have kicked this year's comic-book-busters off with a bang. Expect sequels."

Robert Downey Jr. is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie! Mark Ruffalo makes the best Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" to date, with a serious and human, yet comedic performance! Chris Evans is still quite good as Captain America. As far as performances go, this guy is probably the weakest. But he's still an awesome actor! Chris Hemsworth isn't a remarkable actor either, but he has nice charisma and fits the role as Thor! Scarlett Johansson is smoking hot and sexy, and much more relevant than she was in Iron Man 2! Jeremy Renner was just pure badass Agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye! Samuel L. Jackson was epic and badass in the role of Nick Fury! Tom Hiddleston isn't exactly a really strong or serious villain.

Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Cobie Smulders is also good in their supporting roles!<br/><br/>I've chosen to judge this movie with what it is: a fantastic superhero-movie!

When I go into a movie, I use six main things for rating a movie....... 1.Is it engaging from the start? 2. Are the characters interesting? 3. Is the acting good. 4. Are the effects quality? 5. Is the plot good? 6. How much would I want to watch it again?<br/><br/>The constant action through the film manages to keep you entertained and the good actors and special effects make this movie easy to watch. Throughout the movie there is this sense that no (major) character will die, and it brilliantly replaces the feeling that they will all live happily ever after with a fun sense of comedy and a spring in its step. This movie is by no means perfect, but it effectively manages to keep you on your toes and makes you want to watch it again and again. I may have some bias based on my love of superheroes, but I definitely recommend this movie."

","I am a big fan of science fiction. I have not been such a big fan of all movies based on comic books. I am not such a big fan of sequels either. The Avengers was a must-see-film for me, for several reasons, but most of all, I enjoyed both Iron Men, Captain America, and a bit of Thor as well. Hulk did not do the trick to me.<br/><br/>The Avengers brings all these superheroes together. Their opponent is Thor's evil half-brother, Loki. His main goal is to get a magical stone, or cube, that would open the gateway to another dimension, to Asgard, where other, even more evil forces await to be released, and freed to the world of the humans.<br/><br/>The action in the film, along with the SFX, is great. However, the storyline is not something you have not seen or heard before. Actually, there is very little new to the film. Also the decision to get all the superheroes or stars together, does not really differ much from Expendables, which is somewhat huge phenomenon, even though the script could be written by a 12-year-old.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a lot better than Expendables, but that does not mean, it is a whole lot better, and that it would be better than, lets say Iron Man. For me Iron Man alone stands above The Avengers. The film does not come better with bigger explosions, and a lot more heroes, than in the original film. But obviously, with fans of the 80's stars in Expendables, it is enough to bring them all on the screen at once.<br/><br/>What I truly enjoyed in this film was actually a few parts of the action. The one with Thor dropping out from the sky, or the parts in the end, with the heroes pretty much destroying most of the city-site.<br/><br/>All in all, it is certainly a-must-see for the fans of comic stars, science fiction, and action. I enjoyed, but not that much, that I would recommend it to everybody."

","I can't really say anything that anyone else hasn't said about this film. Go out and watch it and you'll love it. Best film of the year so far. That's all I really have to say about this movie. <br/><br/>Basic Details to mention would be that the CGI is pretty good but can still stick out a bit easily. Another thing to mention is that it can be a little long for people under the age of 13. Also I don't care how old your kid is or how much they would want to see this film. Do not take them to it or rent it (when it's released on DVD and Blu-ray) until they're thirteen. I've seen enough people take them to this movie ignoring the ratings and then getting p*ss*d off that their child is only 8 1/2 years old."

Of course it also has the eye candy a gal needs - well for me anyhow! - Loki! He's just perfection in every single way. Tom Hiddleston is my favourite British actor. Since I discovered him in Thor I have been hooked and checking out all his other movies. He was fantastic as Loki!

","It's finally here. OH MY GOD. As a big comic fan it's amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade. We finally get star studded spin-off featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters. If you've been living under a rock, then you may not have noticed that over the last five years, Marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to The Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk join forces to stop Thor's brother, Loki and his alien army. Sure, the plot is simple, but that's what we want for a big smackdown. For any team we need a great leader and Marvel have found the best in Joss Whedon. With his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due. He also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes. We get a sense of Stark and Potts relationship, some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye, the confusion of Rogers and so forth. He does his best work with Hulk. I've loved every incarnation of the Hulk so far, so I was wary of Ruffalo's performance. He captures it perfectly, going for a more nervous and geeky Banner. When the Hulk is unleashed, Whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously. Hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film. The action is fantastic, with a number of exciting set pieces. The final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action, and they really do work as a team. There are a couple of shortcomings. The alien race is just pathetic, and never really feels like a threat. Add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience. The film lacks any real threat. We hear about the many people Loki kills, but we never see anything that relates to this. Without seeing the sacrifices made it's hard to get too involved. There are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up. These are things that are minor nitpicks. After all, the only way to do a perfect Avengers movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time. What it does achieve is simply amazing and very exciting for the future of superhero films."

","I really enjoy some comic book movies - ""Spiderman 2"" and the first ""X-Men"" are excellent in my opinion. But I'm completely baffled by the high ratings given ""The Avengers"". The dialog is stupid, most of the costumes really lame, the story line completely predictable and good lord but the clich√©s run rampant. The ""super-villain"" has a British accent - that's about all you need to know about this movie. Most of the acting was completely forgettable or, in the case of Samuel L Jackson, just plain god-awful. If it weren't for Robert Downey and Mark Ruffalo, I don't know how I could give this more than one star. As I was suffering through this awful thing my mind kept drifting to ""Mystery Men"" and how much better and funnier it is!"

","I probably sound like an grumpy twit with a title like this, but I'm the sort that enjoys most, if not all cinema. I was a little bit surprised that I didn't enjoy this... in fact, I thought it was pretty poor.<br/><br/>Yes, the action was cool, but after tolerating an hour of poor script; an hour or so of flat-out action wasn't going to cut it for me. I ended up sat there waiting for New York to be destroyed enough that I could leave the cinema.<br/><br/>One of the main issues is that dialogue tries too hard to be witty and falls flat; then the serious conversations are just too melodramatic and overtly clich√©. I was sat cringing whenever Thor or Loki were talking.<br/><br/>Possibly the only part of the movie I genuinely enjoyed was to finally see the oh-so crap antagonist be slung back and forth in to the floor by hulk. Mainly just so I didn't have to watch him open his mouth.<br/><br/>Whilst subjectively I think this movie is crap, the action is some of the best Hollywood is capable of churning out; though it's annoying that this film will probably take an undeserved place on the IMDb top 250 over this. It's a poor unoriginal movie caked in explosions, pretty CGI and whatnot- thus this means that everyone will automatically love it...<br/><br/>What's worse is the sequel sneak-peak mid-point in the credits; for me it just translated to ""Hollywood wants more of your money to waste on ---- like this""."

","OK, I'm going to have to start with the negatives about this film. Oh wait, there isn't any! In all seriousness, this film was incredible! I went to the cinema and watched it in 3D. I already knew that the film was going to be good by reading reviews and going on what my friends said it was like. A large group of us went to watch it and came out wanting to watch it again. There isn't a single scene in it that is boring or that drags. The acting is top class. You think that watching a film with lots of superheroes is going to be cheesy or poor in acting performance. Not with this film. The cheesiest thing about Avengers Assemble was Captain America's suit and, to be honest, that's not even cheesy. The graphics were outstanding, which is what you hope for when you realize the film cost $220 Million to make! Every time you saw the Hulk smashing things up was incredible and not to mention the incredible scene where you see the Aircraft Carrier actually turn into and Aircraft! <br/><br/>Overall, Avengers Assemble is an amazing watch, one of the films that you'll want to watch again and that you could say in the future 'I watched that film when It came out in the cinema'. If you haven't seen it already, get to your nearest cinema and be as amazed as I was. If someone says the film wasn't very good, I think its safe to say the have clearly no idea what there talking about! 10 Stars, absolute masterpiece, can't wait for a possible sequel (watch the credits guy's, worth it)."

"stevinmarshall","10","8","17","29 April 2012"," Now THIS Is How To Make an Ensemble Film
","Marvel studios took a leap of faith in handing this project to the brilliant Joss Whedon. After all, his only other film that got a cinema release (Serenity) failed to even recoup its budget at the box office. They must have seen something in him, though, because this film is, in every sense of the word, Epic!<br/><br/>It could so easily have just been Iron Man And His Sidekicks, but Whedon's fine grasp of characters gives everyone involved their fair share of screen time without the film dragging for a second. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is all cock-sure and swagger. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is every inch the demi-god that has Earth ""under his protection"". Steve Rogers / Captain America (Chris Evans) is a man so far out of his own time he feels alien to the world he now lives in. Most enigmatic of the group is Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansen), who is a master manipulator and reveals only as much as she wants you to know, and Cliff Barton / Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who is both mentor and partner to her. Their history is one that needs its own film!<br/><br/>The real joy of the piece, though, is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / The Hulk. Banner lives an isolated life, barely keeping ""the other guy"" in check, when Nick Fury sends Black Widow to recruit him. In a nice twist, it is Banner who is needed, not Hulk. Ruffalo is, by far and with all due respect to Eric Bana and Ed Norton, the best Banner AND Hulk to date and is given 2 of the films most memorable moments.<br/><br/>Tom Middleston chews up the scenery as Loki, every bit as evil as Thor is good, with a plan for each of The Avengers in turn.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson is given more to do as Nick Fury than ever before. He is the master control of The Avengers Initiative, so confident in each of his heroes he is willing to defy orders from his superiors.<br/><br/>Visually stunning with great character developments, awesome special effects and a breathtaking pace, you never feel the 2 hr 10 minute running time. Popcorn will be left behind as you laugh and cheer through this ride.<br/><br/>With the obligatory Stan Lee Cameo (although he is not the best cameo in the film) and Joss Whedon's trademark sucker-punch both in place, Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is by far the best superhero film to date. <br/><br/>And the sequel? Will someone please put Joss Whedon on retainer? Now!"

","Shakespearean lightning and thunder arrows, red white and blue shields and golden armor, emerald rage and badass Morpheus long-coat, and Scarlett Johansson's leather Pearbottom. <br/><br/>Oh AVENGERS, how sweet thou fury! The god Loki (Tom Hiddleston, Brit-leering and still looking like Data from STAR TREK GENERATIONS) has come to Earth from Asgard to conquer and destroy. And Earth's mightiest heroes are there to punch him a lot.<br/><br/>Seems kinda ineffectual and unimaginative that against literal magical/divine foes, the best retaliation that can be mustered by the writers of this mega-superhero tale (Zak Penn and Joss Whedon) is that the heroes ""punch"" demons flying around on bad motor scooters. (Even the grand resolution, though a jaw-dropping sequence, is nothing more than the old ""destroy-the-source-to-destroy-the-minions"" gambit.) <br/><br/>And what does Loki want with Earth anyway? As we saw in THOR (2011), Asgard was a pretty bodacious LSD-colorized dazzlegarden. Is he here for the fabulous Grilled Prime C√¥te de Boeuf at Spago? Is Loki after our Arab oil? Our blood diamonds? Our white women? Taking his cues from Dick Cheney, his plan seems to be conquest for the sake of conquest, no exit strategy, no goal. And he's using a cutting-edge science concept to do it: the tesseract (or hypercube theory), a wormhole joining two distant points in space-time. Loki allies with a croaky guy named The Other (whose helmet looks like it was fashioned from dog turds) and they order their demon-riders to spurt through the wormhole to Earth and break things. Some plan! <br/><br/>Dim plot aside, THE AVENGERS is overseen by Marvel (the studio that can do little wrong when pumping out A-List superhero blockbusters) and fashioned by writer-director Joss Whedon (the man from FIREFLY, who can also do little wrong with his iconoclastic approach). Highly enjoyable movie experience ensues.<br/><br/>Not only are there big stupid CGI things and Pretty Orange Explosions aplenty, there is heart and poignancy and humor, uncertain alliances between heroes, petty arguments, snappy dialog, human frailty and godlike wrath. And Scarlet Johansson's leather Pearbottom.<br/><br/>Whedon does it again - imbues this ostensibly kickapoo punch-em-up movie with real personality. Even if you did not meet the individual heroes in their own films over the past few years, they are each presented as a throbbing personality crisis, no emotion spared. Except maybe for Captain America (Chris Evans), whose wooden delivery makes us suspect he landed this job on the cerulean dreaminess of his eyes. You see, he's frozen his facial muscles in place, for fear that if he moves them one iota, he'll stop looking super-pretty. And Jesus! - look at the size of his biceps! <br/><br/>And then we see Chris Hemsworth's biceps - and they're even bigger! Hemsworth once again brings the hammer as thunder god Thor on mad steroids; half-brother to Loki, and therefore forced to speak in a British accent (for an Aussie, that's an eternal annoyance).<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark/Iron Man, now plonking his ginger assistant Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow cameo), and bequeathed the best dialog; so cheeky, arrogant and sarcastic that Brad Pitt called from OCEAN'S ELEVEN and wanted his insouciance back. His armor is the damned coolest thing about this movie, and when he is flying up into the wormhole firing his hand-blasters at demons, his power is awe-inspiring. Now if only he had an iron Pearbottom...<br/><br/>Bruce Banner/Hulk is dork-cool Mark Ruffalo. Love that guy; perfectly cast as the most unruffled guy in the room (unruffaloed?), even though harboring the most internal rage. In this third major movie featuring the Hulk (after HULK and THE INCREDIBLE HULK), he can apparently change green at will. ""That's my secret - I'm always angry!"" (Hey, I must be a Hulk!) Banner and Stark exchange much tech jargon that means absolutely nothing, but their quiet moments are powerful. <br/><br/>Matter of fact, all the heroes have their portion of quiet time, which director Whedon effortlessly makes compelling, and their dissent is the most interesting element of the movie. Marvel Comics were always canny at setting up Marvel Team-Ups where the moral ambiguity of the situation set heroes at odds with one another - and Whedon somehow captured that lightning.<br/><br/>Down the list, we have archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who can apparently claim superhero status because he has good aim and his arrows explode. I guess Rambo can fill out that application form then. Hawkeye and thigh-jitsu expert Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have been re-rendered by this movie franchise as two CIA assassins with a spanky sexual tension. One would think these two mere humans would get lost amidst the super soldiers, iron men and gods, but again, Whedon gives us even their little patticake moments and doesn't lose our interest. And did I mention Scarlett Johansson's leather Pearbottom?<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson's role as Nick Fury, director of SHIELD (some kind of unnecessary homeland security contrivance), has been elevated from that of annoying eye-patch cameo during the stinger of Marvel movies, to annoying eye-patch starring role; wearing his custom leather, flying around in his invisible aircraft carrier, and constantly whining that Earth can't handle these threats so we have to assemble a team that can. May I suggest Angie's List? <br/><br/>Clark Gregg appears for the umpteenth time as SHIELD Agent Coulson, now with a first name, Phil, and a predilection for Captain America trading cards (like the rest of us he-men, going bi for Cap's biceps).<br/><br/>Cobie Smulders is here as eye candy. I guess one leather Pearbottom just wasn't enough.<br/><br/>In the final telling, THE AVENGERS will thrill with its stunning action, thoughtful characterization, and the simple fact that Marvel managed to cram all these colorful icons onto one bombastic piece of celluloid. And did I mention Scarlett Johansson's leather Pearbottom?...<br/><br/>--Poffy The Cucumber"

The special effects are state-of-art and instead of writing a long review, I suggest the reader to watch this highly entertaining movie. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Os Vingadores"" (""The Avengers"")"
"Argemaluco","8","9","20","28 April 2012"," Very entertaining, but not great
","I have liked the comics from an early age, but it wasn't until I was 10 or 11 years old when I started to systematically collect them, following specific titles and ""plunging"" myself into the respective mythologies from Marvel and DC (I have never been never been an ""exclusive"" fan of some publisher). One of the first comics I took seriously was The Avengers, because Stan Lee already knew that the secret to capture the readers wasn't on the cosmic battles and colorful disguises, but on the examination of the vulnerable and human side of the characters. The Avengers was the perfect medium for that, because it put together a group of superheroes with very different ideologies and personalities, so that their mere interaction was as entertaining as their fights against villains and other threatens. Fortunately, director and screenwriter Joss Whedon comprehended that fact, and as a result, the film The Avengers is very entertaining.<br/><br/>In The Avengers, Whedon wrote a generally well balanced screenplay in which he re-introduced the characters, justified their alliance and put them to fight as a team in one of those cosmic threatens suffered by New York with such a frequency. I said ""generally well balanced"" because the screenplay makes some stumbles and has a few weakly developed characters. To start with, Loki feels like a bland villain; his methods and his motivation aren't consistent to what we had seen in the comics, in which he was a formidable and malicious manipulator (after all, he's the archetypal ""trickster""). I also found the ""Heli-carrier"" sequence, in which Iron Man and Captain America try to repair an engine during 15 minutes, a bit weak...it feels like a poor excuse to insert an apparatus action sequence. And the other problem from the screenplay is that we don't know practically anything about the character Clint Barton. Fortunately, it was interpreted by Jeremy Renner, who is such a good actor that he can display his character's nature and his relationship with the other members of the team with just one expression; but even like that, I would have preferred the sacrifice of some gratuitous action scene in order to bring that character more dimension.<br/><br/>Those fails are mainly noticed during the first half of The Avengers, in which the pieces of the story are being accommodated. For the rest, this is a very satisfactory and entertaining (and unexpectedly quite funny) culmination of the ""cinematic universe"" Marvel had been building since the film Iron Man in 2008, and it was very pleasant to finally see the seeds which had been planted in that film harvested. As for the actors, I don't have any complaints. When I wrote the review of Captain America: The First Avenger, I complained about the fact that Chris Evans hadn't been able to evoke the gravity of Captain America, but fortunately, he corrected that weakness in The Avengers. Chris Hemsworth also brings a perfect work as Thor. Robert Downey Jr. shows a lot of enthusiasm and conviction as Tony Stark/Iron Man, while Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk also bring solid performances.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best moments from The Avengers were the dramatic ones, as well as the interaction between the superheroes. However, that doesn't avoid the action scenes from being exciting. Their best attribute is that they are always perfectly clear. In conclusion, even though I wouldn't consider it an excellent film, I had a very good time while watching The Avengers, and that is already more than enough to make it worthy of a recommendation."
"senshi_nisha","4","10","23","16 May 2012"," Enjoyment does not equal quality
","I wasn't intending to write a review about The Avengers because I consider it to be one of those movies with a life spawn equal to it's running time.After the credits roll it's ""out of sight,out of mind"" for me.But seeing the praise this mediocre movie gets in most reviews and how it has managed to hit top 50 with an average of 8.7 I felt the need to even up the balance a little.<br/><br/>First of all ,I want to say it is OK to enjoy/like/love any movie.But before claiming it to be ""the best thing ever"" take a moment to think if enjoyment and quality actually overlap.<br/><br/>I can guess why The Avengers is so popular:<br/><br/>-it has a cast of well-known,loved actors. <br/><br/>-it's a comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>-it's path has been paved by 4 prequels(without the Hulk movies) <br/><br/>-it features a team of 6 superheroes so everyone can take his pick.<br/><br/>-it's a light-hearted movie.<br/><br/>-it's an action-oriented movie with flamboyant special effects.<br/><br/>-it's targeted at the most impressionable audience:children and teenagers.<br/><br/>Having all these ingredients the movie only had to play safe in order to be a box office success.I must congratulate the producers for perfectly anticipating and manipulating the public's expectations.Because people are indeed claiming The Avengers to be the pinnacle of super hero movies.<br/><br/>Seriously,people? As much as I dislike Batman I still consider The Dark Knight to be way more deserving of this title.However there seems to be an overall consensus that The Avengers had brilliant,amazing,like never seen before action and humor.I must ask you,have you had your memory deleted when you entered the cinema?It's true that the movie doesn't screw up in a blatant way, and has an enjoyment factor due to the reasons I've enumerated earlier, but it consists undoubtedly of the same old clich√©s which are endlessly used and reused in super-hero/action movies:<br/><br/>The bad guy threatens Earth->heroes are gathered to defeat him->they don't get along->the bad guy gives them a little beating->now they get along->the bad guy is defeated by the heroes.And guess where the final fight takes place?Manhattan Island.And guess what the government does without knowing the outcome of the battle?Tries to nuke the island.But let's forget the plot.Action movies almost never bother with it.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the battles.Choreography and imagination were almost absent.At times it felt like watching a turn based fighting game.And when that huge metal worm made it's entrance I really thought they will fight it together using some cool combos, but no,Hulk simply punched it in the face.And there was an interval of several minutes during which Loki was absent from the final battle.But he was probably busy commanding his army,too bad his troops were randomly flying around,uncoordinated and without using any tactics.Maybe some BGMs would've helped the battle scenes a little, but the OST war rather shy. <br/><br/>Not much is to be said about the characters,each have one or two defining traits(excepting Loki maybe) and that's pretty much it.The dialogue is shallow,consisting of cheesy one liners and typical lame jokes.<br/><br/>Maybe this movie has your favorite superhero, maybe you're a big fan of the comics, maybe you ship Captain America and Iron Man or you have fantasies with Loki ,maybe you liked the 3-D ,but think before rating this movie a 9 or a 10."

","This is a good film but the current overall IMDb score of 8.9 is rather high.<br/><br/>Put simply its entertaining and fun. However the problem inherent in the film is how to fit so many larger than life characters into one story and give them equal screen time. Whedon manages to do it but as a result i feel the story had to fit the characters rather than the characters fit the story. There are a lot of new character relationships that have to be established. It gets a little bit convoluted trying to keep up with itself.<br/><br/>The threat facing the avengers, i.e Loki and his rather randomly sourced army, just seems a bit cobbled together. Especially the army! Where they came from or what they are doesn't seem properly explained. Just that Loki somehow has one. The threat the Avengers face seems more to do with sheer numbers of bad guys rather than any particularly interesting powerful individual villains. Loki on his own just doesn't seem that threatening. He is wonderfully without remorse though. Bitter and twisted by his quest for revenge. One of his scenes with black widow is almost like Hannibal Lector and Clarice in Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>Black widow for my money is the most entertaining and interesting character in the film. Maybe its because she doesn't actually have any super powers that makes her so. What she does have is an exceptional mind, attitude and rather scary hand to hand combat skills. Played wonderfully by Scarlet Johannson she is a pleasure in practically every scene.<br/><br/>One of the other pleasurable things about this film is the occasionally very funny dialogue and scenes. Whedon is a master of witty fast paced exchanges and he doesn't disappoint here. The cinema audience laughed hard many times. The Hulk having the two biggest laughs in the film.<br/><br/>This is a decent film which could have went horribly wrong. A lot of lead characters vying for screen time is a problem. Time spent establishing new relationships also. Perhaps the next one will be more compelling? The film isn't overly subtle but then what did i expect given the nature of its premise!?"

","Luckily I saw this movie before I saw the rating on IMDb, or any other rating or review, as a matter of fact. Actually we were not planning to see this movie, but it was the best choice out of other average titles.<br/><br/>Honestly I would give this movie a 6.5 on a scale of 10. The action is solid, but the story is not nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>Basically it is your bad guy steals super-weapon, superhero(s) come together to fight bad guy and with some ups and downs there is the expected grand finale with lots of action story.<br/><br/>The big problem is that there are a lot of characters in there so not everyone gets enough screen time. Personally I would have liked that Scarlett Johansson's character would have gotten more story.<br/><br/>The rating at IMDb is thus inflated and should not be taken seriously. It is not though that I didn't enjoy the movie but for example, The Dark Knight is much better than this."

","My fianc√© and I have seen this awesome flick twice. I am also putting it on my holiday wish list this year so that I can add it to my DVD collection. That is how geeked out I am for this movie. The cast was memorable. Robert Downey Junior was born to play Tony Stark. Mark Ruffalo excelled as Bruce Banner and even resembled the comic book Banner. Scarlet Johansen and Chris Hemsworth made for tasty eye candy as Black Widow and Thor respectively. Samuel L. Jackson wows as Nick Fury. The story was well told by writer/director Joss Whedon. There is plenty of humor and action. There is also some tragedy as well in the form of the death of S.H.E.I.L.D agent Phil Coulson,played excellently by Clark Gregg, at the hands of the villain Loki played chillingly by Tom Hiddleston. If you have not yet seen this movie run to your local movie theater and see it. If you have seen it already see it again."

","When I first read about the film I thought it would not be that good to watch a juice of so many characters. But the director was rightfully applauded for his work in giving a good deal of time to all the characters. Everything about the movie is very nice. It takes you through all the characters about whom you would have probably learned a lot and for those who do not know a lot, Marvel has already done everything for them to understand with a series of films based on the individual character. That is a thing that truly marks American films different from others. They know what audience will want and how to serve them. You will find a lot of instances (as I had experienced) when you would just be scared that such a nice film has to come to an end after 2 hours 20 minutes.<br/><br/>PROS : I loved the timings of each and every characters except for hulk who was introduced in a simple manner but who ultimately steals the show based on his (my favorite) two dialogs which I have heard from everyone that they liked. The instance when hulk comes into action , everyone have to shout like hell. Iam a big fan of iron man and especially because of Robert Downey but this green character fills up the whole space every time he becomes angry or rather say wants to be angry. What I first thought before entering into this mind blowing film , I had been thinking that Thor would be playing a greater role and since he is some god typo so he will help the avengers the most. But I like to get wrong evreytime I start a film. Than comes our nick fury who though was the leader of the group in papers but appeared to be playing a role of the grand daddy. I felt this especially in the 2nd half. But that was nicely handled as he was doing whatever he could do , and what was best for him. Black Widow and I mean everyone was playing a role that they could play according to their abilities. However a single disappointment was the role of captain America who did not seem to fit properly into the fight sequences. And he was looking a kind of supporting role along side the hawk eye and the black widow.<br/><br/>CONS ‚Äì I would have liked to see some more development into the story of the tysserect and how loki got involved with everything. Everyone seemed to be in a little bit of hurry in the second half. Well may be I am too attached to the film that's why I am saying that. ""A must watch for anyone."""
"aharmas","9","6","12","6 May 2012"," And The Winner Is
","If there's a genre that's evolving and becoming better and better in the last decade, it's the adventure/comic genre; not solely a result of better CGI and cinematographic techniques, but there is also much better writing and acting, and in previous years, efforts by Nolan and Joe Johnston have been bypassed by critic and association entities because they are not a specific type of picture. It is certainly my hope this brilliant film doesn't suffer the same fate for it's great cinema all the way.<br/><br/>With a superb cast that appears to embody each of the super heroes, and most intriguingly, their own stunts, we are treated to a very exciting two hours plus at the movies where the Earth is once again in danger of being overcome by an alien race, and somehow, story lines from several films are tied together neatly. Eventually, they all become a cohesive whole, and the results are MARVELous!! The film is terrific, and it might not reach the levels of perfection that we saw in ""The Dark Knight"", a movie so magnificent in its structure and sustained by terrific writing and acting. There's certainly no villain like the Joker here, but the evil forces are sufficient enough to warrant a cry for help, so that we need our heroes to come and kick some alien butt. It's definitely a showcase for all involved: Renner, Downey (much warmer) than in any of his previous turns as Ironman, Johanssen is magnificent, Evans is fantastic, Hemsworth is royal like in his turn, but the best turn out there is sheer force of nature that Ruffalo gives to the Hulk. He certainly walks away with the picture, yet everyone else gives him plenty of competition for the spotlight.<br/><br/>The film is a crowd pleaser, with plenty of terrific set pieces, leading to an extraordinary third act, a piece of cinematic action rarely seen before, where every element moves so smoothly, it can make your heart soar when you see what really good films can achieve. It certainly doesn't remind me of some of the films that have been recognized in the last decade, as the best that cinema can offer. Good film do not have to be serious; they have to be well made, regardless of what the subject matter is, and ""The Avengers"" once have proved just how amazing solid script writing (by one person, not a whole team of creative ideas) can give you when you combine with top of the line special effects. It's truly a joy to see Jackson sharp tuning a role we have seen before, but it's now full of pizazz.<br/><br/>There are some terrific possibilities coming our way later this year, and I am looking forward to the amazing offerings by Nolan, Scott, and Sonnenfield, but they have a battle uphill trying to match this wonderful movie. Watch, learn, and learn to give credit where credit is due. This is cinema at its best."

","This was a terrible film. The lines were cheesy. The action sequences were predictable. Every sequence that rolled out on screen had already been done to death by countless action films before- there was nothing new, fresh, catching or anything innovative for that matter in the way the film was shot, scripted and acted. <br/><br/>Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the low brow, tasteless racist slanderer of Captain America (Yes I know he was doing it to show this mindset was still of that of a white American of the 1940's) towards Samuel Jackson's character made me want to walk out of the film. And I'm not even black. A complete waste of money on my behalf. To see this film receive the high acclamation that it has just goes to show how brainwashed the general population has become due to the continuous release and production of these utterly mind-numbing, idiotic films.<br/><br/>Not even worth a star."
"joshuadrake-91275","9","4","7","14 September 2015"," Great movie for Marvel! One of my favorite Marvel movies of all-time! Thank you, Marvel and Joss Whedon for making such an awesome Marvel superhero flick!
","The Avengers is a great movie and I think it's because of what they wanted to do with this film in Phase One of Marvel's cinematic universe and this movie pays off quickly.<br/><br/>The action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just top-notch. You already know what the plot is about so I don't have to go over it, but I will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor. The ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this film.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and he does get a lot of screen time. Chris Evans plays Captain America and he does an amazing job, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner were both good as Thor and Hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters. Mark Ruffalo was cool as Bruce Banner / The Hulk and he does motion capture for the Hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero. Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff and she could not done better in this film, but the one person who really was great is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother and he makes a good villain. James Spader is gonna do better as the title character, Ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 Marvel Studios film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", which will be released this Friday on May 1st, 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as Ultron.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson is going to rock as Quicksilver, but I think Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's sister, Elizabeth, is hot as Scarlet Witch and she's gonna do great in that part, but Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is good in the screen time he has in this film, but he only has a cameo or small part in the new Avengers movie, which I will review on Friday May 1st, 2015 and I think it's going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie season.<br/><br/>The visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie, especially The Hulk in this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is fantastic and amazing. I could not believe the music that I heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it. The film's running time feels like it's three hours long, but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long, so the movie moves on very quickly.<br/><br/>Overall, I love THE AVENGERS and I am giving it an 8 / 10. Marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future Marvel movies and it's not like every day that a four-year plan pays off with such praise and hype, but this paid off wonderfully."

","The Avengers (2012): Dir: Joss Whedon / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson: Here at long last is a combination of comic book superheros brought to the screen to the delight of fans. Hopefully nobody will confuse the title with that crap handed John Steed Emma Peel 1998 film that everyone wanted nothing to do with. Perhaps a title change? We have a host of superheros including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. The villain is Loki of the Thor film and he has a world domination scheme that is every bit as corny as any other world domination scheme. That doesn't matter because viewers will attend to see the combination of powers become a reality. Loki is a great villain and thankfully he is targeted by all of these heroes thus giving us great action sequences. His run-in with the Hulk is especially amusing. Joss Whedon is the right director to bring this spectacular together and the special effects created are explosive. Whedon also gives each cast member a good fair share of time. We have Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark / Iron Man whose sarcasm is a scene stealer. Chris Evans is thawed and ready as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth as Thor sets to bring Loki back to his planet for justice. Mark Ruffalo is terrific filling in as the Hulk whose anger is subdued until fans are given the payoff in full blown green fury. Scarlett Johansson oozes sexiness as Black Widow, a skilled spy trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Third act descends to action combination of the various talented ensemble that is a thrill. Score: 9 / 10"

Robert Downey Jr. Is probably my favorite actor and if not he's very high on my list but the commitment and work put in from the entire crew of production and filming members is one for the books. I'm really looking toward to seeing a second part to this movie and I'm very confident when I say that I know it will be great! If you know anything about any of these comic book heroes then I'm sure you didn't need to see any movies such as the Iron Man trilogy, Thor, Captain America, or the Hulk to understand this film...

"williampsamuel","9","4","7","6 December 2014"," Avengers is Mighty Comic Book Fun
","Between a massive advertising blitz and some none-too-subtle hints that Marvel has been dropping in their films for the last four years, Joss Whedon's Avengers adaptation is one of the most eagerly anticipated blockbusters in recent memory. With most of Marvel's flagship characters- played by some of Hollywood's biggest stars- assembled together in a big budget production co-written and directed by the man responsible for Buffy and Firefly, the premise alone is enough to make fanboys swoon. This is a project with some very high expectations to meet. And having seen it, I for one would say that it has met them.<br/><br/>It would not be much of a stretch to say that the Avengers is what every summer blockbuster wants to be. Given a few hundred million dollars and near total creative control, what director wouldn't want to make a film like this. In its two and a half hour running time, it delivers a coherent storyline, several likable, well developed protagonists, and enough action and explosions to show up Michal Bay.<br/><br/>I mention this notorious director because his Transformers films, particularly the latter entries, have made millions on the idea that brainless fight scenes, gratuitous pyrotechnics, and more than a little T&A are all it takes to make an action movie; no acting, writing, wit, or originality needed. But Avengers shows that that's not true. Like a certain other superhero franchise due to release its final installment later this summer, Avengers works as much because of its human drama as its action and special effects. <br/><br/>One of the main reasons the Fantastic Four movies didn't work, aside from weak screenplays and wooden acting, was that we never bought the idea that the actors on screen were a team. In the first film, they utterly lacked the kind of chemistry that would be expected of friends and co-workers. In the second entry, the chemistry was so forced that they seemed like a sitcom family. Avengers suffers from neither of these problems. Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downy Junior, Scarlett Johansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Mark Ruffalo not only shine on their own, but also work seamlessly together as part of a team, playing of each other's strengths and personalities.<br/><br/>Between Stark's cynicism, casual arrogance, and roguish charm, Cap's loyalty and earnestness, Banner's demur, unobtrusive nerdiness, and Thor's zeal and new found humility, all of the leads get the chance to establish themselves as well rounded characters, and to remind us why we liked them in the first place. And like a real team, the characters don't always get along from the moment they first meet. They keep secrets. They question each others' motivations and commitments. They get on each others' nerves. And they certainly let their egos clash. In fact, some of the best fight scenes are between the heroes. But like real people, they put aside their differences and their egos. They learn to trust each other and work together, in a way not nearly as sappy or clich√©d as it suddenly sounds when I'm writing it. <br/><br/>The casting of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury continues to seem like a better and better idea all the time. He might not be able to go all out, what with this being a PG-13 production, but there were moments that, for me at least, very much invoked fond memories of Pulp Fiction. Tom Hiddleston also does very good work as the villainous Loki. His air of condescension and supreme self confidence makes him instantly loathable, and the hint of jealousy and subtle desperation in his voice, together with his piercing, wide eyed stare gives the unmistakable impression that something is definitely not right inside his head. Watching the heroes give him the beating he deserves is a supremely satisfying experience.<br/><br/>And like I said, the action is great too. The numerous fights and shootouts are excellently choreographed and filmed, and the climactic alien invasion is stunning in its size and complexity. It's like a non-sucky Battlefield LA, and the cost must have been astronomical. I'm also highly impressed at how long the film was able to keep the action and sense of excitement going. From start to finish, the final battle lasted roughly half an hour, without getting bogged down or becoming overly repetitive.<br/><br/>Add in some typically Whedon-esque humor and a fair number of insider references to the comics, Avengers is mighty entertainment, and everything that fans could have hoped for. I look forward to Marvel's inevitable follow-up, and to the director's next project. I don't know why it's taken so long, but Joss Whedon has finally arrived in Hollywood, and I expect to see much more of him in the near future."

","When I watched Iron Man 2, Captain America: The first Avenger, Thor, I wished I could see them together in a single movie. But to me it seemed impossible at that time until 2012 when I was marveled to see the trailer of the Avengers. As I watched the movie, it was a dream come true. The reason it seemed impossible to me was that its hard to accommodate so many signature heroes in a single 2.5 hour movie, but Marvel did a really amazing job. First off all the movie is a sequel to 4 or 6 movies (Hulk (2003) and Iron man if you want to add),and is prequel to 3+ movies plus a TV series. Second Marvel delivered very well. Every hero was at first a sole hero but gradually they ended being a team. Every hero had his own story plus a part in the team. How the team came together was also so heartwarming and how they helped each other. Every hero was greatly portrayed with great graphics, loads of action,comedy,thrill, and a great feast for comic fans and non-comic fans both."

","The Avengers : As Thor's hammer smashes the ground causing huge ripples in the earth, The Avengers' smashing action blows your mind as it leaves a deep impact on you, way after the film is over. One of the most awaited films of the year, The Avengers is everything you'd expect from a awesome superhero- get-together film. After Loki steals the infinitely powerful Tesseract from Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. puts together the group that he's had in the works for years. Gathering Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the team of ""The Avengers"" takes on Loki and his army to save the world. The Avengers does not fall short of anything. Stunts, story, performances, humour, just everything in the right proportion. Humour is in abundance but no way does it make the film spoof-like. You feel for the characters, which makes the film a roller coaster ride you don't want to miss out on! Do not compare it to The Dark Knight - Nolan's Batman movies, there is nothing dark or twisted about The Avengers, it's a feel-good fun film."
"TheAvenger95","10","4","7","11 August 2014"," Superhero movie gold... it doesn't get any better than this.
","The plot was great. It's simple enough for normal movie goers to follow, yet complex enough for the fans who've been following the continuity to go ""oh yeah! This ties-in with this, and this relates to that!"". Whedon really pulled it off well, considering this could have gone a 100 ways wrong. The pacing was also exceptional (something the other 5 movies never really mastered) Very few questions are left unanswered by the end. It really is a good, well rounded story from start to finish. Don't expect too many easter eggs or cameos, because to be honest, there were almost none. As a fan-boy, I'm a little disappointed, but at the same time, I fully understand that they didn't want another IM2.<br/><br/>The characters all shine. There is no ""star of the movie"" (and if I absolutely HAD to pick.. I'd have to go with Banner/Hulk). Every single character gets his/her moment(s). I do have a lot more to say about each individual actor/actress and their respective character, but I wouldn't want to spoil any of the amazing and surprising character moments. I will say this though: the acting from some of the guys/gals were FAR better than I could ever have imagined, and the actors of whom I was expecting great things, weren't as good as I thought they'd be (I did have unfairly high expectations for them though)<br/><br/>The action: every fight sequence is straight out of a comic book. You'll see scenes that will immediately make you realize: the guy who made this movie is a flat out, comic book geek. Whedon knew exactly what the fans wanted and put it all in there. Every single fight sequel has a great flow as well - it feels so real (and keep in mind, you'll be seeing Iron Man go up against a god of thunder - so when I say it looks/feels real, I mean it) The stunts are extremely well choreographed and it becomes clear that a lot of them were done by the actors themselves, which I find very impressive. The CGI was incredible. Some of the stills and trailers had a few cartoony shots, but it all looks amazing on the big screen. If you stick through the credits, you wouldn't be surprised at the amount of people it took to make this movie come to life visually.<br/><br/>The dialog and humor... well, what can be said: It's Joss Whedon. It was fantastic. The only dialog that didn't impress me was some of the stuff with Nick Fury (there was also a certain scene with Cap and Stark from the trailers that's been changed, and IMO it didn't really work as well as the original version). I was beginning to feel a little worried that TA would be TOO funny after reading some of the reviews on RT, but it wasn't so. I'll admit, Whedon walked a fine line and it almost ended up being a comedy, but luckily (I think) he maintained the balance... The movie was freakin hilarious though ;)<br/><br/>The score was impressive as well. Alan Silvestri composed a heroic orchestra of sounds that just makes you want to start cheering. That said, a few of the songs were a bit too reminiscent of Cap:TFA (which I found a little lazy), but for the most part, the overall score is great (as I'm typing this, I'm still whistling the ""Avengers Theme"").<br/><br/>The 3D: I thought it was pretty good. It's not necessary that you go see it in 3D, but I'd encourage you to do so. It did add depth to the movie and when you're watching what is (arguably) some of the best fight/battle sequences ever captured on film, you'll be wishing that you could get the full experience. Some of the scenes (very few) were a bit dark/blurry though - but overall, coming from a guy that doesn't really like 3D, I'd say spend the extra few bucks. It's not everyday that the Avengers assemble on the big screen.<br/><br/>All-in-all The Avengers was amazing. It's definitely my favorite comic book movie of all time now, and easily one of the top 10 movies I've ever seen. It delivers on all accounts and only has a few, very minor flaws. One of the best aspects of the movie is that it's a roller-coaster ride: it's lighthearted, VERY intense, and then lighthearted again. It's unexpected and I never knew what was coming next. it's funny and serious, often almost at the same time - I was a little exhausted after watching it ;) Don't underestimate the Avengers: while it is mostly an action/adventure movie, it's definitely NOT just another ""mindless popcorn flick"". It does have a sense of depth that I wasn't expecting and the characters do evolve and make you care even more than their solo movies did. Instant classic IMO. 5 out of 5 and it goes without saying, I'm looking forward to seeing more."
"drawlife","10","4","7","1 August 2014"," Flawlessly Assembled
","A lot of comic-book fans including myself have wondered how can having six larger than life superheroes in one film possibly work? Will they be distributed with the right amount of screen time? Can there be a cohesive story to tell? Will there be plenty of action and visuals? The list of questions goes on and on.<br/><br/>Fortunately I can tell you that the hardcore fanboys can put their pitchforks down as writer and director Joss Whedon pulls off a magnificent achievement by bringing the right amount of stability in this superhero circus, engineered to please the fanboys and nonfans alike.<br/><br/>The film has a simple storyline, but it's very well-paced filled with adrenaline and streams very nicely. However, it's not the story that makes the film so great, but rather the characters instead. The script written by Joss Whedon never forgets its heroes' humanity as the film explores each characters with a lot of depth with reasons for doing why they're doing what they're doing. The story reconnects us with each character but also finds the time to flesh out each characters strengths and weaknesses, with some wonderful moments of insecurity throughout.<br/><br/>Loki, the film's villain is brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hiddleston as a cunning, mischievous, and evil mastermind. Chris Evans solidifies his role as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth portrays a more noble, less arrogant Thor. Mark Ruffalo one of the characters I was worried about during the hype train of this film, went beyond my expectations. He delivers a new kind of Bruce Banner and I would argue the Hulk steals this film. There's also a lovely banter between Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow, Whedon treats them with respect and they do earn their place in the team. As for Robert Downey Jr., well do I really need to tell you he's awesome as always? <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally able to stretch his legs than being just the guy making surprise appearances as he is able to slide into the role quite effortlessly. Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson returns and provides sharp dialog in the film. Cobie Smulders also makes her Marvel film debut as Agent Maria Hill who is Nick Fury's second in command. <br/><br/>The visuals are great, as expected, the overall look of the Hulk is very impressive. I loved how ILM modeled it to look like a mixture of Mark Ruffalo, and Jack Kirby's interpretation in the comics.<br/><br/>We get a lot of action beats, and a good amount of time is spent on having the heroes talk trash and square off against each other to prove who's the toughest. There's Iron Man vs. Thor, Hawkeye vs. Black Widow, Thor vs. Hulk, and so on. These showdowns allow each character to have their time in the spotlight, and they do build genuine tension. The last 20- 30 minutes of this film is worth the ticket itself. Whedon provides plenty of jaw-dropping action sequences. <br/><br/>Though this is a comic-book film, there is a great sense of subtlety and the film explores that. Let's be honest, in many different ways, this movie should not have worked at all. There are too many larger than life characters to juggle and quite frankly it's ridiculous. Joss Whedon's brilliant script has a strong and unique theme of family dynamics. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding themselves from community. While doing so they not only realize that they belong together but they need each other. Obviously this is expressed through punching, but that essence is the heart of the film.<br/><br/>As a comic-book fan I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all the people who were involved in the project as well as the films that came before. Give massive credit to Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige. The Avengers is a visual spectacle, but it's also a film with brains and heart. At a running-time of two and a half hours, the film is well paced and time flies by. So in every regard, the movie fulfills its hype and raises the bar even higher for Marvel and other superhero films to come and my childhood is avenged.<br/><br/>10/10"

Loki, Thor's evil brother, tries to take over the Earth with an army of aliens called the Chitauri. S.H.I.E.L.D., Led by Director Fury, is charged with stopping him. They attempt to unite several of the world's most talented individuals in order to accomplish such an impossible feat. This is called the Avengers Initiative.<br/><br/>The Avengers:<br/><br/>Natasha Romanov/Black Widow: Highly trained agent close combat specialist<br/><br/>Hawkeye: the best aim with a bow that anyone has ever seen Tony Stark/Iron Man: Genius in a suit of high tech body armor Steve Rodgers/Captain America: super-soldier from WWII, frozen in ice for seventy years after defeating HYDRA. <br/><br/>Bruce Banner/Hulk: Gamma Radiation Scientist that becomes a giant indestructible green rage monster when he gets too angry.<br/><br/>Thor: Asgardian God of Thunder wields a War hammer known as Mj√∂lnir.<br/><br/>These heroes have a rough time working together. It isn't until after a major tragedy that they become willing to work together to stop Loki. A major theme of this movie is definitely the importance of teamwork. Not one of these heroes could of done this alone (except maybe the Hulk). It took all of them to be strong enough to defeat the Chitauri, get back the Tesseract and save the city.<br/><br/>Tony Stark was definitely the most dynamic character. He somehow managed to turn down his ego in order to work with the other Avengers. He wasn't the only one, though. Thor went through some changes when he faced his brother again. Bruce Banner learned to control the Hulk a little better. Director Fury never changes, though. He is still as cold and protocol driven as the day he was first introduced to Marvel fans.<br/><br/>The one thing I don't like about The Avengers is that it starts off a little too slow. After Loki steals the Tesseract, it takes a long time for the movie to pick up again. A large portion of the beginning of the film is just a bunch of random dialogue with a few plot points thrown in.<br/><br/>Other than the slow start, The Avengers is an amazing sci-fi superhero movie with plenty of action and a plot that actually has some depth. It's an all-around wonderful movie and is definitely worth watching."

","Marvel's Avengers Assemble was an absolutely fantastic film. It was great how they pulled all the different movies and their secrets and put them into the one film. Each actor played their part to their best and I was gripping my seat at every turn. There was a lot of emotions in the movie including humour, sadness and suspense; one minute you would be crying and the next, laughing!<br/><br/>This is a great movie for the whole family but I would advise that you watch the other superhero movies first, as it would be hard to follow otherwise.<br/><br/>11 out of 10 from me, can't wait for Avengers 2!"

","The Phenomenal Avengers<br/><br/>Today I watched ""The Avengers"" for the first time. The movie itself, I believe was very well put together. Not knowing who each character is and not seeing each one of their movies to get their background. The movie was well put together, that I understood what role each one played. With the original cast of each character are in this movie, except they did not use the original actor for the Hulk which is what I was familiar with but the part was very well portrayed by Mark Raffalo . The Hulk character keeps the viewers on edge, wondering what or when will he release the rage of The Hulk.<br/><br/>The movie starts with that main villain Loky, god of mischief, planning one of his ultimate plans of taking over the world. The original actor, Tom Hiddleston, from the movie "" Thor"" plays an amazing part both dark and evil. Capturing all the characteristics of a grand villain, comes to life in the amazing film and Hiddleston plays the part to perfection. Other characters in this film include the fantastic performance of Chris Evans as Captain America. With his honor and loyal traits this character is incredibly brought to the screens with a perfect actor that does its great justice. <br/><br/>All the characters in this film are portrayed wonderfully to bring this fantasy film to life. This movie also shows the truth of a community in a tragedy. When all hope is lost in the movie each character mad at each other in regular life come together to get through the hard times and defeat the powerful Loki. This is film each actor feeds each other in this film that all the scenes connect perfectly and even if you have not seen all the individual movies of all the characters one by one. The film is still pretty easy to follow and to catch up on each one and the part they play. All and all I would like to say that Joss Whedon did an amazing job on creating each character and I hope there is more to come. Two thumbs up in my book¬Ö.ART"
"didacrubios","10","4","7","4 September 2012"," And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.
","Joss Whedon tells a story, which, though classic, is developed in a really great way. First of all, an enviable and satirical script defines the pace of the work, which remains strong throughout its duration, accumulating tension to lead to a powerful final act, this is achieved in part thanks to the great characterization of the characters, very well defined in their dialogues and by the performances of the actors, who easily draw the different personalities of heroes and villain, as well as making the viewer vibrate with the clash of egos when they appear on screen.<br/><br/>A Special Mention goes Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the Norse god and Thor's brother. The latter is a successful incentive for the film, the fun of seeing him interact on screen is matched only by his great performance (specialy the scenes with Stark, Natasha and Thor) demonstrating a complex villain, even tragic, (although sometimes scary) whose motivation, while simple at first glance, proves to be a multi-layered one in an attentive viewing (pay attention to his dialogues and facial expressions, especially in encounters with Thor, Agent Coulson and his scenes in the outcome).<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. keeps the level as Tony Stark, and continues to develop his character. As we saw in the first Iron Man, Stark demonstrates that, despite having matured as a person, he's someone who does not know how to be a team player. He learns, in this film, that a hero is more than a cocky playboy, even if said playboy has superpowers.<br/><br/>The last, but not least, is Bruce Banner. Probably the most more grayest character that has the privilege of appearing on 'The Avengers'. Ruffalo's Banner is a sad, depressed man, who is ashamed of himself and is considered a monster by the one surrounding him, he has to learn to accept himself. A great success, by the director, is to outline his relationship with Tony Stark, as the contrast between the two is one of the delights of the film.<br/><br/>It doesn't my criticism, however, the fact that the final conflict may not appeal (to a greater or lesser extent) to those who 'do not tolerate CGI', which are really plentiful (though visually spectacular in themselves) during the last act.<br/><br/>However, I must say that such scenes are well maintained not only in effects, but also in style (special mention to an amazing a scene where the camera follows the protagonists, an artistically impressive oner which captures the might of the heroes with the sound-image combo).<br/><br/>Also, Whedon doesn't rely on ""Eye Candy"", and gives to the outcome a decent plot-structure, remarkably finishing the relationships between the characters, all of this seasoned, successfully, with good dialogue and some epic moments to make it more palatable. Paraprasing Roger Ebert, like many recent films in their third acts, The Avengers goes for wall-to-wall action, essentially, but the director has invested well in establishing his characters so that it matters what they do in battle and how they do it. There are personal issues at stake greater than simply which side wins.<br/><br/>Another negative point, in my opinion, is the following, although the premise is developed in a great way, giving shape to a somewhat simplistic plot, as I said the film does not redefine any way a plot that we have not already seen before, despite the fact that represents such concepts much better than any other film in its genre. However, although imperfect, the film satisfies at all times, and the scale between hits and misses is good enough to make this an excellent movie."

When the movie was over, i was like, did 2.20 hours just pass.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much humour in this, i knew Stark would be a smart-ass, so that was anticipated, but i did not expect The Hulk to be funny, twice!<br/><br/>All in all, great movie, and a good start to The Avengers trilogy/quadrilogy or whatever this is going to become."
"nick-asaro","10","4","7","17 August 2012"," One of the best comic book movies i've ever seen.
","What can I say about the Avengers that everyone else hasn't already said? Well, believe the hype! it's great! why? well numerous reasons. One of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to life.Joss Whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the Marvel Universe (see his run on Astonishing X-men) and Team dynamics(See Firefly or any of his other works)and he works his magic to the max here. another reason is the great cast. while all good, two performances really stand out to me. The first one is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and the second one is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. While I enjoyed Ed Norton's Banner, I felt something was missing from him, Likability. Mark Ruffalo had Likability. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was a great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and he's better here than he was in Thor. Another Reason is the action. Not only does the final scene have An epic battle that rivals Robots trashing Chicago in Transformers 3 (This is way cooler) But other great action scenes come throughout the movie. one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where Loki steals the Tesseract/Cosmic Cube and takes down a whole bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D agents including Nick Fury and Hawkeye. Also, The plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics. So final verdict: possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012. Assemble and go see it."
"SillyRaccoon","10","4","7","12 August 2012"," My boyhood dream has been realised.
","I have been waiting for an Avengers movie for well over a decade and when I found out that it was even in the pipeline I was beside myself with excitement. I went to see the movie with somewhat high expectations due to the cast involved and the previous Marvel movies building up to this title. I have to say that it completely surpassed my expectations and I was amazed throughout the entire movie. <br/><br/>I attended the screening in 3D and I honestly have no idea why people had anything bad to say about the 3D in this movie as it was quite brilliant. <br/><br/>For me, the underrated characters in the movie are Black Widow and Hawkeye. I felt that these characters were portrayed perfectly by Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. I also felt that we have finally found a perfect actor in Mark Ruffalo to play The Hulk. The two actors that have recently played Bruce Banner/The Hulk have been pretty good but both seemed to be lacking in something but I could never put my finger on it. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br/><br/>I can see exactly why there has been a massive explosion of potential Marvel movies in the pipeline and I cannot wait to see what the sequel could bring. I feel that Hawkeye and Black Widow could definitely have their own movies if not a movie where they are working together. I also hope that the people at Marvel and Disney have identified Mark Ruffalo's great ability to play Bruce Banner/The Hulk in such a great way and maybe look into rebooting the entire franchise.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie across all age ranges as there is something for everyone. I also cannot wait for this movie to come out on blu-ray."
"EUyeshima","9","4","7","3 June 2012"," Avengers Assemble Most Adroitly
","Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made ""Iron Man"" (1 & 2), ""The Incredible Hulk"" (the 2008 version), ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable. A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.<br/><br/>Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.<br/><br/>Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.) For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.<br/><br/>The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory."

"marlinmat","3","7","15","24 November 2012"," felt let down on this ""blockbuster""
","After all the hype, I was expecting an entertaining movie. To me, that means a plot and story line that I can feel a part of and be interested in what happens to the characters. I pretty much became bored due to feeling no connection with the characters and nothing unexpected happening...sure there are special effects and a bunch of stuff thrown in just to see if it would stick to the wall, but none of it engaging. Then there were characters that were so shallow that I felt no interest in who they were or what part they played...did Gwineth Paltrow actually get paid for whatever it is she was doing? The Hulk seemed to be more of an after thought in this story as there was no consistency in his role. In the Hulk's first scene he's an uncontrollable force that destroys anything regardless of whether it involved resources that belonged to good or evil. The climax of the movie which involves an alien invasion, was far from exciting due to minimal effort being made to compel the viewer into wondering ""Oh my, whats going to happen now"". Instead, the feeling evoked was ""gee, that was an OK special effect""."
"theburrus1","3","7","15","11 November 2012"," Over-hyped through and through
","I will not make this review very long, but you can add it to anyone else's that gave this a 3 out of 10. First of all, I will say that this film is perhaps the first one (for me ever) that has warranted obtaining it by pirating it from the internet. I could not sleep had I spent $10 at the theater on it, and for that matter $3.00 for a one-evening rental of it on DVD.<br/><br/>As I downloaded it, I was really excited, mostly just basing it off the reviews and records it set on its opening weekend and through the summer of 2012 even. And wow, was I so wrong in doing that. Keep in mind, I know that it holds true to form to comic books and their characters depicted in the movie, but I have seen Iron Man, Captain America and the last two Incredible Hulk remakes, and somehow this grouping of all the Marvel characters, diminishes the value of all the characters' individual films they lead in so much its embarrassing. I really liked Iron Man but his one- or two-liners in this film are not funny, but very cheesy and predictable. The costumes on some of the characters are laughably ridiculous, namely Loki his ""ram-looking horns"" or whatever, Hawkeye and his blue contacts and then CGI diminishes all of the others' looks. <br/><br/>And finally it speaks enough for itself when this is just one of a very few films I have ever watched where I stopped ( or paused) it every 10 or 20 minutes to go do something else, come back a couple hours later, continue watching,only to repeat the same thing again and again. It took about a day for me to finish it! I mean that just says something of how dull and dopey this film is at times. <br/><br/>All the fan-boys who may argue out there, don't please because I obviously realize you are a fan-boy. Anyone else looking for a ""truly good, Oscar-winning, or perhaps classic and one-for-the-history-books"" type of film, look elsewhere."
"Ratisbonanza","5","7","15","24 August 2012"," Nothing new, just some other action flicks on steroids
","This movie is another typical US production: great FX, lame story, even lamer lines for the actors (espcially Hiddleston, whose character is completely wasted, even though he plays his (mad) part very good), only Downey has his usually funny highlights but this cannot save the movie. When I have figures like Thor and Loki I try to build a more mythical, special story and don't end up with the ever so boring same mankind vs. whoever fight, marking the enemy almost unbeatable at the beginning and then ending up with some metal monster that the Hulk can bring down. What more or less usual humans like Black Widow and Hawkeye can do to survive such a battlefield for super heroes is beyond my understanding, too. Not to mention the usual showcasing of US equipment (F-35 e.g.) and a ""skycarrier"" which in some way made me think of ""Space Battleship Yamato"". And last but not least no one of the ones responsible seems to have read Marvel comics when they have been young; I did, and there's no way that Iron Boy and Miss America could hold up to Thor and Hulk. How did Iron Man put it correctly in the comics (with regard to Thor/Hulk): ""With enough energy I can keep up with those guys (on the Super Hero top list)...for two seconds."" The end with interviews and statements on the streets and of course before that the use of nukes to close the portal brought my till then five stars vote down to three. Why for whose sake ever is the enemy superior when we have nukes and they don't? How could nukes close a portal made of pure energy from the cube which is - because of this fact - impenetrable?

"anifanmc","10","7","15","28 May 2012"," A cinematic Marvel in more ways than one
","When the first Iron Man film came out, the studios behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe were embarking on something truly unprecedented in modern cinema. Iron Man was a relatively under-promoted movie with trailers that showed barely the surface of what to expect. I went to the midnight screening of the movie with a number of friends as a social outing, while they were the ones who were truly Marvel comics fanatics. By the end, I was absolutely blown away by the strength of the movie in both its action and gravitas. And after the credits, when Nick Fury arrived played by Samuel L. Jackson to announce ""The Avengers Initiative"", I was both excited and skeptical.<br/><br/>Although I wasn't an avid comic book fan at the time, most people my age knew who the Avengers were - the ""World's Mightiest Heroes"", comprising such characters which would be almost ludicrous to depict on screen. In this day and age, who would take a movie about Captain America seriously? Or Thor, who I knew of primarily as a chief Norse god and not a superhero? And yet, one by one, each of the movies blew away all my preconceptions and expectations.<br/><br/>The Avengers, the result of four years of meticulous buildup and hard work, does not disappoint. I am by no means a Joss Whedon fanboy, but you could see his work ingrained in the dialogue, the scripting, and the loving attention paid to a universe that he, as a comic book fan, clearly cares about. I remained skeptical all the way until I was physically sitting in the theater that this could be anything but an action orgy, yet through the most unlikely situations, they gave the film a heart.<br/><br/>The premise is surprisingly simple - Loki, Thor's brother from his film, is preparing to invade the Earth with the help of an unknown benefactor and an army called the Chitauri (who are in fact the Ultimate Marvel version of the notorious Skrull - minus the shapeshifting ability) while taking advantage of the artifact known as the Tesseract (which the fans of the comics would recognize as the Cosmic Cube). SHIELD's Nick Fury, recognizing the threat, tries to bring the team together with Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and the out-of-time Captain America, while consulting Dr. Bruce Banner, whose angry side has been kept under control for some time, to help find the Tesseract. The initial interaction between them is, as expected, not a cordial one, though you do see the beginnings of some deep friendships beginning, including one between Stark and Banner - evidently brought together by a penchant for genius. While there are numerous shorter action sequences stringing the film together with character setpieces, the finale of the movie culminates in one of the most brilliantly shot 30-40 minute action sequences I've ever seen. The third Transformers movie attempted something similar, and failed at it, where this truly succeeded.<br/><br/>A few things really stand out in the movie. The first is the evolution of Tony Stark's character. In previous movies the main thing that had really been explored were (a) his ego and (b) his quest for redemption; as Rogers puts it, however, he seems to only fight for himself and is ""all about style"". Yet, in this film, he manages to portray not only a semblance of heroism, but participates in one of probably the most heroic acts depicted so far in a superhero film. His relationship with Dr. Banner manages to underscore just how strong his character has become - where the other team see Banner as a ticking ""time bomb"", as he aptly puts at one point, Stark believes that not only did the Hulk save Banner's life, it is something of his nature to be embraced and taken control of instead of feared. And ultimately, the faith he shows in him proves to be right.<br/><br/>Another strong element of the film, as in most Joss Whedon productions, is the uplifting of a strong female character, namely Black Widow. Natasha Romanoff had a bit part in the second Iron Man film, but wasn't the real focus of the film nor was she fully explored as a character. This film provides a strong focus into her psyche as a master assassin and highlights her relationship with Hawkeye, the master marksman. She's surprisingly one of the film's most inscrutable characters, showing only enough emotion as she needs, but being capable of great loyalty, compassion, and heroism. Despite her and Clint Barton being the two ""non-superheroes"" on the team, they provide an absolutely integral part of the team; their role is irreplaceable on the team and they kick as much butt as the rest of the hyper-powered team members. At no point in the movie did I feel like any one super hero was used to prop up the others like a crutch.<br/><br/>And finally, without a doubt, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of both Bruce Banner and the Hulk is probably one of the best ever to hit the screen. Previous movies had touched on the strength of the Hulk and his potential for limitless strength while highlighting Banner's genius and compassionate nature, but it has never been done quite so well. He steals the movie, ultimately surpassing all expectations against all the odds. He grows rapidly (both literally and figuratively) throughout the movie, gaining a new sort of confidence. Before the film I wasn't a huge fan of the Hulk, but after-wards, I have infinitely more respect for the character - mixed in with a touch of respectful fear.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth watching in theaters, on the big screen. The experience is 100% worth it. All I can say is, The Dark Knight Rises has a lot to live up to if it hopes to do anywhere near as well as this monster of a film."

I have seen thousands of movies but there was no one like this.As a child and till i saw avengers i always dreamed of watching all the super heroes together.When i heard about the avengers i always thought the director won't be able to do justice to so many characters.But this movie changed my thought.From the moment the movie starts you are lost in it.Every scene is just about perfect.All the super heroes look great.You will be surprised by the amount of comedy in this movie because you expect it to be a complete action one.I can assure you that you will watch this as many times as you want but you will feel the same that you felt first time.And surely you will want to be an Avenger no matter what your age is. I have been dreaming this movie since i saw it.<br/><br/>Why to watch:- The best movie of all time,Super Action,Awesome Comedy, Some classical acting,Thor,Iron Man,Captain America,Hulk,Hawkeye,Black widow and 3D quality<br/><br/>Why not to Watch:- Watch it otherwise you will be missing a revolution."

","Having seen the previous Marvel movies, I have to say this was probably their best work so far. This movie caters to all ages with plenty of laughs and OMG moments. Sure, the beginning had a bit of a slow start, but once it got on its feet, WOW! Iron Man had a big part in this, being the hilarious, immature playboy to Thor and Captain America's more serious nature. Scarlett Johansson played the part of Black Widow perfectly and Hawk-Eye and the Hulk were both splendid. The villain, Loki, stepped out of the ""typical bad guy"" shadow and made the perfect enemy for these amazing heroes. The effects didn't have that sick, CG look a lot of other hero movies have and the plot was believable. I'll admit, I shed a few tears in some scenes, but seconds later, they brought the laughs right back. Overall, an excellent family movie!"
"levantelee","10","7","15","10 May 2012"," Movie of the year for me
","""Warning, this review may contain spoilers"". The Avengers was definitely worth a wait. I enjoyed every second of it, and Iron Man played an important part in the whole film. And he was also my favorite superhero. This movie was so special in 5 ways: 1. The Anticipation. 2. The Trailers. 3. The Cast. 4. The Villains. 5. The HULK. The Hulk was a COMPLETE MONSTER in the movie and I was glad he fought Thor. But, the assets( Black Widow and Hawkeye)did a PHENOMENAL job in their part of the movie. Scarlett Johansson was amazing. Thor was more aggressive in this movie than in his own movie. Oh, THOR vs Iron Man was my favorite fight scene. Captain America played a good role in the film. Loki was lethal and unpredictable in the movie. I was laughing so hard when Hulk smashed Loki into the floor. When I seen the movie, the day it came out May 4th 2012, every single person in the audience was laughing so hard. In the post-credits scene I was so surprised to see THANOS. I knew their was going to be something after the credits and I'm going to do that every time I see a marvel movie. BTW, I'm glad they showed Thanos in the post-credits scene. Phenomenal movie, go see it ASAP."
"josh-fielding","9","7","15","7 May 2012"," My expectations were incredibly high and THE AVENGERS went above and beyond what I was expecting
","I should start this review by saying that I am a massive comic book fan and have been for as long as I can remember. Whenever a new comic book movie comes out I get very excited and am either satisfied, more than satisfied, disappointed or mildly annoyed when I actually see the damn thing. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999) has been building steadily since ""Iron Man"" (more than satisfied) and has been coming along nicely brick by brick with ""The Incredible Hulk"" (yet to see), ""Iron Man 2"" (satisfied), ""Thor"" (satisfied), ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (more than satisfied) adding more and more detail and continuity to the mountain. We have now reached ""The Avengers"" (more than satisfied) which climbs to the peak of the mountain to take it's place as the epitome of an awesome movie. I went into ""The Avengers"" excited, disbelieving that this was actually happening and very, very scared about how much I would enjoy it due to the MASSIVE hype surrounding the film. I came out in a state of great pleasure and I thank the stars that Marvel Studios chose cult television genius Joss Whedon to direct and write it. Why did I love this movie so much? <br/><br/>1. Joss Whedon brought the spirit, skill, humour and knowledge that this film needed. His previous works that I have seen, ""Dr. Horrible's Sing- A-Long Blog"" and ""Firefly"" prove that he can create great drama and many memorable lines both meaningful and hilarious. His twenty-five issue run on ""Astonishing X-Men"" proves that he knows Marvel characters very well and can write great superheroes with very human flaws. <br/><br/>2. The actors were downright perfect for their roles and each one got an equal role to play. Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man/Tony Stark),Chris Evans(Captain America/Steve Rogers), Chris Hemsworth (Thor, God of Thunder) and Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) have already proved in previous films that they are great choices for Marvel's movies. Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow/Natasha Romanov) got just enough screen time in ""Iron Man 2"" to show she was a GOOD choice for the character, but in this she proves to be the best we could possibly ask for. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye/Clint Barton) appeared for five seconds in ""Thor"" to shoot an arrow or two so he obviously proved nothing in that movie, but in this one he proves to be a superb choice for one of my long-time favourite Marvel characters. Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk/Bruce Banner) is the only main newcomer in this film due to Edward Norton and Marvel disagreeing with each other after ""The Incredible Hulk"" and proves to be a perfect choice for Bruce Banner, certainly better than Eric Bana in the horrible outing ""The Hulk"". Tom Hiddleston (Loki, God of Mischief) proved excellent in ""Thor"" and continues his excellence in this. Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson) plays the only character created specifically for these films and has become a fan favourite through his brief appearances in previous Marvel pictures. Agent Coulson really gets his chance to shine in this film and shine he does. <br/><br/>3. It set things up very nicely for future entries in the series.<br/><br/>4. The character interactions were incredible and all of the heroes and villains were smartly developed, something you can be guaranteed in a Joss Whedon production. <br/><br/>5. It looked great, the costumes, the fight scenes e.t.c were all very well designed. <br/><br/>6. It had heart, something you don't get in most blockbusters. <br/><br/>7. Stan Lee's cameo. <br/><br/>8. Post credits sequence. <br/><br/>9. Harry Dean Stanton's cameo. <br/><br/>10. The hilarious lines, such as ""Puny God"" <br/><br/>These are just a few of the many reasons ""The Avengers"" worked so well for me and all in all I have to say that my expectations were incredibly high and ""The Avengers"" went above and beyond what I was expecting."
"kevinxirau","10","7","15","7 May 2012"," A movie that assembles and conquers.
","Wow, it has finally arrived. Marvel has had one hell of a project, coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as a way to show fans what is coming over the horizon. The result is an all-out marvel mash as Earth's mightiest heroes have come together to face a threat no one hero could possibly face alone. They are the Avengers.<br/><br/>Loki, the god of mischief, has come to conquer the Earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up. To make matters worse, he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal. In desperation, Nick Fury, director of the peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Incredible Hulk. If these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together, their combined might be enough to conquer this global threat.<br/><br/>This is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie. The faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film. Normally, such a task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics, but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in The Avengers, not to mention avoid any plot holes. Thankfully, this movie does it all plus more. It is, dare I say it, incredible! <br/><br/>The action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre, lots of shooting, punching, and, of course, smashing. Things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out. All the characters have practically equal back story, interactions, and amount of fighting, even characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. With this, not one seems left out or doesn't get enough of these elements. Dialog is written very well and there's a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film (and it's hard not to laugh with it). There's lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit corny.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this will satisfy anyone, especially the fans. Everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt. With fantastic action scenes, excellent special effects, well-written script, cool music, and surprisingly great comedy, The Avengers is sure to satisfy in every way. On a scale of one to ten, I would give this movie a twenty (it's a shame I can't physically give such a rating)! Go check out this awesome flick and enjoy! AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!"
"Carlkid13","10","7","15","7 May 2012"," If you are interested at all you will like it
","I went into this movie with an assumption. I figured that the action scenes would be awesome. Marvel had shown that they were very capable of great action sequences and this would be no exception.<br/><br/>However, action alone doesn't make a good movie (matrix sequels). This was the part that I was worried about. Would the story and characters be good enough to match the explosive action? The answer is a resounding YES! Great character interactions, hilarious dialog, a true comic book story (not deep like Dark Knight but fun like Iron Man). All of the characters have roles that feel natural and the dialog flows. Robert Downey Jr getting Joss Whedon lines is as good as it sounds and I never realized how hilariously awesome the hulk could be.<br/><br/>There are a few problems I had with the movie such as Captain America's back story, no wait I really just hated the Captain America movie. This movie met my expectations (which were enormously high so to surpass them this would have had to be the second coming of Christ's type of awesome)."

","It took Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America to build up to this, and was it worth the wait, Yes in deed.<br/><br/>Nick Fury(Samual L. Jackson) brings together Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Doney Jr), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk(Mark Rufalo), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) in hopes of stopping Loki(Tom Hiddleston) from world domination.<br/><br/>It was worth it all the way through. Samual L. Jackson this time is front and center, and really shines in the role of Nick Fury. So does everybody else, Mark Rufalo really brings his own to Bruce Banner, although I do miss Edward Norton in the role, Rufalo does quite well. And Tom Hiddleston is quite menacing as Loki, more so then he was in Thor(2011), he was the best villain, almost tops The Joker. The rest of the cast are pretty good also. The Effects are great, the battle scenes are epic. This is a Marvel film that should not be missed."

","Superman: The Movie, The Dark Knight and The Avengers. Yes ""The Avengers"" does indeed stand tall amongst the greatest superhero movies of all time.<br/><br/>A stellar cast assemble to create a marvel of a film, pun definitely intended. The special effects are top notch and never look out of place like superhero movies of the past. However it is truly the story that is most appreciated since it is the final act of an intricate tightly woven plot that has been building through the current generation of Marvel films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) and ends with the best superhero finale ever conceived for the big screen. Yes its that good. The only factor that could have been reduced was the amount of humour and sarcasm following certain kick-ass scenes which could have benefited with a touch of cool. In retrospect the humour mostly gets it right and compliments the ""comic book"" feel of the movie, which is what we have all desperately wanted for so long: A comic book movie that truly sets your mind free like the comic books and cartoons we all read and watched growing up thinking anything was possible.<br/><br/>I applaud you Marvel as ""The Avengers"" now stands as one of the greatest, if not the greatest superhero movie of all time."

","I rarely review any movie titles, purely because I watch so many films it would be impossible to review them all. Avengers Assemble however was a special case.<br/><br/>I not only rate this as the best comic book movie ever crafted, but also as one of the best films ever made. It had heart, comedy, action, animation, character development, suspense; all neatly encompassed in a smooth and flawlessly flowing Joss Whedon storyline.<br/><br/>Each character has his/her moment of glory and not one of the actors/actresses feel short of the high expectations placed upon their shoulders. Chris Evans as Captain America is and always will be my favourite character in this Marvel film series and he shined brighter than ever in his second role reprisal.<br/><br/>I cannot more highly insist you see this film whilst it is IN THE CINEMAS!

","I just got back from the movie theater where I saw The Avengers. Without spoiling anything, I must say it is indeed a spectacular spectacular and I hope to find time to watch it again in the near future. It's an action bonanza laced with fine performances (I love the arguments between Captain America and Iron Man cleverly delivered by Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr.), clever humor and not surprisingly Marvel universe references. <br/><br/>Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars. The script was nicely done and the dialogue really reflect the minds of each character. Really, The Avengers is the complete package of entertainment that engaged me with lots of thrills and absolutely no boring moments. I highly recommend it."

"puzgolac","3","12","30","10 May 2012"," More of them does not make for a better movie
","Deceived by the praise and high ratings this movie received here I decided to watch it, even though I didn't like Thor, couldn't sit through the propaganda that was Captain America, and thought that both of the Ironmen were only average. <br/><br/>The movie is just fighting, explosions, destruction to infinity, and the action isn't anything that you haven't seen before. There is just more of it, which doesn't make it better - it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast. Scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid one-liners, seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of ""God bless America, and make the rest of the world (or rather Universe) its colony."" <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson was unbelievably terrible, Scarlett Johansson was terrible, and was that Sherlock Holmes wearing a suit of armor? I could have sworn that the character was the same, only the name was different. So much for Robert Downey's versatility. The rest of the cast followed suit. The only decent actor in this movie was Tom Hiddleston , but his character was ruined by the writers. Loki is supposed to be a god, but here he is so mediocre, that it is ridiculous. His ""mighty"" spear is nothing more than a very low grade laser gun, which doubles as a mind control tool that doesn't work all of the time, and when it does work, it does not work all that well. The mighty, fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder, dropping like mosquitoes. Characters' level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment. There are 2 (yes, TWO) funny scenes, and both include the Hulk beating up people. That should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie. <br/><br/>I guess to like this one you would either have to be a die hard fan of the Avengers, or a die hard fan of mindless, repetitive, boring action. This movie doesn't require suspension of belief to be enjoyed. It requires suspension of brain functions."

","This is one movie that i went into with really low standards, but i was sadly still disappointed. There's no story line, a terrible script, Annoying Characters and Pointless endless hoards of enemies who what to kill everyone like usual (for some reason). The Special effects are alright, but that's to be expected as they have the budget for it. But to be honest, the only thing that kept me watching this major disappointment was Scarlett Johansson in that tight costume. That's IT! That's simply not enough for a huge blockbuster that was supposed to unite all of these massive superhero movies of late. Don't waste your time with this movie. (I will just add that this movie isn't as bad as Captain America or Thor both of which i walked out of)"
"jamiethomaswhite","3","8","18","5 September 2012"," Bad directing, aimless acting, too long.
","This film is a steaming pile of turd. I've never disliked Joss Whedon, I love Buffy and Firefly/Serenity but he's not a very good director. The actors seem to suffer as much confusion as their characters do almost like, as torn as they are to join Shield and The Avengers in the film is how torn the actors must feel from scene to scene as to why they're even in this film.<br/><br/>Captain America does not seem like a 1930's man, I've seen better period acting in Mad Men and the like, I was looking for some authenticity in him. Thor is paying so much attention to his hair he seems to have forgotten his point. And Scarlett Johansson is horrific, she's so monotonously apathetic it shines through in her character and the only part of her face that shows any sign of acting is her eyebrow, when it raises at one point. The left one it was.<br/><br/>And this film is the longest bad film I've ever had the stupidity to watch.<br/><br/>Another point that peeved me is that the action is so ridiculously loud but the speaking so quiet in comparison, it was like every explosion was happening inside my head and every conversation was in the next room over and I was listening in.<br/><br/>The Avengers gets 1 point for the team dynamic, when they're altogether it's interesting to watch, and 2 points for Robert Downey Jr, he's a whole lot of man but even his humour and acting is outweighed by the stink of the rest of the film, so it gets 3 out of 10 from me and a black mark against Mark Ruffalo who was a credible actor in my eyes."
"doorsscorpywag","3","8","18","19 August 2012"," Marvel Universe so utterly a dull place
","As a 1960s Marvel and DC comics fan I have watched the film adaptations with interest over the years and frankly have been rather disappointed. Poorest of all is the Marvel Universe of comic characters. A bunch of dullards dressed up as something interesting and worst of all is when they get together as in this the first outing of The Avengers. Tony Stark's Iron Man is the worst of an utterly boring bunch but only just as he has some serious competition from the less than one dimensional Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America. The plot what there was of it was lamentable and the hopeless friction between the super heroes seemed nothing more than a way to pan out two hours rather than adding anything to the actual movie. Nick Fury added a bit of interest but was underused and SHIELD looked more like the Men From UNCLE with a bit of Captain Scarlet thrown in but less interesting. Loki was a very poor villain and the alien invasion was one of the worst ever conceived. <br/><br/>This type of film is made for a very intellectually challenged American audience and had all the ingredients to satisfy them. Lots of explosions and plenty of American flags to cheer at. But I always thought Marvel's characters were a lot more interesting than this bunch of costumed bores. Maybe I saw it through rose tinted shades back then but what I remember was a lot better than this tripe. I will admit Thor, Captain America and the new Hulk film were reasonably well done but Iron Man I and II left me cold and I was a big fan of him as a kid. But the Avengers was a mess. <br/><br/>The DC side (Green Lantern aside) has for me been done a lot better especially the Batman adaptations. Marvel not so, sadly. <br/><br/>One of the worst bits was the sentimentality card played via a rather sad and pathetic Agent Coulson who up till thn had been a rather interesting character. This device used to galvanise the fractured super force into an unstoppable storm of red white and blue and some green. <br/><br/>The witty one liners become tired and overused as the film drags itself to an inevitable conclusion and the final battle in Manhattan was done better in Cloverfield. It's a shame as these guys were my heroes as a kid in the 60s but now as an old man all I see are a bunch of prats in Halloween costumes. Luckily I have the final Batman movie still to watch so it's not all doom and gloom in the costume hero stakes but this lot should be retired as they are nothing but frauds."
"ted-ms","9","8","18","16 July 2012"," Greatest action film I've seen
","There are not many films that are good enough (In my opinion) to make me go and see it five times at the cinemas, HOWEVER from start to finish The Avengers was an excellent example of how to develop a reasonably detailed plot-line whilst maintaining an unrelenting series of action sequences.<br/><br/>The chemistry between each of the already well established characters was fantastic. Getting a good balance of all personalities with wholesome and righteous from Captain America, sarcastic and nonchalant from Iron Man, zen and rage from Bruce Banner. They really managed to cover all the sides of human emotion and hero stereotypes.<br/><br/>At the end of the day if you want the most unexpected, ground shattering storyline with serious real-life connections tho may not be the best movie for you. However if you want a brilliantly laid out series of action sequence, funny one liner, small plot development, action sequence, action sequence and bigger action sequence. This movie is going to rock your world!"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","8","18","15 May 2012"," A Gem of an Action Movie
","The Avengers (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up."

","What happens when you get a team of super hero's together who shouldn't be in a room together let alone trying to save a city? You have the Avengers, one of the most anticipated movies for years. I remember working at a movie theater back in 2007 and one of the guys that worked there was telling me about how there was talks to make the film and I thought it was never going to happen, well, clearly this is why I'm not in the stock market. But when I heard that Joss Whedon was behind it, I couldn't wait, he's the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is one of Hollywood's best writers. He has a genuine love for comics, action and giving characters real depth. After viewing The Avengers, you couldn't ask for better action on the big screen and so much great excitement. I think the fans got everything they were asking for and deserved with this great popcorn flick.<br/><br/>Nick Fury arrives at a remote research facility during an evacuation. The commander explains that an energy source of unknown potential has activated and opened a mysterious portal. Through it steps the exiled Loki, who takes the Tesseract and uses his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel including agent Clint Barton and a few others in order to aid in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the Avengers Initiative: Agent Natasha Romanoff, Dr. Bruce Banner, Agent Phil Coulson, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract from Loki. However, Thor, Loki's adoptive brother, arrives and attempts to free Loki to reason with him. When that doesn't work, the hero's start fighting over who's in charge until they realize that Loki's ego is growing stronger and will destroy the world if they do not stick together and stop him as The Avengers.<br/><br/>First off, the actors: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson all clicked so amazingly well together. I'm still a little bummed that they couldn't get Edward Norton for the Hulk, he was a perfect cast and just excellent in The Incredible Hulk, but Mark gives his own take to the character and comes through in the end. The effects are so amazing and grand to watch on the big screen that this was the only way you should see the movie as they are just tearing New York apart with all these aliens and flying creatures in the middle of down town Manhatten. Now one of the things I do have to laugh a little at is that all the characters get these cool costumes, sleek, sexy and tough¬Öthen you have Captain America who looks like he got his costume at Target. You can't blame the officer he tells to get the police to get the civilians to safety and the officer asks ""and who are you that I should be taking these orders from?"". There are some great comedic moments, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. and The Hulk just going crazy on Loki.<br/><br/>There are a couple of flaws in the film like Loki. I don't know if it was the actor, Tom Hiddleston, but I just couldn't really take him seriously as a villain. I found the aliens who were invading more threatening as Loki just keeps saying ""Kneel before me! I am a God!"" and giving you a used car salesman's smile. There are moments where it seems to drag a little with the talking, as we're getting our hero's together. I'm all for development, but I wanted a WWE smack down because we're not given as much depth with these characters as you would say Spider-man or Batman. But I think I'm just nitpicking at this point because I don't want to put anyone off on the film.<br/><br/>The Avengers is everything you could ask for in a superhero film. It's got great action, excellent chemistry, good style and is just a ton of fun to watch. I got to see this in a crowded theater where you can tell the audience was just pumped up to see something good and you got to give the film credit for bringing some excitement to the theater. We don't get many exciting films that have actual good writing to it like this. Joss did an excellent job handling these big guys on the screen and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Though I hope there is more egging on of the Hulk, I would have a ton of fun if I were next to him saying what Captain America was talking about his mama.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I've seen the inflated review aggregate, and at the risk of being dismissed a contrarian, I seriously disagree with the accolades. The Avengers movie I saw contained no character development whatsoever; no character starts off ignorant, growing to enlightenment, or overcomes cowardice to become a hero, or any other example of behavioral character arcs. By the end, they are as they begun, unchanged, and definitively two-dimensional. The lack of character development is compounded by uninteresting, witless, filler dialogue (despite a few one-liners which managed to draw a giggle), with Dr. Stark and Dr. Banner, i.e. the alter egos of Iron-man and the Hulk, occasionally foraying into esoteric scientific jibber-jabber, that only served to bore me even more. In saying that, Downey Jr's, Tony Stark was the only mildly interesting and amusing character in the entire piece; the rest of the characters I couldn't give a shite about, despite liking them in their stand-alone movies. It seems Director Joss Whedon and pen pal, Zak Penn, are unaware of the law of diminishing returns, whereby the repetition of anything ‚Äì in this case, fist-fights, and gun and super-power battles ‚Äì eventually numbs to the point of indifference. Speaking of indifference, the limp-wristed, laughable, horn-wearing villain, Loki, was about as menacing as having a series of ping pong balls pitched at you. And the death of (no spoiler here) was about as emotionally moving as having your pet weevil larvae die. Effects-wise it seems despite the advances in CGI made by Avatar, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Avengers decided to go retrograde, the Hulk looking nothing more than a three-dimensional cartoon, and likewise with Iron-Man and the endless stream of generic alien henchmen. The green-screen for the most part looked phony due to the artificial interior lighting illuminating the actor, mismatching the natural exterior light of the background ‚Äì an Age-old problem that some directors don't seem to care about, however seriously it affects the suspension of disbelief. Anyway, enough of my moaning; if you like mindless-action with practically no story other than goodies versus baddies, and if you're a fan of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, you'll love this."

","The Avengers is a fun movie, it looks great visually and has a classic comic book plot. The issue is there is nothing original or inspiring about it! It lacks drama and the ability to get you lost in the plot; it is terribly predictable and never once has the viewer worried or wondering what will happen next. Yes it's a fun and awesome comic book movie, but I would say it's much more of a novelty than a great work of art. The Dark Knight series were all base off comic books yet had an edge added to them to make the viewer connect to the characters and actually worry because they need knew what would happen next, like most great movies. The Avengers fails to do this throughout the film. There is nothing innovative about the plot there is no true tension in the film. I would normally rate this film as a 5/6 out of 10 but I can't since there are so many high ratings. Simply said The Avengers is a fun simple movie with great visual effects that can bring you back to childhood, it is not a horrible film but it is not a work of cinematic art by any means and I do not feel like it deserves a rating as high as some of the most classics and original films we have to offer rate."

","I was drawn into watching this movie by the promising graphics more than anything else. I'm not a comic book aficionado in the least, so I went into the movie without any of that background knowledge. Nor did I need it, as I soon found out. There's enough back story inserted to get folks through & the back story of the characters isn't really integral to the story, I thought.<br/><br/>The plot was VERY predictable. There was nothing new or original about it. Can easily see where the story is heading and pretty easy to guess how it will end. So, in that regard, I'd give the movie a 1 out of 10.<br/><br/>Where this film shines -- and is downright amazing -- are the majority of the graphics. Fantastically intricate CGI work! From that aspect, I'd give the movie a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>So, basically, this is a great one if you're looking for mindless entertainment as the story line isn't a challenge to follow. Definitely a feast for the eyes!"

","I AM HULK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The Powerhouse, the boiling bed, the grizzly, machismo and the Ultimate hammer-head, he knows how to pump up your very source of adrenaline.<br/><br/>I regret that I watched this movie late- but it was due to my exams that I wasn't able to do so. But if you still haven't seen it yet, I tell you bluntly, you are a fool!<br/><br/>'Avengers' is the best super-action movie I have ever seen!!!<br/><br/>It's not due to the story, not due to the theme, not due to the super- star cast. The real hero of this movie was the awesome special effects and of course, that includes Hulk.<br/><br/>The arena is all set. We have Ironman, Hawkeye, Thor, Hulk, CaptainAmericaand Black Widow to set the stage on fire. And what are they facing? Gargantuan, bulk bio-mechanical aliens with a centralized connection system, they lay down the New York City to dust, smoke and metallic rubble.<br/><br/>There wasn't a single moment that you actually feel bored or out of place. This movie kept me glued to the screen throughout.<br/><br/>Now, for the characters¬Ö..<br/><br/>Hawkeye: He is a good guy, turned bad guy, then once again into a good guy. Don't let his metamorphosis confuse you. Because his explosive arrow (for those who understand 'brahmasthra'!) indeed made me reminiscent of the good old fight between Hindu Gods and Demons. He is good, but still, just a little bit less than the others.<br/><br/>Black Widow: Don't even dare take her at her face value. She is never what she appears to be. She is docile and meek when she wants to leech out information from you, but ruthless and super daring when she stomps down the aliens to their gory end. Best scene- The way she takes control of the alien ship. She may soon stump down Emma Watson as my favourite heroine.<br/><br/>Thor: He is a force to reckon with, literally. The power to wield thunderbolts never ever ceases to amaze me. And it didn't in this movie. There was an awesome fight sequence between Ironman and Thor. Best Scene: The way he makes the entire skyscraper an electric conductor and focuses the electricity on the warp hole, blowing the bulky, snaky aliens to smithereens.<br/><br/>Captain America: Though low on actual power, he can still wield his shield and send Thor flying away distances. He is the Captain Cool, one who likes to plan out things and do accordingly. A tad old-fashioned (of course he is old-fashioned- he is old, the scientists literally thawed him back to life!!) but he more than makes up with his patriotism and his iron-will to see it through the end.<br/><br/>Ironman: A billionaire, genius and a philanthropist. Ironman is indeed the superhero with panache. He can be the style icon for all the superheroes- the way he undoes his suit is awesome, uber cool gadgetry, superb dialogues and a sexy iron suit that can do cool different tricks. Oh Man! He was simply superb. Of course he takes away the cake, when he directs the nuclear missile through the warp hole and into the heart of the alien stronghold.<br/><br/>Hulk: No comparison. He, according to me, was the life and soul of this movie. Well, I must complain- that these Hollywood blockbusters always show India in poor light, even though that part does not represent India as a whole. Maybe they have the 'Great Indian Poverty Fetish' or the 'Dharavi Syndrome'. Well, but this feeling of being disparaged does not last long as we soon see the Doctor 'awakening the green bulky giant within' and being transformed into Hulk. There are actually three 'City Moment of Success' related to him. 1) The way he pounds the great snaky alien to dust. 2) The way he punches Thor. 3) Now this was the best scene of the move- he thrashes up Loci in the very Chota Bheem style- that was awesome. I can still remember the reaction that Loci gave¬Ö..<br/><br/>Maybe it doesn't have much of a story. But alien invasion movies are not meant to have one. What they are meant to have is spectacular fireworks, and this had those aplenty.<br/><br/>Every time, I see a movie like this- my heart pumps faster, my whole body gets filled with tout electrical energy. It is as if, I were a character inside the movie. I loved the feeling, I loved the movie.<br/><br/>Miss it at your own peril"
"i_didnt_see_that_coming","7","5","10","7 June 2012"," Unbelievably over-hyped!
","I don't believe anyone wouldn't enjoy it and so I would recommend it, but at the same time, I felt the urge to write a cautionary review to try and add to the expulsion of some of the 9/10 star hype (and the ridiculous 1 star reviews).<br/><br/>I felt a little tired the night I went to watch this film, but since I'd booked tickets I went anyway. I think this might be why I came out feeling it wasn't awe-inspiring. My tiredness stopped me from enjoying the non-stop 'conceptual interfaces', the flash and the CGI, when you are less aware of these aspects what is underneath is not as high-concept as is made out. What I found was a slightly bumbling first half and an action-packed second half. I believe if you got this home when it comes out and watch it on an average TV on DVD you wouldn't be as impressed.<br/><br/>With so many stories to include there isn't much exploration of any particular area, we have a fair bit of time dedicated to learning a little about each character but given it does nothing more than glance across the surface, why bother at all? Why not give us more in-depth insight into the 'mechanics' of the how and why, a creative discussion on, well, something - anything and let the audience infer the rest by showing us in character reactions etc. Then let the second half let-rip.<br/><br/>I'm no film buff but it seems to me that when you stop and actually compare films of IMDb's claim to be equal in calibre - we have The Avengers being better than Taxi Driver, Alien and only 0.2 behind Empire Strikes Back - obviously you can't really compare the films because they're so different but it's a point about the ratings.<br/><br/>In the characters we see half interesting and half one-dimensional, with a strange amount of time, relatively speaking, being given to aspects that don't really push the film forward. Sorry for the lack of pro-critique - like I said, I'm not a film buff.<br/><br/>I didn't know this was a Joss Whedon film until after I watched it and this makes sense - a lot of his stuff is amazing and deep, subtle and telling, yet then you get other work like Dollhouse which falls down by picking the wrong kind of area to focus on.<br/><br/>It's worth a watch though, and if you like comic book films like Iron Man (obviously) you're going to enjoy this. For those less interested in that stuff, don't expect 9 or 10 stars."

In fact the only character to really stand out is Iron Man, but his ironic punchlines get old very very fast. He's just there for comic relief. But by the time he pours his 20th joke, it's just annoying.<br/><br/>The action scenes are just boring. Watching computer-made polygons fight each other hardly matches my definition of excitement. If only I cared about the characters, I might have enjoyed them but since I didn't it was just a borefest. Here's the thing about Hollywood: they try to make action scenes as impressive as possible, but if you do not care about the characters, you won't care about what happens to them.<br/><br/>You would have just as much enjoyment reading the script than watching this movie because the direction is non existent. This movie embodies everything that's wrong with Hollywood nowadays. Nothing is new or surprising in this movie. If you haven't seen a Hollywood movie for 4 years you might enjoy this one, otherwise you'll just be bored by the same old crap as usual."

It seemed to me as if all the Avengers were redundant except for Iron Man because every time they fought, he came and made it right. I also didn't like most of the acting & Scarlett Johansson was more than a waste for the story. She just had no meaning and her character wasn't necessary in any way. I also don't understand why everyone liked Hulk so much. I think Mark Ruffalo did a great job with playing the angry professor but as Hulk? Just no.. he couldn't get a single giggle out of me. The only one that really impressed me was Loki & I loved him already after the first minutes of ""Thor"".<br/><br/>I admit I'm not a professional review writer, in fact it's my first one so it may be really bad but I had to say that I just didn't like it.

It is NOT an original plot or even creative. I fail to see how long scenes of fighting, with the camera cutting back and forth is entertaining. If you actually truly LIKE this movie, please go see a doctor.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see how the second film turns out.

"abengfield","4","6","13","3 November 2013"," The Avengers is okay, but not worth the hype.
","When i sat down to watch the Avengers i had little if not any hope that i would enjoy it. But i was wrong, what happened when the film started was a collection of events that changed my ""little hope"" attitude into something much different. After the opening scene i was, to say the least, entertained. But, when i tasked myself with the painfully easy job of rating this film, all this film is...is entertainment. In a time of dazzling CGI and insanely fun action sequences, The Avengers lives up to the hype. But in a world of intriguing plot, immersing performances and emotional roller coaster rides, The Avengers is nothing but another Transformers movie. Let me elaborate. <br/><br/>Fans of the Marvel Comics will love this movie, because it does what it says on the tin, it effectively brings the heroes (not all of them, but some) together in a fist fight with a destructive foe. To a Marvel fan, this is gold. To a ""film"" fan, however, this movie is little more than a popcorn flick. People enjoying this movie is not my issue, i want people to enjoy movies, but when it comes to the rating systems on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes (etc) people have, wrongly, rated the Avengers near to the highest of all ratings. Films like the Godfather, ALIEN, Shane, Vertigo, Psycho, Blade Runner, Goodfellas, Jaws and many, many more films deserve the high rating because these are cinematic masterpieces. These are films which changed cinema, and have set the benchmark for all genres of today's films. But when i see The Avengers at the top of the ratings with them, it disgusts me. It should be rated fairly, on an accurate basis of how the film is crafted and the impact it makes, and for me it is a 4. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie. But, it is not a classic, nor by far a masterpiece, which renders most fans reviews redundant. People can love this movie, hell it can be there favorite movie of them all, but they need to understand it is nowhere near the Giants of cinema. Its not worth all the hype, but its fun. Its not a clever film (the themes have been done to death, and the twists are terrible) but its entertainment.<br/><br/>So, i bid you farewell."
"soloriamagic08","5","6","13","28 August 2013"," The Avengers, a movie about six heroes and yet the villain is the most interesting character in it.
","The Avengers,the story of a group of super-powered people (well some of them anyway) who are recruited by a secret agency to stop a threat that apparently one hero alone can't fight. Such lies.<br/><br/>Captain America,(Chris Evans)- the so called leader of the avengers. A nice person to the point of garystudom. He is one of the most boring characters in the movie. I watched the avengers for the first time a few months ago on Netflix, and Cap's origin movie was on there as well, and I tried to watch it but only got to the 30 minute mark and shut it off. I was bored to proverbial tears. I don't get the appeal. For me he has no presence and is as forgettable and boring as Hawkeye and Black Widow.<br/><br/>Ironman,(RDJ)- the real leader in my opinion. He seems to be the focus for most of the important plot points, and he is the one who untimely saves New-York. He just has a presence that the rest of them lacked. Where the heroes were concerned the movie was more like Ironman featuring the Avengers and I actually didn't have problem with that.Out of them all I loved his costume the most, and seeing him here has made me want to go out and see his origin movie and sequels.<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemsworth)- Thor is decent by himself, but the interest level really comes in when he's playing against Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hemsworth and Hiddleston play well off each other. They have great chemistry and their love/hate brother dynamic is always fascinating to watch. This is a shame that this was barely touched on in Thor's own movie. Since to me the family dynamic is the meat of their stories. I loved watching their scenes in this movie (the little that we got to see of it) where we get to witness them bounce their dialogue and emotions off each other.<br/><br/>Thor as a character shines better when he is on his own planet. Or pretty much any planet not named Earth. It's like when he's on ours it nearly sucks out everything interesting about him. <br/><br/>Hawkeye( Jeremy Renner) and Black-Widow(Scarlett Johansson )- Two completely human characters fighting alongside super- powered people. Yea, really don't get that. They were wallpaper for me just like Captain America. When they were on screen it's like they were barely registering. I should not have a continuous question mark in my brain when it comes to a character.<br/><br/>Bruce Banner/The Hulk(MarkRuffalo)- I have never seen the hulk movies (apparently there are a fair few) or the TV show. My first foray into this character was in this movie. He is nervous and twitchy, but generally a nice person and I think Ruffalo pulled that off nicely.Then he turns into the Hulk¬Ö. I didn't like the Hulk. He's too godlike for one thing. Same problem I have with Thor and his kind. It takes the emotional stakes out of the character if it's pretty impossible for them to die. He also acts like an animal. Also not a fan of obvious CGI characters (huge green ones at that) being mains and running around with actual real people. It's very jarring in a bad way. I also don't think a full-blown movie works for him. His character works better in an ensemble or even better not part of the cast at all. As for the Bruce part of him well we already have a genius level scientist. Don't really need two. Overall I didn't enjoy the hulk and wanted him off my screen.<br/><br/>Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - the main villain who pretty much took over the movie by his first scene on down. Like in his co-origin movie 'Thor' he is a true scene stealer. I loved watching him. Hiddleston is a treasure to watch act this character out. If the academy wasn't such stuck- ups about fantasy/sci-fi movies I truly think he deserved an Oscar for his portrayal in this and the first 'Thor' movie. His acting for Loki is just brilliant.<br/><br/>However, no amount of scene stealing acting is going to erase that Whedon pretty much destroyed his overall character. He went from a sympathetic villain in 'Thor' to a complete monster punch line in this one. The tone of this movie wasn't serious enough in the first place with Whedon thinking he had to make everyone be a walking comedian, but I will never understand the logic of making your villain be the silliest thing in the movie.Sadly that is exactly what Whedon did. Loki was a pathetic villain.<br/><br/>He took a great character and made him into a joke. The last straw though was not the constant beat downs and jokes at his expense, but an encounter with one of the avengers toward the end of the movie. Loki as a villain had officially went into ludicrous territory at that point. However, what saved him as a character for me was no matter how silly his dialogue sounded at points, or how many times he kissed pavement, or just how overall ridiculous he was as a villain, Hiddleston acted his butt off as Loki. I couldn't take my eyes off the character. All I wish is that Loki from now on stays in the 'Thor' movies and that Joss Whedon doesn't get to touch the character ever again.<br/><br/>In summary the movie's tone was to comedic. It was like whedon was writing for the next bada bing instead of great emotional character moments. The dialogue was more cheesy and clich√© then not.The CGI looked dated.There was no real emotional punch. I just didn't care if they lived or died. Although It wasn't like they were in any real danger of that happening in the first place since the movie overall lacked believable tension,and the villain was well acted but really pathetic as one."
"secondtake","6","6","13","26 May 2013"," If you're already a fan you'll love it, if not it's yet another well crafted superhero CGI flick
","The Avengers (2012)<br/><br/>First: this is high energy stuff with lots of superhero fighting. Lots. Beyond that I had to pick and choose what I liked and what seemed to be dragged out a bit. It was never slow, but it was often a bit uninteresting.<br/><br/>the real downside to the movie was, well, the plot, which had yet another super huge super awful enemy that required our local team to go out and find a way to conquer. It never really mattered why these bad people were coming (though they do explain why, with a spacey glowing cube and Thor's half-brother having some childhood issues unresolved). The set design, however, was really ambitious, not only with the huge scenes and big CGI effects, but the range and diversity of interiors with a deliberate variety of styles that related to the different characters. And some of the actors and actresses were terrific to watch, even if they didn't really have much to say or do that mattered (besides save the world, of course).<br/><br/>If this sounds like I'm not cut out of this type of movie you are mostly wrong. I have loved, for example, the three Nolan ""Batman"" movies, a couple of the ""Spiderman"" ones, and a few oddballs here and there, all of which work on some of the same principles of super villain and a modified New York (Gotham, etc.) as a city of resilient victims to save.<br/><br/>Small (relevant) confession: I loved the Iron Man movies and never saw any of the other Marvel character movies like the Hulk. In this all-star get together of a half dozen famous super-heroes I naturally loved the Iron Man parts and was neutral on the rest. Mostly because Robert Downey Jr. is a huge cut above the others of the cast in presence, in humor, in making the whole enterprise a comic book come to life, not a serious save-the-world epic. By contrast, the leader of the bad guys is a wan, half-hearted baddie who didn't create the chills or fear the movie badly needed. <br/><br/>As a movie of characters taken from various Marvel comic book (and movie) series, it was how fully the characters were realized that made the difference. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was pretty great, though restrained a bit. The Black Widow in the hands of Scarlett Johansson was stunning to look at but also weirdly restrained (except the fighting of course). Thor was a bore, taking his old school power thing too too seriously. And Captain America, though a likable, cute guy, was also a bad casting job--he had to do more than look good (unlike, say, Gwyneth Paltrow, who simply had to look good since she unfortunately had nothing much to say or do).<br/><br/>You'll know if this movie is your thing before you read this or see a trailer. It's a boiler plate super hero action movie with lots of computer effects and a standard villain from the universe menace. (The computer effects, like these skeletal ocean monsters swimming through Manhattan wrecking lots of buildings, are actually, surprisingly, a bit clunky once you start watching the details.) <br/><br/>Overall, director and writer Joss Whedon seems a bit overwhelmed here, and has co-written a predictable bit of very expensive contemporary Hollywood stuff and then directed it without quite making it special. Or surprising. I mean, even Samuel L. Jackson is stiff and preachy. The movie has its moments for sure, but that's not enough. Disappointing."

","How can this film be rated 8+. IMHO it was absolutely average. Apart from Robert Downey's sarcastic/acerbic humour the film's remaining characters were hampered by a poor plot line and an inconsistent/juvenile comic book narrative that's holed below the water line by contradictions. Marvel need to look to writers like Garth Ennis to see how comics should be done.<br/><br/>Costumes were embarrassingly bad; Loki's plastic horns and staff, Captain America's camp tights and Thor's spandex.<br/><br/>Has the IMDb score been artificially inflated, is it a case of the Emperor's new clothes, or is it Marvel fan-boys? I don't know, but it ain't worth more than 5 or 6 on the IMDb Richter scale."

","I know a lot of critics and fans loved this movie, but unfortunately, this movie just didn't do anything for me. My first biggest problem with this movie: Mark Ruffalo was HORRIBLE as Bruce Banner! It was like he was sleepwalking through the entire movie! Marvel fired Edward Norton, and the best replacement they could find was this guy? Did they just pick his name out of a hat? Come on! My second biggest problem with this movie: Captain America gets pushed to the side, and most of the focus is on Iron Man. Why?! Here's a crazy idea: Seeing as how Captain America is the LEADER of the Avengers! Why not give him the spotlight? Furthermore, Iron Man and Captain America hardly ever get along in this movie. This wasn't at ALL like it was in the comics! In the comics, Tony Stark deeply admired and respected Steve Rogers. In Fact, Tony Stark's father, Howard helped create the ""Captain America"" program. My third biggest problem with this movie: It takes FOREVER for the The Avengers to come together and work as a team. Throughout the movie, all they do is fight most of the time, and occasionally throw in a corny joke. Can someone please tell me what purpose that serves, other than to look cool? If you like generic, run of the mill, superhero movies, then give this a watch. However, don't expect this movie to be deep and meaningful, because you will be sorely disappointed."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked pretty cool, and when the review started coming in I immediately got excited. <br/><br/>When I finally got to see the movie I realized after the first 20 minutes that this wasn't the movie I was hoping for. Now let me explain why.<br/><br/>I can start off with the script. The script is not good, by adding some over-dramatic, cheesy and boring dialogue doesn't make a movie good. But the script isn't terrible, some of the cheesy comments fits with the dialogue and makes you laugh a little. <br/><br/>But the one thing that is directly terrible with this movie is the story. For those of you who don't know the story, it goes like this; Thor's evil brother Loki has come to the earth to claim it as his, and then he gets a thing called the Tesseract, and afters that he opens a portal so his alien army can enter the earth to take control over it. But then Nick Fury brings together the superhero team called ''The Avengers'' to stop him. I don't think it's necessary for me to start explaining why the story is so terrible, most people should understand why. <br/><br/>And I know a lot of people have claimed that the film don't need a good script or story because it's so entertaining. Well, I don't agree. The first 1 and a half hours of the movie is really boring, and I actually considered leaving the cinema, but then the movie catch up with some really cool and visually stunning scenes. <br/><br/>Some things in this movie was good, like most of the acting, the CGI and some of the dialogue.

","OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SOOOO BLOWN AWAY! THAT MOVIE WAS PERFECT! Sound familiar? Of course it does. Everyone seems to be in love with this movie. I don't know why, though.<br/><br/>The action was nearly flawless, I will admit that. It looked very real and must have been among one of the most expensive movies of all time. However, action is not enough to convince me to be in love with a movie. What's number 1 on IMDb.com's top 250 movies of all time list? The Shawshank Redemption. Why is that movie so good? (Sorry if you aren't a huge fan of that movie). It was good because of the story line. The great acting. The great cast. There is not one action scene in that movie. Yet it is so good. I feel as though people like and/or love The Avengers for the opposite reason. The story wasn't exactly BAD or anything but I can't find anything special about it.<br/><br/>Right from the very beginning- BOOM! Loki just happens to appear from Lord knows where. I love the idea of assembling a team of Super Powered People (super heroes) to form The Avengers. Great. I just feel like I could have predicted the entire movie. I expected Loki to appear, wreak havoc. The Avengers to assemble, all of them having lots of disagreements. Then in the blink of an eye they would work together and beat Loki in a huge battle. And where will this battle take place? NEW YORK!!!! How original!<br/><br/>The acting was good, except I just can't stand Loki, or Tom Hiddleston, or both, I don't even know. I just think he is very annoying and not even close to a good villain. I find myself so unafraid of Loki while guys like The Joker or Bane or Venom scare me to death if I were ever to encounter them in real life (if they were real people).<br/><br/>It was just very bland to me, there were some very funny moments and some moments that were very good action scenes. Doesn't mean I give this movie a 10 it doesn't deserve like other people. The fact that it is somewhere along the lines of an 8.2 just disappoints me big time. I would've expected like a 7.5-7.8. I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250.<br/><br/>I do like this movie, you can see I gave it 7 stars. As I said the acting, cast, and action is very good. But that doesn't mean the story line, predictability or the main villain is any good at all.<br/><br/>All I can say is I've seen better hero movies."

I really hope this new gem of a movie is not used to try and imitate the formula without the magic this one has because, make no mistake, behind all this special effects, shiny images, action scenes and interactions what stand about the most on this movie is the chemistry between all the heroes, even the villain, there is no denying.<br/><br/>From a guy who hate superheroes movies I give this movie a perfect 10, this is no joke this movie is THE BEST blockbuster of this year, totally recommended, even for the wife who hates explosions and the kids will love it!<br/><br/>PD: please watch the whole ending, even after the credits, that last 2 minutes are PRICELES!"

","When i went to the theaters to see this movie I was really excited, I've wanted in 6 months for it to have its release, what i had seen in trailers was something of the best I had seen in movie effects way, and when the movie was finished, and I walked out of the theaters it was the same thing, maybe the movie with the best effects ever, but i wasn't really pleased with what i had seen, the actors are good, the story is okay and the effects are exploding of course, but it's not what I want the avengers to be really, I mean of course you break all the records with that actors and that trailers, but thats just a question about money. it's an action-comedy, and when 9-year old kids around me laughs their heads off every other minute, its not really that feeling you want to have when you watch a superhero movie, the whole movie has received very good critics, though it's only the visual effects that deserves it! I'm one of the few people who didn't add this to their all-time-favorite list, but actually the movie doesn't have much more then an amazing visual effects job, that does the movie pretty entertaining. that's what I think, 7 of 10 isn't bad, but with harder work on the story, it could be a 9-10."
"Nbrayton17","9","6","13","15 July 2012"," Almost as good as the Dark Knight
","I admit it's been a while since I have seen this film but I have yet to give a proper review. Hopefully, this review can trigger the awesome feelings you had when watching The Avengers.<br/><br/>This is what the Marvel movies have been leading up to, that is, every Marvel movie excluding the Spider-Man trilogy. The amount of hype behind this movie was tremendous; while waiting in line for The Avengers, the usher at the theater tells us that ""this is the best movie I have seen in 5 years"". That being said, it's extremely hard to go into this film without any expectations.<br/><br/>So the question then is, was The Avengers good? If I can, I would call it Marvel-ous.<br/><br/>Let's start with what I really enjoyed. <br/><br/>The two strongest parts of The Avengers are the beginning and the end. When the film opens, we get to see the heros in their respective environments. And the opening scene with Black Widow stands out as one of the best. After Loki threatens Earth, the Avengers team has to assemble. Watching the team finally come together after waiting so many years, is a special moment. Now, the end was good because we finally get to see The Avengers work together as a team. While it took the entire movie for the Marvel heros to figure out that they are stronger as a unit than as individuals, it's worth the wait. How the camera panned across each hero who was doing something that effected the next person was stunning. To me, this felt the most like an actual comic book of video game.<br/><br/>The humor and writing really stand out as good. I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought at this movie (and that works for this film). The Marvel movies have always been bright and very light hearted at times, and the script really made that aspect shine through.<br/><br/>The two sides of the Hulk. <br/><br/>The hulk was one of the best parts of this movie along with the relationship between Captain America and Iron man (I hope they set up the Civil War story). However, if I had one flaw with The Avengers, it would be Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner . Honestly, I thought both previous actors (Bana and Norton) played the part better.<br/><br/>I know there is a ton more content to this film, but I should save that for when I get the film again on Blu Ray and have a fresh viewing.<br/><br/>Overall, The Avengers is a superhero film done right. Everything just seemed to mesh and fall right into place. However, I am not giving it a 10 just yet, because The Dark Knight Rises is coming out soon and I believe that it will be better than The Avengers.<br/><br/>9.0out of 10<br/><br/>""Better clench up, Legolas"""
"RNMorton","10","6","13","22 June 2012"," It all fits together
","The most recent Marvel comics film efforts have had several things in common - excellent casting, just spot on casting; great characters developed for years through the Marvel comics; good dialogue; but often muddled and/or derivative plots, and usually overlong. For example, Spiderman 3 had chunks of useless segments and a plot shamelessly recycled from earlier Spiderman movies, interspersed with some gorgeous moments of action. This one is interesting. It wouldn't have been as effective without all the introductory movies for many of the characters, including Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, which actually set the table for this main course. The collection of heroes make this movie greater than the sum of the individual works, it just fits like a glove. There are so many good performances - Evans is good again as Capt. A; Downey has made Iron Man his own, and he's got most of the best lines; Ruffalo is amazing as The Hulk; Johannson is solid as the Widow; Jackson and Gregg fit as Nick Fury and his top agent; and just maybe Renner trumps them all as the unflappable Hawkeye. I saw this with my youngest in 3-D, the next night I went back with both my kids and saw it again in 3-D and enjoyed it just as much. Hiddleston does an admirable Jaye Davidson-esque turn as the bad guy, with some help from an other-worldly invasion force. The CGI stuff works, interspersed with some eye-opening live action. The best moment comes when the camera does a slow 360 degree circuit of the Avengers circling the wagons in NYC. There's a lot going on here, and there still is some fat mixed in with the meat, but as a whole this thing just works grandly. Very highly recommended."

","I wish I could rate this movie 100 out of 100!!!! I have seen this movie twice in the theaters and its amazing!!!! It made me yell because the action was amazing, and it made me burst out laughing in several parts!!!! Lets just say I was very vocal during this movie. The acting is so perfect and the plot was also amazing. The action was unbelievable and the effects were outstanding!!!! I love this movie and have high respect for everyone involved in the making. The Incredible Hulk was portrayed exactly as he should be, just pure rage and outbursts of anger. The Iron Man was super funny and really cool too, as always. Captain America isn't my favorite, he's kind of lame. Hawkeye is also very cool, but I wish he had an actual superpower, like agility or something. Black Widow is awesome, but she wasn't used to her fullest abilities in this movie. Thor is also very cool, but should have been used a little more in this movie. I wish Thor would have taken down one of the huge monster things on his own, he's fully capable of it. All in all, this movie is a must-see amazing movie."
"jediguitar101","10","6","13","20 May 2012"," Unequivocally the GREATEST Comic-Hero/Action movie to date!
","First of all....WOW! I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was just amazing. The story, the acting, the tension, the character relationships, comic relief. Flawless. Just a work of art. I personally think that all of the Marvel movies in the last decade have been great. Movies directed by true comic fans. All leading up to this one moment in cinema history. And they did not let us down:) It's so ironic that most of the ""modern"" action movies are so far fetched. Fake. Pop hype served with sex and a big dose of ""let's come up with a really crazy story to top last years block-buster"". It get's old. This movie, somehow, has a sense of honesty and realism. No doubt, ""super-hero"" magic. But the story and connection with the previous individual hero films just made it all come together in a way that makes you feel like you're watching a great flashback of ancient mythos unfold. Just plain fun!"
"terrilmedved","9","6","13","14 May 2012"," Went in with very high expectations, and was pleasantly surprised!
","Only one man in Hollywood that I could think of could take six superheroes and knit them together so seamlessly, giving them each a feeling of value to the team, have such a clever script and get the action sequences to such an exciting level. Whedon, after decades of hard work in television, has finally ascended from cult status and entered the big time with the highest grossing film of all time and an easy contender for one of the best movies in the genre of all time, if not certainly the most entertaining.<br/><br/>I went in with very high expectations, expecting to enjoy it, but fearing that the film would be a bit beyond Joss's ability to make great. An ensemble cast of 8 main characters and it being the most anticipated film of the last 5 years with the studio breathing down the filmmakers' necks? That's a tough job description. I figured, it couldn't get better than 7/10, but I should've known not to doubt Whedon.<br/><br/>Many will say that this film seems slow paced, but those are people who just want a popcorn flick with minimal character development and dialog. That said, if you pay attention to the dialog, this film manages to draw emotions from the audience, which is rare for a blockbuster type film. The film also manages to keep those scenes succinct enough to keep the audience from lulling. This film was made for the big screen, and was easily the most fun I've had at the theaters in my 28 years.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the comics, you will love how the characters all have their complex attributes displayed, and how all their strengths combine to form a team. You think, ""How will Captain America, Hawkeye or Black Widow be of any use when Iron Man, Hulk and Thor are out wrecking sh*t?"", but there they are adding a dynamic to the team that would sorely needed in their absence. Captain is a born leader, Black Widow is manipulative and cunning, Hawkeye is incredibly reliable support, Iron Man and Thor wreck sh*t, Fury is the soul of the team, and Hulk smashes. <br/><br/>The movie spends a lot of time setting things up, but does it so efficiently that you never really find yourself getting tired of all the exposition. As the story moves along, the humor in the script shines. The acting is solid across the board, with exceptional work by Downey who provides much needed lightness and Ruffalo who absolutely nailed Bruce Banner in a way that wasn't whiny and pathetic like Bana's or Norton's. The ending is as somber as it is victorious, and Whedon sets things up for what I hope is a much darker and more introspective sequel.<br/><br/>While certainly not the greatest film of all time, for the genre, it couldn't get any better in my opinion. A movie like this is why big theaters exist, and if you wait until it comes out on DVD, you'll be missing out."
"garethjohns","10","6","13","14 May 2012"," Exceeds Expectations
","In the days leading up to The Avengers release I was so excited that I could barely contain myself. My girlfriend warned me not to get too excited or I would be left disappointed from my own high expectations of it. It was good advice but I simply couldn't help myself. <br/><br/>Going into the cinema my expectations were as high as they had ever been for a movie, and yet still I was blown away. From start to finish I was rooted to my seat, with my eyes fixed to the screen. With fantastic visuals, incredible fight scenes and even some witty humor thrown in (some may think this weird but it fits in beautifully). The plot itself is not complex but is interesting and does ""The Avengers"" name justice.<br/><br/>Still I think what made this movie so great is the movies that came before it. As soon as the movie starts you already have these characters you know, deep characters each with their own story-line. It means that The Avengers can dive straight in and take you a roller-coaster of a ride. Both those who already know The Avengers from the comics and those who don't will enjoy this."

","I have rarely laughed out loud over a movie but this one had me belly laughing and giggling all the way through. I loved how this movie brought most of the beloved super hero's together and how they played off each other. I gave it a 10 / 10 because of the pure enjoyment of the film. Usually when I sit through a movie I am mentally counting the minutes when I can get up and go, but this one I wanted to last longer. I am so hoping they come up with a 2nd movie, just as good. If you like super hero movies and love a good laugh go see this movie. It is well worth the time. I can not wait until the DVD comes out, it will be a sure buy for me."

Of course I don't have anything wrong to say about this movie. <br/><br/>All other characters have done a very good job. Loki's appearance is very well done by showing his cunning attitudes, villain looking face, my god I love him acting like that. Better than the appearance in the movie ""THOR"". Some reviews say the the movie has to experience in 2D, but I am not going to take a change, I will watch this in 3D too.

","Just got back from watching this movie. This was a very entertaining movie. There are a lot of spots in the movie that refer to other superhero movies before the hero even comes into play. I love the fact that if you were able to watch all these movies, the movie ties it all together. People, I highly recommend that you watch both Iron Man movies, Captain America, and Thor before you watch this. It makes it much more enjoyable. You can still watch it without watching them, it will just make much more enjoyable. Also, I feel this movie was well balanced and engaging. HULK and Stark had me laughing. Not stop action from start to finish."
"The_Dead_See","9","6","13","11 May 2012"," An amazing symphony of perfectly intertwined moving parts.
","I'm not the biggest fan of the setup movies for The Avengers. I think they're tremendously hit and miss, and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits. See, I like the odd comic book, but I'm certainly not a comic book fan. What I am a fan of is good, solid storytelling. You know - characters that evolve, logically sound motivations and tensions, good pacing, an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck - that sort of thing. From this perspective, the setup movies fell mostly flat for me. Iron Man was fabulous fun but it's sequel was poor. The Hulk was meh. Captain America spent far too long without any actual Captain America in it, and Thor - hmmm was just a bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it. <br/><br/>So back a few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that The Avengers was going to surface to tie all these movies together, I didn't really get much of a sense of excitement. A few years later, as the end credits rolled on Thor, I pretty much made up my mind that The Avengers movie was going to screw up badly. If the industry couldn't pull off a good movie with just one hero in it, how could they ever pull off one with six?<br/><br/>Then I heard that Joss Whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled. After all, I've seen him handle symphonies of characters before - with the Scooby Gang and the Serenity crew. If anyone could do it, Whedon could.<br/><br/>But still I was wary. Just didn't want to let my expectations get too high - superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all. Maybe even Whedon would screw it up.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>I don't think I've had this much fun at the cinema in years. Since the first Matrix movie in fact which was, what? Twelve years ago? (God I'm old). The Avengers had everything a good popcorn flick needs - major action setpieces, beautiful sfx, some neat and effective humor, yada yada yada. But none of that is what left my jaw on the floor. What really blew me away - and what compelled me to come here and write the first review I've done on IMDb in quite some time (years probably) - was just how perfectly done the script was. Every character is given their moment to shine, every interaction is perfectly in tune, this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to a perfectly wrought symphony. Every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldn't have taken out one single character - not even the arguably 'second tier' characters of Hawkeye and the Black Widow - without the whole thing coming apart. <br/><br/>This is no Batman or Pirates of the Caribbean, or Spider Man movie; because while those multi-protagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining, the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess. Not so in The Avengers. Everything clicks so perfectly I can't even find the words to describe it. You'll just have to go see it for yourself to see what I mean."
"martin-1415","9","6","13","6 May 2012"," Must see!
","I am a fan of the recent Marvel superhero movies. Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and especially Captain America. The Avengers is better than all of those. All of the heroes in The Avengers get a moment to shine on screen, even Nick Fury. Going into the movie I was a little disappointed to know that Loki was going to be the main protagonist, but after seeing the film I can see why this was the case. The Avengers ties a lot of the previous movies together, and having Thor's brother as the bad guy made that more efficient. It's a long movie, but when it was over I didn't feel beat up and ready for the story to be over the way I do when trying to watch an entire Harry Potter movie. Even the Lord of the Rings movies seems too long to me, but thanks to a great story and even better dialog I never became impatient during The Avengers.<br/><br/>The standout from The Avengers is clearly The Hulk. You spend most of the movie waiting for him to appear and it's amazing when he finally goes on a rampage. At two points during the movie The Hulk actually got applause from the audience.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, I can't wait to see it again. Let's hope The Avengers 2 is half as good!"
"rumasuk","10","6","13","28 April 2012"," the avengers gave me my very first nerdgasm
","Please if you haven't watched it yet, don't read my review or any other review, just go and see it!<br/><br/>if you are not into marvel movies, if you haven't watched every other previous installment of the avengers, you won't find this movie very appealing to you. But, if you have watched every previous movie, if you like the characters, then prepare yourself, because Joss Whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man!!<br/><br/>thats the thing about this movie, its not really a movie on its own, i mean, it expects you to know the characters, and thats just what it has to be. This is not really a movie but a cinematic experience. If the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody, flirting with that somebody, foreplay, the avengers is sex. Thats the best way i can put it.<br/><br/>You can really fell that Whedon knows and loves this characters, because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for building the problems, the humor, the companionship. I have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen. This movie has the best humor, the best action, the best acting, the best characterization, the best everything.<br/><br/>For the first time, i felt a nerdgasm, I'm not lying or exaggerating, i felt it.<br/><br/>Any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all, did not get the point of it, because the avengers will change cinema forever, i mean it.<br/><br/>I love good movies, i do, i know a lot of movies and I'm not a person that watches only Hollywood movies, but i can say this. The avengers is one of the best experiences i have ever had in my whole life. i will see it at least 3 times more"
"fongher10","9","6","13","28 April 2012"," It is a great movie...
","This many reviews can't be wrong and now I'm part of that group. I won't spoil it with much details but the script is good, the directing is great and the action is just amazing. The biggest surprise for me was Mark Ruffalo's part. I was highly skeptical because of his look and the Hulk's but after seeing the entire movie I have to agree that he is the best Hulk version thus far. I am simply amaze at both Weldon and Mark's work. Just wow.<br/><br/>The are two disappointing things for me though. First is Hawkeye. He's only smiles once in the movie and I bet you'll have a hard time finding that part. This is because I've grew up knowing Hawkeye more as a comedic/serious character and not just a pure serious character. That doesn't mean his part in the movie wasn't great. Second is Banner just showing up and agreeing to fight alongside the team. Sure one can make guesses but I much prefer that one was provided; either as Hulk wanting to protect others as he usually does, or as Banner and Hulk agreeing that he needs to help out so that others see him differently and accept him. But even this is overshadowed immediately by the next 10s after he arrives. That was just jaw dropping for me and the Avenger teammates LOL I have to suggest to those that haven't already watched the movie to pay close attention to the dialog's. Many of the lower reviews, especially from film critics, is because they really don't pay attention to the dialog's and rate it down. Plus, you'll see why I enjoyed the Hulk immensely in this movie.<br/><br/>Many people are turned off on the fact that it is an alien invasion scene even the so-called hardcore comic fans. I will have to remind everyone here that for most comic superheroes the big, world killer scenarios are from outer space, from aliens. It doesn't matter if it's DC or Marvel, it's exact SAME situation. It's not a copy of Transformers 3 since Michael Bay made up the story in the first place and did a poor job at it. Transformers 3 is a copy of what comic books have been using for ages.<br/><br/>Don't be surprise but eventually Superman will have Doomsday and his portals. Green Lantern is guardian of the UNIVERSE, don't see how one gets upset at an Alien force coming in to destroy Earth or any other planet that is in their area of protection. Batman and the Justice League will have their Aliens and so forth. Really, what are you complaining about then? That there are too much Aliens? How are you going to introduce them then and still remain true to the story? That's what I thought. Mindless comic book fans that ""think"" they know better...pffft.<br/><br/>If you're happy with just the superhero fighting human villains on and from Earth fine. Stay that way. But don't go bitching because eventually the story of ALL superheroes will involve aliens. You're precious Batman will involve aliens, it's just not there in the form of movies YET. Joker has a big part in aliens and Earth's destruction. Get with it people.<br/><br/>As for people complaining about the lack of character development well the answer is simple. Go and watch the respective movies about the super hero you are disappointed about. There are two Iron movies, 2 Hulks, One captain America, One Thor. And while Black Window and Hawkeye don't have their own movie yet they did have a little history in the movie about them. They are the less popular heroes of the team that's why. So again, why are people even complaining about this issue in the first place?<br/><br/>Seriously though I sometimes think people are just too anal to think clearly, even hardcore fans."

Awesome , epic, cool, outstanding, fantastic etc. Looks like for almost the whole year of me waiting to watch movie and all the hype that they built up was worth the wait<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston as Loki is as evil as ever but it would have been great if more villains had shown up along the way. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye was the surprising character for me since I never expected him to turn evil but he was definitely the right man chosen for the role. Scarlett Johansson was beautifully stunning as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Thor was great and surprisingly gave The Hulk a run for his money (something which I didn't quite expect to see). Speaking of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo was well suited to play Bruce Banner/Hulk (although Norton was better in my opinion). Cobie Smulders as Maria Hills was a bit of a let down since I expected more screen time for her. Samuel L. Jackson was OK as Nick Fury. Robert Downey Jr. is as goofy as ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man but for me the biggest driving force of the entire movie has got to none other than Chris Evan's awesome acting as Steve Rogers/Captain America. He was in my opinion the biggest star of the film in my opinion and really made the team come together as one. <br/><br/>The plot was very simple and straightforward but the action scenes and dram was what made the movie really interesting. Who says that the movie needs to have a good storyline in order for the film to be great. The movie itself doesn't necessary require story background for the characters at all since they were all already told in their own separate movies respectively<br/><br/>On a note to those who have been complaining on the film for being mindless boring etc. My question is, what did you expect from a superhero movie? This movie is all about action and it was made to be entertaining and fun to watch, not for you to sit and expect a twisty kind of turn story like TDK. The main reason why people go watch is because they wanted to see their favorite main heroes from different franchise team up together in the same movie. Thats all that is and to me, that isn't a bad thing at all<br/><br/>I have a degree in film and video (majoring animation if you're wondering) but I still find this movie really good. If you guys are looking for something else beyond action in this film, then you guys are in the wrong place <br/><br/>All in all, an epic film which definitely deserves to be ranked in the IMDb top 100 movie list and definitely above TDK.

Mark Ruffalo was a excellent replacement for Edward Norton, everyone was disappointed by Hulk's character not being played by Edward (including me), But I'd say Mark was up to the mark. If you're looking for a break from your daily-routine stressed life, go to the theaters and watch this movie. The Avengers has all the ingredients needed for a Hit movie. Thor + Stark + Hulk + Captain America = Epic"
"3xHCCH","9","6","13","27 April 2012"," Finally, a Film that Lives Up to Its Hype and High Expectations!
","The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!<br/><br/>The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some ""funny"" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a ""team"" film like this.<br/><br/>It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.<br/><br/>This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon. ¬†Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited."
"Syboat","10","6","13","27 April 2012"," Avengers Assemble! *Spoiler*
","I have to say this film was brilliant from start to finish, the characters were awesome and the action was mind blowing. I thoroughly recommend this film, it captured the true meaning of an epic feature and this certainly delivers a punch! <br/><br/>The Hulk looked great in all his glory and I hope he gets to appear in the next instalment! A great mix of action from the air battles to the streets below. It was great seeing Thor and Hulk battle it out again being the last time we saw them together was in TIHR TV movie from 1988!<br/><br/>I think it was faithful to the comics and brought the comic strip to life and I can only applaud the efforts of the film crew for bringing together the characters that I grew up and became so fond of."

","OK, I know 10/10 scores are thrown in too lightly n ow a days, but hear me out, this movie is truly astonishing. <br/><br/>Following the storyline directly from Thor 2011, this movie starts strong with Loki trying to conquer earth, from there its just a wild ride, it grips on you and you won't be able to catch your breath until way after the credits.<br/><br/>The thing that I appreciate the most, is that its a true SuperHero movie, often in comics adaptations, the directors try to ground the actions and powers, worried they can not match the scope of the comic book medium. Well, not here, The action is unbelievable, the feats of strength breathtaking Ironman shoots its repulsor beams, Thor uses his lightning strike.<br/><br/>Lastly it wouldn't have worked without the humor, Wheedon, has perfect chops, each time his punchlines will take you off guard, and trust me laugh you will.<br/><br/>I watched this in a really packed theater, the function was sold out one week before, a record in my country. Everyone was cheering, laughing, clapping and wowing. a truly special spectacle.<br/><br/>Really F***ING Amazing."
"Choices71","10","6","13","26 April 2012"," Avengers Initiative!
","Yep, I'll be honest, I did cringe a little when I found out Joss Whedon was directing, I absolutely love his work but I just could not see how his talents would be able to be used to make this sort of film. I am so happy to say that I was wrong! The film allows you to enjoy every moment as it passes especially when at the end you realised you've just sat through 2 hours and 20 minutes of concentration.<br/><br/>Like you expect, we're all re-introduced to all the characters, one by one off doing their own thing and S.H.I.E.L.D trying to bring them all together. The good thing about this is when they do all eventually start to get together you get the all too normal tension between a group of individuals being almost forced together with the expectations from S.H.I.E.L.D that they automatically work together as some fantastic team. Aside from all the action scenes, explosions, fights etc etc You still get the storyline the whole time, if you step back and look at the whole storyline you realise that it's a pretty semi-typical script but the whole film you don't even realise that's happening, it really brings comic films to a new meaning. <br/><br/>The biggest adjustment for myself and I'm sure many other viewers was the role of Tony Stark/ Iron Man. Though Downey Jr reprised the role fantastically (no surprise), both Iron Man films had kept to the human story lines, The Avengers introduced the film character into the world of science fiction. With the Iron Man films you could keep some sort of natural relationship with the storyline and characters because all was somewhat believable (in the Action movie sense). But with saying that as you watch the movie and you make your own adjustments to this, so is Stark himself so it ties in perfectly with the audience which is another hats off moment for Whedon.<br/><br/>Another fantastic thing and is one of the defining points of this film, is the comedic input. Almost every comic film is known as being all action and drama, you feel like you have to be serious the whole time (ofcourse minor funny moments but nothing good), Joss Whedon has taken account the audience and the 21st century and made some key scenes in the film so much better and less awkward, it had the entire cinema erupt in laughter. Though with saying that, and you reading it might make you stand off-ish, the way it's worked into the scene it would be just as impressive even if it was just kept to a dramatic scene.<br/><br/>This film had chance of being really well made or an absolute laughable flop. It has impressed me and it has impressed many many other people, I look forward to hearing further reviews as it opens in cinema's around the world. The writers, directors, producers and the cast have all worked together amazingly and I cannot wait for future projects!"
"GoUSN","3","8","19","21 June 2012"," C-minus
","With the high budget this film had, I should not be noticing the staging. <br/><br/>""OK, Mark, you stand there and look annoyed but knowing, Scarlett, look like you're pondering, Chris, focus on keeping some of the accent but not all of it . . . "" <br/><br/>There was no scene in the film where I didn't see with my mind's eye the director on set barking stage direction. Perhaps if the script had been stronger, I wouldn't have noticed. But pair a weak script with a long series of obviously staged (and very non-dynamic) scenes, and you end up with more flat scenes than I can count. <br/><br/>Character development: With this cadre of fun and interesting actors and the huge budget that hired them, you'd think you'd end up with quality oozing out of the screen. No. Robert Downey's Stark was one- note, snarkie, and that's it. A few fun lines, but zero cleverness and no depth. The same with the rest of them. Except for Mark R. and Scarlet J. They were the only two who created anything interesting with their parts - and of these two, Mark R. created a genuinely interesting character in Banner. <br/><br/>CGI: Big budgets mean you shouldn't notice the CGI. In one scene in particular, it was obvious that the actors were in front of a green screen, with the CGI added later. They should blend into the CGI not stand apart and obviously in front of it. <br/><br/>Script: Could the script have been more plodding and obvious? It was not a smart or clever script. It read like . . . a comic book! Perhaps that's all Marvel can do well."
"Dan_L","4","8","19","28 May 2012"," Terribly Disappointing Mindless Mess
","I really enjoyed Captain America, Thor, and the first Iron Man, but The Avengers is just a mostly boring, repetitive, excessively long mess of self-indulgence. You'd never know that the talented Joss Whedon directed -- the film has none of his trademark sly humor, cleverness or pacing.<br/><br/>Instead we get a needlessly long film short on everything but action. While Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard. Frankly, it's just a dumb film and just because it's popular does not mean it's a good film.<br/><br/>So if you like lots of action, wooden dialog, dumb plots, and, well a lot of noise, you'll love this mess of a film. But if you expect to see a film that's better than the best episodes of Josh Whedon's ""Buffy"" or want more from a film, be prepared to be disappointed."
"vikas5544","7","8","19","1 May 2012"," Good But Not Great; Wonder Why it is in IMDb top films!
","I would give it 7 or 7.5 out of 10. It is a very good film, but nothing great. Believe me or not. <br/><br/>I watched it yesterday night at the South Delhi PVR Priya Cinema Hall (3D; hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many people).<br/><br/>The first half was just okay (actually even boring) and the intermission point was so ill-timed and then the second half was good. The fight scenes in the city (Manhattan) are like the latest Transformers. A one time watch for sure; but don't expect much. <br/><br/>I liked the film but not as much as I had expected it to like! There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant. The villain is not so menacing or dignified (like the all-powerful villain of X-Men 3). He needed more teeth. <br/><br/>And I am not alone in thinking so; five of my friends with me have similar opinion. You don't miss much if you miss the Avengers."

","Was not impressed. Wouldn't go as far to say it was as bad as Transformers 2 and 3 but it was aiming to be.<br/><br/>Story wise it was a piece of crap. Typical good vs bad. Acting not so good. The only thing that was protecting these flaws was the special effects. Buildings fell, things blew up, blah blah blah. <br/><br/>The end of the movie was meant to be epic but it was very underwhelming. I was thinking that this was meant to be an advanced alien race. I also thought that Cpt America was meant to be a badass but it turns out he wears pyjamas not chainmail.<br/><br/>It was memorable... only because it was so disappointing."
"mccormick632","4","7","16","3 November 2012"," All this buildup leads to nothing.
","I hate this movie. There, I said it. I watched it in theaters and came out mildly entertained but disappointed, and I re-watched it again recently, only to hate it. This is a poorly written mess whose awful writing has somehow gone unnoticed by everyone I know. To all those people who haven't seen this movie yet, let me spare you the trouble: Marvel's The Avengers, sucks. <br/><br/>For starters, out of the five movies made before this, I only saw three of them, and of those three, only one was actually good (Iron Man). Iron Man 2 was a boring mess, and Thor was more of the same, only with Natalie Portman, so that made it worse. The Avengers takes all these superheroes, most of which I never heard of, and throws them all together for the first time in cinematic history. An impressive feat; but if the Harry Potter movies were any indication, just because it's an interesting idea, doesn't always mean it is good. Usually it means it's total c***. <br/><br/>The good: the actors look the roles. Whoever cast Chris Hemsworth as Thor deserves a raise because he looks perfect. Robert Downey Jr. looks like Tony Stark, Chris Evans is Captain America, and so on and so on. The acting isn't all memorable, with Downey just doing what he does in every single movie he is in, i.e. play the annoying guy. Zodiac (great movie by the way), Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (another fun movie), and the Iron man films, there is not one character who could not be swapped out for another and make any difference. <br/><br/>The Bad: basically everything else. Joss Whedon, in my opinion, is a straight up hack. Never mind the fact that he wrote the god-awful Alien Resurrection, but in this movie his writing is just lazy. So many things that make no sense happen and the feeling I get is that those are things that I should overlook because ""it's a comic book movie."" No, why can a shield developed in the 1940s withstand the full force of a Norse God!? If this stuff was so lightweight and powerful, why didn't Iron Man make his suit out of it? Why does Loki want to take over the world when, in Thor, he explicitly stated he never wanted power? There are so many other things that make no sense, but this reviews got to end sometime <br/><br/>The final battle in this mess takes place in New York, and it is the most boring, least engaging battle since the battle of Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Yes, this movie is on par with Transformers. None of the characters are likable, none of the action scenes are thrilling, the humor comes of as cheap and fails, Loki's army is the most useless army out there, etc. etc. <br/><br/>This movie is a disaster, a titanic failure of a film. Not just because its a boring horribly written piece of s***, but because to me it represents Marvel's laziness. They know their films make lots of money, so they keep cranking out one awful movie after another. First it was Iron Man 2, then it was Thor, now it was the Avengers, and, not deciding to wait a year, they released the awful Amazing Spiderman. These guys take less time to wait for their next product than Activision does with Call of Duty. <br/><br/>With the announcement of the Avengers 2, Spiderman 2, Thor 2, Iron Man 3, Captain America 2, and probably Hulk 2, I gotta ask, when does this end? When will Marvel finally just kill their entire business and stop making awful movies, or at the very least, don't hire Joss Whedon. <br/><br/>*Side Note: No I am not a DC fanboy writing this scathing review simply because it is a Marvel film. I am writing this because I truly detested this film, the fact that is just so happens to be Marvel is a coincidence."
"efc_528491","6","7","16","3 September 2012"," Most Overrated movie ever. Is it bad? No. Is it amazing? No. Is it Decent? yes.
","Okay where do I begin<br/><br/>Action: This movie has really good action sequences and its the strongest point in this film<br/><br/>Story: This movie is rated so highly, they made it seem like it had an out of the box story line and something more, but its not. Is the storyline bad? No. Its too simple and doesn't deserve all the praise its getting. I felt I was watching Transformers 3 again at the final battle with the aliens. There is nothing special with the plot at all, there was barely any depth and its forgettable. A mind controlled good guy on the enemy team? How many times have we heard that before? This movie needs something else in the plot that will differentiate it from the others<br/><br/>Writing: Writing was decent but it there were a lot of cheesy lines. Want some nachos with that? I didn't like how the dealt with the death of Agent Coulson just wasn't right and he could have gone out better. There were way too many coincidences. How does Bruce Banner get to where they were with a bike that goes 10 miles per hour? <br/><br/>Acting: It was either decent or below. Again with the over praise it is making it seem like the acting is top notch or something and it isn't<br/><br/>Other stuff: I think when they do a sequel they need to improve the story, the plot, the writing, and actually make the score of the movie good and memorable because some people don't realize how important a score can be in movies, it adds a lot to them. This movie should not be in the top 250. To be fair it needs to be a 7.6-7.8 on the IMDb scale. <br/><br/>When they do The Avengers 2 its not going to be very hard to top this one if they improve on the things I mentioned"

","Ladies and gentlemen, WE HAVE A WINNER! Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, the Avengers mix everything so well. It leans to the dark but touches on fun and the interaction of every character just enough. Maybe it's the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be introduced in their own movies or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable. It's truly better than any other comic-book based movie that I have ever seen. I say that not to egg on fans of other properties because I AM a fan of other properties. Because of the groundwork that has come before and because of the high level that this film operates, it IS bigger than any have ever delivered. ALL the dramatic beats really click. Besides the depth and action pieces, so much of the humor works because it is so well written. The writing displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the shear number of characters. What's also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come. The TV clips seen leading up to the movie tease at the action but there is SO much they saved for the actual running. I can't thank them enough for that factor. They knew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth! If you liked the trailers and TV stuff, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET! That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise. Avengers is a complete and very well done movie and as much fun as I've ever had in the cinema. That's no lie or no joke."

","I deliberately avoided seeing any trailers or pictures or anything that might have reduced the impact of The Avengers, but I don't think it would have made any difference. <br/><br/>Simply put Joss Whedon has succeeded where so many others have failed in the past, most notably DC Comics,to bring comic book characters to the real world and the big screen,without alienating the fans or confusing the newbies, and seemingly the hardest task, to make it a good movie. An indication of how he has succeeded is my poor 11 year old daughter, who gets dragged to all the Iron Man, Green Lantern, etc, movies with me and her brothers and she suffers through them quietly (mostly). However after leaving The Avengers she declared it her favourite movie ever. <br/><br/>I can't comment on how you would enjoy this movie without the back story contained in the previous Marvel/Avengers Characters movies, but I think that pretty much everyone alive today has some knowledge of who Iron Man, The Hulk and Captain America are, you should be able to work the rest out from there. <br/><br/>I saw it in 3D and it was good, but I wouldn't say the 3D is a must. But I would say see it on the big screen, and see it as soon as you can!"

Hiddleston made a fine villain and the other characters performed as expected,i.e. not everyone is going to get an Oscar for best actor no matter how many films they make, some of the hook and line dialogue was spoken as if they were bored, perhaps they were.

"bombadil-esquire","10","3","5","24 August 2015"," In a nutshell: a must-see
","This movie is frankly excellent. Watching it for the first time up until the fifth time (which for me was after Winter Soldier came out) was very very thrilling. To had a plot, first of all; one that might not show itself well the first time around, but is there nonetheless. <br/><br/>No character doesn't *need* to be present, and no character is out of place. Stark is there because of his father's affiliations with the Tesseract-goings-on, and later his new tower becomes the location of Loki's space-bridge-machine, because of his new energy that he created in Iron Man 2. Cap is there because, well, the Tesseract is the subject of the film's conflict. He is neither cannon fodder nor useless - sure, his action sequences in this movie aren't outstanding like they are amazingly in CA:WS, but since that movie existed afterwards, it doesn't matter. Thor is there because his brother is the antagonist; he in fact has more reason to be in the circle of protagonists more than the other Avengers. Banner is present because he was needed to locate the Tesseract when it was stolen (plain and simple), Barton because, well, he was a Shield agent at the first facility we see, overtaken by Loki's scepter, then et cetera. And Romanoff because, well, she's a major Shield agent who is an elite fighter, as well as the only female of the team.<br/><br/>As for the biggest plot-complaints I have seen: The reason Loki wanted to be captured on the Helicarrier is so that he could disturb the harmony of the team and ""set off"" Hulk, knowing also that with his teleport-trick he'd be able to Lure Thor and escape... and lastly the reason Banner in New York, after arriving by motorcycle, is able to immediately turn into the Hulk, is because of the ability that is evident at the very end of Incredible Hulk; him being able to voluntarily become angry. No single Avenger dominates the plot. This movie has clever transitions when each Avenger is first seen, has no ex-machinas, no over-abundance of jokes, absolutely no lack of clever lines and dialogue (I refer mainly to Loki w/ Fury), no lack of six-vs-aliens action, great acting, and a sensible ending. Whedon's direction/directing of this film is more than ""meh pretty good"" - and this movie was only overrated when its fan-hype was still alive. It doesn't ""become more mediocre of a film"" once more thrilling MCU installments have come out."

Looks like something from the movies of 20 years ago, cheap materials galore. I'm really surprised to see so many favorable reviews of this movie.

This movie failed in many areas esp you need brain damage to accept the story. To put Hulk into a flying ship is just some example how fail the story is. Well to put Hulk into enemy flying ship is somewhat clever but put it into own flying ship WTF? Problem with all these superhero movies is that by definition no hero can die so actually you already know the end of the movie before it start. Ironman put off his armor 50% of the movie despite they are permanent in war and always contact with enemy. The movie was very slow too as it took about 100min to introduce all the ""new"" characters and give them some fake glue to form a team. When the enemy finally arrived which was about 5min before the end of the movie I didn't even see how the high advanced enemy can win over the street NY policemen with hand pistols. For strange reason the us army didn't join the fight so NY policemen with some heroes did the job alone. Loki as the only villain in that movie acted like a joke and fitted seamless into that crap movie.

However this movie was mindless crap. There were no plot variations, dialog's were comical at best. It was just pointless CGI effects. The villain had absolutely no depth and frankly was brainless. At least change the script a bit, put in some variations in the script and hire actors who have depth in acting. Captain America at least had a decent story line, you could connect with the character, the same with iron man and the same with the spider man series. This one from the start was just mindless violence, aliens blowing up crap. All super hero movies should have a good story line, a villain who can many shades to their character. That's why Dark Knight was so good not only because the script had some meaning(terrorism, seeing the good versus bad in people) and of course Heath ledger amazing rendition of the Joker. I realize this isn't a movie that will win an Oscar and also it's meant to park your brain at home and just enjoy but at least put in some effort instead of just letting computer animation take over.

Good for them. Now for the actual review: If watching train wrecks is one of your favorite hobbies AND if you are generally star struck, this movie is a must-see. The entire plot is a lot of nice computer animations covering over a veritable train wreck of predictable - yet quite often inexplicable - events, actions, and cheesy comments. And the cast is eminent - if celebrity and not exercised talent is the 2012 definition of eminence. A Danish movie director who has had fair success in Hollywood was once asked what it took artistically to make a blockbuster movie. His answer: ""Understand that the average viewer is male, 12 years old, and moderately gifted. And understand that there has to be something good, something bad, something awesome, and something pretty. The rest is less significant."" Well, this movie has it all, here are some examples of the stereotypes: Heroes=good. Aliens=bad. Fighting=awesome. Scarlett=pretty. If you don't want to spend an hour and a half getting stupider, go watch 3 episodes of Friends, The King of Queens, or something else which is at least mediocre. And my final comments: Shame on you, Samuel; Shame on you, Robert; Shame on you, Gwyneth; Shame on you, rest of cast."

","I just saw the movie. I have been a comic reader and a movie goer for more than twenty years now, and a film like this should have been my wet dream. Instead what I saw was a hollow, empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original comic book: an attempt that poorly fails in a miserable way despite (or I should say: thanks to) all the special effects and the star power the producers have tried to throw in. The fantasy, the wit, the ideas that were present in the comic and that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids, were completely absent in this studio behemoth. <br/><br/>I will admit that the recreation of such magic was a difficult task, probably doomed from the beginning: but this thing is completely lacking brain, or direction, or any meaning at all. The script is a total and utter disaster, full of bore and incredibly shallow, and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar between themselves. I will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first decent Banner/Hulk: it took only three attempts to the Hollywood writers - and god knows how many millions of dollars wasted. <br/><br/>Movies like ""Avengers"" are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents, which in this case would be Mr. Mainstream Comics and Mrs. Movie Industry. This leaves them with basically no audience: they are too much gruesome and boring for kids, too much childish for youngsters, while for the adults - at least for those the grown-up ones - there are just too many capes. The same stories, printed on comic pages, still resonate in popular culture after decades: but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down."

","I will keep this short and brief:<br/><br/>The plot was paper thin, the characters used cheesy lines which dragged the movie out, and the special effects compensated for the former flaws. The movie basically shows that consumers are dumb enough to actually rate a movie high, like the rating is, simply because enough special effects where thrown in their faces to distract from the awful parts.<br/><br/>To footnote, only a few directors have actually been able to write and direct their own movie properly and with much success. Joss Whedon is not one of them."

","This movie is retarded. Humanity must have seriously degraded if people consider this piece of crap the best of the best in cinema. I can't believe this movie is just two points away from the same rating for scarface. That movie was awesome, not this piece of crap. I think the movie order should go like this; #1 The Godfather, #2 Scarface, #3 Star Wars Episode VI Return Of The Jedi, #4 Alien, #5 Titanic. Those movies are legendary, but this movie? This movie is no where near legendary. I would rate this movie a zero but since i can't pick that i guess i'll go with one star. This movie has the most predictable plot ever, to sum it up it goes like this; bam boom bam boom, cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue, bam boom bam boom, cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue, bam boom bam boom, the end. The dialogue is some of the corniest crap in film history. Batman And Robin was corny and stupid, but at least it was tolerable with Arnold's witty one-liners. The scenes that were supposed to be funny made me gag and the scenes that were supposed to be serious made me burst out laughing at how stupid they were. Seriously, the stupidity never ends; from iron man fighting thor for absolutely no reason, to nick fury shooting a plane carrying an atomic bomb....with a bazooka. The plane is carrying an atomic bomb and your idea to stop it is to shoot it? Seriously?!!!???!? Don't watch this movie it's stupid and if your a huge avengers fan it will be an even bigger disappointment; if you want to watch a good marvel movie watch spider-man 2, that movie deserves an 8.3 rating, not this kid-friendly nonsense."

","Honestly I don't understand how such crappy movie could get so high notes. The only thing that is coming to my mind is that a bunch of people hired by producers has written dozen of opinions and made thousands of votes via different accounts.<br/><br/>There is nothing in this movie that can be described as funny, entertaining or eye-catching. Story line is so miserable, one can easily say there is no story line whatsoever. It is just a series of predictable, naive events without any kind of surprise or suspense.<br/><br/>Acting is typical for American movies - childishly bombastic. Pathetic dialogs and mimicry is so disgusting I wanted to leave cinema in the mid of the show...no show is not a good description of what I have seen.<br/><br/>I hoped at least for special effects but my disappointment reached the ground. Cartoon-type actions of Hulk (in fact there were no point of gathering all the heroes as Hulk himself could easily defeat entire invading armada) was the last coffin nail.<br/><br/>To summarize Avengers was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

","I'm not really into superheroes movies (however I really enjoyed Batman trilogy of Nolan), nor into comics. But people around me were talking so much about how cool ""The Avengers"" was that I decided to buy the Blu ray 3D and give it a try. And... <br/><br/>It was a big disappointment ! <br/><br/>OK it's entertaining, it's a blockbuster with a lot of budget and special effect and action, but the story is casual and predictable, same thing for the characters ! I really don't get how people could have been so excited for something like that...<br/><br/>The worst part ? If a movie so casual has that much success, the directors of the sequels won't make any effort to make a better work on the story... The second Avengers movie did confirms that, it was even worse (but apparently a lot of cuts where made because it was too long otherwise, maybe the DVD/BR version will be a little better).<br/><br/>Of course not all the Marvel movies are like that fortunately ! I'm open minded and I love cinema so I did try some other stuff the Marvel studios made, so I can highly recommend ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (I loved it) and the ""Ant Man"" that was nice too.

"iHaveCellulite","Null","4","8","16 October 2014"," A Record Setting Movie for the Power of Marketing
","If ever there were an example of everything wrong with major movie review sites and Hollywood movies today, this film takes the cake over all others.<br/><br/>To start, this film was monstrously, overbearingly advertised to every single medium containing pixels or paper in the world for months leading up to it's release; including the premise of the multiple years of collective Marvel movies leading up to this single ""epic"" superhero mash-up that would ""blow all other superhero movies away"" known as The Avengers. There was so much hype surrounding this movie, it became almost impossible not to see some kind of advertised praise of how epic it would be. Then came the IMDb movie reviews... <br/><br/>Within the weeks leading up to the release, as well as multiple weeks beyond the premiere, you would be hard pressed to find any review that wasn't at or near a perfect 10/10. It quickly became apparent that these were paid reviewers, as all the reviews seemed to have subtle words, structure, and nuances in common, along with an extremely strange hyper-in-depth biographical portfolio of personal knowledge for the historical work of every writer, producer, director, musician, camera operator and even extras in the movie. All extremely uncommon knowledge to be so readily described in every person's review to support this movie. Last, was the extreme repetition of descriptions such as ""spellbinding"", ""breath- taking"", ""edge-of-your-seat"", etc.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>Once biting the bullet and paying money to finally see it, I almost laughed out loud! How in the world a movie with: horribly stiff acting, nearly no plot beyond ""bad guy wants to destroy the world, we must put aside our differences and unite"" clich√©, oddly outdated CGI, terrible 'Batman & Robin (1997)' style punch-lines and puns, surprisingly really low-budget looking costumes and props, and uneven main character screen-time (aka The Avengers is 85% ""The Ironman Show"", 10% ""The Thor Show"", 5% everyone else) ever, ever received any Review Score over 5/10 absolutely blows my mind.<br/><br/>Don't let the advertising, infallible Marvel die-hards, or paid reviews fool you; this movie is the 2012 version of all those 90's Superhero Sequel attempted cash-grab franchise movies we grew to hate until their demise (Batman Forever/Batman & Robin, The Phantom, etc). Ironman (1) and especially Batman Begins restored faith in the whole, ""Revamp the modern Superhero movie the way it should have been"" genre... and now it's spiraling right back to bland, dull, blatant cash grabs; with this movie the king of them all."
"tieman64","Null","4","8","24 August 2013"," Whedon Anonymous
","Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" opens with the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), Norse God of Mischief, on the planet Earth. Here he encounters Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of a superhero law enforcement agency. This introductory sequence is designed to show off both Loki's ruthlessness and the manly coolness of Nick Fury, but it achieves neither. It's an over-long sequence, filled with bad CGI and second-rate action.<br/><br/>The film then offers a series of vignettes in which Fury assembles a group of superheroes, including Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Their task? Stop Loki and his giant CGI army. The problem? All these superheroes are too busy bickering to band together, organise and efficiently kick butt.<br/><br/>Your typical Whedon tale centres on a Scooby Doo gangs of likable heroes (""Serenity"", ""Firefly"", ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", ""The Astonishing X-Men"" etc) and ends with a hero sacrificially dying for the greater good. Whedon's heroes are also never able to prevail without a little help from their buddies, and there is always some tension between being the sole saviour and having to work with others to accomplish a goal. As he typically has only tiny budgets at his disposal, Whedon also relies heavily on clever writing, witty banter and comedic irreverence to generate excitement. With ""The Avengers"", however, he has been granted zillions of dollars and has been unconsciously domesticated by the demands of the summer blockbuster. The result is a film which is continually pulling in two directions, wanting to be huge, bloated and filled with generic spectacle on one hand, and wanting to be clever, small and intimate on the other. In the end, the vulgarity of money wins out over good prose.<br/><br/>Still, a number of classic Whedon moments do survive. One cleverly written vignette has Black Widow tied to a chair, seemingly being interrogated by a gang of villains. We then learn that it is she who is in control of the situation and that it is SHE who is interrogating THEM. Another clever moment sees Loki imprisoned in a glass cage at the heart of our heroes' stronghold (yes, that clich√© again), no one realising that Loki has designed his own capture, the God of Mischief attempting to live up to his namesake and sow discord within his enemy's own home. Most of the film's other good scenes revolve around the Hulk, who's imbued with much pathos by Mark Ruffalo, an actor renowned for his many melancholic-man roles; Ruffalo elevates everything he touches.<br/><br/>The rest of ""The Avengers"" unfortunately degenerates into CGI fisticuffs, Michael Bay styled mayhem, exploding cities, CGI aliens, errant missiles and sequences which feel like an angry kid bashing action figures together. Here's a film which spends zillions of dollars bludgeoning us, when a guy like Whedon can cook up infinitely more excitement with a simple rope, chair or the sheer possibility that the Hulk might go schizoid. Like most Marvel projects, ""The Avengers"" mistakes excess for excitement.<br/><br/>Whedon's never been a good visualist. Even his stint writing for the ""X-Men"" comics (""The Astonishing X-Men"", a series arc which plays almost exactly like Whedon's ""The Avengers"" movie) relied more on words, banter, and the energy of his prose than well drawn panels. In this regard, most of ""The Avengers"" is slow and generically shot, though it does contain a few great visuals. A brief shot of a SWAT squad advancing on the Hulk's tiny shack is particularly cool. <br/><br/>Beyond this, the film offers the usual super-hero subtext. Here the enemy hopes to invade America (New York) and obtain the Tesseract, a much coveted cube which can provide endless energy and which was placed on Earth thousands of years ago by Gods. Our heroes, of course, band together to stop the theft of the Tesseract. In a previous Marvel film, ""Captain America"", a Nazi figure called Red Skull also attempted to acquire this energy source. In Marvel lore, it's always our squeaky clean, white Western ubermensch who decide who gets to keep Earth's resources. Same as the real world, though the Pentagon rarely wears spandex when it's nuking for oil grids.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Whedon's Loki is one of the most pathetic super-villains of all time. He's a whiny dude, with all the menace of a high school chemistry teacher. You'd think The Avengers would assemble only for big fish, but no. They apparently take on wimpy Norse Gods as well.<br/><br/>7.5/10 ‚Äì See Josh Trank's ""Chronicle""."

","The Avengers represents everything that's bad in a hero movie. In my opinion, this movie should be nominated for one of the most disappointing movie of the year. The movie is not funny, barely action and has a terrible plot. the villain in the movie, Loki, was the most bad villain character in the history of movies and not in the good way. I hope for me and for everybody else that there will not be a sequel, because it will ruin everything that batman has built about a comics movie.

","The Avengers displays Joss Whedon's flawless comedic timing, and his ability to balance fun among serious situations perfectly. One can see why Buffy & Angel were a huge success, & Firefly/Serenity a huge cult hit. Welcome to the big leagues, Mr. Whedon.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I like this movie's Hulk more than the two stand-alone movies. This movie showcases why the Hulk can work best as a supporting character instead of the lead. Hawkeye, in my opinion, was an odd character to add, and the movie could have done just as well without him. The other characters perform their parts well, but Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark steals the spotlight every time he is on-screen. The chemistry between the cast is seamless. I also loved seeing Coby Smulders as a bad-ass action chick, although its a shame she did not see much action.<br/><br/>The only downsides I can think of is the sometimes cheesy dialogs, mostly by Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, and some very loose usage of technical slang.<br/><br/>Other than that, here is a toast to The Avengers, and I am surely up for seeing The Avengers 2, Iron Man 3, and (a man can dream) Coby Smulders in an action movie."
"DubhDoo","9","6","14","17 June 2012"," A blast from Joss Whedon.
","So here it is. After nearly fifty years, The Avengers have finally made the transition from page to screen, and best of all, it does not manage to disappoint. Much of this is down to Joss Whedon and the pitch-perfect casting.<br/><br/>At first, the choice of Whedon as director surprised me somewhat. I really like Whedon, don't get me wrong, but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first 'Toy Story' and the unfortunately overlooked 'Serenity', he struck me as an odd choice. But make no mistake, that even with millions more dollars at hand, Whedon fortunately remains true to himself; keeping humour in sight, with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout. He is confident and assured with these treasured characters, managing to juggle all these superheroes (and one super ego).<br/><br/>We're all used to (most of ) the cast members by now; Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki; but we also have some new players in the form of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. What is most brilliant is that all the actors impress. I was eagerly anticipating seeing Evans as Rogers again, after falling in love with his solo effort, but it was in fact Ruffalo who struck me the most. His portrayal as the tortured Bruce Banner was nuanced, believable and very human, applying emotion to a difficult role. Hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous Loki, giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great lines.<br/><br/>One quibble I had was Hawkeye's lack of screen-time, but that can be ignored as I suspect he will either get a spin-off or have a larger role in the sequel. <br/><br/>This is the very opposite to say Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy; instead of being dark, realistic and multi-layered, this is the very synthesis of a big, bright summer movie, a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences. While Loki's army were a bit too Transformers-esque for my liking, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Overall, an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise it's getting. All I want is for Whedon to the sequel."

","'Avengers Assemble' has been smashing the box offices all around the world! It is tipped to be one of the highest grossing films of all time! The film has been strongly anticipated by 'Marvel' fans worldwide, who stuck on through the credits of the original character films to see 'Nick Fury' (played by Samuel L. Jackson) hint at the upcoming film.<br/><br/>The film itself has certainly lived up to the hype, the cast is superb with an all star cast including; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson and Gwyneth Paltrow. It also includes new up and comers; Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner and Tom Hiddleston.<br/><br/>In the very beginning it is quite dull but it gets progressively better and better as it goes along! The cast all work together really well and there are tonnes of laughs and shining moments! Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/Tony Stark) is definitely one of the shining stars. Downey Jr. and Johansson were the best of the bunch; they both did some fantastic acting and were absolutely hilarious! Chris Evans (Captain America/Steve Rogers) annoyed me because his character is very cocky and relatively boring yet he got quite a lot of screen time?<br/><br/>The film has its up's and it has its minor down's but overall the film was fantastic and I really enjoyed watching it, I'm sure there will be a sequel, here's hoping it's as good as this!"
"lasttimeisaw","5","6","14","2 June 2012"," The Avengers
","Harboring a great deal of expectation of this record-breaking multi-superhero-in-a-row action mash-up, I finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen, but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012. <br/><br/>Alerted by the general opinion of ""if you can survive the boring first 60 minutes, the latter part will blow you away"", maybe ""boring"" is a lesser word, the inter-conversations among these superheroes are way too tedious to arouse any interest, and in light of my last encounter with THOR (2011), I know he is a boredom, then here comes his worsen twin, Captain America, so it is dumb and dumber situation. Most of characters are reprising their usual roles, Robert Downey Jr.'s sleekness is being harnessed into its maximum quota. So I assume the only revelation could come from Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, the newcomer on screen, and the third candidate of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo, but the truth is they might be a clear torrent, but cannot save this juggernaut from being a destroy-it-all dross. <br/><br/>The fighting scenes are the saving grace here which is not a false claim, but it satisfies my eyes without compensates my soul, director Joss Whedon just haphazardly levels everything in Manhattan without any single casualty provided to imply its minimum credibility. No worries at all, we simply witnessed an empty and meaningless catastrophe without any mind activity as we all know Iron Man will not be the sacrifice as a sequel is already set on a release date. Thus, am I over-demanding here? After the invasion of myriads of this sort of big-budget action flicks, THE AVENGERS is no way a standout by any means, none of its actors could stick out with any arresting existence (I might be too desperate to count out Gwyneth Paltrow), Mark Ruffalo is the closest choice of a decent acting in it, all the rest is just the way he or she is, an utterly featherweight character study is the case here. <br/><br/>The gags are scarce (ooh, poor Loki), too much SCI-FI doctrines and the narrative in dead earnest (thanks to you, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson) makes the film's lengthy screen time too overt to be slighted, and I waited until the end-credit rolled over, but a second bonus scenes never show off. <br/><br/>The film's huge success has baffled me so much and its staggering status of the third biggest grossing film of all time (after AVATAR 2009 and TITANIC 1997) does make me do some solemn post-mortem to question my taste, the conclusion could be that I may be detached from the majority's liking, which thankfully I believe heralds a good sign for me, right?"

You spend all this money and then muddy up the shots with a hand-held? It's the cancer on the testicles of cinematography. Buy a dolly, or tripod or Steadicam.<br/><br/>I'm just glad that I didn't see this in 3D (which is another head-scratcher for me). Stargate or Independence Day was shot better. Any Hong Kong action movie is shot better. Any Jackie Chan movie is shot better.<br/><br/>The story was better than average. A good amount of very bad and stilted dialog, though. Loki's ulterior motive on being captured was amazingly transparent.<br/><br/>Acting was generally good. I don't know if you call what Downey does as ""acting"". It's him being charming, which works most of the time. But Scarlette? A looker but not getting much better at her ""craft"".<br/><br/>And I thought it was just silly to see her face-off with the alien invasion with a handgun.<br/><br/>And did Hawkeye's arrows magically replenish themselves 3, 4, 5 times during the final battle? Hemmesworth will be a very good actor in ten years. But he's okay now. But too small to be Thor, though.<br/><br/>And please!

","The Avengers was very well waited among Marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time. <br/><br/>In the mix among stars doing battle are Scarlett Johansson, who plays the Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as archery expert Hawkeye. There were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers, while on few others it disappoints. Since writer-director Joss Whedon was dealing with so many big-name stars, like Robert Downey Jr., who reprises his role as Iron Man, Gwenyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Mark Ruffalo, who takes over the role of Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk, there's just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately in.<br/><br/>For those who have kept up with it, though, The Avengers is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy, and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come.
==========
As a rewatch 05/01/18' and nearly 5 years since initial watch 12/10/13' opinions remain near same. The Avengers has great entertainment value, though at the same time some of it feels quite bland and uninteresting. The finale battle elevates the film as a whole but much forgettable scenes I had forgotten."

","What in the actual hell, 8.2 people, you gave it 8.2? UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH, UGH.<br/><br/>1. Nick Fury played by a weak voiced pip squeak whiny voiced guy? Forgot his name, yeah know he's famous, but all the way through: B MOVIE ACTING. Montel Williams acted better in that nuclear missile movie. Not that he woulda pulled that role off though.<br/><br/>2. I hate that damn CIA guy, whatever he is, the SHIELD moron, the cutesy white guy, his look doesn't match his personality in the movie in my opinion, and his acting was eh. Like idolizing Captain America? The hell for, so he did some stuff in the past long ago thanks to an experiment and for that he becomes an idol? He's still a moron, he's just on magic steroids witha special shield. OooooOoO.<br/><br/>3. How can Scarlett, whatever he character name is, be all calm and cool like a snake and blow up a hospital with people in it, but then when the Hulk fights her, they show this stupid scene of her doing a horribly fake shaking, hugging her knee, like she's scared, only her acting with the shaking is utterly kiddie like, terrible, not believable, and oh yeah so I was gonna say: how can she be scared all the sudden after being cool as a snake, actually more fearless since she was at the beginning of the movie being dropped from a huge height while tied up, but then when moron Hulk pops out she's shaking like a little baby?? HUH?! 4. Why did Thor suddenly act like he was out of breath when that dumb SHIELD agent I just mentioned got stabbed? That winds THOR? Fail.<br/><br/>5. Why is the guy playing Captain America A STIFF? Why when Thor slammed his shield did he get up and then do a slow robot turn? How stupid. And then when Iron Man mentions the red level, he does this stiff (and it happened to fast, bad directing) step back like he's just realized something profound, but it looks dumb.<br/><br/>6. So when Captain America jumps towards the lever, THEY MAKE A COMPUTER GENERATED VERSION OF HIM JUMPING. WHY? It looked dumb, like those stupid CG's of spiderman in the spiderman movies. Just dumb.<br/><br/>7. How the hell is the Hulk intelligent in this movie when he's supposed to be an angry retard? 8. Why is Thor always being a cry baby in this movie? Stupid, so shallow, bad directing.<br/><br/>9. How the hell is Thor able to be stabbed by a little blade when the hulk can't even make him bleed? Ooops? 10. What was with the fake ""what happened?"" sht at the end when Iron Man woke up? Damn that was so fake and pretentious and weak. ""What, what happened, I can't remember directing a nuclear missile into a wormhole and going into outer space and being pushed out by the explosion, whu, whu?"" Shut up.<br/><br/>11. Oh and damn how cheap was that when Scarlett got pinned by some metal rod thing and damn how could you not smell the director saying, ""Oh, check out her ass""? UGH. STUPID. SHE'S ALREADY WEARING TIGHT PANTS MORON DIRECTOR, YET YOU DECIDED TO SAY, ""CURVE UR ASS UP, IT'S FOR THE LITTLE BOYS"" when her ass is already all over the movie in those tight pants? You cheap idiot.<br/><br/>12. Why is Hawkeye played by an oldish ugly guy with shtty acting skill? He was good in Hansel and Gretel, however it's spelled, but sucky in this movie. Who the hell's idea was it to do that gay scene where he crashes into the building window and goes ""Ah, aaaah"" when he landed on his back, like that was so profound and making this epic music to that. He shouldn't have even been in the movie his role was so pathetic and dumb.<br/><br/>The only guys in here whose acting was great was Iron Man and Loki. I never once thought Loki out of character, maybe for a split second, but that was just day dreaming, not cuz of his acting. And Pepper, who was way underused, was good, never think of her as ""Gywneth"" when she's acting.<br/><br/>And what the hell, Scarlett is being used in Age of Ultron? She sucks man, she's some pretentious fighter bitch, her ass is not that great, she's too short. You can't think of any better females to plug in that movie, you have to use her? Whoever is directing these movies is an idiot with bad taste. Sad such a great soundtrack was used for such a sht movie."
"alexclaire1001","7","5","11","10 November 2013"," Let's be Honest Here...
","This picture was the highest grossing film of 2012 and was raved about and spoke highly of. however in my opinion this movie was heavily overrated and didn't really offer anything groundbreaking or worth while.<br/><br/>The films story is weak to say the least and is presented in the form of ""Here you go, here it is"". The main plot for this film is Loki has somehow come back from the dead and has joined forces with an alien race called the Chitauri to take over the Earth with the stolen Tesseract. So with Hawkeye and Selvig brainwashed and kidnapped, S.H.I.E.L.D's base destroyed there is no other option but to begin the Avengers initiative. That's it. <br/><br/>This story might not sound to bad, which in reality it doesn't even though being a bit simple. The reason I think the story is weak is because there are so many plot holes, which are never explained or expanded on. Examples of these plot holes are:<br/><br/>-How did Loki can come back from the dead? -How did Thor return from Asgard to Earth? -The inconsistency of how the Hulk can control his anger -Why was it when Iron Man throws the nuclear missile into the rift where the Chitauri mother ship is, it kills every Chitauri warrior on Earth? -(Picky one) How are the Avengers actually talking to each other when none of them are actually wearing earpieces?<br/><br/>The film's start is very under looked because of the good climax. To be honest the start is actually boring and not compelling at all. This is why I think this film is heavily overrated as people only remember the very well done battle scene. <br/><br/>So they're the major issues with the films however there are some positives. All of the actors perform very well, especially Tom Hiddleston as Loki but with the exception of Jeremy Renner's portrayal of Hawleye, which was very dull and boring. Action sequences are handled well but sometimes cam across repetitive and didn't offer anything new or exciting. The Special effects and CGI was very good and didn't look bad or too unrealistic. The film's pay off is also very satisfying. <br/><br/>I can only hope that in the upcoming Avengers 2: Age of Ultron they can add something new or compelling."

","I've read some Marvel's comics but not enough to become a fan, and this film is average(I'm just too easy) <br/><br/>What is this? Is Loki, the villain that WEAK? Maybe he couldn't adapt to the Earth's environment? And his army? Look like they're adopted from Transformers! <br/><br/>What's good about this film? It's 3D, nothing more.<br/><br/>It took me almost a week to watch this because it's too boring. Our superheroes, their jokes, their love line, their problem... no interesting, easily solved. End!<br/><br/>Old superheroes' formula, boring story. If you want to kill time, go on."
"GeorgeI4280","5","5","11","29 September 2013"," I saw the movie with high hopes.
","It is very much save to say that only truly super hero addicts will love this. I don't read the comics anymore because Id rather read a book or watch a movie could be my age as well. <br/><br/>This is overrated beyond all ends. The villain is annoying beyond all ends. Because you have to incorporate so many characters you have to cram all this crap into one movie and personally the individual films are much better. This felt like an overdose of flashy sh*t everywhere and the story is rather dull. <br/><br/>I went in this movie with high hopes because I on occasion enjoy super hero movies. My favorites have to be the Tim Burton & Christopher Nolan Batman films. Those were fantastic. This is a mess. With over two hours of flashy ridiculous plot twists and cgi up the a** only Super Hero, Comic Book, Addicts and little kids will really appreciate this. If you have a brain and want more realism in a film avoid this crap aside. <br/><br/>I gave it a 5 because some of the special effects were impressive and some of the action was cool and lets be real Scarlett Johanson is hot as hell. But this movie barely qualifies as a 5. You want a true action film with a super hero taste go with The Dark Knight or Batman Begins."

","WARNING The reviewer IS a comic book reader, BUT only reads the graphic novels published by DC Comics, therefore, it is up to the reader of this review to make a decision for themselves over this review is biased or not.<br/><br/>I was not expecting much from the Avengers when I first heard of it, I was pretty disappointed with Marvel's previous films which claimed to lead up to this HUGE climax. Iron Man had it's moments, but don't talk to me about it's sequel! Captain America was only redeemed thanks to Hugo Weaving and Nazis and Thor...well...Thor was just plain rubbish! <br/><br/>So, to be honest, Avengers did not act on the contrary! The plot is that of a children's TV programme, not of a supposed Oscar worthy blockbuster. The villain, Loki, and his henchmen had no thought but in to him at all, he is a stereo-type that has just been used too often; a war-mongering, idiotic Englishman and they were given no back story at all - who the hell where they? The icing on the cake is that, some of the acting and directing is just appalling and there is one scene where this factor is incredibly prominent...<br/><br/>Hawkeye is on top of a building firing arrows at the ""aliens"" and Captain America is with other members - I can't really remember, I've tried my very best to erase this movie from my mind- and starts to talk to the archer. But how? Neither of them are wearing microphones or shouting... If there is a logical explanation I do apologize, but I seriously doubt it. I have done research on all of the Avengers featured and no where was there a mention of telepathic powers.<br/><br/>Having said these horrid things, I did enjoy Robert Downey Jr. and Black Widow was nice eye candy!<br/><br/>People who will enjoy this: Hardcore Marvel Fans, Children under 12, Robert Downey Jr. Fans and perverts."
"luminous-luciano","6","5","11","10 May 2013"," We've All Seen This Film Before...
","Only in excess of 1,400 reviews of this so far - what could possibly be added at this point? It is obvious that the comic-book readers (and nostalgics, of which I could have still been, maybe ten years ago) were more than elated to see all of their favorite four-color heroes in live action together, all at once, sharing the big screen as if a Marvel comic came to life and had, very nearly, no budget restrictions whatsoever.<br/><br/>But seriously - Loki? In the 1960's Thor comics, maybe, he was still a villain one could love to loathe. But nowadays? Neither the character nor the actor portraying him (poor guy) were remotely interesting. <br/><br/>The army at his disposal was made up of some sort of third-rate alien race that, ironically enough, evoked some of rival DC's aliens from their INVASION crossover event back in the 90's (because they couldn't use the Skrulls - right? If those show up anywhere, it will be in a Fantastic Four movie! How amusing to see the Marvel universe split up that way - due to their overzealous ambition to expand their properties' share of the movie industry! It is truly priceless! And more so with the odd choice for replacements here...) <br/><br/>Much has been said about turning Nick Fury into Ebony Fury: personally, I think it improved the rather bland, James Bond wannabe type that the character was for several decades following his introduction in the comic-bookies... However, Samuel L. Jackson is not half the actor Lawrence Fishburne is: the latter could pull off Morpheus but the former is simply not convincing as Shaft, Mace Windu, Agent Augustus in the XxX movies (which naturally prepared him for this one here) and, truth be told, he must be taking this part about as seriously as his role in Snakes On A Plane...<br/><br/>And as for the Avengers themselves - aside from the extremely convincing Hulk (and customized too, in order to look more like human thespian counterpart Mark Ruffalo - I am sure Edward Norton and Eric Bana were so green with envy - not.) and the ever-solid Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man (he truly made this character his own) the rest is somewhat disappointing as Thor has still not grown on me, Captain America seems ill-served by Chris Evans' acting range and Hawkeye... Well, anyone could have played Hawkeye. <br/><br/>The single most disappointing character has to be Scarlett's Black Widow: I mean, wow, that line-delivery and lack of expressiveness is worthy of a Razzie or two - come on! Especially that line amidst the big battle in New York - ''I don't see how that can be a party'' was it? (I paraphrase!) Even Kristen Stewart could not have been this bad!<br/><br/>S.H.I.E.L.D. leaves me uninterested flat out, as well it should. It had ''future TV series spin-off'' written all over it; that must be why! <br/><br/>Now, it took me only a few seconds to figure out why all of this looked so damn familiar, as if I'd seen this movie before: and I sure did! The gathering of characters everyone knows, their peril aboard a ship and then the big battle with a common foe - the exact same plot was seen a few years ago in... LXG! That's right: the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the movie Warner Bros. approved because it was cheaper to produce than a full-fledged (JUSTICE) LEAGUE movie! And these Avengers were still a long way from assembling, back then...! <br/><br/>So, why was the LXG so poorly received - and the Avengers praised? The LXG had a better, more iconic ship than the S.H.I.E.L.D.'s whatever it's called - it was the NAUTILUS! The LXG had a better action gal too in Peta Wilson! The LXG had one of the original action stars - Sean Connery himself! I'm sorry but, no matter how much I appreciate him, Robert Downey Jr. doesn't quite measure up to the original James Bond! And it only stands to reason too as the LXG gathered up classic literature characters rather than super-heroes who all have, collectively or individually, less than 100 years of history and yet the need to constantly revamp their mystique is already felt. Perhaps it is due to the fact that they lack originality? The Hulk is, after all, nothing but a rip-off of Mister Hyde. Thor was borrowed from Norse mythology - and modified. Hawkeye wants to be Robin Hood with an attitude. Need I go on? <br/><br/>The Avengers were only more anticipated and (considerably) more well- received because the target audience was primed and ready for it: they read these heroes' stories in their childhood and had wanted this for so long. That simply wasn't the case for the LXG; the kids who read those and viewed them in the same light are all dead of old age already. <br/><br/>For my money, the LXG had the better script - and more believable action. The Avengers' lone long action sequence is truly the only lasting impression one is left with with this over-hyped production - and I had seen it on YouTube before I got to see the film in its entirety! That doesn't say much for the rest of this Marvelfest - does it?<br/><br/>And, quite frankly, Thanos looks ridiculous too. But they have time to improve him a bit for Avengers 2 (Although with Batista as Drax The Destroyer, how hokey will the overall finished product get to be...?)"
"seb_lotr","1","5","11","4 April 2013"," What a cheesy movie.
","I am not a fan boy and have very little knowledge in the history of the characters. But it seemed to me like a real hodgepodge of mismatched heroes and no real problem in the movie. Thor cant die, hes a God. Iron Man is sort of impenetrable. The Hulk cant die. Captain America is just a douche bag the entire movie. Why start saving like 5-10 innocent people when the entire world is at stake? I really didn't feel this movie or the heroes. Scarlett Johansen at least made some sense in this gang of totally invincible heroes as she had some brain at least. (not to say iron man didn't but he also has tons of firepower) The one really astonishing actor in this movie was Loki he really made a realistic and hate able characther. A movie worth watching just for him."
"phsta89","6","5","11","7 January 2013"," Very average action film
","All I can say is that I am very unimpressed with this film.<br/><br/>The action is not too satisfying and very predictable, the acting is passable, the dialogue is at a strict minimum and the story is pretty much non-existent. In short, it's a whole bunch of CGI and explosions put together. Similar to Michael Bay's Transformers movies. The only strong point of this movie is the cast, but in my opinion this goes to waste because none of them are really given any interesting material/context to work with.<br/><br/>I suggest you avoid it unless you're a die-hard comic fan or if you really want to see Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and RDJ together on screen and fantasize about them."
"felipeogando","5","5","11","12 November 2012"," It was a typical good versus evil movie
","The ""Avengers"" was an action packed movie from start to finish. It was fun and entertaining to watch. To be honest, I didn't know the background of each of the superheroes, because I rarely get a chance to sit down and watch an entire movie. But, the plot was kept pretty simple. So, it was pretty easy to follow (even for someone like me).<br/><br/>I thought that this movie was absolutely hilarious! There was a steady amount of humor throughout the entire movie that just keeps you rolling and makes it just about impossible not to laugh. The scene where the Hulk grabbed a hold of Loki and was pounding him into the floor mid sentence was just the hilarious. I was rolling out of my seat. The Iron Man really had quite a few good lines too that gave the movie just enough seasoning to entice you.<br/><br/>In my opinion though, I thought this movie was just OK. I felt like there were too many scenes that were impossible and not clearly laid out, and it dragged down the movie's quality. For example, when Captain America was waiting on Iron Man to queue him to pull the lever when they were fixing the engine, an enemy came and started shooting at him continually. Captain America had no protection or safe haven for quite some time, but he still was never injured. Or another example was at the end when Iron Man fell from the sky after taking the atom bomb up into space. To be honest, I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that he walked away from that unharmed. I guess I'm too realistic for fairy tales.<br/><br/>There were some parts that I couldn't understand either. Such as, how things ended up with Loki's brother. It seemed to me at first, that he was not on the superheroes side, and then, he ended up being a good guy? And also while in the plane after Loki was captured, he said he's worried about what will happen after his brother shows up, and then later he turns completely cocky and is not intimidated by his brother at all. Maybe it's just me, but I thought because of these things, this movie's quality wasn't that great. So in my opinion, this movie was pretty predictable and lacked any kind of twists in it. It was a typical good versus evil movie, and I've seen lots of them."
"hendricks-jon","5","5","11","12 October 2012"," Not worth one's time
","I cannot believe The Avengers has received such stellar reviews. By 1/3 the way into the film, none of the characters draw one in, the story is uncompelling and I find myself only waiting in boredom for the next fight scenes which turn out to be formulaic and insufficient to warrant further viewing. The designs for various scenes and characters also fail. They look plastic and cheap and distracting from the story rather than immersive. Save your time and money and skip this title. Evidently these reviews have a minimum line count which is equivalent to paying by the word. So let me be verbose. This film was not even fun to watch the villains tearing apart the world because they look so silly in their costumes, their character building moments are horribly predictable and shallow, and what is up with the designs for Loki? He looks more samurai than Scandinavian god, which I am sure is a tip of the hat to the samurai influence in comic books, but let's get real for a moment. He's a bloody Norse god. He should look Norse. If he's going to look so radically different from Norse mythology -- all cybernetic-anime -- then there needs to be some kind of story and character building to explain it."

","I had sky-high expectations for this movie since the day I heard about it. I'm a huge fan of Whedon and Downey, Jr. and I almost peed my pants during the end-credits scene of Iron Man (2008). I knew the probability of this movie being bad were higher, but I had to watch it anyways. Here's a summary of my experience watching the movie: jumping with glee when it began, sitting at the edge of my seat and laughing my head of while it was going on, and shaking by the time I walked out. The acting is amazing, especially by Mark Ruffalo. His hulk was surprisingly funny. I expected RDJ to steal the show as usual, but all the characters were expertly balanced by Joss Whedon. The action sequences are stunning and the final battle is awe- inspiring and humorous at the same time. Loki was very well portrayed by Tom Hiddleston. Not only are all the technical aspects of this movie brilliant, but the storyline as well. The movie is truly a piece of art, only with explosions, so that makes it better.

But he is not the only good actor in the movie, we also have Chris Evans as Captain America that delivers the leadership needed, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow that show us how amazing a woman can be in a situation of danger, Chris Hemsworth as Thor that gives us that bravery, strenght and performance we wanted to see from him, Tom Hiddleston as Loki that delivers the big villain with no compassion that this movie needed, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson funny and brave as always, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill the new woman with a lot of potential, Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Dr. Erik Selvig also great performance, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye a actor that show us archery like no one and spectacular performance, our Samuel L.

","From the beginning off this movie turned one completely off. The choice of a bad guy was horrible, a pure hype machine of a movie. Robert Downey is a good actor but his trite portrayal of being charming grows tiresome. Marvel movies have alway's lacked depth and true heart. However this movie engages than cruises by fast, a popcorn movie full of great marketing. A movie like this deserves one view, but really easy to forget its poorly written, acted due to all the hype. Its time for Robert to hang the the suit up. The first Iron Man was the only good one, the character is now dull and annoying. Liam as Thor has no on-screen like ability or charisma. Chris Evans plays a somewhat convincing role but he couldn't act his way through Fast And Furious. Mark Ruffalo is the only saving grace of this movie The Hulk will always be a hard hero to get right, he makes it work on all levels.

(His quote about Hitler directly contradicts his role in the film, he's a filthy hypocrite that gives the AMERICUH!! vibe.) It's a fun watch, but this is evidence of the dumbing down of cinema for a worldwide audience.<br/><br/>Overseas markets are big money, but because cultures are so diverse, to appeal to the world the movie is forced into a least common denominator.

It's well written, has character and plot development, stunning visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and most importantly, the avengers themselves. My favorite thing about the introduction of the characters is that they don't all appear at once. The avengers come together one at a time planning to accomplish their own goals at first, only discover that they all have a common enemy and the world needs them. It's a smart and good pace that the film follows allowing the audience to breath a little. The cast acts their parts in a way that comic book films almost never succeed in. They have dynamic and rope you in every second. You can even put aside Captain America's dorky costume because everything about this movie is so good. Best part? No romantic crap in this movie. Everything is short, simple, and to the stuff we care about."

","""The Avengers"" is a super-hero masterpiece. Marverl's idea of bringing together the Avengers to one motion picture was genius, and the execution was masterful. Joss Whedon's humor brings nothing but benefit to the already great story and action scenes. Of course, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark is certainly awesome, and Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner is the best I've seen so far. The most outstanding character is in fact the Hulk, and Whedon's humor shines best with him. The entire team eventually works together perfectly. The only minor flaws that are pointed out by certain critics are the lack of story and character establishment. However, because this is in fact a sequel to the five films, I believe that anyone who has seen ""Thor"" will surely understand why Loki does seek domination over Earth. And it is also why I believe the characters are ones who have already been established in their own films, and ""The Avengers"" is an all-out motion picture meant only to entertain. It does so indeed, is the best super- hero movie yet, and most likely will stay so for a long time."

Robert Downy Jr., as usual, brought the most amazing array of sarcasm and wit to the screen, his audacity always has just the right amount of pluck and pomp to press all the right buttons while tip toeing playfully on all the wrong ones. The entire cast of this film were perfectly chosen and each one brought dynamic energy to their character.

"joeravioli1","9","5","11","27 May 2012"," Out of your seat heart-pounding action. But one little problem.
","The Avengers starts with a bang, as the god Loki emerges through a gate in space into a remote research facility. He converts a few people to work with him, including Agent Barton, a.k.a Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). His plan is, of course, to take over the world and enslave all the humans, or as he puts it, ""free them from freedom"". S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Samuel. L. Jackson) assembles a group of superheroes including the vain Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Asgardian Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the warrior Captain America (Chris Evans), and my personal favorite, the powerful, awesome, and spectacular Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The purpose of these heroes is to combat the threat Loki. <br/><br/>This movie was great from start to finish. Sure the director went a little overboard with the special effects, and the flying aircraft carrier was a little much. But otherwise, it was fun, clever, and exciting. Joss Whedon did a great job of mashing all these heroes, who each had their unique personalities into one film, which acknowledged each and every one of them. the humour was smart, well placed, and perfect.<br/><br/>One thing though, is that the 3D was awful. It made the screen dark, and it made people sitting off-centre nauseous. So if you are going to see this movie, I suggest seeing it in 2D. I also suggest sitting near the wall, because during the intense action scenes, the walls vibrate and it gives you a feeling of actually being in the movie. <br/><br/>This movie probably would only appeal to the young people, as young people love the sensation and the insanity shown in these films."

","Absolutely Brilliant!!!!...not a single dull moment in this movie. Great to see Robert Downey Jr. after Sherlock Holmes...right on the button. He is having amazing sense of representing Tony Stark in the Iron Man franchise and now in The Avengers. Captain America, Thor were fabulous in this movie. The action was top notch. Scarlett was OK and I missed Edward Norton as Hulk although Mark has done an excellent job as Hulk especially with some of his interactions with other super heroes. I wish Hawk Eyes character would have been given better treatment. He was lost in the crowd of super heroes. All greats ensemble to form this wonderful movie. Go watch and enjoy all the super heroes of America!!!!"
"daniela-giadach","10","5","11","14 May 2012"," A major outburst of emotion and suspense
","""The Avengers"" was truly one of the greatest action movies I have ever experienced. I'm not the type of person who hypes up about a movie but this one was worth the hype. The emotionality between the Avengers team and the suspense brought by the battle scenes, I have never experienced something similar to it. All the action going on kept you on the edge of your seat, about to burst out screaming. <br/><br/>Making a movie in which all the major super heroes are involved is hard, specially as you have to unite them all in an adventure that makes sense for all of them to be in. I have to say that in this movie the plot was beautifully put together and made absolute sense. The lines, the movements, the sets, everything was perfect. I congratulate the actors and the director for this wonderful movie. The conflict between the siblings of Asgard, the jealousy, the emotionality between them fully portrayed what the Avengers fight for: fair and freedom for all. It was a wonderful experience which I am willing to go through once again."

","Since 2008 we have had two ""Iron Man"" films, a better ""Hulk"" film, a ""Thor"" film, and ""Captain America"" film. As each film was released, we were given clues to something bigger coming up. May 4th, 2012 gave us ""The Advengers"".<br/><br/>Director Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. has a crisis to deal with. At a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. facility where experiments are being conducted on the Tesseract, an energy cube with unlimited power, open a portal and Thor's evil, slick. power mad half-brother Loki who was exiled now is free. Loki takes the Tesseract, and Professor Erik Selvig and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clint Barton to help get more items to reopen the portal and bring an alien army to help him take over the Earth. So will ""The Avengers"" meet this challenge or fail in saving Earth?<br/><br/>The film is 142 minutes long, but once things get going time isn't a problem. The cast of Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarrgard, Clark Gregg, and Gwyneth Paltrow give good performances,<br/><br/>You know that there are two ""more special"" scenes as the credit roll and lets say that both will get your attention. I plan to go see it again, because it is so much fun to view,"
"jediforce10","10","5","11","13 May 2012"," A movie that not only lives up to everyone's expectations, but also blew them away. The Avengers is a movie that everybody should see.
","I'm giving no spoilers here since I am wanting to make anybody who hasn't seen this movie to go hit the movie theaters ASAP. Needless to say, The Avengers is everything you want and more in a superhero blockbuster flick. MARVEL truly put a lot of effort into this movie and it really does show a lot. They not only did a huge team up movie, but they also created one that was deep, compelling and brilliantly done. Every hero we've seen in this movie is given not only a fair amount of time on screen as a group, but each one also individually. We see their struggles with their times as a superhero and each one of them has an arc of their own. Even some of the side characters get their own fair share of screen time and I for one applaud that. The action scenes are beautifully well done in this movie and some of the best I've seen in a superhero flick; especially the final battle. Not only does this movie succeed in also being strong in character development and action, but its humor is also top notch. I burst out laughing at a lot of those funny moments and I think you will too when you see them. There is a lot of eye candy to behold in the movie as well and everything looks brilliant and feels brilliant. I'm not going to go into more of this movie so I don't dare spoil anything for you all, but it has to be said right now. The Avengers is quite possibly the best movie of 2012 I've ever seen. The story is excellent, the characters are superb, the effects are top notch, there is plenty of funny moments, and everything in this movie is well balanced from beginning to end. If you haven't seen this movie, then do so. It's everything you want in a superhero movie and you can't miss it at all. Get to the theater today and see this movie!"
"Bruce722","10","5","11","12 May 2012"," Simply put... MARVELOUS!
","I'm not gonna lie, this movie was absolutely amazing! Also, if I'm being completely honest, I went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldn't like up to the hype. It definitely wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with the critics. Boy was I mistaken. Outside of the films from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this is easily the best superhero movie ever made. They plot developed perfectly, the action sequences were incredible, there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue, and the characters and actors were all great. One of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake. Well the great Joss Whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing Black Widow and Hawkeye. Another thing, Mark Ruffalo did a marvelous job as Bruce Banner. A lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from Edward Norton. Maybe it's because I'm biased and loathe Norton but I thought Ruffalo did a better job as Banner. I wouldn't have minded them focusing a little more time on the Hawkeye character and I wouldn't have minded if they actually squeezed in Natalie Portman's character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didn't need it. I just think if you can put Portman on screen, you put Portman on screen, lol. I also wouldn't have minded if they focused a bit more on the villainous pawns and where they come from but I have a feeling we'll find out more about them in the following Avengers sequels so I can't be too upset about that. All in all, if you like superhero movies, action movies, or just kick ass movies in general, you should like this movie too."

It was witty at just the right moments. Ever character defending earth in their own way. The story was good. plot was good as well. I can only give this movie a 10. I would give it an eleven but you know I have to stay withing the rules. Is this the best movie every made?

Another one is when in the end of the movie Iron Man Flies to the space, throw the bomb and then ""surprisely"" make it to Earth. Worth the money of the ticket and even more.

","If you ask me, making a superhero movie easy , why??? well, the whole formula of a super hero facing a mad man who wants to take over the world then hero saves earth, with some fancy effects, and you have a movie, BUT it is not an easy task to impress people or make them to take the movie seriously, in my opinion the two main films that succeeded in making a revolution in the superhero category movies are the new dark knight franchise, which took things 2 the next level, with their deep messages and this movie Avengers. Avengers is one of these movies that will leave an impact for a long time, the cast is perfect, a strong script and kick ass direction. - The story, is really interesting, it was fresh, it wasn't boring at all, not just another hey we saved the world yay nop it made me feel like i was fighting with them YES WE SAVED THE WORLD, i don't know how to describe it, all i can say is that the script was really good and it will make you excited, I love aliens so i was excited,,, - The cast is PERFECT, these guys were like peanut butter and jam \m/ which is one of the main reasons that the film succeeded, with out the perfect cast this movie would be average, Tom Hiddleston is a genius i love his role he was perfect, he played his role well, as for Robert Downey, Jr. this guy is damn awesome, every time the movie gets really serious he comes in and lighten up the mood \m/, the rest of the cast were really awesome, kudos 2 all of them :). - The direction was really good, the effects were awesome and not corny, perfect job. - this movie proves that by the right cast, direction and script you could make a respectful not just another superhero movie, this movie was a dream movie 4 most of us and damn i'm lucky enough 2 be alive 2 c it, i was really excited and when i came out of the cinema i got more excited, awesome movie, if you didn't c it then GO,,,,"
"joker-4","10","5","11","11 May 2012"," Disney Marvels at Whedon Assembly
","If you have been a fan of the core Marvel Studios' films since 2008's IRON MAN, where the beginnings of the ""Avengers Initiative"" were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER, then the AVENGERS will not disappoint. In fact, it very well might make you question why the other franchise films weren't as good as this fast- paced, funny, superhero showdown.<br/><br/>Marvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the Disney banner ‚Äì and they no doubt wish that the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises could return to their fold, as it was the success of these earlier films that brought Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy ‚Äì and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike; by Odin's beard, Sir Kenneth Branagh directed THOR. Enter Joss Whedon, who created a weekly TV show in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that was a near-perfect example of a live-action comic book, to deliver a heavily-anticipated yet so-easy-to-fail production of getting such a diverse character set in a movie that worked. And worked it did.<br/><br/>The film gets off to a slow and even somewhat murky start as Loki, Thor's mischievous half-brother, played with a Anthony Hopkins-worthy sneer by Tom Hiddleston, appears, escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of a SHIELD HQ as well as the spiriting away of a few supporting characters including Stellan Skarsgard's Dr. Selvig, also of THOR, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, getting the full movie treatment here, all under the semi-impotent glare of Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed spy Nick Fury. Obiously Loki never saw Samuel L's wallet from another film.<br/><br/>The movie picks up with the re-introduction of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow as Whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in BUFFY if he had an Avengers-sized budget backing him up, but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, finally appear and, of course, get into a wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsor/shield/hammer. Once the team finally assembles, insanity, and the hilarity that often follows, ensues. Oh, and Mark Ruffalo proves that the Hulk can indeed smash.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's adept skills, he also writes the screenplay, prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created a production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of Thanos, the mainstream movie audience who thinks that Tony and Pepper are destined for each other, and his own loyal, core fan base of Browncoats. Each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of a comicbook splash page. The rough-up dust-up of a third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in a street-level brawl in NYC against, what else, an invading alien army, could very well have became tedious, as admittedly, the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless, forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures, but the action, humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen.<br/><br/>2008 saw the release of both IRON MAN and Warner Bros.' DARK KNIGHT. The result was that both films set the bar that future genre films would have to follow. In 2012 that bar was set yet again. What remains to be seen is if the upcoming DARK KNIGHT RISES film, as well as the sequels for IRON MAN, THOR and CAPTAIN America, will continue to raise that bar, or if they will all just... assemble."

What kind of help is this?"" And of course, this being a proper Super Hero movie, The Hulk eventually becomes useful rather than simply destructive and clears up most of those doubts. And in all honesty, what, exactly does Captain America do? Except for reflecting things off his shield, that is? Or am I getting too picky here? Possibly so.

"tilby182","10","5","11","9 May 2012"," One of the best films I've ever seen. A MUST SEE!
","Like many people, who have been fast forwarding the credits to see the teasing snippet at the end in the Iron Man films, Thor, Captain America etc, I was ridiculously excited to see this film. I'll hold my hands up now and admit that I am a huge sci-fi nerd and regard Thor and Iron Man 1 as two of my favourite ever films (along with titles such as the recent Star Trek, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy). Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This film was, there's only one way to put this... INCREDIBLE! The special effects were out of the world, literally the best effects I have ever seen, on a larger scale than the most recent Transformers film, but less in your face and over powering. The effects were first rate, completely seamless and is definitely something to watch on the big screen, rather than wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>I found that the acting was really good as well, everyone pulling their weight with a big nod towards Tom Hiddleston who i believe was one of the stars of the show. Definitely the best Hulk there has ever been and Chris Hemsworth was utterly fantastic. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr will deserve all the plaudits he takes from this film as he was brilliant, as always, in his role of Tony Stark. Even Scarlett Johansson, who many assumed would just be ""token bo__"" was really good and her character had surprising depth.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where you cant help but smile while watching it as you follow an incredible story line while witnessing faultless special affects. I cannot recommend this film enough, I have seen it once at the cinema and have already booked tickets to go see it again. The phrase ""a must see"" has not been as relevant since Lord of the Rings, People..<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS FILM!"
"Italian_one_xx","10","5","11","7 May 2012"," I was expecting brilliance and I found perfection
","It is the film to watch!<br/><br/>This movie is the best ever superhero film I have ever seen. I was expecting a ""Michael Bay style"" movie with nothing but CGI, but there is so much more to flashing lights in this movie (unlike Transformers 2,3).<br/><br/>The character clash worked really well as some scenes included just the heroes communicating and interacting. The characters were all brilliant with a superb cast e.g Downey Jr. But the Actor that stood out the most was none the less than Mark Ruffalo (where has he been all this time?. This guy fits so well into the clothes of Bruce Banner, as he really portrays the human and the scientific side of the hulk, he also shows the battle with him self that he is constantly fighting. The Hulk in this movie was expected,lets be honest, to be a 'side character' instead he was a BEAST, no, better THE HULK. I also liked how Lou Ferigno makes his cameo as the voice of the Hulk. As for the rest of characters such as Iron Man,Captain America and Thor they all shared really equally big roles. Black Widow's character is not only the 'pretty face' but, an extremely shrewd woman. Perfect woman? Or is it just me? Hawkeye the last character, like we all expected draws the short straw, but not as short as you would expect, as he is seen doing some amazing stuff. The Antagonist Loky has a great impact in the movie, as the contrast of characters between Him and Thor, Tony Stark and the rest escalates the tension to breaking point.<br/><br/>The film adopts a light hearted feel at times, which smooths the film with some light humour. The visuals were incredible, especially with the Hulk transformation (finnally we get to see that) and the battles.<br/><br/>I would suggest watching Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, the Incredible Hulk and the first Avenger (find out the order on IMDb) before you watch the avengers. Remember if you have not gone Cinema to watch it yet, stay till the very END.<br/><br/>{Unfortunately for me i think i know how avengers 2 is going to end to find out my imaginary ending search up Spider man 1994 episode 57... I am not a geek/nerd and I just really like super heroes.}"

"DareDevilKid","10","5","11","6 May 2012"," There Was The Anticipation! There Were The Expectations! There Was The Hype! And.....Boy Did It Deliver!!!
","Movie Review: The Avengers (2012) by DareDevilKid.DDK<br/><br/>My Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Yes! Oh, boy did this movie deliver! Its like all the cogs fitted perfectly in a well oiled mechanism. Director Joss Whedon has made a brilliant transition from the small to the big screen. The Director has delivered a classic Action/Adventure film of epic proportions. And this was no little achievement, considering all the legendary characters of folklore mostly possessing their individual blockbusters - some really good and some plain mediocre -, which were amalgamated into one huge vista.<br/><br/>All the superheroes & even the super-villain merge into the plot beautifully and appear exactly at the opportune moments. Even a somewhat throwaway hero like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) feels vital. Her fight scenes are Buffy cool. Hemsworth and Evans are more relaxed, more comfortable in their spandex skin. If there's an underused super it's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but in the last act he impresses, too.<br/><br/>But The true standout is The Hulk. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner pulls off the trick of allowing his inner rage to simmer just below the surface the whole time. And when the green dude shows up, stand back and just enjoy. He's the first version of Hulk to make his burst of power feel so gratifying. His destructive nature is infectious. Also an honorable mentions have to bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man & Chris Hemsworth's - he's really growing with each passing film - Thor, who adequately support Mark Ruffalo and his alter-ego throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The Avengers looks great. The reportedly $250 million budget is on the screen. Many scenes have a great deal of variety. Not just well- choreographed action, there's a cleverness to the very idea to many of the scenes. Whedon pushes his heroes to their limits. When your script can put demigod Thor in peril that's incredible.<br/><br/>The plot is simple yet effective - Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston - a slimy megalomaniac) has taken a cube called the Tesseract that harnesses limitless energy and aliens from another dimension intend to invade Earth to get it. Its easy to follow and merges well into the narration to let the film deliver what audiences really want to see - these ultimate superheroes becoming a team and kicking much butt.<br/><br/>The action is magnanimous, the CGI effects are dazzling but ushered only when required, great and witty one-liners are interspersed intermittently, the humor is enthralling, the set-pieces are brilliant, each character is painstakingly developed, the narration is crisp and finally but most importantly, the action makes sense - a rarity for action adventure movies nowadays - in a way that you follow each minutest detail even while its bursting on screen at the rate of knots. The action occurs only after enough plot and character detailing and even when it occurs, it smoothly takes the plot forward. This rare feat elevates Whedon as the real superhero of this film.<br/><br/>'The Avengers' reminds us of the reason we love movies ant buy tickets for admittance in a cinema hall. It will keep drawing you back for more, as viewing it just once is insulting and will leave you just plain unsatisfied. The euphoria you experience after completing this exalting visual odyssey will settle only after many long hours and then the realization will ultimately dawn - that you have been privileged to witness an classic that will be indelibly etched in cinematic archives."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","11","6 May 2012"," The long-awaited party (not Bilbo's one-hundred eleventh birthday)
","Like Bilbo's one-hundred-eleventh birthday party, ""The Avengers"" is a ""long-awaited"" event, after four (not counting Hulk) major features on the ensemble of heroes which grossed a mind-boggling aggregate box office in excess of 2 billion dollars (well over half of which coming from the two editions of Iron Man). <br/><br/>The main plot is rather simple, and familiar: (a) Earth is fighting for its very survival against alien invasions and (b) there is an object/device of immense power sought by one and all, good guys as well as bad guys. <br/><br/>Assembling the ensemble of six is quite a challenge. Before we examine how cleverly this is done, let's try to catalogue the protagonists. How about into 3 groups? Least ""human"" are Thor and Hulk. Early in the movie, just before his first appearance, a cryptic remark is made about Thor to the effect of something like he is ""basically a god"". Hulk remains human, but only until ""the other guy"" (a term used repeatedly by our hero himself) takes over. Next come the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" category: human with so much done to their body that they become sort of superhuman: Iron Man and Captain America. Finally, there are Black Widow and Hawkeye (altered ego of ""Green Arrow"" of the other camp, the JLA?), Nick Fury's special agents who are one hundred percent human but trained to so excel in combat that they are almost superhuman. <br/><br/>The villains are quite unimpressive, serving as punch bags for our heroes, who provide vastly better entertainment by fighting among themselves. Let's see how cleverly this achieved by a plot that is nowhere near being convoluted and yet delightfully un-formulaic.<br/><br/>While everything evolves around Nick Fury whose brainchild ""The Avengers"" is, assembling of the team is mesmerizing, providing plenty of opportunities for fights among the heroes. Almost from the first minute, Hawkeye defects to villain Loki who wields a brain-control device. Black Widow succeeds in persuading Hulk to join, but only as a research scientist, not a superhero (they consider ""the other guy"" more a monster than a hero). Captain America, technically over 100 years old, is revived from his deep freeze while Iron Man is led into Fury's scheme much earlier on (off screen), almost like his partner. <br/><br/>Soon after Iron Man, with Captain America's assistance, subdues Loki (part of the villain's cunning plot) Thor who seems to have materialized out of nowhere claims his brother for a prisoner, setting off an exciting bout with Iron Man, eventually stopped by Captain America's mediation. <br/><br/>At Fury's headquarter (an invisible flying aircraft carries ‚Äì this you will have to see for yourself), five of the six Avengers assemble, with Loki in captivity. The villain's plot is to have the defected sixth (Hawkeye) come to his rescue and destroy his captors. He tries, very close to succeeding, to manipulate the team member's different personalities to set them against each other. Even more damaging, Loki thinks, is a provocation to bring out ""the other guy"", unleashing Hulk's destructive power. It seems to work initially. The attack led by defected Hawkeye provokes the appearance of green monster Hulk. The ensuing combat between the physically two most powerful (Hulk and Thor) is something to behold. While this one is sheer brutal force, the fight between the two special agents is a show of beautiful yet lethal combat techniques. The result: Hawkeye breaks out of the brain control to which he has been subjected and comes back to his senses. As well, Captain American and Iron Man, whose personality conflict has been the biggest obstacle to their cooperation, finally work together as a team.<br/><br/>So in the last hour of the movie, while Loki brings out his alien army down on to Manhattan, The Avengers are finally cemented as a team, as you see in the most publicized trailer shot with the camera circling them in an undaunted spirit of solidarity, ready to face whatever enemy that dares to come to Earth. <br/><br/>This movie must be seen at least twice. The first time you are dividing your attention between following the story and watching the action. Only in the second time can you fully enjoy the excellent dialogue (rare for an action movie) which will be several times more meaningful than this first. At the same time, you are able to sit back and fully enjoy the action. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth reprise their respective characters, adding a delightful new dimension on personality conflicts. All this is done mostly through crispy, witty dialogue. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, who has made brief and briefer appearances respectively in Iron Man and Thor franchises, bring more complete realization to their respective character, as well as a half-told story of their past relationship which strongly suggests a spin-off prequel. Last but certainly not least is Mark Ruffalo whose soft-spoken, low-key interpretation of Hulk gets two thumbs up from me.<br/><br/>And of course there are all the others. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson and Tom Hiddleston's Loki need no introduction, and not even reminders. From Iron Man comes Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and from Thor comes Stellan Skarsgard's Erik Selvig, two more familiar faces. For a welcomed new face is Cobie Smulder's Agent Maria Hill."
"sarahmdorra","7","5","11","6 May 2012"," Surprisingly very good!
","It was a surprise that I actually liked Marvel's The Avengers. My expectations were a film about a bunch of superheroes exercising their powers for the sheer amusement of the comic-book fans. Indeed, I was right about the exercise of power (naturally enough) but the way such showing-off was employed is what I like about the film. While, on the surface the events may seem to revolve about a group of mentally immature superheroes, there are several references to a deeper meaning, presented in a hilarious, light way with focus on both action and dialogue alike.<br/><br/>The undertone found in The Avengers has to do with the current universal trend of freedom and rebels. Loki makes it clear that his purpose is to fix the 'problem' which earth inhabitants have of misunderstanding the meaning of 'freedom' claiming they 'are made to be ruled'. Also, there is an indirect mention of fallen regimes, in general, and particularly the fall of the Soviet Union. Though this subject is not dealt with depth, it gives some weight to the light nature of the film. A film about superheroes is not expected to tackle serious issues but, at the same time, films whose main aim is to entertain the viewer should still not be an embodiment of triviality as is the case in many comedies of the last few years.<br/><br/>This is delivered through a balance between action and dialogue. The film is action-packed like a superhero film should be, though this does not come at the expense of dialogue; action sequences are supported by the amazing CGI (with a special nod to the resemblance between Dr Banner and the Hulk). Dialogue, similarly, plays an important role in the development of events and the relationship between the characters.<br/><br/>Wittily, this is coated with a fair amount of good humour. Though some jokes could be predictable, the spontaneity of the performances makes them, unarguably, funny. For example, towards the end, when Rogers is giving orders to policemen, what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves. Non-verbal humour even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard ‚Äì when Dr Banner's 'other guy'shut Loki up with a slight movement of his huge arms.<br/><br/>Such elements gather, in the end, to make a film that, successfully, transcends the circle of comic-book fans, delivering one of the best films of the season."
"joemoe116","10","5","11","5 May 2012"," exceeded my already high expectations
","This review will not contain any spoilers. I want those of you who have not seen The Avengers to have the same experience I had when I saw the film. To put any spoilers in this review would be unfair to those who have not seen The Avengers. You probably wouldn't believe me anyway. I went into this film with very high expectations. Something that has never happened to me before happened when I saw The Avengers. The film exceeded my already high expectations. I remember the very end of the first Iron Man when Samuel L Jackson appeared as Nick Fury, then Robert Downey Jr. appeared as Tony Stark At the end of The Incredible Hulk, Samuel L Jackson was back and Nick Fury in Iron Man 2. . At the very he end of Iron Man 2 we saw Thor's hammer. Samuel L Jackson appeared as Nick Fury in Thor. At the end of Thor we saw Capt. America's shield. In Capt. America Samuel L Jackson played Nick Fury connecting all 5 films featuring 4 of the greatest Marvel comics superheroes of all time. Now Tony Stark Iron Man, {Robert Downey Jr.} ,Captain America Steve Rogers {Chris Evans}, Thor {Chris Hemsworth}, and The Hulk and Bruce Banner {Mark Ruffalo} are together in The Avengers. Nick Fury played by {Samuel L Jackson} brings all these superheroes together along with black Widow agent Romanoff {Scarlett Johansson} and Hawkeye {Jeremy Renner.} I'm in agreement with some of the posters who said that The Avengers is the best comic book adaptation ever made. The script was well written. The cast gave master class performances. No one else could have portrayed these characters other than the actors who played them. I was blown away by the special effects in the film. I became a kid all over again watching this The Avengers. This was an excellent movie. You should do your family and yourself a favor and see The Avengers. I guarantee you will not be bored."

","This movie was so anticipated by me ever since I knew this was being made... Every Marvelmovie being released before this one was watched by me knowing that every superhero would play a part in this movie! All the previous movies (beginning from The Incredible Hulk, still with Edward Norton) were a prelude: a sort of prequel to this big set-up! And what a movie!! This is what I call 'movie history' being made! The story lines of all the other movies (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor & Captain America: the First Avenger)all come together (which would make it hard to watch if you haven't seen any of the previous movies... especially the Iron Man and Thor-films) Go watch this movie! enjoy it! savour it! It is marvellous! Incredible! And I enjoyed every single moment in this 2.5 hour during movie!! This gets a 10/10 for story, for excitement, for acting, for music, for directing! A true actionpacked movie and I loved it!"

","Ten out of Ten<br/><br/>I along with my friend went to watch this movie on the basis of IMDb reviews. And boy !! The reviews didn't disappoint us. <br/><br/>Why I was not having too much expectations on this movie ¬Ö <br/><br/>1. 6 Heroes !! Its very difficult to give enough screen time to all of them and at the same time keep the pace of the movie as well. (Spider Man 3 was a classic example of this goof up) <br/><br/>2. Was concerned about the Mega Villain. <br/><br/>3.Bad reactions on the casting of Mark Ruffalo as HULK. <br/><br/>4. Lately, a lot of Super hero movies were flops or average. (Green Lantern & Iron Man)<br/><br/>But now, I would definitely ask you all to watch this movie¬Ö.. coz ¬Ö¬Ö. <br/><br/>1. The movie has cleverly given the screen time to everybody. <br/><br/>2.Loki made a tough Villain to beat alone. <br/><br/>3. Everybody loved Mark and as well as the HULK. <br/><br/>4. Timing of the funny moments were spot on. <br/><br/>5.Technologically good as par with Avatar and Transformer 3. <br/><br/>6. The best Super Hero Movie out now with Batman series. 7. Avengers will be enjoyed by a 10 year old kid to a 60 year old man. (I am 30 and my friend is 38) <br/><br/>8. Can be enjoyed in 2D as well.<br/><br/>Waiting for Avengers 2 ¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö."

","I had absolutely no hope of this one making it big. The second I took my seat, boy was I proved wrong by many a mile! There's a reason this is only the second super hero movie in the top 250. Coz its worth it. Period.<br/><br/>I was absolutely glued right from the first minute. It was an awesome mixture of high-end action, drama, suspense, thrill, humor and love! OK maybe not love. Who would want that in a super hero movie anyway?<br/><br/>Iron Man was at his brutal best whether it was tactics, word play, narcissism or just plain old explosive action. He just did not disappoint! If you thought Iron Man only did solo, you are in for a surprise.<br/><br/>I thought Hawkeye and the Black Widow were going to be just another pair of dummies. NOT! They are as much a part of the story as the rest of them. Be prepared for some of their cool moves. Man, does Scarlett look stunning when she is beating the hell out of the bad guys. Hawkeye might have done way better with a gun, but what the hell. To each his own! <br/><br/>Thor and Cap. America, the demigod and the strategist, with the awessssome weapon and shield combo, totally kicked butt(ask Loki's horde)! Perhaps, there was little the captain could do with just his shield.<br/><br/>And the best for the last. For those who had lost all hopes of Hulk ever entertaining them, this one changes it all. He is now my favorite today! What raw madness (ask Loki)!! This time Hulk gives it all with a pinch of humor that we have missed in the previous two movies.<br/><br/>The first half was built around bringing all the super-heroes together and setting up the story line without deviating from the end plot. The second half just blows you away. Joss Whedon seems to have become a master artist when it comes to super cool dudes. He's given each of the good guys an equal say in the movie with none in particular ruling the show.<br/><br/>In the end the 2 and a half hours of non-stop fun seemed to be way less and I was left craving for more :( . This summer is gonna be really hot folks and the Avengers just got the party started! Hoo-haa! Go watch it!"

"adamwillingham95","10","5","11","27 April 2012"," It's no Dark Knight but it sits comfortably at the number 2 spot.
","There isn't really much plot going on here but what there is plenty of is character depth, Joss Whedon does a fantastic job of giving these characters so many levels that we never knew they had. This added depth to the characters really causes us too feel for them in their moment of hardships. The character I ended up empathising for the most was actually Black Widow which actually surprised me a great deal. But that's thing that Whedon does really well, he is used to developing characters and yet again his fantastic writing does it again here. Now if you had your doubts about Joss Whedon's directing ability then let me reassure you that you can put those fears to bed. Some of the shots he creates are absolutely stunning making for what will be some very iconic scenes from the movie. Not only did Joss Whedon direct this action filled roller coaster he also put pen to paper and wrote it, as I said the plot isn't exceptional but the dialogue is utter brilliance. Every word out of Tony Stark's mouth is absolutely hilarious making this funnier than a lot of comedies I have seen.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the standard of the acting that is typically found in these Marvel movies, it's pretty good but nothing really amazing. Robert Downey Jr. obviously returns as the obnoxious and downright funny billionaire, Tony Stark. Everyone has seen this role before so you don't really see anything new here but you know what, that doesn't mean it hasn't gotten old. As usual Robert Downey Jr. performs brilliantly, displaying one of the best performances of the movie adding some comedy to an otherwise action filed adventure.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. isn't the only one that shines here, Mark Ruffalo ‚Äì who I am a huge fan of ‚Äì plays Bruce Banner/ the Hulk brilliantly making for my personal favourite Hulk's we have seen to date and there is nothing I wish more than for him to get his own movie after this, but we all know that isn't going to happen. Ruffalo also supplies us with many laughs throughout the movie and he also gives us a collection of the best action sequences in the whole movie with his ""Hulk smash!""<br/><br/>We see the return of Tom Hiddleston as the menacing Loki and he plays the role absolutely beautifully. The first shot we get of Loki is harrowing which is mastered by the combination of Hiddleston's devilish performance and Whedon's gorgeous directing. Loki not only makes for a horrifying villain but his chemistry between Downey Jr. as Iron Man is priceless. If you weren't fond of Loki in Thor ‚Äì like I wasn't ‚Äì your mind will be changed here he truly is an evil person making for an iconic villain.<br/><br/>Chris Evans and Hemsworth show us the performance you expect from seeing them in their individual Marvel movies, they aren't show stopping but are good enough for this movie. I feel as though the best moments of acting are when all of the Avengers are together, the chemistry between them is perfect, they all have their own different relationship between each other that can swap from hatred to best friends in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>Now the one thing that you don't have to worry about in this movie is any of the main characters being pushed aside. When I first saw the trailer I thought that this will end up being Iron Man & Co. but trust me it isn't, all of the characters you want to get all the screen time they deserve. Maria Hill played by the brilliant Cobie Smulders is one of the very few characters that gets pushed to the side, but she was never really regarded as one of the main characters although I would have liked it if she had a bit more ass kicking to do. Pepper Potts played by Gwyneth Paltrow makes a brief appearance which literally lasts a minute but you don't really care about that as this movie really isn't about her.<br/><br/>The Avengers isn't exactly perfect, there was one thing I wasn't too fond of and that is that these movies are starting to feel far too familiar. Apart from the stature of this movie in comparison with others it doesn't really vary it's self from the other Marvel movies ‚Äì Paramount Pictures ‚Äì the direction has the same old comic book action style which you can spot in all the other movies. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I can see many people starting to tire of it.<br/><br/>I feel as though it is usually useless and extremely overpriced, the same can be said here. I didn't feel as though the 3D was necessary, if it was it would have been filmed in 3D and not post converted like most films are these day. The 3D wasn't used like Avatar to fully engross me in the world, it just felt like it was there and there was nothing really too it, I know I would have enjoyed the film just as much in 2D.<br/><br/>The thing The Avengers does best is what it set out to do. It isn't trying to be a dark superhero movie with a serious tone ‚Äì like The Dark Knight ‚Äì and that's good because trying to compete with that is a ridiculous thing to do. The Avengers tries to be a comic book action-filled, Hollywood blockbuster and you know what it does that perfectly.<br/><br/>Trust me, if you are a fan of superhero movies then you will fall in love with this movie, it is the movie we all wanted and expected, Joss Whedon has done us all proud and for that I would like to him, thank you very much. This is the perfect start to a Summer filled with brilliant movies.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed you can check out many more at: http://moviesoclock.wordpress.com/"

","The critics so far are basically right about what makes it great. Virtually all of the reviewers have said it has excellent dialogue and great action set pieces.<br/><br/>No one who is a fan of fantasy action movies could seriously deny how good this is as an action spectacle: the special effects are very good, and put to good use by Whedon and his team. The tracking shot through the midst of the final battle is amazing. The finale is a genuine classic battle scene, and is as good as anything that Steven Spielberg would have put together in the same circumstances.<br/><br/>The movie is funny enough that IMDb should add 'comedy' to its genre list. And all the other things the critics are repeating (so far, anyway) are true: mostly good acting, Ruffalo is especially good as Banner, character interactions are done very well, everyone gets enough to do that it feels like an ensemble movie, all of the title characters from the prior films are portrayed as well, or better than, in their own films blah blah blah...<br/><br/>So all the good stuff we've been hearing/reading is basically true. What about the bad? There's less consensus around the bad, but probably general agreement that the plot as such isn't all that. It's basically the story as told on the cover of The Avengers comic #1: a team of powerful, but not unstoppable, individuals gather together to fight a foe no hero could stop alone. As Time Out's reviewer noted, the plot is basically just a coat-hanger for Whedon to build his character arcs and action sequences. But The Avengers was always likely to be limited by the need to be an origin story of sorts, and so I wasn't really expecting a lot more from the plot on this occasion; and the storytelling itself is very good, the way the character arcs were moved forward and entwined, was done very well. The alien army was an adequate, but not very innovative way to get Loki reinforcements and get a big battle for the heroes at the climax.<br/><br/>The beginning was a bit clunky (several reviewers have used exactly that word) and I don't think it was a very helpful way to get audiences who hadn't seen the build-up movies into the film.<br/><br/>There are potentially interesting themes of control, power and freedom (as Patrick Samuel touched on in his review at Static Mass Emporium), but these are not given sufficient fleshing out, leaving the movie in the 'summer blockbuster' category, albeit a much, much better than average example of that kind.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'll say it again: The official title is stupid.<br/><br/>But overall, I'd give it a 9/10. (Probably a 7 to 8 for those who haven't read the comics or followed the movie franchise closely.)"
"paulneedhamishere","2","9","24","21 May 2012"," Death of a Super Hero
","This film was dreadful. It was certainly action packed, with an onslaught to the senses reminiscent of a roller coaster ride but lasting two hours 23 minutes. The dialogue consisted of half a dozen very shallow characters trying to sound cool, which means for Robert DJ that he was mumbling incoherently for half of his lines. The story was so predictable - overcome overwhelming odds by gritting your teeth, stamping your foot or banging your hammer just that little bit harder. But let us take a moment to mourn the sad demise of the extraordinary talent of superhero Joss Whedon who will be remembered for Buffy and Firefly but not, if we're generous, for this abomination. So, what have I learned from this experience? That IMDb's scoring system has been compromised and can't be trusted - 8.8 is ridiculous."

"DamnYouGoogle","5","9","24","7 May 2012"," Exactly what you expected probably.
","In order to understand the situation of my review I'll clear some things up. I saw this on a regular movie screen, no 3D and no IMAX so maybe I wasn't fully engrossed in this film due to the medium I chose to view it in, but lets cut the crap, if a movie needs images popping at your face every other 30 seconds and IMAX sized screens to be ""TOTALLY AWESOME, BRUH."" it was never that solid to begin with. That being said lets analyze the film shall we? So here is the main problems with The Avengers as a whole, it relies too much action with too little meaning. What did I expect though, right? Well I expected something a little less cookie cutter than this.<br/><br/>If Transformers is a bad movie (which it is and far worse than this.) for lacking fan service of its original audience to connect to, The Avengers is stunningly mediocre for the exact opposite reason. God bless the man or woman that enters the theater with no prior knowledge of every superhero movie released in the last 7 years, because all this film contains is fan service upon fan service. There is nothing organic about this film and it shows in spades. Everything and everyone is merely glazed over waiting for there 12 minutes of solo screen time no risks are taking and there is so much Star Wars prequels-equse action going on that it kills any tension you might have the film almost runs 150 minutes 100 of which are unnecessary fights between the bad guys and good guys or the good guys and the other good guys not gelling as a team its just an obvious film.<br/><br/>The avengers isn't irredeemable though it has some solid performances particularly Colby Slomders of How I met Your Mother fame proves she can probably take a stab at being an action heroine on her own project and Mark Ruffalo's take on The Hulk impressed me. The action sequences while over abundant are masterfully crafted and the comedy is surprisingly what works the best in this film with several witty one liners strewn through out the film.<br/><br/>At the end of the day I think the film was too much Bang and not enough buck. As I was leaving a gentlemen was talking to his wife and said ""I thought there would be a lot less talking."" my inner monologue rebutted ""Wanna just watch stock footage of things getting blown up and punched?"" but this is what it is. If you are a fan of superhero movies you'll probably love this. If you are fan of things that blow up and implode you'll probably love this too. Fans of focused films with a little more story and character development, maybe a risk or two being taken will probably feel the same way I do about it.<br/><br/>My one sentence summary of The Avengers, ""2 and half hours of non-specific escapism."" I that sounds like something you like which there is no shame in then I recommend it. If not id pass or wait for a rental.<br/><br/>5/10"
"tubs-fuzefx","2","20","65","3 May 2012"," Movie does not live up to hype,wasted opportunity
","I think this movie was made for 16-year-olds who've never heard of the word ""hegemony"". Who just want Hulk to rescue Iron Man without understanding what motivates his change of heart towards Tony Stark or who see nothing wrong with shots concentrating on Scarlett Johansson's butt and don't understand the inner conflict of the characters.<br/><br/>The film tries to use humour and action sequences to gloss over poor story development, poor character choices and action sequences that really don't propel the story or characters forward but that seem to happen for their own sake.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there are some very clever, witty lines especially from Tony Stark but they're a wasted opportunity to explore Thor and Loki's relationship more, which was set up so well in the Thor movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie is full of so many clich√©s that you see them coming a mile away. There's also a lot of cringeworthy dialogue trying to sound profound - if that's not bad enough, the film has no heart. Something that the 1st Iron Man and Thor movie had in spades.<br/><br/>There was a clear arch with the characters - we knew what their pain is and what they needed to get by the end of the film. The Avengers in this movie are paper cut-outs with no depth.<br/><br/>They're almost parodies of themselves and this is very obvious with Hulk vs Bruce Banner, which is a pity because the animated series on SABC 3 currently shows how interesting the character dynamics can be without sacrificing what makes each character tick.<br/><br/>Here I didn't feel anything for the characters, I didn't care whether they live or die or get anything new that we haven't seen in their past incarnation. Instead I was bombarded by dumb 1980's drivel about how we need big brother America and ""Right is might mentality"" ... ja nee ... actually the film is more about how America sees itself and what it thinks. A not-so-subtle indoctrination into why we need ""Team America World Police"" this time in form of the Avengers.<br/><br/>It's a pity that a movie with no proper character development, a story with no build (it's actually a throwback to a time were escapist films were far removed to anything resembling peoples lives, values or a smart comment on our times) will make millions until people realize that the emperor is naked like they did with Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>Well, if you want a movie where you will check out your brain at the door and watch things explode, then this movie is for you. If you want to laugh in short bursts in between, then this movie is for you but if you want an action movie that will move you, I suggest your rent Iron Man 1 and Thor instead."

","Went to sneak of Avengers tonight in Austin and wish I hadn't wasted the couple hours or so! Very disappointing. Wish I had sold or given away the passes. I remember a time where the story was the most important part of the movie, instead of just smart quips and CGI explosions to make up for it. I guess it is all about making a quick buck. ""Hey, lets put all these elements together and make a killing off the rubes!"" Thing is, we will accept lower and lower quality films, and have no one to blame but ourselves. Don't like silly cars that turn into metallic aliens anyone? I would wait for HBO or the like if you must see this. On a VERY related subject: who are the morons in marketing who decided that they should over-book a sneak so a good third of passes are turned away? From the angry/disappointed faces on the adults and KIDS who were leaving, I am wondering how all the bad will generated helps promote a film? They should barely over book by say, 1% so that people with lives aren't at the mercy of slackers who sit around all day with nothing else going on but to sit all day. Grade C for movie and promotion."

I'm not sure why, but even with the 3D effect - to be honest, didn't make much difference, until the final battle sequence - but even then it was few and far between! I think this film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk - was that supposed to sound impressive? There were a few funny bits, especially with the Hulk, but on the whole the film just dragged on without a real purpose - I hope the supposed sequel will be much better!"

","So why do all the heroes have the same personality? why are they all cracking stark themed one liners in every single scene and smirking :S its boring af to watch. They had to have a moment were stark lists why hes different to cap just so the audience can tell them apart hah.<br/><br/>urghh where to start this was such a lousy movie. The villian is loki again hes more or less the most edgy, angsty teen style villian you can imagine with no true motivation as to why he is evil in the first place. What i was left out to die by my birth parents and a loving caring family took me in and raised me as their own son? they truly love me and care for me :O well, im going to murder my adopted family now..... what an ""edgelord"" character xD<br/><br/>He is happy to sit and wait for the hero's to finish up their playfight with one another while he spectates without trying to flee. The god of mischief not running away when left to his own devices, crazy huh.<br/><br/>Next they take banner onto a billion dollar aircraft, and yes i know what you're thinking, literally everyone in the audience is rolling their eyes at this point knowing exactly what is about to happen, heck i expect everyone on the aircraft in the movie were rolling their eyes when they heard banner was coming aboard. Andddd yep he rages out and takes it down killing god knows how many :/ what a twist. During this predictable development, Loki the man responsible stabs the heroes freind and ally Coulson to death and hes harrowing final words are ""ohhhhhh so thats what it does"" as he shoots loki of the ship with a ""dock off"" sized gun. How touching a sentiment :/ the mcu rally knows how to bring the feels right.<br/><br/>The heroes dont really give a fu*k about coulsen though and they quickly run off to crack 200 one liners and to start randomly face planting windows, bro on bro fist pump with the jolly green giant. urghhh its like watching teen titans go at this point, honestly watching it on mute improves the third act drastically the same as with the civil war playfight. Then the egyptian cosplaying aliens all die for some reason. The director never really bothers to show how this is possible. He never foreshadows some form of hive mind concept with a central control ship at any point in the movie, all that happens is the government see the portal in the sky above new york and decide to nuke new york instead...... stark takes the nuke through the portal and miraculously it hits a ship a couple miles away in space, which by happenstance insta kills the entire alien army talk about good luck. That is some next level lazy storytelling right there, just a massive cop out.<br/><br/>And the funny mass murderer is interupted mid temper tantrum by the green man and playfully thrown around like a rag doll and left in a ditch as he strolls off and cracks the 201st lame one liner. The camera than zoooooms in for a close up of the bemused expression on the murderers face as he comically sighs into it :/ and this made a billion dollars..... hah. I was fully expecting Arnie to pop in with his Mr.Freeze suit on and crack a cheesy one liner in the after credits but it was just the heros grabbing a snack instead.<br/><br/>No funeral scene for coulson or memorial for the countless dead, no attention whatsoever throughout the movie to the heros love interests, they just get sidelined and forgotten about.<br/><br/>Overall it was a tone deaf mess of a movie with shoddy storytelling and identical gimmicky characters who showed no emotion."
"fredroyer","5","2","3","22 November 2019"," Live Action Team America
","Marvel only hires TeeVee directors for a reason. The visual effects work has already been previzzed. All they need is someone competent to film the spoken bits in between the cartoon-like action bits. But this movie set an interesting precedent: the reliance of Hollywood on the Chinese movie goers. No movie can possibly gross over a billion dollars without the Chinese audience these days. Americans are largely tapped out.<br/><br/>What is seen here should make you sit up and notice- and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market. Captain America is presented as the leader of the team, but he is played as a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command just because he showed up. He is given deference, but he is not respected at all. Even the NYPD police captain disrespects him - until he demonstrates his martial arts ability, then it's all ""yes sir, right away sir"".<br/><br/>He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and by Stark too, yet supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even - and no one should be surprised by this - has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here. Stark is also American but his portrayal here is a complete 180 from Cap: Stark's politics are correct, and Cap's politics are not.<br/><br/>The sequels would change up his hair color (Thor at one point in his movies had bleached eyebrows!). But the portrayal would remain the same: dim and dull. This is the only version of Captain America global audiences will accept."

","The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema and instead go in expecting some cool action, hot chicks and a few wisecracks.<br/><br/>In this endeavor it succeeds fairly well; it is in fact almost nonstop action, and it flows well for this purpose. There's hardly a moment of relative boredom or dullness, and it keeps your attention throughout. Pacing is something many films have trouble with and this does it well.<br/><br/>The special effects and sound editing were very well-done too.

What sticks out in my memory is Thor hitting his hammer against Captain America's shield, an awesomely done scene for effects.<br/><br/>The humorous one-liners, mostly stemming from Tony Stark but also from the camaraderie among the Avengers group, also work well enough and keep you at least smiling throughout.<br/><br/>However, I sensed a strong amount of cold, calculated filmmaking here. I felt almost no style in this entire film, and instead I felt as if Joss Whedon had a quota to fill as he was filming it. It's almost as if he was thinking, ""I need to show what happens during the following encounters: Thor vs. Captain America, Thor vs. Iron Man, Iron Man vs. Loki"", etc., and then later on, many combinations of two or three of the Avengers fighting bad guys together, to contrast their earlier conflicts. I appreciate the contrast that went into that aspect, but it just felt plain robotic the way it was executed. The thought pattern I detected was, ""You damn well can't have an Avengers movie without this happening, and this, and..."" The result of this is that this ""quota"" took the focus and actually enticing filmmaking was put on the backburner. He was simply showing things happening with entirely no flair or style of direction whatsoever. Oh look, here's Iron Man coming in to save the day! He's going to say something funny, don't we know it! Nothing stylish, unexpected or cinematic happens in this entire film. It left a dry taste in my mouth, despite all the cool effects and fighting.<br/><br/>The story, along with the direction, was very milquetoast and forgettable. To briefly summarize: Loki, an alien, comes down to Earth to wreak havoc; the Avengers team up and stop him and all the aliens he summons through a giant portal as well. You'd think Nick Fury, being the leader of the Avengers, would take on a more interesting storyline role, but he really doesn't. I was maniacally uninterested in every single scene with him talking to the heads of S.H.I.E.L.D., and beyond that his storyline doesn't really go many places in this film. In fact all the other individual character storylines didn't really go anywhere either, which is okay since this film was a group effort, but the overall group storyline was not very interesting either, basically another rendition of saving the planet. Therefore neither the overarching group storyline nor the individual storylines were very fulfilling, leaving the story as a whole lacking.<br/><br/>The script was also extremely dry and poorly written. I feel this was another item that went on the backburner to give the aforementioned ""quota"" more focus. Most of the lines were very uninteresting and without character. One example that stuck out in my mind is Nick Fury saying, ""I'll bet you $10 you're wrong"". People may say this phrase in reality; it's not the realism about it I attack but the character and flair of it. This is a movie; when characters speak they should be saying things that are somewhat relevant, interesting, mysterious, gripping, funny, or any combination thereof. Something that delivers, something with edge or character. Most of the lines in the entire film I have completely forgotten already except ones like the above that I remembered just to point out how uninteresting they are. Just like with the direction, I felt as if the script, too, just had people saying things to move the story along. Very sparsely was any extra style or flair or character added in.<br/><br/>Last but entirely not least is the acting, and overall I was disappointed. I'll start with the good: Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny smartass self, and I have no complaints, nor was he exceptional. I also actually quite enjoyed Chris Evans as Captain America; I find him a talented actor who works well in various kinds of films. Also Scarlett Johansson did a great job as usual. I love Stellan Skarsg√•rd; he's a great actor, but I have to admit his placement in the film felt awkward and every time he came on screen I chose to express it through hysterical laughter. Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury but I wasn't very impressed, but I blame that on the script. Now for the bad: The main villain of the film, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, was a terrible choice for the main villain of any film. I mostly laughed at his scenes, because of how bad his acting was, when laughter was unintended. The guy who plays Thor, Chris Hemsworth, was not very good either in this film. Also Mark Ruffalo was a disappointment to see. I don't mind his acting normally but it was just so noticeably inferior to Edward Norton's Hulk that it has to count as a negative.<br/><br/>To sum up, good pacing, special effects and some interesting encounters between certain characters do not save a film when it has weak direction, a weak script, a weak storyline, mostly weak acting, and most glaring of all it seemed very cold, calculated, and without style. However, I was at least mildly entertained."

","Perfect!!! Everything I wanted in a superhero film. Having all these characters who've been built up over the past five movies finally come together was amazing. Joss Weddon did it, and did it well! All actors playing th amin avengers were superb and Loki us currently, and I'm pretty sure will remain for a while, one of the best villains in any one of these movies. The best part was how different it was from any other Marvel movie. There were funny quips and retorts between a couple of the characters that added the comedic touch perfectly, Coulson's death was sad, but it was the motivation needed for the team. Then the battle of Manhattan was fought and let me just say it was awesome. Overall marvelously inpressed!!!"

That had some hilarious results. I love the Dr Strange/Tony Stark moments but you kinda knew they had to come. Bruce fighting with Hulk was hilarious. Thanos is a great character and a way that unifies what all the teams are doing. One of the highlights of the film has to be when peter dinklage shows up in ....well in the form he showed up in! (you'll see!) it was delightful to see him and i heard at least 10 audible sighs of glee at seeing him. Groot and Rocket hangin around with Thor was Hilarious.

Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, SHIELD, and Captain America have come together to form the Avengers.<br/><br/>There was doubt about the Hulk in this movie considering the two disappointments in the previous Hulk movies. But this was the greatest Hulk in comparison to all previous Hulks. Mark Ruffalo, who plays the role of Dr. Bruce Banner, is a perfect match. He really redefined the not only Dr. Banner, but also the Hulk. Well done Marvel.<br/><br/>The drama between the heroes as the Avengers was forming was super, but it was short lived. The fight between Iron Man and Thor was cool, but it leaves a person wanting more. Later on, the Hulk and Thor fought, and it was awesome to see it on the big screen. It was also a little short, but it may have taken from the Avengers story if it were any longer.<br/><br/>The battle in New York was incredible. The Hulk was funny with his smashing tactics. There was one scene that was a single shot that led from one hero to the next across the city as each was fighting one of the villains. The fighting sequences and the choreography that was put together in that shot was impressive and entertaining."

It is the first time on the big scream that we get to see all of our favorite characters together, fighting and saving the world. Some of the characters we have already seen like Iron Man, Hulk (though this time played by Mark Ruffalo and not Edward Norton), Thor, and Captain America all of whom have had their own movies so far. These characters are some of the most likeable characters to be on the big screen. The acting in this film is spectacular and all of the actors/actresses are the characters that they play.

The plot didn't engage me, I didn't relate to the characters and I couldn't care less what will happen to them. There was no depth or point. This is simply a couple of hours of superficial fun for those who have fun shutting their brains out. I love the effects and the action and the adrenaline too, but that's not enough for me. I need the film to have a strong story and depth. If I can't have both, I'll always pick a poorly filmed good story rather than superbly made nonsense.

"jayrule","10","1","1","26 June 2019"," Seven years later, this is still one of the best films in my collection
","This is one of the best films I've ever seen, not just because it's a fun action film, filled with characters that I've grown to love, but because it was the first of its kind, setting the bar for other multiple-character franchises. It's a first, and because of this it absolutely has its flaws, but it's definitely a game changer.<br/><br/>Despite having seven lead characters (counting all Avengers plus Loki), everyone got at least a few moments of screen time devoted to their development. With seven leads, that's pretty amazing. We have the quiet moments, the little gestures and phrases that have been picked apart time and again by the fans that have granted a depth to the film that wouldn't have been possible if this were the first time we met any of these characters, and that's the real beauty of Avengers. It's a team-up flick, but it's a team-up of characters we've all been introduced to before. (Even if you hadn't seen any of the previous films, there was a sort of pop culture awareness around most of them by the time it was released that you'd be hard pressed to go in blind about anyone except the characters who didn't have their own film yet and were, however regrettably, less important because of it.)<br/><br/>Combine that with a well-loved director who isn't afraid to sucker punch his audience, and you've got a perfect mix for a film that doesn't just thrill audiences with fight scenes that are larger-than-life, but gets people to invest emotionally in a fictional world. Avengers was released more than two years ago, but the film is still being picked apart and very much alive in the hearts and minds of the fans because of Marvel's expert world-building. In every show, every film, you see threads that lead back (or forward) to other events in the Universe, and it's this sort of continuity that the fans love. They pick up on every little reference, read into every word of dialogue, every prop placement, every choice that the creative team makes, and this is what has made Avengers so successful. It stands up to that test, and even with ten films under Marvel's belt, there's still very few inconsistencies. (Especially when you compare it to the next largest Marvel franchise, X-Men, which has some major timeline problems around Wolverine.)<br/><br/>All in all, this is a film that should be in every collection because it's not just great, it's revolutionary."

","How is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three? I re-watched it two times in a row (which makes it a total of 6) and still loved every moment of it. If I have to guess it's the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing (unlike awful Game of Thrones,season 8), which makes it tick. There are no grade A actors in it , aside perhaps Robert Downy Jr. and Sam L Jackson, yet in this one, every one is a star. Both Evans and Hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren't just a pretty face. They are captain America and Thor respectively, and I cant' imagine anyone else in that role. A typical acting of Mark Ruffalo, actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of Hulk even better than Ed Norton, whom I personally consider to be one of the best, though notoriously known difficult to work with, actors. Scarlet Johanson Gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever. Not to forget everyone else, who gave an outstanding performance. This movie is not without its flaws, yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides, makes up for it. I will give it a 10/10 rating, as this is a movie that started an Avengers craze for me, so all the other movies, even the bad ones, fall into their place in this epic movie series."

","The Avengers takes it's time assembling the full team for action, and it pays off tremendously. When the team comes together they have such an ecstatic chemistry with each other. You watch in awe even when they're just talking with each other. Each hero plays off the other so well, and they all have a unique relationship with the other that helps tie the team together. Tony Stark and Captain America clash heads, Tony Stark finds a new friend in Bruce Banner, Bruce Banner has an awkward relationship with Black Widow, and the Hulk has a friendly rivalry with Thor. What helps tie the team together and solidify their authority is the score. One of the best scores in the marvel universe and in film is The Avengers Theme, a classic piece of music that sticks in your head, and it helps you weave an emotional connection to these characters. The Action is some of the best. Although the action is quite entertaining without being too much or too little, some small portions of it feel a little underwhelming, but the rest will give you goosebumps. Watching these characters come together from their separate movies forms quite the spectacle to behold. It gives the movie a monumental atmosphere around the entire experience. Despite that a good chunk of the movie the cinematography can be kind of dull. The dialogue between the team, the action they serve out, and the spectacle of a film that they exist in all comes together to form a memorable movie experience that lasers itself into your brain so you never forget it. Overall, the Avengers is an extremely successful culmination of these heroes that delivers thrills, comedy, and some truly powerful moments that embed themselves in movie history. So I give it an 8.8"

Most of the characters are full of themselves and unbearable to watch in all their unpleasantness, others are just useless ragdolls, I've never felt even the slightest sign of danger or distress, and the funny parts weren't that funny.

"cyberknight","1","1","1","23 June 2017"," The ending is spoiled on the trailer!!!
","So, I watched the trailer for ""The Avengers"". It has Loki bragging he has an army, to which Tony Stark/Iron Man replies that they have The Hulk...<br/><br/>I supposed that, maybe, if I didn't know absolutely anything about The Hulk from the comics, I wouldn't have predicted the ending of the film with that. I mean, they had The Hulk... So what? Considering the cool and calm way Mr. Stark said that, I could conclude that he thought (or, more likely, had it for granted) that the so-called ""Hulk"" was so powerful that anything, even a whole army, thrown on it wouldn't even tickle. It just happens that's the case in the film.<br/><br/>Unlike most superheroes, The Hulk has no Achilles Heel (apart from himself). The more things you throw on The Hulk, the stronger he becomes, infinitely and exponentially. That piece of information is not presented on this film, as far as I can remember (and not even in any of The Hulk films, but I don't remember most of them, so I can't be sure), but it wasn't necessary. The morons that cut that trailer should have known better than to put that Robert ""Tony"" Downey ""Stark"" Jr.'s one-liner on the it. Yes, it spoiled the ending for me, and no, I didn't watch the trailer on purpose, it was shown when I went to the theatre to watch something else (I was so shocked by the spoiling trailer that I can't even remember what I went to watch, then).<br/><br/>This film is boring, uninspired, over-hyped, so badly scripted/plotted that it can't even be called ""pretentious"" (is that good or bad, for a film of this genre?!) and the visual effects are so exaggerated that everything looks fake. Even so, it has one of the best lines of all superheroes films I've seen. It comes like this, the film starts, there is a lot of boring/annoying bla-bla-blah and, after Mr. Stark tells Loki that they have The Hulk, Bruce Banner reappears, someone says him that it would be good if he could get angry, to which Dr. Banner replies... Sorry, even with ""spoilers on"", I can't force myself to tell you this. If you don't want to watch this film (if I hadn't, I wouldn't, believe me, it's really that boring), go to a search engine site and look for ""The Avengers Hulk angry secret"" and watch a clip of the scene, because it's THE ONLY piece of all of it that is worth watching. I can't say that that alone would be worth the price of admission, but it surely put a smile on my bored face.<br/><br/>10 stars for Dr. Bruce Banner's one line, -7 for all the rest."

","This is an example of a successful movie. The successful movie is when you watch it breathtaking, easy watching and yet this is a movie very hard to make.<br/><br/>The hell of making such a movie is to write a handful of protagonists - each having a separate movie of their own - into a single movie, where all of them should be main characters and equally. A hell of a job)) Yet of all Avengers movies, including Civil War, this one is the best. <br/><br/>So.. this is one of the movies you wish it never ends) But first.. I want to praise the role of Cobie Smulders. She is very sexy and played her role of Maria Hill very and very sexy) I'd very much like to have such a girlfriend in me life)) <br/><br/>So) The task was to make many episodes like video clips)) where each of the characters have single and impressive dialogue and acting. Then - to unite them all into a movie. Personally, after watching it three times.. I'm a big fan of Scarlett so first time I was all into her.. Second time I watched it I liked the performance of Tom Hiddleston, well.. this is a movie where all actors are just perfect))<br/><br/>Tom .. there is something ideal for him to take the role of Loki.. you will never see him as a villain)) You will understand him and have compassion - this is what Marvel is all about)) <br/><br/>But today.. as I watched it the third time.. it was all about the connection. about understanding, about to be together. Strange but this third time, I noticed the trust Captain America tried to have to this team, strange and unknown to him.. Sacrifice Iron Man made.. their mutual partnership.. you know.. Marvel's movies are not about fun comics blockbuster they have a meaning) This movie was about understanding and to be together despite all odds) A dialogue between so different people and about not to be alone but to be together)) This is why I love Marvel movies so much) They have this humanity in it)) Beauty of humanity in all of the rage of a blockbuster))<br/><br/>So today.. it is about Thor still loving his half brother, Widow saving Arrow, Iron man and Captain working together.. Hulk.. trying so much to be a good man he always is.. This is not thanks God just a superhero movie this a movie about understanding and God! it ends too soon - the movie))<br/><br/>Thank you Marvel) It is marvel)) The fairy tale not about heroes but about us))"

"EthanBJones_03","9","1","1","23 May 2017"," Why do I feel like Shawarma!?!?!?!?!. A must watch for comic book fans
","'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon and stars Roberty Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Tom Hiddlesticks(Hiddleston if it actually bothers you). It's the end result of 5 previous movies, combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When a charming, likable British villain tries to attack Earth with his giant disposable CGI space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team, consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one. And thus we have a Cinematic Universe. Thanks Feige. Your brilliance had doomed us all. <br/><br/>The Avengers is one of the most likable, enjoyable, fun action/superhero movies that's ever been released and redefined a genre. Without this movie, all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn't exist(the debate on whether that's good or not is still open) and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted. Don't watch this movie expecting 'The Dark Knight' or 'X-Men' because this movie centres fun as its #1 goal and excels at it. All the cast is likable, the action is fun and it is overall just a great, big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life.<br/><br/>As much as I praise this movie, it does have some flaws. The main flaw is the dull, generic and clich√É¬© ridden story which is just really poorly written. It follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have NO stakes in Marvel movies. I will also say the 'ending' should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so I would definitely say it should have been handled better. The end credits sequences are gold, though.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man and is easily the best part of the MCU. On the flip side of this, I will say that I was very disappointed in Chris Evan's Captain America and I think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch. I understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human. Hiddlesticks was phenomenal as Loki and remains as easily the best MCU villain. He's smart, he's charming and, most importantly, he's British. That must be a requirement on entry to the 'Super villain Squad' because every villain in the universe is British(or at least the good ones are). Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and Hawkeye. She may not be a critical member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity. Mark Ruffallo was great as Bruce Banner and I adore how he refers to his alter ego as 'the other guy'. Jeremy Renner was fine as Hawkeye and remains the most useful Avenger with his SICK Archery Skills. Seriously though, he doesn't need to exist. Chris Hemsworth was good as Thor but not particularly memorable. Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold.<br/><br/>The cinematography for this movie is great and I adore the tracking shots Whedon uses in the action and I think it benefits the action so much. Whedon CAN do action supremely well. The effects are amazing and are a delight to look at. The costume design was great and the set design was also really good. <br/><br/>This movie needed to provide some fun action sequences, be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard Marvel fans. I can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them. As for the third one, I can't comment but I will assume they were happy. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do because it is pure, adrenaline filled enjoyment.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Meh.<br/><br/>In this movie there's everything you expect, just as you expect it: extremely noisy action scenes, a multimillionaire budget flaunted without restraint, superhero brawls, New York invaded by aliens for the 2.735.961th time and the usual Stan Lee cameo.<br/><br/>I suppose that's enough to satisfy Marvel zombies.<br/><br/>To me, it seems like Mr. Whedon worked alternating the autopilot with the Copy & Paste function. For example, the showdown against Loki's army is basically Transformers 3 final battle with different characters, and a less talented direction.<br/><br/>The only real surprises come from humor: I have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny. Apart from this, you'll find nothing but cheesy costumes, woody and/or pointless dialogues, tons of derivative spectacularity and a plot that often seems to go nowhere (Black Widow, with all that chatting aimlessly about her past, is particularly confusing).<br/><br/>And Thor's hammer is blatantly fake."

"PimpHandStrong","1","15","47","26 September 2012"," Way OVERRATED - not really different or better than Bay's Transformers series
","SPOILERS AHEAD Let me preface it by saying I have never been a fan of the Marvel comics and only found a couple of the set-up movies to be decent. However, I was still intrigued because of the very good reviews from critics and the box office success. After watching, this is not what I would consider a good film. It's basically on par or slightly above Michael Bay's Transformers series, and anyone who has read my reviews of those knows how low I think of them (even the best, the original, is really only average). Avengers is pretty well made, decently well acted, and slickly produced. But it just doesn't have a good story and the premise is basically absurd. First, the villain is nothing special. Loki's motives are vague, his plan confusing at best, and at no point is his character even that menacing. Right from the start you know that Thor or Iron Man or Hulk could kick the crap out of him so there's never any suspense as to whether Loki would succeed. Second, all the science and techno talk throughout makes little sense and is very difficult to follow. I found myself not caring about Iron Man and Bruce Banner's supposed genius after a while. The script is just soooo formulaic. You know the heroes will have personality clash at first, you know there will be a sombering event that will pull them all together, and you know they will prevail. This has been done a million times in these movies and to be honest, it's been done way better.<br/><br/>What is even the point of the Scarlet Johansen and Jeremy Renner characters? They're human and their abilities are really impossible to even believe, same with their effectiveness when fighting the final battle. In reality, they'd have been killed in like 2 seconds like any other human fighting in a battle of immortals. Renner's acting was also pretty bad. Same with Chris Evans, Captain America was just a wooden character. And for a movie that was praised for a clever script and lot of humor, I laughed only a handful of times, even Robert Downey Jr's alleged wit got annoying.<br/><br/>And like I said, no suspense in the final battle. The alien army that had been built up throughout turns out to be very easily defeatable. These guys get killed like nothing and don't even appear to have any special powers. Their forces turn out to be quite light as well. Besides, Hulk and Thor are basically portrayed as immortal, same as Iron Man when he is in the suit (which has every magical ability under the sun), so there is zero suspense because no one watching could ever believe for a second that any of these 3 could actually be defeated or killed. The way Iron Man blows up their big ship is a ripoff of Independence Day anyway and of course he lives, once again, zero suspense as to whether he would make it. It's just poor film-making. And really, Micahel Bay could have made this movie especially the final battle, that's basically what it is.<br/><br/>Overall, you'd have to be a huge fanboy of the comics to think this is a great movie. It's really not. Plus, at 2 hours and 20 minutes, it drags and drags and is a tough watch. Very disappointed overall, not recommended. 4/10"
"timerty4","6","7","18","29 May 2012"," Unclear Plot, Lame Jokes, Inaccurate Character Potray
","From the name of this movie, we are supposed to feel that this movie has to represent Marvel superhero characters. So this movie has a responsibility to make each superhero look as genuine as possible but it is not mostly successful.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining in many moments. I like Iron Man's suit removal scene, seeing Black Widow's confidence when she was being interrogated and her subsequent self-release, the fighting between Thor, Iron Man and Captain America when Loki was taken to the helicarrier.<br/><br/>What do I dislike about the portray of the characters? Black Widow in her normally very cold or cool appearance appears too surprised and fearful when she was in India while pointing the gun to Bruce, even though she already has backup. If she is really a trained agent, she should have prepared herself for the possibility of Bruce getting angry. But she reacted as though she was unprepared for that, this conflicts her status as a trained agent. If she was prepared, she would have shown it more, and concentrated more on evasive actions rather than felt so surprised and fearful.<br/><br/>The movie has quite bad immature jokes.<br/><br/>The movies has many poorly-constructed jokes that seem immature. It mentioned adoption and bullying to crack jokes, and the worst of all, it uses the dying Agent Coulson to make people laugh. It has quite a poor and unhealthy sense of humor. It made me think whether this movie is only for young and immature teenagers to enjoy. It could have an unhealthy influence on growing up kids.<br/><br/>This is the movie's most confusing subplot-- The movie's plot has Loki and Hawkeye trying to prevent the Avengers from stopping their plan. Hawkeye was to destroy one of the helicarrier's engines, why he didn't destroy the other engines is a mystery, maybe he did not have enough ammunition? Loki comes aboard the helicarrier to create his own mental disruption.<br/><br/>Black Widow in her interrogation deduced that Loki was trying to influence Bane somehow so that he will turn into the Hulk before he could locate the Tesseract. We can then see the scepter glowing with blue light when the avengers were arguing and Bane feeling agitated. Maybe Loki was influencing Bane to pick it up too. But not many people could understand this part of the movie plot properly if they don't already realize that Loki's scepter could influence minds. This should have been hinted on when Hawkeye suggested the plan to Loki.<br/><br/>The joke when the police chose to listen to Captain America was also another lame comedic moment.<br/><br/>Hawkeye's arrows should have more explosive power in the city, and he should have been aiming the big targets rather than the small ones, such as the head and eyes of the giant whales. He seem weak in the movie. He turned into a swinging spiderman at the end before looking like a poor casualty because he could not properly break his entrance, which contradicts his character as a trained agent. I think Hawkeye fans would be more displeased with the portrayal of the character.<br/><br/>Black Widow should have a second round with Loki at the Stark Tower with the mind games since they both like to play with each others minds. But Iron man took her place to show Loki that his scepter could not work on him. It seems like another lame comedy moment.<br/><br/>Hulk was simply smashing everything. Nothing much. Captain America and Iron Man were their usual selves.<br/><br/>Thor was cool and not letting his character down. But his hammer should have punched a hole in the containment glass rather than leave a crack. Loki was a great villain, which was also obvious from the first Thor movie. He could win MTV's villain award this year.<br/><br/>Nick Fury looks too agitated at times. Bruce should be more like that.<br/><br/>There are indeed many exciting and entertaining parts in the movie, but nothing too much to brag about when it comes to the portrayal of some of the superheroes. This movie makes some superheros look good but others look lousy. The intention to make some of the superheros look fallible seems to end up making them look inaccurately portrayed.<br/><br/>My judging for the movie: Because of the lame jokes I will minus 1 point. I will minus another 1 point for Black Widow losing her cool in one scene. I will minus another 1 point for the confusing subplot involving Loki in the helicarrier. I will minus another 1 point for making Hawkeye not aim for the big targets and making him look like a bad victimized casualty after his ambitious spiderman-like crashing swing into a building.<br/><br/>Therefore I give this movie a rating of 6."
"asc85","4","7","18","26 May 2012"," Don't care what the masses might be saying...
","...this film wasn't good at all. With the exception of the excitement of seeing all these leading characters in one movie, I fail to see why everyone has been running and running to this movie. First of all, the acting is terrible, led by Chris Evans as a far-too-earnest Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth as a heavily accented Thor with dialogue that made sense hundreds of years ago, but not in 2012. Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Scarlett Johansson are decent enough, but no Academy Award nominees there. The plot and many of the sub-plots were difficult to follow, as the primary purpose of this movie was to show cars, buildings, and people being blown up. I understand that I'm not in this movie's target demographic, but the X-Men series and Iron Man were far more intelligent and interesting than this. Yes, I know this will be one of the highest grossing pictures of all-time, which is why I wanted to know what all the fuss was. Yes, I know there will be many sequels generated from this, which makes sense. Just count me out from going to see them."

","After I saw the trailer for the first time, I didn't have high expectations for the movie. I had the same feeling, that I had when watching the Transformer 3 trailer the first time. After reading all the euphoric reviews on the Internet, I decided to watch the movie tonight. I even saw it in 3D. The movie was just as bad, as the trailer looked. The villain Loki wasn't interesting or threatening at all. Whatever happened to a good villain ? The whole story was REALLY, REALLY WEAK. The whole story reminded me very much of Transformer 3, and was just as bad. I don't understand why so many people here praise this movie. If this is supposedly the best super hero movie Hollywood is able to make in 2012: Good night. I don't understand why it is so hard for Hollywood to make a great movie , with a really good, dramatic, epic story. There are so many good comic book stories out there, it can't be that hard to just turn them into a good movie. I was just as disappointed from this movie, as I was from Transformers 3. I definitely WON'T watch this movie again at the movie theater , or buy it on DVD. Hoolywood has become so boring, it's sad.

The audience wasn't born yesterday...<br/><br/>This movie focuses on the fight scenes. Technically, they impressed me (I counted 11 visual-effects companies in the credits!).

"frogambassador","8","6","15","20 September 2012"," Avengers Assemble - Review
","There are several reasons why this film fails as something a person should ever watch more than once. Firstly, there is a major lack of plot twists or changes to the story that might keep you on the edge of your seat; everything about the plot is insultingly linear and predictable and follows the most basic structure of 'goods versus evil' with a predictable injection of basic virtue and morals - in this case 'unity' and 'teamwork.' are clearly highlighted.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film manages to insult your most basic intelligence by showcasing unnecessary antics that are nothing more than fantastical nonsense. Think of an action scene and describe it in words; this is a way to bypass the lush graphics and realize that: a) while Iron Man is in space and is flying away from the portal, he somehow changes direction in the vacuum of space and returns through the portal. The Hulk, who cannot fly, jumps a few hundred feet in the air and catches Iron Man before bouncing off to safety. b) Nick Fury is violently gunned down, dusts himself down in time to evacuate the base. c) Captain America is shot down, dusts himself down and carries on. d) Black Widow, who also is incapable of flight, gives Captain America psychic eyeballing to communicate she wants to jump ten times her height into the air by bouncing off your shield so I can hijack a space-orcs flying motorcycle which is speeding towards us from a distance.<br/><br/>One could argue that it is not meant to be realistic and is mere entertainment. What becomes salient about Avengers Assemble is that there are no rules. The heroes never get stuck, never get challenged, they're never in any recognizable danger, there are no puzzles, any challenge is overcome easily and characters do as they please. No rules means no mystery, no interest and nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Finally, the antagonist was hardly foreboding to ever present a sense of danger or worry against so many heroes, all equal protagonists, all dreadfully dull - especially Bruce Banner."

"frezeframe","5","5","12","21 September 2012"," Highest no story rating ever!
","Ever seen one of those muscle pageants where they flex and flex and flex and flex... and then they come back on and flex some more? Well, that's kind of what the Avengers is like. Nearly every scene is a huge climax and it's just a wet dream of adolescent violence and fantasy- with no one being held accountable for any character actions. I knew there wouldn't be much for story going into the big summer Marvel franchise comic book blockbuster, but I did expect an attempt at story. Look at Spiderman or to a lesser extent, Transformers. Sure, they sucked, but at least they tried. A blockbuster movie should be like a play to some extent, showing subtext and depth, rather than just defaulting on raw special effects exhibition. Why? Because these Billion dollar franchises can afford to hire the best writers in the world. But they don't. They feel that their numbers, data and formula will make them more money than the tried and true Aristotle/Socrates methods of portraying the human condition in a three act structure. And they're right. Money trumps all, for the film industry is at the end of the day, an industry that bases everything on huge profit margins (one the largest margins in the history of mankind, in fact).<br/><br/>However, if you look at some of the masterpiece visual effects movies of the last few decades (which Avengers tried so hard to be), there is a common thread that puts them above the rest: They all engage in creative storytelling where characters are held accountable for their actions in some way, no matter what the level of fantasy is. That extra effort pays off in the subconscious and is the sole reason why a movie with effects alone can't give us the cerebral satisfaction of a Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings, Avatar, Aliens, or Terminator 2. These type of films are like a Broadway show, giving you big climaxes and well timed beats. You could say The Matrix would be more like a Cirque du Soleil. The Avengers is like the body building pageant(as the Avengers themselves are constantly trying to out flex each other throughout the whole movie).<br/><br/>I have a rule, regarding my 1-10 movie rating system: Any movie without a story can only score a maximum of 5 (flawless effects-great acting-no story, respectfully) This is not to say that all the writing was bad in The Avengers. The dialogue was actually quite clever- perfectly timed comic relief. It's strange that Hollywood is notoriously bad at delivering honest, unscathed human emotion and experience, but so good at delivering comic relief (one of the hardest things to do in all entertainment). Here's The Avengers story synopsis: All the leads are invincible- action, action, action- One of them has turned bad and tries to take over the world-action, action, action- he fails, but lives at the end to set up the sequel, action action, Roll credits. It literally plays like it was written by a 10 year old boy who plays with action figures in his back yard. (then spiced up by a team of ghost writers with well placed jokes and lots of Downey Jr. nuances) Wouldn't surprise me if that' what actually happened.<br/><br/>Is Avengers worth watching? Yes. The acting is great (except for Scarlett Johnasson- who is brilliant in her own right, but NOT a believable superhero). It's funny and very intense. Big action, big sound, testosterone, gunfire, some bow&arrow action, missiles, gadgets, rocket powered things, aliens, a nuclear bomb, martial arts sequences, gunfire, even a touch of romance. A man's movie, through and through.<br/><br/>But I'm not so sure. I think any good ""man"" movie should actually have in depth storytelling (The Matrix, Aliens, Aeon Flux) Why not go the extra mile, guys? Comic book movies should be held to the task especially, because it was good storytelling that made their franchise pop in the first place. Film is a different medium. You can't just expect everyone to know all the backstory- and make things bad ass for the sake of seeing something bad ass. You have to work at it a lot harder to tell an effective story in an arena where you are being timed to 2 hours of attention span. Avengers fails, just like most comic book movies. Sin City is a great example of effectively crossing over from comic book (graphic novel) into the film medium.<br/><br/>It would be nice if Hollywood spent just 1% of the 200,000,000.00 spent on a movie like this, toward paying a team of talented screen writers. Imagine if David Mamet had written this... or Aaron Sorkin? With all the money and power and technology and talented artists bursting at the seams (like the Hulk) to exhibit their skills... it just seems like a no brainer to show us what money can really buy.<br/><br/>So, it's a no brainer movie. Just really good eye candy and a few laughs."
"moritz-imdb-231-176485","5","5","12","23 August 2012"," Boring
","I have to admit, I am no comic book reader, but I have enjoyed a number of acceptable comic book movie adaptations (500, the first two Xmen, Spiderman, the first Iron Man).<br/><br/>This is not one of them. The story is boring and flimsy - Loki wants to subvert earth (why?) using a light cube called Tesseract created by earth scientists. (what is this- no explanation). The avengers who we mostly know from previous movies are assembled, but there is no character development or any interaction and - apart from some smart lines from Iron Man - no meaningful dialog.<br/><br/>The heroes first beat each other up, then they make peace, then they beat up bland Loki and his alien invaders - that's the story. Not really fascinating, is it?<br/><br/>The movies effects are OK, somewhat artificial in places, but not overwhelming. E.g. avatar was worlds above this.<br/><br/>To summarize: Boring story, bad dialog, mediocre effects - this is a predictable popcorn movie, unless you are a big Marvel fan, you can skip it."
"DCMarvel18","9","5","12","7 August 2012"," The Greatest Superhero Movie Ever!
","I've seen The Avengers about 5 times in theaters now, including the midnight premiere and I can say it is my favorite movie of all time and the by far the greatest superhero movie to ever exist. It even surpasses the legendary films from the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. It's a fantastic film all-around, and it has characteristics that any moviegoer or non-moviegoer would just love. The plot has Joss Whedon written all over it and that's how everybody loves it, with his other amazing pieces of work like Firefly and Buffy The Vampire Slayer. This is the first Marvel movie after its purchase by Disney, so that means amazing special effects and The Avengers doesn't disappoint with that at all. Being a hardcore Marvel comics fan, this movie is a dream. It also has a spectacular star-studded cast, Chris Evans returns as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, and Samuel L. Jackson as Sgt. Nick Fury, with new performances by Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and by far the fan-favorite and greatest performance of the movie is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. People were nervous about the new Hulk because they didn't know how Ruffalo would perform as the Hulk because Edward Norton played the Hulk in the most recent Incredible Hulk movie, but Ruffalo delivered a performance that none of the other cast could top and was the hit of the movie. The Avengers is a movie that no one can hate, I guess that's why it's the 3rd top grossing movie worldwide of all-time. So, unless you hate good movies and yourself, go see the biggest movie of 2012, Joss Whedon's masterpiece, Marvel's The Avengers."
"turtle-shells321","8","5","12","29 July 2012"," Good but probably the most overrated movie of the year
","I remember this being largely anticipated. I watched the Iron Man movies, so I was going to see this. It had lots of action, but the plot was a little weak. I also didn't understand why they took the villain from Thor and couldn't use someone like Thanos (which is rumored to be the villain for the sequel). Yeah, it had lots of jokes but most of them were too cheesy for me. The best jokes come from Iron Man. It gets a bit boring in the middle part. Overall, I don't think this is a bad movie but I don't think it deserves a spot on the top 250. You should also know I almost never give movies a 10/10. Also the fan base for it is a bit annoying but I should leave that out. The plot is basically a bunch of middle-aged superheroes coming together to fight one of the superhero's brother and his army of Skrulls or Chiatauris if you will. Ruffalo's performance as the Hulk was the best out of any of them, unfortunately there is no Hulk sequel planned for MCU: Phase 2. You should also now know that I've watched all the MCU films and own most of them on DVD. Overall, 8/10. You should also know that I don't hate Marvel and I love them over DC except when it comes to movies."
"Portaltech78","9","5","12","4 June 2012"," Not perfect, but good
","I, like many others, was waiting for this movie to come out, after all those previews at the end of the credits in several movies like Thor, Iron man etc. I have to admit they did a very good promoting of this movie, It made me want to see it more and more.<br/><br/>First of all don't get me wrong this IS a very action packed and enjoyable movie you should see on the big screen. I just think the story line was lacking and some characters was not up for this job and should have been left out like Samuel Jackson (Nick Fury),Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Loki looked weak and his pointy scepter he had was a ridicules prop that appeared weak and fragile. The rest of the cast was excellent, especially Iron man, Black Widow."

","I don't get why everyone likes it that much. It is what my parents call (big, bad movie) I agree with the big part but not so much on the bad part. It starts out with a dark energy research station somehow bringing Loki to earth, he makes a big mess and we have all the superheroes coming in. They capture Loki, he escapes, go to New York and fight people from another dimension. The End. As simple as that. Good Job special effects people! the main battle was great but lasted such a long time without anything but plain violence; I wanted to leave, predictable ending Loki's defeated,hooray. The only value of the whole movie is the battle scenes. Jokes are corny and unoriginal, you'll be disappointed if you want to know about the superheroes. Most people like it because they read the comics. I personally am a 2000nd's kid so its not so great."
"brookemcmahon00","10","5","12","29 May 2012"," MARVEL-ous !
","If you are a fan of action and comedy movies, then The Avengers is the movie I would recommend. The movie had my full, undivided attention from beginning to end, and considering it was a 2 and a half hour movie, that's saying something. It can be very difficult for a director to direct a long movie and keep the audiences attention, but I must say, this director did it, and well at that! It may seem like the typical hero vs. villain movie, but it has been the best one I ever saw by far.<br/><br/>Marvel has had many successful movies in the past like Iron Man and Captian America, except this time it included both Marvel heroes and many more.<br/><br/>So,if you are unsure about whether to see the Avenger or not, I highly recommend it!"
"stabb666","7","5","12","26 May 2012"," Avengers disassemble...
","I love the Avengers, in theory. Unfortunately, in practice I couldn't wait for this movie to end.<br/><br/>From the empty backstory for the 'bad guys', to a total lack of empathy for any of the main characters, I found this whole experience soul crushingly dull. Which is odd when there's an explosion or a fist fight every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>It would be quite annoying to work out the veneer-thin plot if not having seen some of the prior Marvel outings for Thor, Iron Man, et al, but there are some saving graces.<br/><br/>An almost seamless set of special effects does lend a sense of realism to the ridiculous scenarios that the heroes find themselves in. And with plenty of running time to allow each a fair chunk of screen time, it doesn't feel as if any one member is worth less than the rest.<br/><br/>That's part of the problem for me- with trying to squeeze an equal share for everyone in, it starts to feel patched together, losing coherence. When the flow begins to break up, my attention span begins to shorten. I start to not care about the events or their impact on the story, and instead just want to see the Hulk smash."
"devinnsmith","8","5","12","14 May 2012"," Pretty Friggin' Awesome.
","I was lucky enough to score tickets to a prescreening of The Avengers in my city. I'd loved all the other Marvel movies leading up to it, so I was really stoked. <br/><br/>The Avengers is the superhero movie we've been waiting for. Don't get me wrong, I love the darkness of other superhero movies, like The Dark Knight, but as Nick Fury aptly puts it: ""maybe we need a little old-fashioned"". And this movie is exactly that. Joss Whedon gives us precisely what superheroes used to be - extraordinary people fighting their flaws to become the saviors of the human race. <br/><br/>In all fairness, The Avengers is not a film that requires much thought. It's a beautiful spectacle, but it definitely does not possess Oscar-worthy performances. It's slightly campy and tongue-in-cheek, which is oddly refreshing. The Avengers never takes itself too seriously, which I think a lot of people aren't getting (hence some extremely scathing reviews on here!)<br/><br/>With the exception of Mark Ruffalo, every actor has gotten a chance to explore their characters in a previous movie, which adds to the ""easy-breezy feel"" of the movie. That being said, I thought Mark Ruffalo was a wonderful Bruce Banner -- I'd love to see him in his own movie. <br/><br/>The action is non-stop and the CGI is phenomenal. However, this is another case of unnecessary 3D. It's didn't add anything to the effects, except muddle them up on occasion when there was a lot going on. This movie could be shown normally and it would almost be better. <br/><br/>Believe the hype. This is an awesome movie. Joss Whedon did an fantastic job with the movie. I can't wait for The Avengers 2."
"fiskemannen222","6","5","12","14 May 2012"," I don't get the hype. Entertaining movie though !
","The amount of hype and praise this movie has gotten is out of hand. It's simply a blockbuster action-movie with superheroes. The plot is easy to follow; bad man wants to take over the Earth for some reason, gets help from aliens to do this, superheroes stop him/them. Of course, this is a bit general, and yes I know the names etc of all these people (beings?). Having had separate movies for many of these heroes (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk), we know these superheroes, their character and motives if you will. Not all the audience will have seen the previous movies, but it's not exactly a difficult story to follow, and we have seen the same plot 10000 times before, in different variations and in different mediums (books, comic-books, films etc).<br/><br/>You guys could see the movie or read about the whole synopsis right here, because I can't bother telling it in detail. Anyway, point is this; if you want to see a summer, blockbuster action-movie with lots of eye candy, then you have discovered the right movie. It's fun, enjoyable and with lots of action, naturally. If you're looking for a great story though, you might have to look somewhere else. There's really no surprising twists or complexity, no fear for the well-being of any of the characters, and in short, not a really interesting story to tell. <br/><br/>All the action-scenes are fun etc, but if an alien species invaded us, I would assume that they would have more potent weapons than some laser guns and huge fish-like robots that crash into buildings in Manhatten. Really, a demi-god like Loki and an advanced alien species are content with ravaging Manhatten a bit? Seems like we humans have better weapons alone in the atomic bomb, because one of those was enough to stop them. Yeah, and we have superheroes, three of which are severely underpowered and I don't understand why they were even there (Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America). Lame. Enjoyable and fun to watch, but bad story. Should get around 6-7 IMDb rating. Simply because it's a well-made action-movie blockbuster. No way this is among the best movies ever made, as it stands now in the IMDb ratings."
"DICK STEEL","10","5","12","30 April 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Avengers
","Although if I may add a little personal bias here, The Avengers is perhaps the Hulk movie that never got made until now, leaving the other two films starring Eric Bana and Edward Norton biting the dust. When Mark Ruffalo was announced as taking over the mantle of the gamma powered being with anger management issues, I'm sure many like myself would have been bewildered, but Ruffalo shows why he's the best Hulk just yet, and is a mean Bruce Banner as well. We get back to seeing Banner being a scientist, enlisted not for his raging abilities, but that of being the go to expert on gamma radiation. That doesn't mean he's a pushover when it comes to the crunch, and with Ruffalo being motion captured rather than having the Hulk purely CG, is something different, not to mention the countless of cool scenes the big monster gets himself into thanks to his powered abilities. In short, it's almost Hulk 3: Hulk and Friends instead.<br/><br/>But I digress. The Avengers finally made it to the big screen after all those stingers in the various Marvel movies gave audiences a tease for years. The wait is over, and boy, was it worth the wait. We welcome back the familiar faces in Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), as well as the SHIELD agents in director Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Coulson (Clark Gregg) and new addition Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), as well as bit roles to others such as Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Jarvis (Paul Bettany), Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) stringing all of them into a fit as the villain hell bent on enslaving all of humanity, with help from an alien race army of course. Talk about an ensemble cast!<br/><br/>And true to form, Joss Whedon devotes adequate time to almost all of the Avengers, and making this more like an extension of their individual films as we dwell a little bit more into the background and issues each hero face, some which we know of from their earlier arcs that thankfully don't get rehashed too much save for certain quick montage sequences. Tony Stark has just about finished his research on renewable energy, not forgetting a new version of his armour that we'd get to see here (the Mark VII), Captain America still finding his feet in the real world and showing shades of the leader he's growing into, and Thor continuing his bickering with half brother Loki that culminates into having him being sent back to Earth to take his villainous brother back to Asgaard once again. The quieter moments in the film provides plenty of opportunity for characterization, and Whedon doesn't disappoint in showing how well he's comfortable and knowledgeable about each one of them from comic folk lore.<br/><br/>And when it comes to what fan boys all over the world are clamouring for, Whedon doesn't disappoint when it comes to larger than life action that pits the Avengers either against each other, playing into the hand of Loki in his divide and conquer strategy, and when they finally get their act together to cooperate and save the world. The Team Ups here, either in twos or threes, is fun in every essence of the word, pitting each hero against each other, or when cooperating to address problems that require their unique, combined abilities. And there's always good natured humour around the corner when you least expect, some really taking you by surprise, yet is still keeping true to the nature of each character. If you'd think the bulk of the wisecracks come from Stark, well, think again!<br/><br/>Whedon also makes it a conscientious point never to rehash what had already been seen in the individual movies, but providing a lot more and expanding the scope from what had been done before. I assure you that you'd haven't seen the Hulk do battle like what he does here, easily becoming a fan favourite and stealing the thunder from the rest, and of course a lot more from Captain America whose own film saw a limited variation in his fighting abilities, as compared to what he finally does here. Thor with Mjolnir is another dimension and class altogether, while Hawkeye finally saw some battles of his own after his short cameo appearance in Thor where he didn't fire a single projectile. The biggest challenge and change of course was on Tony Stark, and it would be interesting to see if this change, about being less egoistical and self-centered, would translate into his next film as well. The final battle that took at least half an hour of screen time, is the Avengers comic book come alive in larger than life spectacle that's best seen in the IMAX 3D format.<br/><br/>So what's next? Iron Man 3 will blast off and be first off the blocks, then there should be another Captain America film that will showcase more of SHIELD. I guess maybe either Thor or Hulk may make a big screen return next, before getting everyone together again for another hurrah, hinted upon midway through the end credits, but which was mentioned would be a smaller film than this one. Let's wait and see, but in the meantime, get out there and enjoy this one heck of a ride! Definitely a film that fans of either hero will find irresistibly awesome and in a league of its own. More please!"
"krissaddy","10","5","12","30 April 2012"," If you miss this on the big screen, you will regret it!!! Simply Epic!!
","Firstly, I have seen this movie twice already and this is THE BEST Marvel movie, anybody else that says otherwise is either out of his mind, lying or hasn't seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>You may think that in a movie that consists of four characters who have their own franchise would do injustice to the two new characters in the movie, think again.... Black Widow and Hawkeye also have their time on the screen. But of course the best lines go to Iron Man and the most epic fight scenes go to the Hulk.<br/><br/>After watching the two Hulk movies I was a little disappointed only to the extent that they show him as this destructive and out of control monster which he is. But this movie makes you sympathize with him and even make you like him. In fact I felt that the fight scenes involving The Hulk were the best in the whole movie, followed by Iron man! I won hide the fact that I am a huge Batman fan, I find Nolan's movies head and shoulder's over other movies, but this movie is up in the same league. Highly polished character screen presence, well directed, amazingly witty, very very funny and above all visually captivating. I felt the run time was a little short actually. I just didn't want it to end. Considering people were clapping and yelling out their approval for some of the movie's topnotch scenes this movie will be a huge blockbuster which it thoroughly deserves to be. I am predicting it will be the next 1 billion grosser!!! This movie just raised the bar to a whole new level for Marvel movies. Seriously I was more eager for the release of The Dark Knight Rises but wow! What a show by Marvel and I would say full credit to Joss Whedon. You sir are just outstanding... The movie was tight and it didn't have any loose ends worth mentioning. First my favorite series of all time Firefly, now this, thank you, Joss Whedon!!! That was a mind-blowing movie. I will watch it a few more times! ;)"
"avaclub","7","5","12","30 April 2012"," The Avengers ‚àû Synonyms to Iron Man 3 ‚àû
","The First question- Does 'The Avengers' is a film of six superheroes? Answer is NO. The movie is heavily based on the power and skills of IRON MAN and later followed by Hulk; all other characters are just supporting characters adding no extra flavor to remember. Since Captain America, Hawkeye & Natasha don't have super powers they lacked the status of being a superhero as far as avengers is concerned. Even the possibility of emotional connects between Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Natasha was missing. Also Steve Rogers(Captain America) was struggling to make a presence with other super powers.<br/><br/>If one has to term The Avengers as Ironman 3 than it would not be possibly wrong because from the beginning to the climax it's he who holds the film either by his action or style or the dialogues (some of them are really cool). The auto removal of his iron-suit by robotic machines was kool and in a scene where Loki pushed him from the heights, the way his Iron suit came, auto activated and became his body-suit was awesome. Thou Hulk was entertaining but he came into his 'Smashing Avatar' only after half the way movie has past. The way he beaten up the 'Loki' after his comments of being a God was really enjoyable <br/><br/>But Joss Whedon, the director could have done better to balance out the movie in terms of introducing equally capable superheroes. Also first half of the movie gradually reaches to boredom with the introduction of superheroes; it's only in the second half that excitement moved to the next level. <br/><br/>When we talk about visual effects, cinematography, production value, 3D version or soundtrack all are good and worth praising. Regarding performances its again all the good humor punches goes along with Ironman which makes you smile followed by Hulk. Tom Hiddlestone as Loki and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha were impressive. Rest all were limited in role to mention.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good weekend watch especially for Ironman and Hulk Fans but may not live up to the hype created. Walt Disney is gradually learning to tap South-Asian markets by pre releasing the movies here after the debacle of John Carter(thou a good movie) ;Hope this will worked out.<br/><br/>Thanks & Regards AVA TheCritiqueLab.com"
"sivadigitalart","8","5","12","29 April 2012"," Super's epic adventure!
","Rating: 4/5 | Super's epic adventure.<br/><br/>The Avengers or Avengers Assemble is an eagerly anticipated Superhero film in 2012, which is written and directed by a cult film maker Joss Whedon, based on Marvel/DC superhero comics 'The Avengers' by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Starring Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel L. Jackson. The Avengers 2012 is the best and most entertaining Marvel Superhero films ever made for Super-fans and others. This movie truly fulfills audience expectations till the end.<br/><br/>I am not going to talk about the story here, because who cares about the script; it's just Supers at all. However it's a typical superhero plot where the group of American Superheroes are assembled together for a highly complicated mission and saving the earth from the bad guys who take over the world. What else it could be, it's understood that always Hollywood saves the world from bad guys. In this film Hollywood collaborates with Marvel comics and bringing together six of Marvel's superheroes including Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to face the supervillain Demi god, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). It is the best sequel ever made for Iron Man and Hulk. Especially the Incredible Hulk is the most Incredible vital character in this film. The second half of the film is moving fast due to the unlimited action sequences including motion captured CGI monster Hulk's smash-ups, O.M.G. I can't believe that this film made the Incredible smile! And he also makes you produce laughter.<br/><br/>The special effects and motion captured CGI are highly impressive and nevertheless the stunning action choreography is highly potential till the climatic battle. Overall everybody had done a good performance, in particular the interesting member in the crew Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) performance is good and holding the attention unique with wit. The Director and co-writer Joss Whedon has done a great job. Even though the script is not complicated much but he had constructed the characters well in the script and also he had changed their characteristics a bit like the Hulk. He had given everyone an equal opportunity in the film and made everyone radically distinctive in their skills. There is a bit of humor in this film, slapstick gags which is handled well and everybody enjoyed throughout the film. However, director Joss Whedon is quite innovative with unique comedy, and special effects which is always helping the narrative move forward. The protracted conversation for superheroes could have been avoided in the film; people won't expect the superhero to talk, so in my opinion don't make them talk much in the script.<br/><br/>Result: The Avengers is a Superhero film with dramatic action, thrilling adventure, fun, alien invasion, superheroes with super powers including ridiculous costumes and accessories, unbeatable smash-up collisions, high-tension action sequences with the spectacular special effects which are all combined together and leading us to the happy ending. Its truly worth watching and highly recommended for Marvel fans and Super-fans.<br/><br/>The Avengers: A-vengeance in 3D<br/><br/>Sunday, April 29, 2012"
"julian-mumford","8","5","12","28 April 2012"," Yet another high for the comic book genre
","The ultimate superhero mash up from Marvel Studios.<br/><br/>Following the huge success of Iron Man (Robert Downey Junior) and the relative healthy returns for the lesser known Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (now Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans), the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obvious.<br/><br/>Adding to the mix, we have tight leather clad Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner) along for the ride, following their brief appearances in the previous films. On Bad guy duties we have Loki (Tom Hiddleston), hell bent on creating a portal to earth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world, making him the undisputed leader of, well everything.<br/><br/>On paper this should not really work, we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers, origin stories, character arcs and so forth. Somehow writer and director Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Serenity fame, manages to create a cohesive whole. Each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun, no-one appears sidelined for too long. The ultimate tag team if you will, even Agent Phil gets his chance to shine.<br/><br/>Whedon is far to sharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious, for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture the balloon, audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriously.<br/><br/>Complaints, the film does feel long and there are shades of ""Transformers 3"" in the climactic scenes, have we not done organic alien monsters destroying skyscrapers? <br/><br/>The story is largely irrelevant, all the crew are called together by Nick Fury (Samuel LJackson) in full, ""hell yeah"" mode, to defend the earth against this ultimate threat. <br/><br/>Loki wields his staff with aplomb, initially stealing away Hawkeye and Selvig (Skellan Skarsgard). We know they are working for the wrong side due to their crazy eyes, until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery, or get bashed on the head, dependent on your medical training.<br/><br/>The effects are top notch, production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm grip on the material and belief in his characters. All participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes across on the screen.<br/><br/>Who would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play Comic Book heroes, how times and story lines have changed.<br/><br/>So to the characters. <br/><br/>Stark is just Stark, every mans wish fulfillment, rich beyond dreams, able to ignore anyone and everyone, good with the ladies but now settled with the radiant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Thor continues to talk in Nordic God like speak, which never gets old. The trusty hammer Mjolnir gets a good work out here, incidentally Natalie Portman's character is referenced but not shown on screen.<br/><br/>Captain America is tried and true, embodying a dependable ""old world"" can do attitude, which is a pleasant antidote to Iron Man's showy pursuits. Evans does well here, actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all the chaos.<br/><br/>Strangely the character that should not work at all, just maybe steals the show. The ""Hulk"" whose character development in real life now has morphed through three ""A"" list actors, is the obvious crowd pleaser. He also gets the best two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe, just a torn shirt and some cut off jeans.<br/><br/>The Hulk is played rather well by Ruffalo, bringing something to the role that Norton or Bana did not find. The big guy remains under wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry, he sure makes some mess.<br/><br/>Clearly the studio are thinking big, stay for the set up as it is clear the ""Avengers"" work is not done yet.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Yet another high for the comic book genre, post modern and self knowing in the approach, this works better than anyone might have dared to expect.<br/><br/>Big, loud, expensive comic book superhero mashup. Not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed for the spectacle on show and the obvious thought, care and intelligence invested in the series.<br/><br/>Recommended <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

","To start off, this is single handle the best film of the year hands down... Well until the dark knight but this movie is some serious competition. I had never heard of the director, Joss, until this film was made and to be honest looking through his film history i was having some doubts. Which i now take back, he has done a amazing job, He gives each character all the amount of time they deserve, He created intense and epic battles and very humorous moments to top it off.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, this movie is amazing not perfect but amazing and it is a must see no matter what whether you are a comic book fan or not."

","Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word ‚Äì Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well. Excellent 4/5"

","I saw this was 8.8 on IMDb and thought wow! I really should see whilst it's at the cinema. I really liked Spiderman 1 and the recent Superman, so I thought I'd really enjoy this movie as well. Wrong! This movie lacks any character development or suspense. It moves from event to event without any build up so there is no anticipation within the viewer. Nothing really bothers any of the avengers which makes the movie boring. I mean, Thor has an incredibly hard fall and when he gets back up his hammer hand doesn't work FOR A WHOLE 5 SECONDS! Next time the movie cuts back to his scene he's right as rain, so there's no opportunity for the audience to really care about what happens on screen as everyone takes it in their stride.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good, I went and saw it in 3D but I think it would be better enjoyed in 2D. There is a certain lack of clarity in most movies that have 3D applied post production. It's not bad, it's just not good enough (e.g. Like avatar was) to make up for the reduction in clarity and extra $3.<br/><br/>TLDR no character development or anticipation, gave it 5 for the special effects.<br/><br/>FTR I am a 32yo female."

","WHY-WAS-EVERYONE-SPEAKING-SO-SLOWLY-? DO- THEY - ALL -HAVE- A -SPEECH- IMPEDIMENT? This is a ghastly movie, the worst I have ever (partially) watched. I read the reviews for Prometheus which was not flawless but it was powerful and contained some outstanding imagery and it actually scored lower than this ( The Avengers) odious piece of crap. The acting was extraordinarily bad, the dialogue so witless and dim that it defies belief. I watched the first hour but was in danger of vomiting with disgust at any moment and so turned it off. Scarlet Johansen is a classy actress, what was she thinking, also Gwyneth Paltrow? Robert Downey Junior is a great actor who seems to always play in dumb movies- he's worth more than than. I heard good things abut this movie- what have we come to that people rate this garbage as entertainment?"

","Your typical modern action movie: all style, no substance. Plot is close to non-existent, or, at least, incomprehensible. Very jumbled, entirely because the writers wanted to somehow meld all the individual Avenger stories into one story. Makes for a contrived mess.<br/><br/>As expected, the special effects and action sequences are good. <br/><br/>Hard to compliment performances in an action movie, as there is very little real acting involved. However, Robert Downey Jr puts in a show- stealing performance.<br/><br/>On the whole, vastly over-rated (and this is probably a sign of how dumbed-down the general population is with regard to expectations for movies). The only positive thing I can say is: it's better than Transformers, but that says very little."

","Superhero movies have been the craze for a while now. Sure, they've always been around, but now they seem to be coming out in droves. Either a new hero to make a movie for, yet another sequel to an existing series (Batman 1-3, Spiderman 1-3, Amazing Spiderman 1-2, Iron Man 1-3, Captain America 1-2, Thor 1-2, and the extensive X-Men series to name a few), or another reboot. Yes, they are popular, but for the most part extremely formulaic. Other than Nolan's Batman series there is not much new in any of those movies, and the Avengers is no different. Maybe even worse.<br/><br/>Everything you expect to see in the Avengers, you will see. Some snappy one-liners from Downey Jr., explosions, an excessive use of CGI, good guys win, bad guys lose, dot dot dot. I think I've seen this one before. There is no creativity, no thought, nothing really. If you enjoy movies that require no thought, this one is for you.<br/><br/>And the hype? I put this up there with the Fast & the Furious, it's THAT bad, yet so many people seem to love it. Are we really that unimaginative and dull? It's only exciting if you can't see past the CGI and battle scenes.<br/><br/>If you would like to watch a 'superhero' movie with actual substance, Watchmen is a terrific example, they are the 'anti-Avengers' if you will. Enough with these cookie-cutter characters please. Don't waste your time on this one."

Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.<br/><br/>An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clich√©d nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality."

It has all the favorite clich√©s: 'the evil' that will destroy the world, we have typical jerk->hero transformation (with pseudo sacrifice) and all the others 'unpredictable' character evolutions... <br/><br/>I would call it a well-crafted movie. Action-scenes are good, dialog can be fun sometimes and the acting is nice. It just brings nothing new to the table and it is one of those movies, that you will watch and then remember a couple of scenes/lines from it and later on, you'll just remember a warm fuzzy feeling that it left in you.

"Uriah43","5","4","9","24 December 2013"," Extremely Uneven
","This is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points. For starters, I thought ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) and ""the Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo) were absolutely sensational. Likewise, most of the other characters were well played too. On the flip-side though the introduction of ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) was terribly planned and presented. Not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind. Not only that but his costume-or basic lack thereof-also stuck out like a sore thumb. Additionally, although I liked the CGI I thought it and the non-stop action were just too overwhelming. Even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them. This made the film look extremely uneven. Too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup. Be that as it may, this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess. All things considered then I think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film. Accordingly, I rate it as only average."

But to a viewer that want to be entertained by more than just cheesiness, this movie fails.<br/><br/>First of all, it commits a mistake that is pretty obvious to begin with, way too many major characters are tried to fit into one movie. We are left with some story lines for Hulk, Iron Man and Thor, the most major members of the Avengers, while Black Widow and that bowman are just forgotten.<br/><br/>The villain is also pretty forgettable, it's Loki that's back, and he's a spoiled kid that never really seem that powerful or impressive, compared to the avengers. I am not going to spoil anything, but it seems like he attempts to be a really clever villain, but just ends up as a spoiled kid.<br/><br/>The plot in general, is also pretty forgettable. It's standard, mediocre superheroes stuff, that you've seen a hundred times in superhero movies.<br/><br/>If you're a die-hard superhero or marvel fan, or just enjoy action and cheesy lines, then this is your movie.

"thematrixcbc","3","4","9","21 July 2013"," ...Not Fantastic
","I'm generally a Joss Whedon fan, but this film is truly awful.<br/><br/>Now, before I'm pilloried by the Marvel fanboys, let me explain why:<br/><br/>1.) The first hour of the film is spent gradually (very gradually, at points) reintroducing characters from the previous Marvel character films. Which this is to be expected, it happens not in any organic way, but in a very perfunctory, forced manner by introducing the crisis immediately as the film begins.<br/><br/>This is disconcerting for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because it leaves you very little room to go ""up"" from there. There's no build up to the introduction of the enemy...it's just there.<br/><br/>2.) For all of this often needless exposition, there is little, if any, character development within the first half of the film, which left me feeling cold towards any of the main characters - I just don't care if they die. Kill 'em all. <br/><br/>3.) Because the ""action"" starts at the beginning and doesn't really stop, every moment of exposition feels like it takes a year just to get going. What is often intended to be humorous, springy dialogue is delivered in scenes that are utilitarian, at best, and just leaden mill stones, at worst.<br/><br/>The script is well-written, and the actors do very serviceable jobs delivering their well-written lines, but the truth is that, because the movie started with action and kept going, no one really cares what they have to say.<br/><br/>Will it entertain some people? Yes. But...frankly, it's just not worth paying a monthly subscription to watch on Netflix, much less purchase it to own."
"mikecart1","7","4","9","4 June 2013"," An Epic Letdown
","Before I say everything that was wrong with the movie, I will first say that I am familiar with the comics and source material, and have thought all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far were decent. My personal favorite is Ironman 1, one of my favorite movies overall, because of the way it told the story and how it maintained more realism than the other movies in the franchise series of Marvel movies. Physics, engineering, and basic foundations of life were followed while telling the story of Tony Stark. Everything, while elaborate, seemed possible. Possible is the key word.<br/><br/>I grew up watching Bill Bixby be the Incredible Hulk with Lou and thought the show was awesome. I do know, though, that technology wasn't around the make Hulk be what the comic wanted him to be. The Hulk movie therefore was decent but nothing I am dying to watch again. Captain America and Thor were decent too.<br/><br/>So what was I expecting when I saw Avengers? I was expecting the 1992 Dream Team. I was expecting a movie that would be epic in every way where each character was maximized to their fullest while trying to solve a deep plot similar to The Watchmen or even the recent Dark Knight Trilogy. I got neither. The plot, in my opinion, was way too simplified and even worse, all the characters seemed to be more forgettable.<br/><br/>I will say some of the casting was quite poor and didn't flow with the original intent of the characters and some were just annoying in their roles. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, in particular, were very unwatchable even though like Lost in Translation and The Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>Overall, I can see how this movie made so much money. It is the perfect movie to take younger kids and comic book fans. It is actually even better for those that don't know the source material because they are coming into the movie fresh. However, this is no Dark Knight type of movie with the depth of plot, real-world story lines, or the perfect casting. I give it 7/10 and hope Avengers 2 is a lot better executed."

"makaylaspencer","5","4","9","7 April 2013"," The avengers assemble
","If you like your typical action packed superhero movie, The Avengers is the perfect movie. It has action, suspense, and humor with a touch of romance thrown in. It has amazing heroes, a great villain, fighting scenes, a rivalry between hero and villain, and an all-star cast. What it lacks, is originality. All superhero movies are the same, the world has been threatened in some way and a superhero must rise to the occasion to overcome the threat. The ongoing battle between good and evil, which isn't any different in this movie. What makes The Avengers different from other superhero movies is the compilation of characters. The world has been threatened once again and we need Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to come together and save us, as Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) plans to use a glowing cube called the Tesseract to open a portal bringing an evil alien army to Earth to help takeover. We have beat Loki before in the movie Thor, now he is back with a vengeance. Unfortunately if you have not seen these movies you will need to catch up as there is not a lot of back story on why these heroes were chosen. With everything going on you do not really get to understand the characters, especially why Loki wants to control the world. Even if you haven't seen them you know what to expect and can understand the basic storyline. There are no surprises, you can plot out the movie before you even watch it. Overall, I found the movie to be exiting, but explored way too many times. The whole idea of needing a superhero to come save us has been done before. Originality is what makes a movie great. Director Joss Whedon did a great job compiling different characters together into one movie. Even with amazing special effects and compelling characters, I believe he could have made a better storyline with more surprises. We should be walking away thinking, ""Wow, I did not expect that to happen!"" The world will continue to want heroes in their lives. In movies like The Avengers, we are given hope that good will always overcome evil. Which is why I'm sure they will be coming out with another one soon. I just hope to be speechless and amazed when it's over."

","Only thing I didn't want to end up with was that what if 'The Avengers' turned out to be Scavengers. I'm happy I didn't. Having solved the purpose of what most of the Indians expect out of a Hollywood action flick, 'The Avengers' did a pretty decent job.<br/><br/>With all the superheroes coming out of the 'Marvel's Comic World' to the Silver Screen, the film is a good deal for those who fantasize of ultra advanced 'reality possible' scientific machines and gadget, of men and women with extraordinary or superhuman skills; In short, for people who loved the 'Star Wars' and played 'Contra'. Also, the movie's like a platter. As you get to taste a lot too much in a single order. Featuring six superheroes, especially 'Iron Man' and 'the Hulk', it's a nice combination if you like to explore the Marvel Universe's fantasy. Though, I missed the Spiderman and Wolverine.<br/><br/>Talking of what all I missed, I certainly missed a bit of reason in the story. The story bores you in between. And with an exhibition of the superheroes, I definitely wanted a bigger Villain with some solid spine- wasn't there. I thought that 'The Hulk' and the 'Iron Man' had had better nemesis in their individual movies. Felt bad for the 'subdued' superheroes- Poor Captain America. <br/><br/>'A genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.' ‚Äì Iron Man aka Tony Stark's reply to Captain America. 'My secret is that I'm always angry.' ‚Äì The Hulk. With superb dialogs, the film amazes you with the gross action sequences alongside the proper pinch of humor- courtesy 'Hulk' and 'Iron Man'. Undoubtedly they both steal the show and mark a livelier presence on screen. Tony Stark's (Iron man's) wit makes you applaud. The 'angry' Hulk makes you laugh and you find his anger cute in two particular scenes. First one when he with Thor kicks some butts after which, when naturally standing, Hulk punches Thor out of the frame. Well, the Hulk had to vent his anger somewhere after all. Second was his reply to the 'Demi God' villain's claim of being what he was. It certainly reminded me the days when I played WWF as a kid.<br/><br/>With the commendable action in 3D; all perfect performances by Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man) , Mark Ruffalo(The Hulk) with very impressive act from Jeremy Renner(Hawkeye) the film is worth a watch as you get to spend some quality time with the ever so beautiful Scarlett Johansson as the red head 'Black Widow' while she's busy turning and twisting arms and breaking bones.<br/><br/>It's exactly what we expect from a Hollywood action film, though could have done better with the plot. With superb casting of all characters including Samuel Jackson as 'Nick Furry' it would secure a definite 3.5 out of 5 stars for me. My take: Go watch it."

","Avengers Assemble is incredible to say the least and I wasn't in anyway disappointed with it. Before I saw it, I decided to watch Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor so I'd be all prepared for it. I mean it's everything you'd want from a great movie: excellent action, excellent directing, an excellent cast of actors, excellent dialogue, excellent special effects and an excellent script. <br/><br/>I bet it was hard deciding on who would direct this movie with such high expectations but Joss Whedon, who created such TV series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, was the best choice and he directed it perfectly. I mean he didn't overdid like Michael Bay does with action movies. He actually had it well thought-out and the action really works in the movie. <br/><br/>It's amazing how you can take a bunch of superheroes from separate movies and come together to make one fantastic movie. Now all the actors did great, but I think Tony Stark/Iron Man is the life of the party because he's the funniest and coolest and Robert Downey Jr. is one of my favourite actors ever. Also Scarlett Johansson, one of my favourite actresses, is tough as she is sexy as Black Widow. And I like the different relationships between the characters. <br/><br/>In fact, in my opinion, it's ten times better than The Dark Knight because The Dark Knight was too dark and overdone. But I can't really decide whether The Avengers is better than The Dark Knight Rises because both movies blew my mind away!<br/><br/>But after seeing this movie, I've decided that I ought to get reading superhero comics because they're the original source and I love superheroes. But for the next Avengers movie, I'm really hoping that they put Spider-Man and Wolverine in even though most people say it's highly unlikely. But until then, I'll continue watching Avengers Assemble!"

Even if that was the soul purpose of the movie, not a lot of work was put into the performance of the main characters, except for the ones mentioned above.<br/><br/>Still don't know why Captain America and Hawkeye were casted in the movie, they have no soul importance.

Finally we found the perfect person to play the Hulk/Bruce Banner as Mark Ruffalo looks like a nerd and doesn't look angry in every scene like the other Hulks and made the Hulk look like a cool guy rather than the others who took it like it was a curse. Scarlett Johansen improves from her kick ass performance in Iron Man 2 to become a real person you would not want to make angry and proves to us she is in for more than just the good looks. Tom Hiddelston pulled of our villain very well and if you though he was cool in Thor he was even more cooler in this and probably the best villain since the Dark Knight. We couldn't forget Samuel L Jackson who no longer appears just at the end for a few minutes but finally brings together the avengers:)<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri even pulled of a great job with the soundtrack and could I dare say it was better than what he had for Back to the Future well it was WAYY better than the Back to the Future soundtrack and I never thought I would say that. <br/><br/>The Avengers is just the greatest film everr 11 out of 10"

"everafter_tales","5","4","9","19 September 2012"," Okay...but not for all
","First let me state that superhero movies of any kind are really not my genre of choice. I've watch enough in the past to know that when it comes to films and/or TV shows, superheros are not where my attention is most likely to be held. Be that as it may, I decided to give 'The Avengers' a try after numerous discussions with my work colleagues, and an internal battle with myself that anything even remotely touched by Joss Whedon could never be anything less than exceptional. <br/><br/>Sadly, the film failed to spark the fire within my inner super-heroin and I was left unimpressed. Don't get me wrong, I'm well aware that I'm one of only a limited few who were less than thrilled by the film and by all accounts, to a superhero fan, I'm sure it was amazing, but for me...<br/><br/>I think the main problem I had; and I feel it could be the same for others who didn't really enjoy: was a lack of understanding. For anyone who isn't a die hard comic book fan or hasn't seen the previous movies (particularly 'Thor')I felt that there was so much going on that I couldn't understand fully what I was watching. Thankfully the colleagues I mentioned earlier had the foresight to give me a little knowledge so I wasn't entirely clueless. I knew who were the good and bad guys but when it came to the plot I had no idea. <br/><br/>My advice to anyone who's going to give this movie a shot is to maybe do just a little research if you can. Maybe watch the different films (Iron Man 1/2, Thor, Captain America...) first so you can identify the characters who you spend two hours watching. It helps in this case to be prepared. <br/><br/>The one thing I did enjoy was the action. Deep at heart I like a good movie explosion as much as the next girl and on that front there was enough to just pique my interest, but as a majority of the good stuff happens in the last hour or so of the film, for me it came a little too late to save things. <br/><br/>I went in with the mindset that six superheros had to be better than one. I left with the mindset that Herny Cavill as Superman is my last ditch attempt to find some interest in the superhero genre."
"cherold","7","4","9","11 September 2012"," I was expecting more
","Based on the hype, I expected The Avengers to be one of those classic comic book movies that leave you breathless and amazed. Helmed by Joss Whedon, lead up to by several other comic book movies, I really thought this would be amazing.<br/><br/>But it's not amazing, it's good. It's about Iron Man good, which puts it a notch above Thor, a notch below Captain America, and several notches above Iron Man II and the Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>There's just not a lot to it. Captain America was a good movie because it delved into the character, but here the movie rarely goes deeper than the occasional witticism. The only character theme is some squabbling, but this comes across as kids on a playground (although it is entertaining to see the movie play the ""what superhero could beat what superhero game""), and resolves itself perfunctorily. This is not what I expect from Joss Whedon; it's what I would have expected from Whedon directly after he made the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the movie is not enjoyable. It does have some cool special effects here and there and it moves along at a quick pace. The performances are generally good; I particularly liked Mark Ruffalo's laid-back Hulk. It's got some very cute moments sprinkled in, although they feel a little lost among the endless battles.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, and if you want a fun popcorn flick this would be a good choice, but it's not a classic."
"bushtony","7","4","9","8 September 2012"," It's good for what it is..and what it is is OK by me...
","It's good-enough entertainment for what it is, and what it is is OK by me.<br/><br/>Ultimately a CGI superhero bun fight with lots of noise and eye-melting visual FX. Indeed, there is some significant measure of wit and gravitas in the principal performances and it's altogether, in summation, a very jolly, non-threatening and unchallenging exercise in popcorn artistry on a grand scale. And you know pretty much how it's going to end before it begins. So no need to worry about any of the characters or invest too much concern or emotional currency.<br/><br/>Worthy of all the hype, resultant adulation and strikingly impressive box office cash-cow achievement? Probably not. But then that's an impossible reputation to live up to. It's never going to be as good as it's made out to be in terms of most people's honest expectations - even if they feel they can't admit it - but then again, whatever is? The first hour is moderately tedious and draggy and takes it's own sweet time about re-introducing characters, thumbnail sketching them, and setting up the story. <br/><br/>A bunch of aliens are waging war on the world, coordinated by Thor's evil brother Loki. The world in this case is Manhattan. Why? Who knows. Just is. Only a brave but mismatched band of spandex-wearing, armour-clad, god-like or accidentally mutated super-dudes stand in their way. Not exactly original as narratives go, but it's only a hook to hang the CGI action on after all. It's not there to be inventive or innovative. Complexity need not apply in this particular universe.<br/><br/>The whole point is the action - a dynamic eye-candy sm√∂rg√•sbord of fights, explosions, gunfire, detonating machinery, devastation and mayhem in all it's high-spec CGI glory. A beautiful computerised cartoon of dazzlingly destructive technical wizardry. And on this score it delivers impeccably.<br/><br/>Kudos to the cast for instilling some crucial human elements into the characters they play, deftly aided and abetted by some astute dialogue from Whedon. The sly and self-aware way in which he overloads the exchanges between Stark and Banner with meaningless technological gibberish that he just knows is utter rubbish is very smartly satirical. Arch cardboard ciphers made self-knowing and appealing. <br/><br/>In terms of the characters, though, what strikes most is out of all of them the one who ends up being the most emotionally engaging, charismatic and sympathetic is the one who is a complete CGI render - The Hulk. Maybe this says something pertinent about modern cinema and modern movie acting. Food for thought, perhaps? <br/><br/>As superhero movies go, it's amusing, entertaining, watchable and spectacularly burns into the retinas with the best of them. Better than BATDUDE or SPIDERGUY? Subjective, but I enjoyed it more than a lot of the other stuff around. There are long stretches of boredom in most superhero movies, but apart from the (probably necessary) preamble, AVENGERS avoids the customary slog. The fact of the matter is that when superheros in superhero flicks are not doing their stuff as superheros in superhero flicks there ain't much of great interest going on. And it can bore.<br/><br/>AVENGERS is a Michael Bay movie with wit, charm, some heart and care and more of a brain in the driving seat. Whedon taps into the consciousness of the crowd in order to understand what makes a crowd pleaser. He's a smart guy who has studied the psychology and identified where people like Bay and Emmerich get it wrong, thus avoiding those pitfalls and getting it mostly right.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. I'll probably watch it again and enjoy it again. After that, though, doubt it will need a further revisit any time soon."

"marzblackmann","10","4","9","7 August 2012"," Avengers have assembled!
","After seeing this movie for the 9th time, I guess it's high time that I actually wrote a review of Marvel's Avengers. OK,just letting you know that there MAY be spoilers ahead! Read on at your OWN peril.<br/><br/>First, understand that as a comic book fan boy since I was 8,that this was a dream that had finally come true! The Avengers,earth's mightiest heroes had at long last become a film. Let me say,that my only fear was that it wouldn't live up to my expectations and I would be disappointed. Ladies and Gentlemen, it EXCEEDED them.<br/><br/>What makes this movie an enjoyable and entertaining experience? Well, you have to begin with the film's director,Joss(the BOSS)Whedon of Firefly,Buffy the vampire,and Serenity fame. You can tell when he scripted this,he has a love and admiration for the iconic characters. He himself,has written for comics too. The man knows his stuff. He knew what the not only the fanboys wanted,but also,those who weren't familiar with comic,NEEDED and that needs was entertainment! The story is a simple one.Nothing complex or deep,but it does it's job.However,it was a classic comic book plot,which I dug! I was impressed with the film's pacing. It didn't make me feel tired or anxious. The visual EFX were fantastic! The CGI on the Hulk,in this film,is the best yet so far!Impressive.<br/><br/>The cast! Well,wow!EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE,from Downey,Evans,Hamesworth,Ruffalo,Scarjo,Jackson,Renner,and on down just were fantastic. I wished that Hawkeye had a little bit more screen time,but being that he was being mind controlled by Loki(brilliantly played by Tom Hiddleston).<br/><br/>Lots of cool action too in this film! OH man!Classic comic book geekiness abound. I mean,we get to see Iron Man vs Thor for heaven's sake!The coolest scene for me,is seeing the big three(Cap,Iron man,and Thor)standing together amid the aftermath of aforementioned battle. The fight between Thor and the Hulk on the Hellicarrier was EPIC too.<br/><br/>So,what makes this a film that you should see? Well,honestly,it's a good solid piece of entertainment. NO,it doesn't have the serious realism of the dark knight rises or any deep thought provoking messages,but it's a film that you can take your family to if you want to escape the heat or stress of the day! This movie has a good balance of drama and humor. It kinda does remind me of Indepence Day too. It seems to have that unifying affect drawing together everyone no matter what race,religion or creed.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.It's worth the trip."
"faisal_khatib","9","4","9","11 June 2012"," The Avengers like someone on Twitter said, is the 'Star wars V (or was it VI?) of our generation'
","Two weeks after everyone else saw 'The Avengers', I finally got around to watching the film last week. A lot has already been told about it by the gazillions of reviews on the internet today. This review will get lost among all that noise so I chose to keep it short and simple.<br/><br/>Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings together a group of superheroes i.e. Iron Man () and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) along with SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to have a face off with a global threat posed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his army of Chitauri.<br/><br/>A run-off-the-mill story about the bad guy revealing himself in the first half by stealing something powerful; then the good guys get defeated in the first round to perform the knockout punch in the finale, with a post-credits scene promising a sequel. Where it stands apart is the brilliant execution on the part of director/writer Joss Whedon who not only manages to balance all the power packed characters into a dynamic package but creates what possibly could be the best adaption of a comic book into a superhero movie. He keeps the audience on the edge of the seat with intense action ranging from 'in your face' hand to hand combat and 'zipping around Manhattan' flying exploits.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. when not suited up plays Tony Stark with immense amount of ease and charisma. Chris Evans seems out of place, which goes well with his lost in time character while Chris Hemsworth seemed a little underwhelming in comparison to his solo film act. Samuel L. Jackson had more breathing space with a lengthier role which was good to see while Tom Hiddleston as Loki was impressive as the outnumbered villain.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was a refreshing change after the previous actors who played Bruce Banner, while the interpretation of Hulk was the perfect hurrah for this amazing comic character that's been long overdue. The respect it deserves on the big screen was a long time coming.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson sheds her 'Iron Man 2' eye candy role for something more in line with what you'd expect from the savvy spy - Black Widow. Unlike the trailers, Jeremy Renner had more to do than I expected which was pleasing and it would be great to see a film about the back story of Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson's character.<br/><br/>Background score, screenplay, cinematography, costumes, CGI were all top notch. Not a chink in the armor. Support from Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsg√•rd was more than adequate without turning into clich√© ridden monosyllabic characters that have plagued recent big budget films.<br/><br/>The Avengers like someone on Twitter said, is the 'Star wars V (or was it VI?) of our generation'. A must-watch in the theatre though you can skip the 3D glasses if you want because I doubt it would reduce the awesomeness that is the film."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","4","9","8 June 2012"," The biggest superhero spectacle yet, without losing focus on the characters
","It has finally been assembled. Marvel's decision to make ""The Avengers"" might seem like the superhero equivalent of the ensemble movie ""Valentine's Day,"" or the theory that stuffing multiple popular actors into one movie is an adequate substitute for storytelling and makes it so marketable that no one could pass it up.<br/><br/>While that's not necessarily not true of Marvel's super plan five years in the making, ""The Avengers"" means something more to comic and superhero fans; it is a culmination of a lifetime of anticipation that does in fact have a historical precedent set by Marvel Comics. Essentially, this movie is a collective nerd-gasm, but whether you're part of it or not, there's plenty to love about how geek godfather Joss Whedon tackles this gargantuan task.<br/><br/>Still, it's pretty amazing what bundling seven or so of the most beloved comic characters of all time into one package can do when it comes to creating an entertaining diversion. Many folks will nitpick at ""The Avengers"" script from now until eternity, but something needs to be said for the experience of being so awe-stricken that you couldn't care about those things if you tried. There's no shame in covering up ""flaws"" with entertainment, especially when you deliver that entertainment with a level of quality rivaled by few blockbusters of this scale.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" is a near-perfect execution of giving the people what they want. If you had to make a list of what you wanted from an ""Avengers"" movie, Whedon and Marvel would appear to have read your mind. The action sequences blow every previous superhero film out of the air, land and sea, the wit and humor come from more than just a series of punchlines or catch phrases, and all the characters get a chance to shine from an action and development perspective.<br/><br/>Story is secondary to achieving those goals. Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) power-obsessed brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has made a deal with an alien race known as the Chitauri to destroy Earth so he can rule it. He breaks into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals the Tesseract, an object at the center of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" that has the power to open a gateway through which the Chitauri can invade. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), realizing Earth is about to be at war with an unstoppable force, summons Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), a displaced Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor in hopes they can place nice and band together to stop Loki.<br/><br/>So you have high stakes (global destruction), and a force powerful enough to justifiably bring all these heroes together. That's all you really need. The script properly gives each hero reasons to fight and a personal journey, something to overcome. All this for seven characters in a 140-minute runtime. Even though we're building up to yet another movie climax that involves the destruction of a major American city by hostile alien forces, it's still this unique grouping of characters that changes the whole game.<br/><br/>As someone who seems to specialize in creating projects that develop cult followings, Whedon was really a perfect choice to write and direct. Despite what one would assume to be a lot of pressure, you never get the sense that ""The Avengers"" is trying too hard. The balancing act of all these characters might have seemed too tall an order for any one man, yet with actors really dedicated to the souls of their characters, Whedon and the cast pack in so much into even the smallest of exchanges.<br/><br/>One character the movie excels at in particular is The Hulk. Ruffalo commands the role of Banner as if he was the one who played him in the first two ""Hulk"" features. The script paints him as the team's secret weapon, but also as the most volatile link in the chain. Some fear the green monster, others (Tony Stark) try to provoke him. Either way, despite sharing screen time, this Hulk is both more brutal and emotionally accessible than ever before. More than any other character, you'll end up most curious about what Marvel might do with him next.<br/><br/>In general, the lack of time needing to be spent on plot development gets rationed off to all the characters, allowing the third-act action to pay off in more terms than simply eye candy. Each hero has a personal story arc or obstacle to overcome, whether its Tony Stark proving he can set aside his ego or Captain American understanding that he can be relevant in the 21st Century.<br/><br/>With so many heroes in one film, Hiddleston had to bear a ton of weight as Loki, creating a presence that could balance out all these good guys. Although not much of a physical threat, his The Joker-like move to allow himself to be imprisoned gives him the fuel to be cunning and unpredictable in performance and in actuality.<br/><br/>From a pure entertainment perspective, ""The Avengers"" should be considered king of all superhero movies. What it lacks in thematic and character depth it makes up for with action and humor. Whedon writes so expertly around clich√©s and identifies ways to make the film naturally funny, and the way the action scenes are edited together, there's no confusion in regard to what's going on despite the chaos of the Chitauri invasion scene.<br/><br/>Marvel deserves all the credit in the world for building to this point and delivering precisely what fans wanted. Although anyone can enjoy this romp, not just those who saw both ""Iron Man"" films, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America,"" there's no doubt the legwork in those films makes it so much easier to enjoy the entire dynamic of ""The Avengers."" What a momentous achievement from a business, filmmaking and audience perspective.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com"

","Just got back from seeing the Avengers and have to say that I enjoyed it. It had a non- stop feel and some of the best action sequences I've seen. Is it a great action movie? Absolutely! Is it one of the best superhero movies ever? I'm not an expert in the genre, but I bet it is. Was it one of the top 50 overall movies of all time? No way!<br/><br/>I was really shocked when I saw an IMDb rating of almost 9 for this movie and I'm hoping that over time, cooler heads will prevail and bring the movie's rating down into the 7's where it likely belongs.<br/><br/>I found that the writing was fine for an action movie but I certainly didn't lose myself in the reality of it all. There were a number of sequences where the dialogue and interactions of the characters was not believable or compelling.<br/><br/>I apologize to those who would quip that dramatic dialogue and characters with whom the audience can empathize don't belong in this type of film but I think they do and I'm sure we'll see it someday.<br/><br/>Go see this movie - well worth the trip to the theater to see it on the big screen. Savor the amazing special effects and action scenes that are so well put together. Please don't suggest that the film ranks with some of the all time great works of art that have made it to film."
"ganeshsubramanian","9","4","9","21 May 2012"," Absolute entertainer from start to finish
","I watched this movie in India while on a stint there. The audience was mostly adult groups. I'm not sure how much the crowd knew about Marvel or it's comic book characters but I can surely say that they loved it. I was extremely enthralled to see all the superheros in a single movie and it far exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Of all the characters in the movie, the one that I was impressed most is the ""HULK"". Mark Ruffalo played this character to perfection. No other actor might have done this role that excellent as Mark did. The portrayal of a human side to a person considered superhero (as repeatedly demonstrated by HULK) is what endears me to HULK as my favorite comic book character ever.<br/><br/>RDJ, the Chrises (Evans and Hemsworth) were impressive as well. The roles of Hawkeye and Black Widow could have been enlarged a bit more and Renner and Johannson respectively played it with aplomb. The Villain as played by Tom (Loki) could not have been any meaner.<br/><br/>The screenplay fitted with witty lines and laughs thrown in between proved to be great as well. My hearty kudos to Joss Whedon for bringing together a spectacular show on screen. The music from Alan Silvestri was appreciable too.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the sequel very soon... and the next one should definitely have Spider Man and X-Men as well to make it more entertaining than ever...<br/><br/>Ganesh."

","Saw them all, Iron Man 1 & 2, Captain America, Thor, Hulk (both of them), and anticipated the arrival of the Avengers, and man, what a fun movie it was. Thought the way the set them all up was executed very well. Didn't really have a back story going into the movie about the Black Widow character, but her opening scene sufficed. Thought the 'Hawkeye"" guy was a cool character but didn't really see how he was a super hero in a sense, if that makes any sense. Hulk, Captain America, Thor are definitely genetically super heroes, and Iron Man is by ways of modern technology, but come to think of it, Black Widow is just a real devastating woman who stands on her own and Hawkeye is also kind of just a guy that's a real good shot, but end of the day, they'd all be great back up if non-friendly aliens came down for a visit. Not wanting to give away the story, just like to add that the length of the movie didn't bother me at all, the character development and was loads of fun. Really enjoyed getting to know characters again."

Tom Hiddlestone does justice to this character in a way that truly signifies a real god of mischief. Scheming and plotting with thoughts and plans coming at split second intervals, Tom Hiddlestone still gives his character that dynamism of a brainiac with deep inner pain that you'd think could boil over at any moment.<br/><br/>Mind blowing movie for a super hero generation.

"lewiskendell","9","4","9","14 May 2012"," Most entertaining movie I've seen so far this year.
","I loved Iron Man and Thor, enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger, and was slightly disappointed in Iron Man 2. But even the best of those movies were just a lead-up to The Avengers, which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies, and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind, that I've seen.<br/><br/>This is pure summer blockbuster fun. And I don't mean that in a way that limits the movie, but instead as an example of the best of what a summer blockbuster can be. The story is rather straightforward: a massive threat to Earth that's too big for any of our heroes to handle alone, and a rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as a team. It's clear, easy to follow, and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum. The Avengers feels like it's the perfect length, with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacing.<br/><br/>What struck me most about it was the humor. It carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes, the well-handled exposition or the interplay between our heroes. The Avengers is outright hilarious at times. The laughs are woven organically throughout. The tone of the movie just feels right, which is probably the best compliment that I can give it.<br/><br/>I must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the Earth's mightiest heroes. Marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for The Avengers the past few years, and it paid off. And it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it. Can't wait for Avengers 2!"

From my view there was much of a 'conflict', just a difference of techniques or views. Second problem I have with the movie is that it was too short and there wasn't any cameos of any other characters that could have been involved with the film. (no spidey or wolverine or fantastic four involved in taking out an invading force?) Picky I know, but so much was great with this film, trying to find something bad with it was much harder."
"s_quinland","9","4","9","6 May 2012"," Assemble for a FABULOUSLY Fun time!
","(SPOILERS) Comic Book movies should ALWAYS be written and directed by people who love comic books. Joss Whedon's genuine love for the genre comes through in every frame of this blockbuster. There is something for everybody; it is an over the top, energetic thrill-ride, funny and totally fun movie. Rather than treating the characters with deadly seriousness or turning them into jokes in tights, his respect for the disparate back stories as already told in the preceding movies (Ironman, Thor, and both Hulk attempts), shows though and he somehow manages to bring them together in a totally believable and yet still 100% comic-book way.<br/><br/>He also understands that aside from the absolutely amazing (WOW!!!!) special effects, this is still a character story at heart.<br/><br/>In a less complex director's hands, you could just have The Avengers all be perfectly reasonable and noble, and have Fury send out lovely engraved but cryptic invitations (which they would all politely accept), sit them all down around a round table and explain that Something Big and Bad is out there and they must, virtuously and selflessly, sacrifice their lives to the Common Good. And they would of course, being heroes, immediately acknowledge their moral Duty and, already being suited up in their cute costumes with capes and leather and tights and armor, begin the Battle for Earth without even stopping for lunch. Of course they win. Heroic Music swells and the credit roll.<br/><br/>That's the way someone who doesn't really understand the genre may have approached the film.<br/><br/>Not Joss. Our Heroes come from all over the place and only one is already on board with the Avenger Initiative. The rest have to be¬Ö persuaded. So how do you get all these guys in the same room and playing nicely on the same side when one had been brain-hijacked, one doesn't believe the cover story, one doesn't even want to be there, one is certain this is simply a personal fight, one has nothing left to lose, and one super-spy-intelligence gatherer is being pulled into an epic war with superior firepower? Do they all just suit up because Nick Fury tells them to in a deeply rousing and inspiring speech? Nope. They walk away with varying degrees of disbelief and I-Have-My-Own-Problems attitudes and snipe and snarl at each other, bicker and fight like a bunch of siblings in the middle of a Testosterone War (apologies to Black Widow).<br/><br/>And when Superheroes fight... Well. Let's just say things get broken up a bit. They only begin to work together when everything is falling (literally) apart. I guess falling to earth in a broken¬Ö. (insert major spoiler here¬Ö nah, not gonna do it!)¬Ö will do that to a team. Of course they weren't ALL on board the *********, but they all did literally succumb to gravity in their own way. Everyone gets knocked on the head a bit, shakes it off and realized they had better Do Something.<br/><br/>Working in pairs at first, then cross teaming, they finally get to the point where Captain America is calling the shots with all the assurance of a broken military general who is finally in his element and completely understands his troops. Only then are they The Avengers.<br/><br/>But they still annoy each other, maybe just a little.<br/><br/>Within the scope of the main Save the World from a Terrible Menace plot, there are smaller interwoven stories, many character reveals, and of course, as this is a Joss Whedon project, completely believable and absolutely hilarious humor sprinkled throughout.<br/><br/>The Big Bad, Loki, is as complex as any other character, and is much more menacing than in the Thor movie; less, dare I say, comic book two dimensional. In Loki's determined and demented quest to be loved, feared and revered, even he understands on some level that he is manipulating forces that he cannot completely control, but he continues to play his part in the game with a grim determination and certain maniacal glee at the thought of beating his step-brother down. Who cares about the puny humans; they are ants, he is the boot.<br/><br/>There is a lot of fighting, amazingly realistic effects, spectacular settings and many surprises. A few questions are answered and some more are raised. My biggest question has to do with the Hulk, if the end is true, then why the first time?? Hmmmm. I have a theory, but will see the movie again tomorrow to see if it bears out.<br/><br/>Quibbles were few and were drowned out by the completely immersive FUN of the overall experience. And as we learned from the other Marvel movies, stay until the very end of the credits. Something happens, and then later, a small, but funny scene. Just stay. And see if you can count just how many special effects companies were involved! I saw it in a regular 3D (IMax was sold out¬Ö *pouts*) in a nearly sold out theater, and suggest that you see it in 3D, too. I can't believe that Joss has never filmed in 3D before, it was handled MASTERFULLY.<br/><br/>What a ride... I can hardly wait to see it again!"
"strayxxdog","10","4","9","6 May 2012"," Amazing Movie- Worth watching 50 times
","I was STUNNED by the incredible performance. Its an amazing movie and all of you HAVE TO WATCH IT. Its very funny and is action-packed. The hulk and iron man has to be one of my favorite characters. I usually don't like a lot of movies because they're predictable and boring but you have to take my word on this- The Avengers is one of the best movies I've seen this entire year. You will not regret putting your money into watching this. The graphic was very detailed and it looked very realistic and the story line was fun and it will keep you in your seat for the entire time. I had to hold in my pee because of this. You don't know what you're missing out on!"
"alanrayford","9","4","9","5 May 2012"," There can be no going back from this.
","It once seemed like Hollywood would never realize how profitable comicbook to film adaptations could be if handled properly. But, eventually, they came around. Since then, superheroes and villains have been setting the Box Office ablaze. But, there's always been one problem with these summer season mainstays.<br/><br/>All of the characters were isolated in their own pocket universes. We could never see Spiderman kick back with the Human Torch. Superman could never run across Green Lantern. Well, here comes Marvel's the Avengers (MtA) to do away with this shortcoming. From here on out, there can be no going back.<br/><br/>The plot to MtA sees Loki (Tom Hiddleston), partnering with a maleficent race of beings to conquer Earth. Nick Fury (Sam Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., takes issue with this and, thankfully, has a contingency plan up his sleeve called the Avenger's Initiative.<br/><br/>Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) come together, with some wrangling by S.H.I.E.L.D., to stop Loki. But, before they can work effectively as a unit, there are a few bumps to be smoothed out.<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes of MtA leads to several instances of one constant of superhero team-ups. That is before they can work together, the good guys have to kick each others asses for just a bit. These hero vs. hero battles are tremendously satisfying. Thankfully, the reasoning behind all of the inter-Avenger bouts is also sound. So you can sit back and enjoy the visuals without feeling as though you have to turn your brain off.<br/><br/>When Loki escalates his plan, however, all differences are put aside as the Avenger's assemble. During this final act, every member of the team gets their moment in the spotlight. One, who happens to be green, gets several.<br/><br/>A particular highlight for me was a bit between the Hulk and Loki that played like something from an old Warner Bros. toon. Anyone who's seen the movie knows what I'm talking about. Besides that, there's Thor calling down thunder, Captain America laying an up close smack down on the baddies, Iron Man zipping and dodging through the urban chasms of NYC and Black Widow and Hawkeye sniping hostiles and snapping necks. If you find yourself feeling anything less than 100% involved with what's happening on screen, consult a physician or check the power level of your positronic heart‚Äîsomething is clearly wrong with you.<br/><br/>When the dust settles, the bad guys have been thoroughly trounced. The good guys are all on good terms as they ride into the sunset. Nick Fury is still looking like the zenith of cool, and things are set up for the, as of yet, unannounced sequel. In short, MtA did its job admirably.<br/><br/>Every actor brought their character to life, special recognition to Ruffalo and Middleston. Ruffalo was able to take a character that's been portrayed by four different actors (Bixby, Ferrigno, Bana and Norton) and still lend it enough pathos to make it his own. Instead of being evil for evil's sake, Middleston's portrayal of Loki depicted a tragically flawed being, driven to the brink of insanity by living in the shadow of his brother.<br/><br/>With the introductions relegated to the solo films, the script was free to move along briskly. At the same time, it was never afraid to slow down and flesh out details that, otherwise, would've left things feeling disjointed. The SFX were superlative. The Hulk not only looked better than ever, his face resembled the actor playing him. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier looked surprisingly plausible. The hostiles looked imposing, and their flying behemoths were terrifying. But the major contributor to this movie's success, I feel, is Director Joss Whedon. The guy was able to take the reins of four separate franchises, simultaneously, and never once lose control. I thought such a feat would be impossible for a single director to achieve. I still think so, unless the director happens to be Joss Whedon. There's no rulebook for helming a project like this. Yet, he still hit a homerun‚Äîkudos.<br/><br/>MtA does have its snags. The first is if you had a problem with Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk or Thor in their solo films, you'll have the same problems with them here. I took issue with Captain America.<br/><br/>I gave the First Avenger a 10/10 on this site because I had my head up my ass and didn't notice what a fanboy I was being. Well, the deficits in that film translated to this one. The good Captain doesn't feel anywhere near as skillful or formidable as he should. There's a scene where Roger's, sans shield, is pinned by machine gun fire. In the comics, the gunman would've been eating that weapon in three seconds flat. But, this isn't the comics. As the scenario played out, complete with Rogers picking up a weapon and unsuccessfully returning fire, it made him feel less like a super-soldier and more like a regular guy in blue spandex. Yes, in the final act he got a chance to shine. But it did little to balance out how poorly he'd fared in the proceedings up to that point. The second problem I had was a minor one about Rogers' new costume. The red, white and blue stripes should completely wrap around his waist. Without that, his costume looks like blue long-johns from behind.<br/><br/>Regardless, Marvel's the Avengers is a really fun, enthralling ride that needs to be seen to be believed. After four years of careful maneuvering, Marvel was able to successfully deliver this first of a kind film that actually lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>ALSO: If you liked MtA, be sure to check out Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. It's an outstanding animated-series that further fleshes out the world these characters call home in a way live-action simply cannot."
"Dragonsouls","7","4","9","5 May 2012"," I'm a satisfied Avengers fan, although find it hard to overlook the flaws.
","I'm writing this review from the perspective of an avid comic book collector, and Avengers fan.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the action in this film, from every one of the main characters. They fought like they do in the comic books, especially Captain America. It seems as if he had plenty of time to practice with that shield of his, the choreography of his fight scenes were better, and he showed the agility and super strength this time out. Chris Evans was very solid in portraying him, and acted like a true captain. Very authoritative.<br/><br/>Even Thor used his hammer to its full capacity, making the most out of it. He used it to absorb and block kinetic energy, dish out energy in return, and he just felt more powerful than he did in his introductory film. He was a bit too serious in the film, gone was that positive attitude though.<br/><br/>Iron man was his usual self, mostly there for comedic elements. Sometimes, it took away from the solemn tone of the action scenes, there were just too many jokes in the heat of battle and found it hard to laugh at times during his jokes. One thing I loved about his fighting scenes was how he used Captain America's shield to deflect his beams. So, so cool. Well choreographed! Now, the Hulk. In a nutshell, well, he stole the show! That's all I'm going to say. He looked so much better then he did in his film just several years ago, my how technology progresses in such short time! Now, the supporting cast did OK, Black Widow got more screen time then I expected. She is fun to watch, a great tough actress Johansson is. As is Renner, too bad he was limited in his action. I won't mention the other performances by Paltrow, Jackson and Skaarsgards...they were all just solid and short.<br/><br/>Plotwise, well, nothing that complicated. It was a sublime story, but simple when looked above the surface. Aliens invade through a Stargate/Wormhole. Dark and evil energy is brought forth by the main Protagonist, who was fantastic as usual. Hiddlestone was just as menacing as he was in Thor, a fine actor indeed. Acting wise, he stole the show, and threatened mentally more than physically. That is rare in a Marvel film.<br/><br/>Now, if a Marvel film would only have a top name directing it. I mean, DC movies get the best directors, Donner, Burton, Snyder, and Nolan. Am I missing one? The Avengers felt too confusing at times, a comedy for the most part, yet, having the violence and action of a war film. I didn't like that. And as for the 8.8 score and fantastic reviews, well, I can't rate a movie above an 7 if its missing a good soundtrack. Perhaps less CGI and a good composer would add more emotion to the film. I found that The Avengers lacked in emotive substance.<br/><br/>Go see it though, it's a hell of a roller coaster ride and one of the best comic book adaptations ever."
"Willie-12","8","4","9","4 May 2012"," Very Impressive And Well Worth The Wait
","It has been a long time since I've anticipated a summer movie season as much as I've anticipated 2012's. And what better way to kick it off than with one of the most anticipated movies of...well if not the decade, then at least the last 5 years. The Avengers was a very impressive accomplishment by Joss Whedon, and it was well worth the wait. This is one of those movies that had its work cut out for it for quite some time. This was going to take some skill as a movie-maker. How in the world would anyone be able to bring all of these larger-than-life characters together in such a way that it would not seem too jammed packed and jumbled up for its own good? How would all of these heroes be showcased in a movie that is almost all main-character and lead actor? And to answer those questions, all I can really say is this: I don't know. And after seeing the movie, I still don't know. All I know is that it was done, and it was done very well. I have to admit, when I found out Whedon was going to be at the helm for this one, I had some doubts (which, I'll admit were only based on my lack of attention to most of his work as a writer). However, after seeing Cabin In The Woods a few weeks ago, I saw what Whedon was able to accomplish with what was, technically a film that goes into the horror genre, but really was one of the best and unique films I've seen in a long time. And even though he was only a script writer for Cabin, anyone who knows anything at all about screenplays knows that that was one that was penned by a very talented and creative guy. So at that point I was more than convinced that he could pull off something great with The Avengers, and after seeing it tonight, it's safe to say that Whedon was certainly quite up for this task. If you love movies then go see this one. It has the action, it has the acting, and more than anything (and is so important when it comes to a film like this) it has the story and script. This is the quintessential summer movie that everyone hopes for. But, and this is the good part, it's also got so much more that makes it so much more than the quintessential summer movie. So, the summer movie season has officially arrived. And now, the rest of the season has its work cut out for it."
"stickmanscooby","10","4","9","1 May 2012"," Avengers Who would of thought it was going to be so Funny (Hulk)
","Some People watch comic/super hero movies and at the end talk about all the faults not me I just want to point out all that made this a kick ass fully entertaining action/comedy movie for all ages. first of all the cast worked perfect we new Robert Downey Jr. was a character(bad ass) in iron man but it shines in this movie with his witty one liners some mite say cheesy but no way not if your iron man to mix that in with the seriousness of Chris Hemsworth as Thor and team leader Chris Evans as Captain America worked like a dream as you will see half ways thru the movie. Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk was a good choice(keep it this way seen so many playing Bruce in pass movies and he is by far the best) and very believable, hulks C G I was above and beyond and funny ill say no more lol. If ya get tired of looking at all the men cast in this movie don't worry Scarlett Johansson is so hot in this it makes up for the lack of woman (just rent transformers dark side of moon if looking for a bunch of models all over the place)in this she does a great job at looking great but also kicking ass just as hard as Jeremy Renner who also does a great job playing Hakeeye actually it was good seeing him in action have not seen him in as much action movies he was OK in mission impossible but glad to see him in a lot more action scenes now that he is going to be taken over for Matt Damon in the new Bourne movie Matt has moved to a zoo. OK gone of track all I can say to round this movie up is its Action Packed Cheesy good and Absolutely Priceless in Scenes. SPOILER was waiting for some surprise at end like they did with there character movies but i think the only thing was Starks building had just an A lift on it and he was redesigning his building :) FIRST REVIEW"
"gillman11","9","4","9","1 May 2012"," Nailed It!
","So, I've seen it twice now and I'm still finding it difficult to articulate just how great this film is.<br/><br/>Usually, with films that are heavily promoted and feature characters that I carry a nostalgic reverence for, there is a fear that I'm going to dislike what has been done with it (and the older you get the greater the reverence for the formative years). I'm certainly carrying this trepidation as the release dates for The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises close in (although in truth, I'll pay to see anything involving Spidey or Batman at least once).<br/><br/>Not so with Avengers. I wanted to be there on the first day ‚Äì Marvel Studios have proved their ability to translate their characters into cinema more than adequately with the wit and irreverence that made Marvel my true love during my younger days. All of the Marvel movies to date have been exceptional in their own ways, even the weakest of them (Iron Man 2 imho) had more than enough action and humour to make spending a couple of hours in their company a great way to live your life.<br/><br/>With this in mind, Joss Whedon seemed an inspired choice to manage the first big screen outing and I'd been eagerly awaiting The Avengers since the post credits scene in Thor and my inner twelve year old was giddy with excitement at the teaser after Captain America.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was just how good it was going to be. And I still can't articulate why but here's a list of elements:<br/><br/><ul><li>It is the best parts of all the other Marvel movies multiplied by 1000.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The characters are all well cast and the actors seem to be enjoying their roles ‚Äì RDJ isn't allowed to steal the show, Hemsworth keeps up the good work, Evans finds the humour in what could be a dry role it, Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson, Scarlett is filmed from behind in figure hugging leather and gets a character that has the intellectual strength not to have to kick ass to kick ass (if you know what I mean). Jeremy Renner does his best with the weakest written role and only has a couple of scenes to shine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is revelatory. And Tom Hiddlestone? Dude was born to play Loki, he is terrific.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A plot that makes sense and seems to propel itself forward without the need for any artificial nonsense (although, I'm sure we'll see the joins through its multiple DVD viewings, on the big screen it works and works well).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Action, action, action. 142 minutes in the blink of an eye.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>HULK! - not too much dwelling on the downside of having a big green rage machine living inside you but proper glee in the smashing potential when it's appropriate.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Quotable lines aplenty: ""I'm going to put you on hold for a second."", ""He's adopted."", ""Mewling quim."", ""¬ÖI'm always angry."", ""Hulk? Smash."", ""Puny God"".</li></ul><br/><br/>It's awesomeness writ large on the big screen. Joy. Cinematic Prozac. <br/><br/>And yeah¬ÖI have a girlfriend, she loved it too. So did my three kids and my ex wife is sick cos we're all raving about it and she hasn't seen it yet.<br/><br/>The biggest compliment I can pay it? I am envious of those people who haven't seen it yet, I want another first time.<br/><br/>And I want a Lego Helicarrier Escape playset! <br/><br/>Dammit, I shouldn't have written this, now I want to see it again."
"hellava_goodguy","10","4","9","28 April 2012"," THE AVENGERS: assemble and watch (NO SPOILERS)
","Oh my god, I cant even think straight right now. If you can put adrenaline, passion, love, sex, and everything similar you can think of in a blender, puree it to hell, and down a dozen barrels of the concoction, you might just end up with a feeling similar to the one I had after watching 'THE AVENGERS'. To say it is brilliant would be a gross understatement. It would be like saying the sun is warm or the universe is decently spacious. The movie is a miracle. Anyone who has even a slight understanding of the marvel universe, or has even seen the recent standalone pictures of Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and the Hulk could fathom the insurmountableness of the task of putting them all together in one single two and a half hour movie. That's like asking to fit the Hulk in a pepsi can. I can't even begin imagining how one would even start with it, but if anyone can do it, it had to be Joss Whedon (Director).<br/><br/>I know a lot of people might be going to watch this movie just because of the lead characters, but for me the pull was knowing Mr. Whedon was at the helm. For those of you haven't heard his name, think Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly. I have loved all his previous works and expected a decent product from him. The trailers were a bit unconvincing though I must say but I was stoked enough by the time I entered the hall (I was the only guy there wearing an Avengers t-shirt). The movie had a lot to live up for, mainly decades of comic book lore and the expectations of generations of fans, and I am glad to say that it not only meets them but surpasses them in Hulking leaps and bounds.<br/><br/>First up three words ‚Äì HULK! HULK! HULK! The show stealer, the show stopper, the master of ceremonies, the winner of the spotlight award - the hulk yanks the movie all unto himself. If I loved the hulk before, I revere him now. He smashes, he busts heads, he is everything you expect from a superhero and more. You have to see it to believe it. His scenes will leave you screaming with joy and jumping from your seats whooping and dancing in the air. Hulk is the man! And Mark Ruffalo's world weary, resigned Bruce Banner complements the severity of his alter-form completely. While the hulk is brutal, Banner finds repose in avoiding conflicts through wit. When the green rage monster will break bones at the slightest insult, Bruce will take everything thrown at him with a pinch of salt. It's the perfect duality and my favorite character of the whole ensemble seeing that the Hulk has always been one of the most relatable superheroes of all time. The very concept of losing yourself to anger is a very humanly intrinsic characteristic, and knowing this allows you to appreciate his awesomeness even more.<br/><br/>And yes, yes, I have not forgotten ‚Äì Scarlett Johansenn (Black Widow) is there too and she kicks ass like never before. She is stunning and beautiful and sexy and depending on your sexual preferences, the second best thing in the movie (the first still being the Hulk). Her story opens up even more and so does her relationship to Hawkeye (Brett Renner) who is also marvelous in his role too.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing in the movie perhaps is not the action (of which there is tones) but the amount of content that they have been able to cram into a single film. The character development is brilliant and even former fringe players like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Coulson get more etched out here than in all their other movies put together. All in all, each character is better represented here than in their own movies (Iron Man and Thor might be the only exceptions).<br/><br/>The story itself is a pretty simple one with Loki (Tom Hiddelston), banished from Aasgard at the end of Thor drifts off into space, returns with an alien army to take over the world, and Nick Fury assembles the avengers to defend us. But like they say, the devil is in the details, and so it is here. This movie is riddled with amazing conversations and meticulously placed jokes, most of them occurring in the midst of epic battles. Each characters relation with the other gets etched out during the course of the story and by the end what we have is a comprehensive understanding of what the Avengers are capable of ‚Äì and with a major reveal at the end of the credits showing us the next villain - you realize that this was in fact just a two and half hour long prologue to what is yet to come. God bless us all.<br/><br/>IN SHORT: There is action, there is humor, there are heroes and there are villains. I wont spoil anything for you by describing any scene in length or short, because the whole thing is that amazing. This is a ride everyone must take for the love of their inner child. Unlike the recent dark turn comic book movies have taken since Nolan's Batman, The Avengers embraces its roots unabashedly. Think of all the cartoons you watched, the comics you read, and the toys with which you played out fantasy fights. Whedon has captured them all. This is a movie meant for pure joy, and if you are even half as in love with any of the characters as I am, you will walk out with a major pain in your face muscles from carrying a ear to ear grin from title shot to credit roll."
"Somak21","9","4","9","28 April 2012"," 'We're not a team. We're a time-bomb!'
","The Avengers gathered huge expectations since it was officially announced in 2010. When separately the marvel comic characters can rock in the movies, then what massive consequences can happen when they are assembled altogether. From Tony Stark to Clint Barton, The Avengers group is subversive and totally heroic in their move. A Lot of money ($220,000,000) is involved here as there are spectacular special effects and eye-popping destructive acts. Till now, there is a huge chaos created allover revolving the release of the movie, even in India. A huge profit is estimated for the movie. Anyway, Let's see how this movie works.<br/><br/>Nick Fury is the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The Tesseract is an unknown source of huge sustainable energy that can come to much need of planet earth. But when Loki (Thor's Brother) steals The Tesseract and tries to demolish the earth as directed from Asgard, Nick Fury assembles The Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Hawkeye to eliminate the extra-terrestrial attack on earth and save humanity. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury does a perfect job. Even not being a superhero, his special role as a colonel in every marvel hero movie is commendable. <br/><br/>Tony Stark aka Iron Man is said to be the salient character of Avengers even Captain America is the first one of them. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is remarkable, humorous, smart, sleek and heroic and most of all perfect from every nook and corner. Without Iron man's technological help and cleverness, The Avengers would have to face much problem.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers aka Captain America, the first Avenger does here a nice work indeed. To him, saving America's glory and assets is everything and so he does. Chris Evans as Captain America was a Joy to watch and he was the only hero that can stand beside Iron Man shoulder-to-shoulder.<br/><br/>Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Hulk, is the strongest and mightiest and toughest pillar of the Avengers. Even Edward Norton was the leading hero of ""THE INCREDIBLE HULK"", Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk here also gives much justice and creates a great atmosphere of strength and destruction.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth as Thor (Which we have seen previously in the movie named on him) was indescribable. He is said to be the God Of Thunder from Asgard and here with his mighty hammer, he yet again creates a great appearance and makes a strong impact in defeating enemies. Nothing is greater than Myst and Gods, in that case. <br/><br/>Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson was effective as the only female superhero character in the midst of powerful masculine superheroes.<br/><br/>Clint Barton aka Hawkeye was fine and he seemed to be the weakest among the Avengers but still he was effective in his negative pre-climax and heroic role in the climax.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother seeks revenge on his brother and tries to rule the world as the only God. So, the character with so much vengeance and thirst and also battling the Avengers all alone had to be very important for the movie and so it was. <br/><br/>Among all others, the most important one was Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and he did a splendid even 'The Avengers' movie puts an end to his character forever. Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Gwyneth Paltrow & more - everyone carried out their roles splendidly.<br/><br/>It was very lucky for me to watch the movie in 3D as the remarkable special effects by Chad Ball, Roland Blancaflor, David Boucher & more and Visual effects by Visual Effects by Shaun Friedberg 'Pyrokinesis', David Abbott, Nada Abdou & more was the most important substance of the movie. Massive Destruction, Aliens, Super natural powers - everything was excellently perfect. Can't be better than this. Also, I would specially recall the use of humor in the movie that made people laugh at times. Also, the dialogues of the movie are excellent. Some awesome ones like - Steve Rogers: Stark, we need a plan of attack! Tony Stark: I have a plan : attack! & Thor: He's my brother Natasha Romanoff: He killed 80 people in 2 days Thor: He's adopted.<br/><br/>Even, this is the second directorial of the director Joss Whedon, he does a commendable job and I doubt if anyone could have done it better. Joss pens down the story with Zak Penn with the help of the writing by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby (The original comic book writers) and gives birth to a very efficient story that perfectly got along with the movie. <br/><br/>Finally, when I saw in the final scene where Tony Stark & Pepper Potts were redesigning devastated Stark Tower and only the 'A' stood among the five letters, I was fully assured that the movie did not intend to glorify any one Marvel Hero but glorified their team work as AVENGERS. And if as the end of the movie hinted is true then get ready for THE AVENGERS 2 because Nick Fury said ""We Need Them And They Know That Very Well"".<br/><br/>'The Avengers' is one helluva ride of destruction, fighting evil & heroism. Kids will love it and so will the elders. Make some time, take your family, put on your 3D glasses, pop some corns in your mouth and have a epidemical time. If you miss this one, consider it as a huge loss."

","I don't care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome. In general, this movie was damn good. I wasn't bored, and I enjoyed every freaking moment."

"Troy_Campbell","9","4","9","26 April 2012"," A rollicking good ride.
","Four years ago Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appeared in Iron Man's end credit scene and whipped the comic book geek-world into a frenzy; it was a hint at larger things to come within the Marvel universe and the fans knew it. Since then we've witnessed a franchise (including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America) that has excelled in self-referential plugs, character cameos and plot crossovers, all building a giddy excitement towards the main show: The Avengers. It was worth the wait.<br/><br/>Writer-director Joss Whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouth-watering action, laugh-out-loud humour and eye-blistering CGI. Whether it's the excellent Thor vs Iron Man vs Captain America rumble in the forest, the mind-boggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown Manhattan, or any scene with the Hulk, the bruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and, along with the series' best CGI, is likely to have your jaw on the ground. Similarly, the script and dialogue is crafted with such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark ‚Äì the Hulk's reaction to Loki belittling him had me in tears ‚Äì and the story roars along at a cracking pace, allowing you to glide over the minor gaps in plot. However, perhaps Whedon's most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast (who continue their great work from the franchise's previous instalments); he has kept every character in focus, yet never over-shadowing the others, resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go. The opening act may be a tad slow, but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine awe-inspiring moments. Bring on the sequel."

","I am still amazed by this movie. First i was a bit skeptic, since lot of movies with big names are not that good as you may suggest. But this? Original jokes, even when you don't suspect it. I laugh so hard, i was crying and is not a so called funny movie, like American pie.. The type of the characters are clearly distinguishable, and is the same as in the previous movies. But even if you didn't saw them, you can fully enjoy it, but if you did, it adds something extra. <br/><br/>It's full of action, and even when it is not so much going on the screen you never feel like that something is missing or boring. It is the perfect movie to switch off, laugh hard and enjoy what's happening on the screen."

","The Avengers is the first of it's kind, to have several movies as a build up. While some of the past movies starring the individual heroes, ranged from good to bad, The Avengers is supposed to be the climax of those movies. After seeing it, I was left a bit empty minded. Although I felt entertained throughout most of the movie, the lack of depth got to me several times. Don't get me wrong, it's not because the story is bad, as a matter of fact, it's better than most ""we-gotta-save-the-world"" stories involving superheroes. But where The Avengers fails, is when it comes to getting the audience out on the edge of their seats. You never really believe that they actually might fail, and it might be because this movie was aimed at an mainstream audience, that darker themes were left out. After superhero movies like Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (which mixed, ideologies/politics with other deep themes) and Nolan's Batman franchise , The Avengers feels more like a well-made CGI orgy, with funny moments, amidst a story that fails to capture you. Although entertaining, don't expect to walk out of the theater, pondering about this movie."

","Let me make it clear that this along with the Dark knight returns and Django unchained are the 3 movies that I am really looking forward to in 2012. After seeing the Avengers in 3D my first reaction was ""awesome"" but after thinking about it more i felt let down with the story. With so many super heroes and just one formidable villain the Avengers were always going to come on top. So how would the story make it more difficult for the heroes was going to be a challenge. Unfortunately the script failed miserably in that department. Since Joss Wheadon (who is himself a great graphic novel writer ) was helming the multi starrer, expectation was that he will have something more than just big effects. Super heroes movies like Spider-man & the Dark Knight are blockbusters but have a great story to tell as well. The Plot is simple, Loki (Thor's brother played by Tom Hiddlestone admirably ) decides to steal some ""Transsomething"" which opens the gate to another dimension from where aliens would attack earth and Loki would rule it. Nick Fury assembles the Avengers: The Ironman (Robert Downey Jr brilliant as always), Captain America & The Hulk and Thor to fight against the other worldly aliens. The only problem is that these superheroes need to get along with each other and put their egos aside to fight the alien invasion. The pros: Fantastic action, great visual effects, good one-liners, The HULK! The Con: a weak script and a predictable plot.<br/><br/>Its a great watch but could have been so much better. Cheers!!!"

Then the last hour delivers with a lot of mayhem and destruction but unfortunately it's more of the same old, same old. Flying robot lizards destroying New York buildings anyone? Didn't I see the same thing in Transformers etc? Do they just modify the CGI a tad and throw them in the next blockbuster I wonder? So much action and yet we were quite bored. Some funny lines here and there otherwise a disappointment from a good director. Movie will make a killing but I'm wondering how much more CGI chaos we can endure before we start giving these type of movies a skip? The suits running the studios are only interested in chasing a sure thing so all we're going to get are sequels and reboots.

Some of the scenes in the Avengers, from the beginning to end, were complete non- sense, very unnecessary, felt forced, lack creativity and almost amateurish. I don't understand the high ratings, and the high gross for the movie, which is attributed to the $50.00 (3D fees) per person. Are some of you people on some kind of drugs?

","I appreciate this film for what it is. An all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects, fancy camera work and ability to not have to think, and just sit back. The plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clich√©d, alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen a million times before with a ""Lets destroy a city with as much explosions and CGI as possible"" chapter. Don't get me wrong, they did a great job with it. Some of the camera work was excellent, much better than Micheal Bay's close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique. But for me personally I don't like being overwhelmed with all the CGI and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects. The only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor. If it was not for that I would have rated this film as just another bland CGI bonanza. A good attempt, but for me, not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. The effect's are amazing, the humor is good, but everything else..seen it before..bored of it."
"rebellion_x","1","11","36","14 July 2013"," Like a video game: Visuals without story and character
","I don't understand how this movie succeeded in scoring so many stars. The only thing good about it were the visuals, seeing Hulk smash and all that. Story line, characters, interaction were all very flat. I've seen previous titles in this series (like the uber-horrible captain America, Hulk, Thor and Iron Man), and it seems clear what this series is about: flat visual action scene's. Pure for visuals it deserves three stars, but since so many people are exaggerating on their score I'm giving only one to compensate. It does definitely not deserve the high score it has now.<br/><br/>Right. I need ten lines. Well, I can repeat the script to show all the silliness in this movie. Banner cannot control Hulk inside. Then suddenly he can anger himself out of will? Out of the blue Hulk suddenly evolves into a cooperating creature. What? How does that fit into his history? And then that old man who saw Hulk falling. He's reacting as if he sees it everyday. Captain America needs a suite because people can use some old-fashionedness? Huh? Then when action is required he asks Hawk Eye: 'do you have a suite?' Huhu, very important indeed. What's it with his shield anyway? Iron Man keeping a rotor running by spinning it himself? Come on please. Mythological gods as science fiction figures? No, don't mess up that! I just feel like I watched my little brother play a video game. Lots of visuals, no story."

Most of the jokes and one-liners are outdated and you hardly feel like laughing at them. (Except for few from the man, the Iron Man ;) ) The silly quarrels the team gets into turns you off. The concept of getting our bad guy from out of space, the powers of whose almost are like supernatural, is totally unimpressive.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say only kids may enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Marvel comics and I thoroughly enjoyed the Spidermans, the Iron mans etc...

"wandereramor","5","5","13","22 June 2012"," Would it be too insulting to put comic book sound effects here?
","The MacGuffin has been stolen in a darkly-lit and confusing sequence, and now the military-industrial complex has to rally its choice second-tier intellectual properties to its defence. All of those guys from the past two years of Marvel movies, plus a chick, a black guy, and Hawkeye to meet quotas, must team up to defeat the evil plot of Loki, whose main superpower is getting his ass kicked in every scene, and a bunch of unseen aliens who want to take over Earth or maybe destroy it because, well, that's what aliens do. They squabble for a bit, and never really resolve the argument, but it's okay because a bit character dies, mentions in his last breath that his death will bring the team together, and then the team states several times that his death brought them together, in case you didn't get that. And then they fight robot space manatees.<br/><br/>It's kind of hard to evaluate The Avengers as a film because, well, it doesn't really try to be a film. The plot is thin and generic, the characters were mostly established in previous films and don't gain any new development here, there's absolutely no attempt to create interesting images or anything more aesthetically pleasing than a forest of CGI, and it's not even internally consistent.<br/><br/>Instead The Avengers is a series of cool moments strung together, and some of the moments are indeed pretty cool, although a lot of the one-liners fall flat. This is probably why it's been received so rapturously by the Internet crowd, which mainly judges media based off the number of clever animated gifs they can spawn. And it is frequently fun, mainly whenever Robert Downey Jr. and/or the Hulk is on screen. But the first hour is unbearable, and all the banter and big speeches in the world can't make up for the corporate hollowness at the centre of the movie. In the end, fanboyism is just another kind of consumerism."
"amyj_25","6","5","13","9 June 2012"," Nothing but a Disappointment
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film after hearing so much good feedback, however when I finally saw it I was disappointed by the lack of conflict and sense of the entire film. Normally in films the bad guy actually comes somewhere close to winning or at least gives the ""heroes"" some trouble. In this film Loki seemed weak and powerless compared to the heroes. Most of the main characters weren't needed like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, and Captain America. The same results could have been achieved if the Hulk and Iron Man were the only heroes. The ease that the Avengers had in defeating Loki made the film boring and regrettable to watch. I found myself on the verge of falling asleep during this entire film. This film is nothing more than any other mundane action movie."
"kosmasp","9","5","13","7 June 2012"," If they can't save the box office, they sure as hell will avenge it
","I'm still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).<br/><br/>All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.<br/><br/>The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).<br/><br/>I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.<br/><br/>Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ..."

","The Avengers is okay. The movie has some weak points and strong points. The strong points out weight the weak points. The Avengers weak points are the script and special effects. The Avengers follow a predictable formula. The comic book hero scripts are redundantly formulated where a problem is created and then there is a final action showdown between good and evil. The viewers then experience the same seen it and done it before special effects. What make ""The Avengers"" stand out from other comic book movies is the character development. The Stark, and Hulk characters save ""The avengers""! Stark and Hulk create comic relief and interesting dialogue. When the Stark and Hulk disagree with the other super heroes their wit is hilarious. I give Avenger six out of ten."
"Aaron1375","10","5","13","14 May 2012"," The Avengers were assembled and this audience member loved the creation.
","This movie has been a long time coming as it had its beginning in the 2008 film ""Iron Man"". There would also be ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man 2"", ""Thor"" and finally ""Captain America"". All these parts, left some wondering could they have this many superheroes in a film and it not turn out a jumbled mess? I never wondered that as all one had to do was look at the X-Men films and see that for the most part those films got it right, the main difference here was that different companies were involved so there may be some trouble. However, what we got was a film that brought a team of superheroes together and totally cranked up the action to the max. Yes, I have to say the action in this film is better than any action in other comic book films. It is not even close, they gave me here what I have been wanting! Do not get me wrong, the Batman movies are still great, I also enjoyed the Spider-man and X-men films, but this one just said this is a comic book film, and people want to see an epic battle, maybe even more than one! So no good, but relatively short fights like those found in most comic book films, we get lots of action and an epic finale! <br/><br/>My favorite character on the Avengers is the Hulk, which explains why I did enjoy this film a good deal. He was finally done right, granted ""The Incredible Hulk"" was good too, but this was the best representation of the Hulk easily. He was presented as the strongest by far, though I nearly gasped when he and Thor faced off as I never saw that in the trailers so that was a nice treat for me and he did to Thor just what I wanted him to, punch him through something! Granted, Thor got some good hits in too, but I loved how they made it clear Hulk is the strongest one! Mark Ruffalo was also an improvement over Eric Bana and Edward Norton. He played Banner in a bit more nervous and skittish manner, unlike say Norton's who looked capable of putting up a fight without even becoming the Hulk. Hulk also got the biggest laugh in the theater I was in.<br/><br/>So this film was everything I was hoping for and more. The rest of the cast was good too as Loki has come to Earth to capture the power of the cosmic cube (though he has someone behind him calling the shots). He plans of bringing an alien force to Earth so that he may become its king, he does this for no other reason than to irritate his brother, Thor it seems. He is still the same Loki from Thor, as you still do not know what he has going on in his mind! I was afraid he would not have this aspect in this film, but they were able to keep it. His alien force is great, and this makes for the great finale!<br/><br/>The finale has the Avengers assembling and working together to stop the invasion and it is a grand spectacle to behold! So loved seeing the heroes utilize their skills and powers and every hero gets in some good hits. Black Widow and Hawkeye are expanded on in this film and they are pretty cool. If I were to have a complaint, it would be that there was one hero they under utilized a bit. In a film with so many heroes I guess it is to be expected, I was just surprised it was Captain America. He just did not play as big a role in the final fight as I would of liked. Sure he gave some orders, but his contribution to ending the assault was giving the Black Widow a boost. However, he was used well in the other scenes he was in, this is not a major gripe mind you...just if I can find something to complain about it is this. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I was impressed and loved this film. It was great to see this band of heroes slowly unite as it was watching Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury pulling the strings to get them to work together. Surprised he was listed last in the credit sequence at the end, because he played the most significant role in the film and was in it from the beginning to the end. The way it is performing at the box office also makes me think there is going to be a sequel for sure and that makes me ecstatic as they show who was calling all the shots and suffice to say I was not entirely sure who he was until he smiled and then I am like ""oh my god, yes!"" See this DC and Warner Bros, if multiple companies can come together and make an epic superhero team film then you can make a Justice League movie!"
"DjfunkmasterG","7","5","13","10 May 2012"," Doesn't live up to the hype.
","I walked into The Avengers tonight expecting something fascinating, instead I was given a screwed up 1st and 2nd act, and a balls to the wall 3rd act.<br/><br/>The Avengers was setting a really great tone of delving into a dark story of earth's take over by Loki and his army, and every time the film would go down this darker path, whether it be editing or poor script writing, as soon as it had you emotionally, and at the edge of your seat, a completely UN-needed joke or comedic moment was thrown in that totally destroyed the moment.<br/><br/>This film easily could have had 20 minutes shaved off the run time, and no offense to JW fans, but he wasn't competent enough to direct this film. Had JF did this flick, I am sure the tone would have been much more in line with the Iron Man films, and of course the tone of the spin-offs (Thor, Capt. America) I will admit I was disappointed that Ed Norton didn't come back as Bruce Banner, but Mark Ruffalo made me forget about Ed within 3 minutes, but let us all be honest here, this was Robert Downey Jr's movie from the get go. The man is a great actor and he stole the entire film without even breaking a sweat. Others tried to keep up, but I think they were unprepared, and this can also be the fault of the director, it is his job to bring the performances out of the cast that are needed.<br/><br/>What was really disappointing was the depth of character development, or I should say the poor execution of it. I know some folks will say, you have to see the other flicks and there you get your character development, but keep in mind, most audiences probably have not seen the other films and walked into this one with the hopes of learning what was needed to be known about everyone. Keep in mind not all of us are comic fans or superhero fans, and a film that is more or less a separate entry into the Marvel Universe, came off more like a sequel instead of an initial entry.<br/><br/>As I noted the 3rd act was great. The war and battles were fantastic from start to finish. The cinematography and choreography for this sequence was top notch stuff, it is just a shame the amount of work that went into the third act wasn't put into the 1st and 2nd.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is just my opinion on the flick. Did I hate it? No, not really. I gave it a 7 out of 10. I just felt it could have been better."

The action is good and the characters all play their roles great, but something is missing in this movie.If the main villain Loki and his crew of aliens became a threat to any city in the U.S. I would laugh and take my chances. Am I the only one wondering where were the U.S.Airforce ,Marines,Army or even the Navy,when a whole entire city is being attacked ? Who were the aliens shooting at when they came from outerspace ? They sure wasn't hitting the people running around in the middle of the street during the entire battle scene.Did any hardworking bank employee,cop,or other random person running in the street get hurt? I didn't see any. Bad writing and action sequences ruined this movie. I was also wondering,couldn't Thor just electrocute most of the aliens for about 30 mins instead of fighting them one on one? He can control lighting. I would still say this movie is entertaining but watched by fans and viewers with common sense , this movie is a comedy and very very very overrated."

","Aside from a few points of humor, this movie primarily features only endless lame fighting (A knocks down B, B gets up and knocks down A, A gets up... repeat over and over and over). Apparently delightful to Marvel fans, tedious and banal to those who seek something other than the simplistic, well-worn pathway to adolescent male fantasy. Yes, the special effects were well done, though somewhat inconsistent -- why is the Hulk so huge in some scenes, so human-scale in others? Why does the Hulk fear his monster's uncontrollability, when it seems perfectly coordinated with the other superheroes during the fighting, and perfectly peaceful afterward? Why is there no character development whatsoever? Oh, right, it's Marvel. Superheroes in stasis. Throwbacks to a stupider time. <br/><br/>I kept waiting for it to get interesting... and then it was over. ::sigh::"

","Watched it. Not all that good at all. For Example, why does Hawkeye have more than enough arrows while fighting against the Avengers, but as he joins 'em in their fight, runs out of arrows? Why does Hulk go berserk against everything on the shield flying boat thing, but fights with the avengers at the end, without a real reason given, even saving Iron Man? Hawkeye isn't even a real super-hero, but hits with every Arrow without even aiming ( At the end, there's a scene where he blindly shoots to his right, of course hitting the target) Sorry for the Random rant, liked that film either way, but could've been better >.> .

","Everybody seems to like this film. I don't. I respect everyone's opinion, but I must say I'm a little puzzled by the public response to what I consider to be just an average popcorn movie. The storyline is weak, but everyone seems to agree that it isn't the most important element of the film. Its major points are: 1) the action; 2) the relationships between the characters. With regard to the action scenes, I felt nothing but indifference. The main reason is that I can't stand CGI. Everything seems flat and unreal. And The Avengers is a CGI fest. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love it. If you are an old-school action movie lover, you'll probably be bored. As for the relationships between the main characters, I was even more disappointed. Dialogues in the film are just an endless series of supposedly funny jokes. The entire movie plays as very loud and expensive comedy. I can't stand Robert Downey, Jr anymore. Someone had said that he is Tony Stark, but the fact is that Tony Stark is Robert Downey Jr. He's not playing a character, he's just being a wise-ass. Actually, he does it in every movie he's in. It's unbearable. The other characters are equally bland, except for Tom Hiddleston's Loki (this man's a great actor) and maybe Mark Ruffalo's David Banner/Hulk. Overall, I was bored and even embarrassed to watch the movie, even though I'm aware that I have the minority opinion."

Perhaps if I wrote more reviews I'd be better at this.

","OK, now although I thought this movie was good, the two things that kept annoying me every time I had to stare at them were:<br/><br/><ul><li>Captain America: Come on the Rubber baby helmet look was terrible are you telling me that they couldn't find a better look for him. The costume was terrible. 1. I know it's traditional but come on come up with something new; the light blue was terrible and looked like a child's costume. I mean the darker blue in Captain America the 1st avenger was better than in Avengers. 2. The rubber baby helmet. What the hell!! It looked terrible they could have done something that came up to his ears, and wrapped around his head letting his hair come out the top. Sorta of like Cyclops in Xmen, I'm sorry the full head cover was absolutely terrible. Chris Evans is a good looking Actor Show him off more, not make him look ridiculous. I mean if they can revamp Superman costume and make it look fantastic... They need to go back on the drawing board on Captain Americas Costume.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Hulk: Honestly I couldn't stand looking at him the digital creation they had was horrible. They went from The hulk (2003) which was a bit cartoonish, but OK. To The Incredible Hulk (2008) which I think was fantastic, the CGI was fantastic you could see muscle def, hair moved instead of looked glued down, and looked like a HULK. The hulk they had in the avengers look run down, old, ""Smaller"" I always envisioned hulk as a big massive thing. This hulk was barely towering over anyone. I'm sorry I just didn't agree with the thing they had there at all. But because they have recast the hulk like 20 times, also brings down the appeal how can you really build up your appeal for the character if you keep changing out the actor. That is an ""Epic Fail""!!</li></ul><br/><br/>But other than that I liked the movie, was very good, better than the XMen why because they were actually fighting something bigger than the screen. I hate like XMen where everyone they were fighting was the same, and so small... they needed to throw in an Apocalypse, Onslaught, something was the enemy is a real Enemy. So other than those small changes I think the movie was great for its genre"

","This was hyped up to be one of the best films of the year, yet I'm left wondering why this movie has so many accolades. Firstly, the intensity doesn't even pick up until an hour in, with a wonky storyline not worth remembering. Much of the plot is filler for the action which there's strangely little of. An epic fail of extras ruin the continuity whilst the main cast seem to dither away into sappy buddy-buddy moments.<br/><br/>With an inflated budget, it seems that more attention was focused on the character's wardrobes rather than better special effects sequences. Dialogue is unfortunately the usual clich√© bits of monologue between opposing teams leaving no room for artistic fluency.<br/><br/>If this was the best that Hollywood muster up.. I shudder to think what the sequel has in store for us."
"dinelle89","3","4","10","19 November 2012"," avengers over rated
","If you haven't seen any of the other movies such as, Thor, Iron Man, The Hulk, or Captain America, then this movie will have you lost. It does not give you enough background information to understand some of the film. For instance, when Natasha Romanoff says to Agent Phil Coulson that she didn't want to bring Tony Stark better known as Iron Man into Headquarters because Tony didn't, ""trust her as far as he could throw her"" I wonder to myself, ""why doesn't he trust her?"" and the question is never answered throughout the film. Along with the scene when Agent Phil Coulson and Thor are standing in front of a computer with a young blonde women's profile opened and the Agent tells Thor that he got her out of the country to keep her out of danger during the battle to come. The movie does not explain why she is important to Thor and it doesn't explain who she is. The characters do not mesh together and the acting his horrible. The scene that Captain America is in a plane with Agent Coulson, the acting is horrible and the dialogue with the intended humor is bland. My first time watching the film, I paid more attention to the special effects and I do give credit that producer Joss Whedon and his crew did a decent job with that. But the second time watching the film, I focused on the characters and plot and I was not impressed. The movie has no surprises in it, the fighting scene in the end is dull and drags on and the ending result of the fight is not only predictable, but clich√©d. I do not believe this movie deserved an 8.7 rating because for a two and a half hour movie, it does more dull action scenes then character explanation and background that it needs to make the viewer fully understand what is even going on between all the characters. The most confusing relationship between two characters is between Natasha Romanoff and Agent Barton. When Natasha is speaking with Loki, they discuss Agent Barton a little bit but the conversation bounces from Agent Barton to Bruce Banner so much that I got completely lost. If you are all caught up on your Marvel movies, then I'm sure the film would be much more enjoyable for you, but as for me, I was not impressed in the least."
"bob the moo","Null","4","10","6 September 2012"," Consistently enjoyable effects and noise with the right amount of fun mixed in
","You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film ‚Äì a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.<br/><br/>Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.<br/><br/>And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the ""puny god"" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.<br/><br/>It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining ‚Äì it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this."

Sure, there are radical action scenes and the film is in many ways true to the comics. However, it is not, what its recently and often alleged, a masterpiece. It is just like many previous films, hard-cooked popcorn action (surely inspired by Transformers effects) but not more than that. The lack of manusscript, depth, sound track, pace and sometimes actor-performance is no where near a masterpiece. The SFX, as i mentioned, are very well though. <br/><br/>Yet, a movie by comic-book-fans for comic-book-fans. Maybe that is its weakness or its only strength?"

BAD PARTS: The director is seldom in my opinion he did some okay things, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and he has done some great things, Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog. But, for me a superhero movie is a little bit out of his league. This is the biggest thing, Monkey flipping Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow!

","There is no way this movie could not score a fat, juicy ten out of ten. The Avengers Assembled is a work of genius and art which is flawlessly executed. This film is gold.<br/><br/>One scene flows into the next. There is no spot of disorientation when one wonders 'how did we get here?' because each scene moves effortlessly and easily into the next. As such it really feels as though the events are unfolding as the movie plays on, not as though a story is being told.<br/><br/>This film requires none of the lead up movies to be watched. However I do heavily suggest the viewing of Thor before hand for Loki's development as this film's villain can not be properly appreciated or understand without knowing the evolution of his character development. And yet, without viewing Thor, the Avengers is just as enjoyable and pleasing.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston as Loki is amazing. He is utterly spell bounding as the only bad guy. He doesn't bend, he doesn't break and he most certainly requires no support. He brings emotion, heart, soul, charisma, anger and insanity to a very complex role. He plays Loki like he's wearing a second skin. He makes the bad guy extremely likable even when he's causing utter destruction left, right and centre.<br/><br/>One should, however, not ignore the challenge that faced the Avengers. Whilst Tom Hiddleston has the burden of being the sole villain and so must not only step up and do a good job, but fill such a huge space on his own with no support, no back up and no assistance, the Avengers have to not only work together as a team but find their own spot light. Every single Avenger, with poise and grace brings heart and soul to their character, creates personal relationships with others, grabs the lime light whilst allowing the others to play too.<br/><br/>All the characters spark brilliantly together.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was an interesting move. He's the first Hulk to be initially awkward and slightly timid but freakishly smart and seemingly cool under pressure. He is also the only one to have the privilege to work with Motion Capture Technology and so you can see Mark Ruffalo's face on the green giant monster giving the green giant a human quality as he smashes his way through life. <br/><br/>Avengers is face paced, serious, fun and light hearted. Viewers are guaranteed to laugh out loud on more than one occasion and not be able to wait to see what happens next. The film is so good that one will just want to see it over and over. The enjoyability of the film is not worn away with multiple consecutive viewings."

We are HUGE Marvel fans, and we were excited to see the movie. Our expectations simply were not met relative to all the hype, and this film is not worthy of an 8.6 rating. It's a very good movie, but not great by any means. Here's the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The Good: The special effects were outstanding as you would expect. The acting was also nicely done. The script was somewhat well paced, although we both felt it started fairly slowly. The movie did had some of the funniest moments of any super hero film I've seen. The storyline was OK, but that brings me to the bad.<br/><br/>The Bad: The storyline was just OK. I won't spoil the movie, but suffice it to say the anti-heroes motivations were somewhat silly to me. That said, it follows (somewhat) to the comic storyline, so the plot was never really all that interesting to begin with. The actors and directors did the best they could with the plot, but I was never pulled into the story that deeply, nor did it strike any emotional connection or interest for me. It was just a great action movie that was well acted with a reasonable script.<br/><br/>Avengers is a very good action film, and worthy of seeing on the big screen. However, to see this film rated so close to the Dark Night is preposterous. Those films are in totally different leagues."
"Samiam3","8","4","10","16 June 2012"," Really liked it.
","The Avengers is almost the definition of good time at the movies. Not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins, this superhero film takes a conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play, and once it does that, the game is played with flair and showmanship.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, the plot itself is absurd, but I guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different Marvel heroes. In less capable hands, the Avengers may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much. With Joss Whedon in the director's chair, it's actually a very strait forward two hours with a good level of focus.<br/><br/>While New York ends up getting the same treatment as much of Michael Bay's resume, the experience is far less superficial. the Avengers does not insult our intelligence. quite the opposite in fact, it embraces it. The Avengers' best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself. This is a movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes. <br/><br/>A good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie. Simply put, these people (or rather super people) are just good fun to be around. While none of them are ever quite fully rounded, when they come together as a team, they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies. with the exception of Iron Man, the films of Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, were not all that memorable when it came to characters. The Avengers makes you realize how distinctive each character is.<br/><br/>One thing I was a little disappointed in was Samuel L. Jackson. While he is very much at home in the role he plays, it seems pretty obvious that he's just playing himself. Perhaps, there is a hidden positive in this. As a supporting character, you don't wanna upstage the people who have top billings. Personally, I think he could've given The Avengers a little bit more love.<br/><br/>Last summer was a somewhat underwhelming year for superheros. It's a pleasure then to see a film like The Avengers fly in to save the day. It's a film made with love, and the work has paid off."

","I had never been heavily anticipating The Avengers. I'm not a huge fan of any of these superheroes, and haven't been up to date on most of these. I only saw the first Iron Man and the two Hulk films, but honestly nothing Marvel released since then. The Avengers surprised me. It turned out to be a fairly slow-paced film with subtle character dynamics and nuanced performances. <br/><br/>Okay, really, it's just a BLAST! Nothing more has to be said. It has a tone that giddily encourages you to get on board. It's pretty much everything you expect, but it doesn't insult your intelligence. In fact, the characters and dialogue are all pretty well-written. A film like this could have had just as amazing action sequences, but with lesser writing and development, wouldn't be nearly as satisfying. Truly, there's something to enjoy in all of these characters, particularly Banner (perfectly portrayed by Ruffalo) and the always charming Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Having not seen Thor, I enjoyed him a lot too and thought Hemsworth was pretty excellent. <br/><br/>Technially, it's excellent. The editing is fantastic, and there is not a single flaw within the editing achievement. Editing action films, especially in their big moments, can be very hard to accomplish, but these filmmakers did an impeccable job. The action sequences are amazing, and big, huge. Overall, there's so much excitement to be had here. I don't have a problem calling The Avengers THE ""perfect summer blockbuster"". It truly is, and boy what a ride it is. Strongly recommended to everyone."

","Greetings all.<br/><br/>As an avid comic books fan I have mine reservations about such material, thanks to some previous experiences with this difficult to work genre, and essentially knowing the characters and their abilities etc.<br/><br/>I wish not to burden you with uber-geekiness and so I shall strive to keep it simple and to the point, as just as possible. <br/><br/>I was, however, greeted with an array of performances, effects and credible references which absolutely satiated a void that longs for successful live action pieces of this nature. <br/><br/>And we commence with what is so often incorrectly executed with films of this category; casting. For me the stars of this is the Asgardians, specifically Thor and Loki/Hemsworth and Hiddleston who radiate such charisma and fitting for the purpose it is uncanny, this partially gives thanks to the script. Robert Downy Jr. is arguably too old to portray Tony Stark now, and I concur that he is better suited as Sherlock Holmes and not the so-called talisman of this franchise, but nonetheless he delivers an enjoyable portrayal. Chris Evans really isn't my idea of Captain America at all, he better fits the wise cracking Johnny Storm/Human torch, but he is not bad, and in no way impacts in detrimental fashion upon this masterpiece. Hawkeye and Black Widow are not my ideal choices from what is a veritable sm√∂rg√•sbord of possible heroes, and neither their counterparts. I was pleasantly surprised by Jeremy Renner though. Still not convinced by any means with Johannson, she lacks a certain commanding presence expected of a strong female. I also have little to say about what I feel to be the shoe-horned Samuel Jackson (my ideas of Nick Fury differ greatly) and the oh so human Phil Coulson, even though he delivers decent comic relief sporadically.<br/><br/>This film excels, where so many predecessors have failed, to present characters from both a comic book perspective and one which the general public can understand. Their capabilities usually fall short, but not in this case, Thor engaging the Hulk in an almost even battle is a perfect example of what this movie does right. The action sequences are mouth watering in some cases, and everyone gets their deserved screen time, with only Cobie Smulders/Maria Hill falling short.<br/><br/>A few minor foibles of mine in particular are some of the comedic scenes which apparently went down very well with most, they're a bit too silly for my taste. Black Widow in the team is another. The slightly slow beginning. But as said previously these are hardly film destroying.<br/><br/>If you wish for great action and cast chemistry, with some very memorable action scenes, and plenty of them. This is a solid choice.<br/><br/>Marvel has set the very high standard for superhero team films. And consequently spawned a sequel. Over to you DC...."
"grnbrndd12","9","4","10","5 June 2012"," The Best Marvel Superhero Movie To Date
","This movie managed not only to be far more compelling than the (below- )average lot of most superhero movies, as well as far more funny. It was great that each of the heroes was allowed to shine, in the case of Thor and Captain America even more than in their eponymous films. It was excellent to have an action movie plot that didn't try to pad itself out by adding mystery (though there is some of that). The dialog between characters was perfectly written to illustrate their respective personalities, and how they butt heads with one another before learning to work together. My one real complaint is that the Hulk, while a ton of comic smashing fun once he does get rolling, is stretched out a bit too long with Banner lamenting his fate and warning to ""not get me angry."" Still, that's more than made up for once he comes into his own. The sequel hook at the end was also tantalizing, but is probably lost on most casual viewers. Highly recommended!"
"Christian_Dimartino","8","4","10","4 June 2012"," Really good and satisfying.
","I finally saw The Avengers. I don't know what happened, but it took me a while. I know that there was a lot of hype built around it, and that it got mostly rave reviews (those who didn't like it are just trying to bring it down), and that I missed out on it and I was getting tired of hearing about it. My favorite movie is The Dark Knight, so for me, a comic book movie has to be really impressive. The Avengers is really impressive, one of the best of it's kind. But not The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>It's been in the making for years. The plot is simple stuff. Loki(the soon to be very famous Tom Hiddleston), Thor's mischievous evil brother, has come to earth, and i'm sure you know what he aims to do. So after years of recruitment, Nick Fury finally decides to bring The Avengers together.<br/><br/>The group includes Thor(Chris Hemsworth), the hammer wielding Norse god, Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), the arrogant billionaire, Captain America(Chris Evans), a super strengthed man stuck in the past, The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), the big green guy with a temper problem, Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), the sexy leather chick who knows kung fu, and Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner), who has an expert mark. These people must fight together... but there is a problem: Their egos.<br/><br/>Those moments are a lot of fun, and that is sort of what makes The Avengers take off. There are terrific action sequences that sort of drag out but are fun anyway, and the dialogue is hilarious, whether it's corny or intentionally funny, and you can tell. But it's an interesting idea: All of these heroes who have never met each other, meeting each other for the first time.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a blast, even if it is too long. Even with the clutter of the heroes, each one gets a fair amount of screen time, and each gives a good performance. Mark Ruffalo is a fine replacement of Edward Norton. Overall, it's a really good movie, but doesn't reach masterpiece. Maybe The Avengers 2.<br/><br/>B+"
"j-a-c-visions","7","4","10","2 June 2012"," How can such a huge and dynamic film be so easily forgettable?
","""Marvel's The Avengers"" deserves full credit for it's dynamic execution in bringing the Marvel cast together, as it was a very well-structured and firmly put-together blockbuster by the exciting character-driven filmmaker, Joss Whedon. The clash and the interactions of each Marvel hero, and the development of this was exuberant, witty, and simply hilarious. As the film progressed into the action tone and the all-out, explosive warfare in New York City, the teamwork and building chemistry couldn't be anymore dynamic, and yet still humorous from Whedon's continuous comic relief of the combination of these contrasting superheroes. Although, after all this popcorn fun, simple but vital flaws remain.<br/><br/>The score of this massively anticipated Marvel feature should've had a magical and intense sound similar to ""The Lord of the Rings"" or Christopher Nolan's Batman films. Instead the score failed to connect, as it lacked in ""pure epicness"" and beauty, and ultimately the film lost connection with one of the most important aspects in a film. <br/><br/>Not only did the sound and score of the film not work, but the very simple story was exposed from the lack of depth in the telling of the story. This ultimately made the film feel smaller and weaker than it should be. With these small, yet very important, aspects of the film, frustratingly, not executed well, instead of ""Marvel's The Avengers"" ending on a high-note, it ends having zero connection with the story and characters, except Mark Ruffalo's brilliant interpretation of The Hulk, because the lack of connection from the score and the lack of depth in the storytelling ultimately wore on everything else that appeared on screen. What lack of connection in a film leads to is a forgettable movie because if a film doesn't connect and stick with someone, how can that film possibly be remembered. But it's ""Marvel's The Avengers,"" how can that be forgotten? Very easily. The concept won't be forgotten, nor will Joss Whedon's incredible character-portrayal of each superhero be forgotten, but it will be the anticipation and the potential brilliance in the other huge motion pictures in 2012 such as ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and ""The Hobbit"" which will make ""The Avenger's"" be that film where everyone thinks, ""what was that movie that came out earlier this year, it was a huge movie...oh yeah, The Avengers how could I possibly forget that."" It's not because the film wasn't good, it was an awesome and intense blockbuster to watch, but it was the little things that left the film slightly over par.<br/><br/>Simplifying it down, ""Marvel's The Avenger's"" was a fun film and one for everyone to see and really deserves high praise for it's execution of it's characters. Although, as glorious as it looked, it unfortunately did not sound nearly as good as I wanted it too. Yet, the film is still easily likable to any viewer because there is so much to like about in the excitement of this film."

","After the events of Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor, Loki returns with an army of powerful aliens to take over mankind. But Nick Fury and his company S.H.I.E.L.D., gathers a group of heroes (Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and Black Widow) to fight back.<br/><br/>The Avengers was one of the most anticipated movies of this year. Now I wasn't as hyped for this movie as everyone else were, simply because I wasn't a big fan of any of the superheroes in this movie. Iron Man is pretty cool, but Hulk, Captain America and Thor aren't that interesting in terms of being superheroes. Hawkeye and Black Widow can't even be considered true superheroes, and overall I was disappointed by the lack of Spider-Man, Wolverine and villains from the comics. This movie only has one villain, Loki from Thor. No War Machine, no Red Skull, no Abomination, just Loki. But after studying the trailers a bit more, and after watching all the films building up to The Avengers, I myself was starting to look forward to the movie everyone were begging to see.<br/><br/>Now, let me say this: I have never had so much fun watching a movie. It's like a lot of other people also have stated, this movie is so much fun to watch with other people, it's almost unbelievable. The Avengers really is one of those very rare movies that we only get like once or twice a decade. And let me tell you why...<br/><br/>First of all, the balance of screen-time and development of the characters is very impressive! It's one of the hard things to do with crossovers. All the characters are also made interesting and likable. Even if they changed the actor for Hulk, he still is Hulk. In fact, the new Hulk is even more Hulk than the previous Hulk! Iron Man is even funnier in this movie than he was in any of the Iron Man films, Captain America is just as likable as he was in The First Avenger and Thor is also back in all his glory.<br/><br/>The action is also fantastic. Let me tell you this, the best part about this movie is the last fight scene with The Avengers vs. Loki and his army! It is so amazing, epic and packed with action! Everyone clapped at almost everything that came on-screen! It was just plain spectacular!<br/><br/>Now, the main gripe I have with this film is the setting of the mid-part. The middle of the film takes place in an airship. Most of it is just the superheroes trying to keep the ship not from falling apart while fighting some bad-guys. It's not bad by any means, it's just not that special. This mid-part is however redeemed by some amazing dialogue.<br/><br/>The Avengers is an awesome movie! It's the movie Marvel fans have been waiting for! The mid-part may not be that great, but the rest of the film is so great it almost doesn't matter."

Well, I guess it didn't take that long, just because I usually refuse to stop living until my dreams come true. So when that day comes, I will have the feeling I didn't have to wait my whole life for it.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" are here and, I must say, it's a wild ride into the fantastic world. Maybe the team is not made out of my favorite super heroes, but they do come along just fine, supported by amazing special effects that, like so many, turn the impossible into reality, at least on the big screen. This movie is quite a lot of fun, especially if you like action. It's a roller coaster from beginning till the end and the story is not too shabby, either. But I do believe Tony Stark delves more and more into that self absorbing personality of his, driving me a bit nuts. As for the others, they care for the action as much and, not to be too demanding, I must admit I did enjoy the journey. Check it out."
"foraspoonfulofborscht","5","4","10","29 May 2012"," A Superhero Movie
","The Avengers is a superhero movie. There are 5 male superheroes and 1 female superhero. None of the characters are developed to a remotely human or 3-dimensional level. Although the film has many moments of witty dialogue and some entertaining action scenes, the plot feels as if it was made up in a few hours, and the villain, Loki, (The brother of Thor, one of the heroes) is one of the worst in recent action films. If you come to a movie wanting nothing but two hours of fighting and explosions, this film will exceed your expectations, but if you watch films for insights on human nature, to see well developed, interesting characters, and to see a carefully devised ingenious plot, this film may not be for you. However, it is fair to say that this is simply an action film, which is ""mindless entertainment"" and as ""mindless entertainment"" this film does succeed. And for succeeding at that, it earns a solid 7 out of 10 stars."

The only thing I thought was a tad bit cheesy were the space aliens at the end. Some movies have computer generated characters without it looking computer generated, but these definitely looked like they belonged in an xbox360 video game. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel to this movie. I liked the other characters who were included in this movie as well, even though marvel didn't make any previous movies to introduce them.

"Reel_starz","8","4","10","16 May 2012"," Fanboys and girls, after years of anticipation, you can finally breathe
","I'll confess that I had reservations about The Avengers: the Marvel superhero movies have been a mixed bag for me so far, and the notion of a big-budget action spectacle centered on not just one but six protagonists, all of whom should theoretically get an equal amount of attention, sounded like a formula for disaster. At best, I assumed that it would be a fun slice of escapism that critics would treat with a mix of condescension and grudging acceptance. At worst, it would be the most ambitious fiasco since¬Ö well, John Carter, though that had the benefit of low expectations. If The Avengers was anything but the cinematic equivalent of a walk-off grand slam in Game 7 of the World Series, blood would surely be spilt.<br/><br/>To my ‚Äì and no doubt tons of other people's ‚Äì relief, neither of those predictions turned out to be right. Not only is The Avengers a blast to watch, an explosive mix of humor, angst and awesome fight scenes, but it's also maybe one of the best superhero movies of all-time. Take notes, Hollywood: this is how you make a summer blockbuster. Despite clocking in at approximately two-and-a-half hours, The Avengers never fails to mesmerize, barreling headlong into the chaos like an enraged Hulk loose in Manhattan yet also giving its numerous heroes sufficient room to breathe and flex their ridiculously chiseled muscles. This is a ticking time bomb of a movie. Each scene brims with energy, an exhilarating, carefree vivacity that would probably be overwhelming if not for those little moments of unexpected pathos strewn here and there that leave you breathless. Joss Whedon, the geek idol whose previous credits include beloved cult TV shows Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, displays astonishing dexterity as he juggles over-the-top action set pieces with incisive, often self-deprecating banter and emotional turmoil. He treats the material at once with ironic self-awareness and the utmost respect, indulging the so-called fanboys without pandering to them, winking at the absurdity while making his passion for the characters and their stories palpable. There lies the key to first-rate superhero movies, something few directors seem to have realized: they may have godlike powers, but deep down, superheroes are still human (well, Thor is technically an actual god, but you get my point). Whedon refuses to glorify his characters, showing them in all their messy imperfections and weaknesses so that they feel less like the flat archetypes that often dominate superhero movies than like real people.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the star of The Avengers is its phenomenal cast. If there's one thing that has remained consistent throughout the Marvel movies, it's the acting; The Incredible Hulk was saved single-handedly from utter mediocrity by Edward Norton's compelling performance, and even Iron Man 2 had Scarlett Johansson kicking ass and Sam Rockwell devouring scenery. You might think that stuffing so much (good-looking) talent into one 143-minute movie would be overkill, like forcing a pack of wolves to share one rabbit. On the contrary, the acting is what truly elevates The Avengers above ""just another superhero movie"", what makes it so compulsively watchable. Watching the actors ‚Äì Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johannson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hiddleston ‚Äì together on screen is a positively mind-blowing experience. As a group, their chemistry is fiery enough to light a small city, and as individuals, they alternately ooze charisma and vulnerability. I was particularly impressed by Johannson, who manages to exude feminist empowerment while fighting in a body-hugging leather suit, and Hiddleston, he of the startlingly expressive eyes and deliciously smug smirk, though it seems unfair to pick and choose when you have a cast as uniformly wonderful as this one. This is ensemble acting at its finest.<br/><br/>That said, I did have a few relatively minor problems. Given the fact that the majority of the movie does such a great job of balancing the action, comedy and drama, I found the climax a tad underwhelming. As pretentious as it sounds, I wish Whedon had supplemented the epic, CGI-heavy, property damage-laden battle sequence (which was thrilling, don't get me wrong) with something more emotionally resonant. It seems like a letdown to spend over two hours building these relationships, only to set them aside at the end. Judging from the audience reaction at my screening, though, most people didn't have an issue with this. Also, a familiarity with or a fondness for the previous Marvel films is preferable since The Avengers assumes that viewers already have some sort of relationship with the characters.<br/><br/>In two months, the Internet will inevitably be filled with debates over whether The Avengers is better than The Dark Knight Rises (The Amazing Spider-Man might join them, but to be honest, that one doesn't have the same level of anticipation as the others). And, if you'll allow me to be cynical for a second, those debates will inevitably boil down to this: The Dark Knight Rises is the serious, gritty one about timely political issues, whereas The Avengers is the fun, lighthearted one about s--- blowing up. Although both of those descriptions are accurate to some extent, they do a disservice to both movies. Counter to popular opinion, it's entirely possible to like Christopher Nolan's Batman films as pure entertainment rather than profound social commentaries, and although it may not have the thematic depth of The Dark Knight, The Avengers deserves to be taken more seriously than run-of-the-mill escapist fluff. Not only does it show (once again) that there is room in action blockbusters for actual acting, but it also makes an ardent case for the importance of superheroes: especially in our post-9/11 world of constant anxiety, they provide a comforting dose of old-fashioned values, hope for salvation from the anarchy. It's unashamed optimism, as opposed to The Dark Knight's secret idealism. Superheroes aren't here to save us from monsters, it says. They're here to save us from ourselves."

"seanebuckley","6","4","10","5 May 2012"," The Avengers!
","I would like to preface any comments i have regarding this movie with a confession, i never thought The Avengers Assemble would ever happen. Even when Marvel started to weave the characters and films together (rather cock handedly i thought) i still felt it would be a step too far. The main problem (or so i thought) would be to balance the characters and actors. Indeed, the very thought of Robert Downey Jnr, Edward Norton (replaced here by the excellent Mark Ruffalo), Chris Evans and Samuel L Jackson in the same film is enough to melt even the hardened film fans little heart. This perceived problem is definitely the films major strength, the way Joss Whedon (finally getting his props) allows each character their space to shine whilst adhering to the 'confines' of the super group is exemplary. None of the team are ever neglected, no matter how varied or relative their strengths seem to be. The obvious odd men out here, Hawkeye and Black Widow, get just as much screen time both kicking ass and burping exposition as Stark or Banner do. Its this care and attention that gives the movie its weight, that even when we are watching a 20 minute slew of explosions and flying kicks, we are still pondering the fragile dynamics of the group.<br/><br/>The action sequences, although never particularly groundbreaking, are never the less brilliant. Probably the shining light is the emergence of the Hulk. The Hulk has had a checkered cinematic past and its nice to see him finally get the treatment he deserves. Firstly, we get the fragile, brilliant and a little kooky Dr Banner. We are inundated with references to his dangerous 'other self', which serves to amp up excitement for the eventual breakout of Banners monstrous alter ego. We really get a sense of how dangerous The Hulk is, everyone on the team seems all to aware of his power none more so than Banner himself. Watching The Hulk single handedly take down one of the larger shark-like alien spacecrafts was utterly beguiling and left me reeling with excitement. The bench mark for marrying visual effects and emotion in this type of movie was Spiderman 2, to my mind at least. It was the perfect balance between caring for Peter Parker and believing in the power of his alter ego. That's exactly what we get in spades here, whether its watching Thor whipping up a storm, Iron Man deploying his TnT or Captain America wielding his starry shield.<br/><br/>Another particular strength is the films humour. Since Batman Begins we have been told that movies have to be darker, edgier and more realistic and whilst i love Batman Begins (and its sequel) i am growing tired of the trend. Here we have a movie that is peppered with fragrant, wholesome humour. Most of this is supplied by everyones favourite smart arse Tony Stark, his witty one liners prop up some of the more lengthy expository scenes and give them a welcoming zip. Also present is Whedons own brand of silly visual comedy which he honed on Buffy The Vampire Slayer. A few scenes continue past the usual action or emotional beat to great comedic effect, for example, after watching Hulk and Thor beat on a few faceless baddies we watch as they recover, the scene should end there but Whedon has us stay around just long enough to see Hulk knock Thor across the room with a single punch. The moment is simple but so effective, it breaks up any monotony accumulated in the drawn out action sequences, breathing fresh air into the proceedings.<br/><br/>Everyone (without exception) comes out of the film with their heads held high, even Scarlett Johansson impressed me as the manipulative Russian spy (Black Widow) and that is something i never thought i would say. I hear the argument that all the actors represented here aren't doing anything taxing or game changing but no matter how frivolous the entertainment may be it still takes some craft to make the world believable. Its Mark Ruffalo that steals the show as the tetchy Bruce Banner. It might be down to the unique fact that we have seen a few incarnations of this particular character over the years and therefore have a solid reference point(s) in which to examine Ruffalo's performance. Its his awkwardness that is the key to this performance, we had always seen Bruce as a gifted but tortured soul. Here Ruffalo plays it smoother, we get a man who is seemingly confident, articulate but broken it seems then, that he is always one step from the Hulk (as he states a one point in the film). The Hulk element isn't portrayed so much as an accident (as in previous incarnations) but as a dangerous personality trait of Banner himself. This is a much more allegorical reading of the character and a much more intelligent one. It is far too easy to write him off as an experiment gone wrong and ditch him as such. Banner learns to control his inner demon and tries to follow the path of the righteous man, well, as much as he can anyway.<br/><br/>This film easily represents the most satisfying instalment of the super hero movie genre. That's not to say its the quintessential super hero movie, but its the most watchable and enjoyable movie of its kind. It doesn't have The Dark Knight's brooding intellect nor does it have Watchemens genre critique but what it does have is fun. I couldn't believe leaving the cinema that the film was a whopping 2hrs 20minutes long, this is testament to the scripts strength and the films charm and charisma. Judging by the films opening box office receipts, i don't think i need to urge anybody to go see this movie but if its simple, loud fun you want you absolutely, positively cant go wrong with The Avengers Assemble."

","The Avengers (Or Avengers Assemble, as it's called over here) was MINDBLOWINGly awesome. It completely lived up to my expectations and then some. Son of Coul :( I loved that all of the characters had something to set them apart. That just made it so much more than your generic popcorn movie, it was funny, touching, exciting... Robert Downey Jr and Whedon are kind of made for each other. ""Performance issues..."" I was almost worried that, because of a few interviews I read where Robert Downey wanted Iron Man to carry the whole thing (seeing as the Iron Man franchise has done the best out of all of the other individual films), the Avengers was going to be Iron Man 2.5, but no. Oh Whedon. You'll never fail me. Despite Captain America being... the least interesting/least dimensional personality (IMO) of the Avengers, he came across brilliantly: a great balance of internal conflict/strong leadership. Thor was just... Brilliant. Chris Hemsworth doesn't play Thor, he IS Thor. That is all. The Hulk almost stole the entire show. After all the negativity and doubt I've seen directed at Ruffalo, he is hands down the best Banner so far. And the Hulk was just...incredible. Hawkeye and Widow worked really, really well. Much better than I'd expected. I friggin' LOVE Renner, and I love that he was part of a darker storyline, he's so good with dark. And Widow was definitely more substantial than I thought she'd be, that was a great scene with her and Loki. If the villain had been cheesy or one dimensional, the story wouldn't have worked. But Loki was amazing. Hiddleston (aka the nicest man in show business) just owned that role. And although Sam Jackson didn't get to say ""I have had it with these motherfuckin' Chitari breaking motherfuckin' New York!"", he did get to shoot a bazooka. Win. As well as adding his trademark wit and humour, there were dozens of other Wheonesque touches that really brought the film together, eg the news report at the end, where people were lighting candles for the casualties. That doesn't really happen in most superhero movies, either the entire city is miraculously evacuated, or the dead aren't acknowledged. Yeah, saw it twice this weekend. I am one happy fan :D"

Avid readers of the Marvel series would deem that justice had been done to the characters. The scenes where Tony Stark didn't get along with the rest of the superheroes were filled with comic relief. I for one wasn't exactly a fan of Captain America before watching this movie, though I had seen him in action in the Spiderman and his amazing friends show, he wasn't as impressive as the people would deem the first ever superhero would be, but the Avengers movie gave me a whole new perspective to the character. The final scenes had people gasping in shock and awe as to whether Tony Stark would survive And the phone call Jarvis made to Pepper Potts had everyone on the edge of their seats.. Avengers- A must Watch!!"

","As 10/10 as it gets!<br/><br/>What makes Marvel great is that each of their Avenger solo studio films are packed with emotion and draws the audience in with relatable characters. The viewer cares about them and gets invested in to their story and character development. Now, magnify that times ten! Add way better action then we've seen from them in the past and you get the greatest genre work ever put to film with the Avengers. This movie more than lives up to the hype! <br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat several times during the film and I can't believe how fast over two hours flew by. Avengers is THE best comic adaptation film of all-time, period and end of story. That doesn't take away from past exceptionalism, even past Marvel films themselves but Avengers just delivers beyond what we've seen before from anyone. As good as Spider-Man 2 or TDK were, you really can't compare them because they operate on a smaller canvas and deliver far less notes. After seeing Avengers, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you're being honest with yourself and fair to the movie itself."
"the_rattlesnake25","8","4","10","27 April 2012"," Joss Whedon Has Done It Right And Well
","With the success of Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man' in 2008, calls started ringing out across the comic book universe for not only further comic book movies, but also for the 'The Holy Grail of Cinematic Superheroes,' which is also known as an 'Avengers' film. What followed was four more Marvel Universe movies, the introduction of many favoured and established characters and the continual teasing of fans across the globe with post-credit sequences. The introduction of Samuel L. Jackson as Commander Nick Fury inevitably announced to fans that an 'Avengers' movie would come to fruition and it brought forth the key question of when rather than where, who and why.<br/><br/>The man tasked with throwing all these vibrant characters into a smouldering cauldron of excitement and pure unadulterated geekiness is one Joss Whedon. He's already created three incredibly successful television shows and an incredibly successful tie-in movie in 'Serenity,' but this is undoubtedly his biggest challenge to date. Today sees the release of 'The Avengers' (or 'Avengers Assemble' in the United Kingdom) across the globe, and while it contains evident flaws, it's nothing short of a two hour canonical ride across the Marvel Universe which provides everything to satisfy fans, nerds and casual cinema-goers alike.<br/><br/>Buried deep beneath a Government facility is the mystical cube known as the tesseract. When it begins to mysteriously start operating by itself Commander Nick Fury, and his agents Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), unexpectedly come face-to-face with the Asgard deity Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The God is being seemingly controlled by a higher being, with but one simple, yet distinct aim, to control, enslave and destroy the Earth and humanity. With reluctance, Fury initiates the 'Avengers' protocol, which brings together the rag-tag team of superheroes consisting of: Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the Asgard God Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Clint 'Hawkeye' Barton (Jeremy Renner), the Black Widow Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and the unpredictable Dr Banner (Mark Ruffalo).<br/><br/>Where 'The Avengers' had the ability to fall pretty darn hard was with the amount of material ready at hand. Joss Whedon could've potentially created a ten-hour-three-film epic without even scratching the surface of what drives these beings to do what they do. Instead, in the running time which extends to just over two hours, he's created an intimate and humanised portrayal of six individuals who may be Gods, geniuses, super-human beings and destructive radioactive experiments on the outside, but all reflect deep, inner trauma on the inside.<br/><br/>The initial meetings between the characters show an element of distrust and reluctance. Why should one be subordinate to others when, by all accounts in their own minds, they all have the better technology, powers or intellect? With their flaws prominently on show from the beginning Whedon doesn't just show the audience superheroes, but he creates them before your own eyes. Building these characters from the inside, outside he allows the audience to empathise with their plights. After all, Thor is simply an Asgardian God with family issues, Dr Banner simply wants to be left alone in isolation to his own devices, and Black Widow and Hawkeye seem to battling those basic primal urges that come with humanity and prolonged friendship.<br/><br/>But one character that does continually feel out of place is the antagonist of the piece, Loki. Despite Tom Hiddleston creating a superb maniacal villain with thespian traits who thrives on power and destruction, it's hard to shake-off the fact that Loki he is constantly being undermined by those pulling his puppeteering strings. Yet, this should not detract away from his performance which constantly steals the show whenever he is on-screen with other members of the Avengers initiative, and which can be partly attributed to Josh Whedon and Zak Penn's slick screenplay.<br/><br/>The script contains some suspect writing in places, especially with regards to Dr Banner and some of the more unusually up-beat and intellectually void phrases he spouts. But aside from the odd sentence here or there, Whedon and Penn's script manages to combine the right mix or humour, bravado and arrogance allowing, not only each character's personality to thrive, but also the plot to be continually be driven forward. Whether it's the blossoming relationship between two prominent superheroes or the developing nature of the narrative, the film is never stagnant, and it's this plot development which gives Joss Whedon the ability to let his comic book geekdom roam free in the final act with an enthralling visual action-orientated conclusion.<br/><br/>Starting in Manhattan, the action takes place on the ground, in the air, inside buildings and generally anywhere where there's an enough room to photograph a glorious all battle of good versus evil. Explosions saturate the air, but there's also an enjoyable emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, especially when the likes of Hawkeye, Black Widow and Captain America are left without their weapons. Beautifully choreographed, fast, frenetic and aesthetically pleasing the final thirty minutes are a fitting and welcome conclusion to an epic comic book movie. Joss Whedon hasn't only managed to finally bring the six glorious superheroes to the big-screen. But he's also also managed to do it well, very well."
"rj-crick","8","4","10","26 April 2012"," Damn near perfect
","The movie starts off slow while the plot takes shape and everyone is brought up to speed on the threat the Earth will soon face. A little too much time is spent with the 'peripheral' characters; black widow, Hawkman and Fury but from the moment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with Loki, the film picks up pace. What follows is entertaining but I think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of delivering expectations. For example a fight match-up that was mean't for the big-screen including two of the most powerful of the entourage left me asking for more. All is forgiven though as the action gets better and better throughout and by then end when you think you've seen the finale it just keeps going. The last 30 minutes of the film is the best of any superhero flick to date though I do wonder if the budget for CGI could have been spread across the earlier parts of the film less thinly. The humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material not seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes. One of the heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesn't get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show off like the others so if you happened to pick this one as a favorite you might be a little disappointed if not for the fact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass."

All the actors did a great job portraying their role, and the visual effects are amazing, my favorite character in this movie is ""Hulk"", I mean I hate him in the other movies, but in this film, whoa he's great, he's strong and heavy (Funny when he smash ""Thor""), and Black Widow, whoa... she's not only hot but she's also dangerous, well overall it was an amazing experience.

I expected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes, and that's what you get, world class entertainment. I enjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give a bigger meaning. Also this movie has a chunk of comedy, not the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you a laugh but not take away the seriousness of the film (too much). It was clich√© but what can you expect. The actor's are flawless and keep up with who they are meant to be. The only part I really didn't like, but also didn't expect was the lack of feeling. A lot of the good movies I watch I come out feeling different, like the movie has effected me, but I felt nothing, (except for one part but it wasn't enough to give a real feeling to the movie). All in all, this is an action packed movie, sure to give you entertainment, not boring at all, funny, has some smart moments and a must see movie for anyone."

"whitegorilla187","10","4","10","21 April 2012"," LA Early Screening Review....UNBIASED!! No Spoilers!
","I am not going to go into any spoilers or tell people to go see this movie, I am sure if you are reading these review you are already going to go see the movie. I also will not go into all the awesome things that went down at this early screening in Century City like; an unexpected visit by some major people who were lightly involved with the movie..........nobody that contributed that much..just Joss Whedon, Kevin Feige, Chris Hemsworth, and Loki himself, Tom Hiddleston but who cares about that, oh wait.....everybody there!!!<br/><br/>OK so now for the review....I believe this movie is everything it is hyped up to be, I am not going to go into all the things I could praise about this movie because there are so many things and it would take awhile. HOWEVER, I will state the two things that I have a minor ""PROBLEM"" with and should be the only ""COMPLAINTS"" about this movie. 1. Joss Whedon said that he CUT the original movie down from 3 HOURS down to 2 hours and 15 minutes, this is something you will definitely notice if you pay enough attention. This leaves room for some ""out of place"" scenes and some fully unexplained situations, but I am guessing it was the studio's decision to do this so don't blame Joss because he did a great job with this enormous task. 2. The reason why this film might gain LESS critical ACCLAMATION then dark knight rises, or ANY OTHER comic book movie, is because of the huge load of Characters that this movie has to balance. I am not saying they are not handled perfectly, BUT it is still much different then a movie with ONE central HERO. All of these main heroes have had their OWN movies, you will need to remember this in order to properly weigh how Joss Whedon handled all of them together. <br/><br/>Overall, I think almost anybody will thoroughly enjoy this movie, whether you just like action movies or whether you sit around waiting for new Avengers news to come out. I am a big Marvel fan and I was very speculative about this movie on whether it would be a worthy representation of the Avengers and it completely delivers. Support this movie so that we can have more and more like it."

"evan_harvey","5","22","91","25 April 2012"," Was it great? No. Good? Only just...
","Lots of money, lots of CGI, high-powered cast, half-assed story. That about sums up the latest Joss Whedon extravaganza.<br/><br/>**spoilers** The story: clunky. It doesn't flow easily. Joss Whedon's script is okay, and even hints at deeper themes, but is ultimately a bit tacky and shallow. Some welcome laughs here and there, but pretty average scripting.<br/><br/>IMDb at time of writing has it at 8.6. 8.6? Not even close. Flat 7 at best. I'm giving it 5 because, for all that money (and there was a hell of a lot of it), it's a pretty poor effort.<br/><br/>Big time films seem to be in a trend of having convoluted stories rather than great storytelling, and The Avengers follows that trend. The whole ""causing dissension among the ranks"" fails significantly because it relies on the super-heroes forgetting all the struggles & personal growth they've been through in previous films. The Avengers tries to present them as reluctant, and egotistical (which of course they luckily overcome), but they've already been through things like this in their own films. Why have they regressed? Perhaps the reason is that Hollywood largely eschews the time-tested concept of character growth for flashy SFX that the kiddies like so much. It's sad, and results in hollow films. Like The Avengers, for example.<br/><br/>The CGI: Pretty good, but has flying worms ala the latest Transformers flick, but not as cool.<br/><br/>The cast: Not too bad. Scarlett Johansson in a tight outfit, and the usual cast of Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans etc etc.<br/><br/>Overall, it's got high-wattage stars, lots of CGI, and not much impact, tension or heart.<br/><br/>Better than Battleship (as if that was hard), not as good as Iron Man 1. Enjoyable and immediately forgettable. It'll make loads of money and probably even a sequel."

","Don't know what people linked in the movie... the action starts pretty late almost 1 hr into the film, action sequences pretty common based in city streets as seen in a few other movies, though little comedy by hulk makes action scenes bearable. One other thing ""why would the army build by Loki be of aliens""... thats funny right, why will be the person claiming to be God have an army of powerless aliens with guns and spaceships...The first hour of the movie is a bit drag and feels like the director had to try real hard to put things together to make some sense (which totally did not) and after that what the movie offers in the second hour is not all that great to have waited 1 hour to get to that."
"jnumenski","6","5","14","12 May 2012"," The people who rated this film have to be under 15 years of age
","First off. There is no way this film is even close to a 9 rating (it's at 8.8 or something now) NO WAY.<br/><br/>The people who are saying the film is a 9 are most likely hyper teenagers who sit home all day, and don't read anything, and watch reality TV - they don't know what is good and what is terrible.<br/><br/>This film is dull. Has no emotion (forced doesn't count), and often times is ridiculous. Though what saves it is the fact it makes fun of itself which is funny. Normally I would rate really low but that humour makes it a little better.<br/><br/>It was well done for what it is. But I think what happened is the last few comic book movies (except for batman) were so bad that people were surprised with this one, expecting it to suck. So I read things like this is the greatest film ever, or ""A+"" rating. You have to be joking.<br/><br/>One of the things that really gets to me is one part in particular. The HULK Is this un-controllable force. He almost destroys the ship. <br/><br/>Makes sense.<br/><br/>Then next thing you know he is fighting ALONG with the avengers. UM..HELLO!!?? how the hell did that happen. Oh they magically tamed the beast or something? Banner says ""my secret is I always stay angry"" (something like that) and then turns into the hulk and starts fighting the aliens. This makes no sense.<br/><br/>So if he had this mentality all along why did he want to kill everyone on the ship? Nothing was learned. I mean he saves Iron Man later. But on the ship he wanted to kill Thor and others. ????? HUGE GAP. Anyone with half a brain would question this. <br/><br/>I enjoy watching this more in cartoon form because the ridiculousness makes sense."
"mykedee","8","5","14","4 May 2012"," Decent film, not as good as the 8+ ratings suggests
","Better than other Marvel movies with the possible exception of Capt America. It has the look down! Heroes we grew up with are on screen together. It gets you stoked! But the action felt rushed and the story is suspect. However what is hard to figure out, is how Mr. Whedon could have made the film any better. I think 'Good' is probably the best you can achieve when making such a film as the Avengers. Too many heroes, not enough time to create a cohesive story, and not enough time to care about what's going on. So basically, surrender and enjoy a good summer film.<br/><br/>It would have been nice if it was 3 hours long. Then we could have enjoyed more story and possibly connected better with the characters, as well as had better, more complete action. There is another huge issue I had with the film. Basically its an action flick. So the action has to be tip top! But I think the action could have been much better. Thor v Iron Man, definitely should have been longer. Thor v Hulk should have been more of an isolated knock down drag out fight. The Heroes should have displayed their might more. Instead we got good looking scuffles that kinda felt out of place and cut short in most cases. The ending sums up how the action fell just a bit short. Hulk taking out Loki?! In the comics that would not have been easy. Loki is a magical demigod. No way could Loki have been easily approached and whipped like that. But it felt like Whedon needed to get the movie over with quickly. And at the time, I was ready for it to end.<br/><br/>Character development fell short in a couple of cases. When Hawkeye was compromised, it was like so what? The aliens Loki used were an unexplained bunch. The Chitaru felt like Darth Vadar's pawns from Star Wars. There was no way you felt like the Chitaru were a threat at all! The Chitaru were there to be killed until the heroes were able to take Loki down. I mean if I were a demigod, would I show up with the Chitaru? I think not!<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie, is the fact the movie finally made it to the big screen. I have waited 35+ years for this. I was an avid comic book collector as a kid, and the Avengers was always the comic book my friends and I wanted to see come true. So I truly enjoyed the visuals. <br/><br/>So here it is, finally on the big screen. Enjoy it!! But don't expect depth and emotional connection to the characters, like the Dark Knight franchise. Which, by the way, is a much better franchise. 7/10"
"kris_zack23","1","10","35","5 May 2013"," Cheap plot, but good action scenes though
","The plot is very bad and very predictable, this is just a regular comic book movie with a great action scenes and CGI. But the story messed it all. Loki as the main villain is very bad. He didn't look as great as Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight The Avengers kinda focused only on Iron Man. It should be called Iron Man and Friends. Hawkeye and Black Widow need a bigger role. The Hulk pants doesn't really logical isn't it? Joss Whedon screw this movie. It doesn't come up to my expectations even though everybody calling it a very good movie. Captain America and Thor fight should be won easily by Thor, it doesn't really make sense how Cap could be evenly strong as Thor. The ending is bad too. Are you serious right now, Joss Whedon? Waking Iron Man up with a scream from The hulk?"

","This movie is rated as an 8.8 at the time of my writing this and I fully expect that to come down considerably now that all the fanboys (and girls) are finished pumping it up. The characters could spend 2 hrs napping and the fanboys would still give this movie a 9 or 10. It's like that with any movie franchise - those most predisposed to loving it are the first ones to see it and rave about it, as well as overlook the obvious faults.<br/><br/>Now that the rest of us are going to see it (and review it) that rating will reflect what the movie really is: A CGI fest that's really kind of mediocre. If it weren't for the very funny moments that punctuate the film, this movie would flat-out stink. It's riddled with cheesy clich√©s and seems more geared towards 10-13 yr-olds than to adults.<br/><br/>I really like ""Iron Man"", loved IM2, enjoyed ""Thor"", and was indifferent towards ""Cpt. America"". This movie was definitely the weakest."

"rolex922","5","8","27","30 April 2012"," Not great but certainly mildly entertaining...
","I certainly have an affection for the Marvel universe and some of the vast catalogue of recent films have been decent efforts. This one is certainly a decent effort but it's not the thrill ride you would expect from such a stellar line up.<br/><br/>The plot is basically ""evil god tries to take over the world...and would have come close if it hadn't been for those meddlin' heroes...yadda, yadda"" Well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>CAST: There are some great actors in this movie who do a decent job with what they have to work with:- Iron Man, Thor & Hulk (especially) are the real backbone for me. There are some miscasts here are well:- Black Widow, Loki & the almost instantly forgettable, Hawkeye. <br/><br/>SJ as Widow just doesn't fit for me. She's a great actress but not really an action hero. The dialogue is poor and she doesn't seem to know what attitude the character should portray. <br/><br/>TH as Loki, he just doesn't seem to have been written a great part but there's something not mischievous enough about his portrayal. He neither hams it up or puts any sort of humour into the part.<br/><br/>JR as Hawkeye has no screen presence or can manage any sort of chemistry with SJ when they are attempting to give some sort of validity to their respective part in this tale. It's all very wooden. That mainly comes from the limp script they're both given. Instantly forgettable.<br/><br/>One mention should go to Samuel Jackson - dude looks as bored doing this as he did doing Star Wars! Surely he's rich and famous enough to go back to decent acting jobs, such as Long Kiss Goodnight? ;)<br/><br/>PLOT: Too many threads makes this a long film (although it doesn't drag on). The setup seems to be mainly a precursor to getting The Hulk into the action. It's very wordy but it's not too much in-between huge bouts of action.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Pseudo BS (as all these movies are). There's a smattering of humour (really only from Stark) but in the main it's bearable. There are character weaknesses, like I've said above, but it ain't the script you came for and this isn't Shakespeare.<br/><br/>ACTION/EFFECTS: My god, this looks great, even the 3D is pretty effective. There are some 'dull' action scenes (particularly the fight between Thor and Iron Man...Zzzz) but in the main, it's decently directed. One point of note though. Some of the 3D shots are so out of place it's laughable. Towards the end there's a shot through a cab rear window and it completely stops any flow the movie had for a second or two. Bizarre! There are more but that one just struck me out of the blue.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Not the best Marvel film and certainly not on par with other comic book films such as; X-men First Class, Nolan's Batman/Dark Knight or Raimie's initial Spiderman reboot but it's certainly better than Captain America and Green Lantern. The latter being one of the worst films I think I've ever paid to see."
"SquigglyCrunch","6","3","7","2 November 2015"," Another Action Movie
","When this movie first came out I was somewhat excited. I hadn't seen ratings like that very often (8.8 right off the bat), and I was fairly new to IMDb at the time too. Unfortunately, it really wasn't anything special. <br/><br/>The plot itself is pretty lackluster. It's just an average action movie in terms of story. Sure, there's nothing really wrong with that, but nevertheless it wasn't very well-done.<br/><br/>The characters are just the same as the plot: nothing special. Sure, we get lots of looks at how well they fight, as well as a little bit of arguing, but that's about it. The character development wasn't amazing in this movie. Sure, they had the other Marvel movies to develop the characters separately, but that's hardly an excuse not to put effort into this movie. <br/><br/>The action, which is the only thing The Avengers contains, is all just fine. Everyone's just extremely overpowered, human or not, to an unrealistic level. Overdone fights aren't really my thing, considering how commonly we see them. <br/><br/>Overall The Avengers is nothing special. Sure, it was risky for Joss Whedon to put all the Marvel characters into one universe, and he actually pulled it off, but giving points to this movie for that is like giving it points for it's creation. The character and plot were very average, and the action was rather un-amusing. The Avengers is heavily overrated in my opinion, and I personally wouldn't recommend it."

And despite the dull NYC ""big finale"", there was some exciting Summer spectacle herein (mostly in the fight scenes). But my favorite parts were during the quieter moments, when all the noise and CGI were dialed down. The movie works best when it's a bunch of competing heroes thrown together in a room. When the egos and styles clash, Whedon's rhythms and sense of humor blossom.<br/><br/>But it does its job admirably, and lends itself to serious popcorn-munching.<br/><br/>7/10"

This is clearly a movie made for fans of Marvel and Joss Whedon does such a great job with respecting the source material, handling all these egotistical superheroes with different personalities and giving them all an equal amount of screen time while making all the fans happy with this film and so far, the only other comic book movie directors who have been able to pull that off are Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn with the X-Men films.<br/><br/>The way the characters interact and play off one another is done perfectly here and while there isn't a lot of character growth in The Avengers as that was what the set-up films were for, Joss does a wonderful job making the interactions between the lead characters feel more real. You might think that with so much going on that the movie would collapse under it's humongous expectations, but thanks to Whedon's directing and writing, the film works wonderfully. The dialog had me laughing my ass off more then a few times while I was watching the film The acting couldn't be better with each actor bringing their acting chops to the table and putting it to good use.<br/><br/>I honesty can't see anyone else play Tony Stark/Iron Man other than Robert Downey Jr. He slips into the role so easily, allowing his charm and appeal to shire through and he has some of the best lines in the film. Chris Evans hardens himself in this film as Capitan America/Steve Rogers and truly owns the role in this film bringing a great deal of heart and genuineness to the role and the dialog between him and Stark teases later events in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth once again rocks it as Thor by being more honorable and less conceited not to mention having quite a few funny moments throughout the film. Scarlett Johansson is great as Black Window and proves that she is more than just a pretty face and kicks some serious ass during the battle scenes. The one character that didn't get enough screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, but thankfully, he isn't chucked aside and does a splendid job playing this character. Hawkeye is right up there with Legolas and Robin Hood as one of the best archers to ever adorn the movie screen. Being the most current actor to play The Hulk, Mark Ruffalo does a great job playing both the angry green giant and the nerdy Bruce Banner with incredible ease and while I do prefer Edward Norton as the Hulk, Mark is a fine replacement and during the film, the Hulk is at his most imposing in the final battle and the scene where he smashes Loki into the floor is just awesome. Samuel L. Jackson gets to stretch his legs a bit as Nick Fury in this film and he glides easily into the role. Clark Gregg returns as Agent Coulson, Cobie Smulders adds a nice touch as Agent Maria Hill and Stellen Skarsgard pops up again as Dr. Eric Selvig as does Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots, but Tom Hiddleson is the true star of this movie as Thor's villainous half-brother, Loki and one would think that a role like this would be difficult to play dealing with all of these strong personalities and overwhelming individuals, but Tom nails it and his performance shouldn't be ignored, because it's one of the movie's strong points and Hiddleston comes across as a scheming megalomaniac but without being cartoonish or over the top and he steals the movie every time he's on screen, but Tom also handles the comedy incredibly well with his exchange with Robert Downey Jr. being extremely funny.<br/><br/>With a run time of just over 2 hours, the film has a great pace and never once did I get bored while I was watching it. The special effects are state of the art, the musical score by Alan Silvesteri works very well and the action is some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. No body feels cheated when it comes to the battle scenes and the final battle in New York is right up there with the battle of Helm's Deep and the assault on the Death Starr as one of the best on-screen battles ever and the climax delivers an earsplitting level of action that is breathtaking and awesome to behold. Also, be sure to stick around for an end credits scene which provides a nice little set up for future Marvel films.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with pretty high expectations and all of them were met. While this movie isn't the best superhero film in my opinion, there is no doubt in my mind that The Avengers is a purely awesome film. It should be watched by any comic book film fan. So go give it a watch if you haven't already, you'll enjoy it."
"sammy_kol","10","3","7","29 January 2015"," Awesome
","A truly fantastic movie and the first of its kind. Marvel did a terrific job. Way to go. Making so many superhero movies and connecting all to each other is a hell of a job. When it all started with Iron Man (2008), no one could imagine that the franchise would grow this big. All because of Marvel we were able to enjoy this movie. Only months remaining for Age of Ultron to come and I'm sure that will surpass this movie too. Tom Hiddleston did a great job in the movie as Loki. Robert Downey Jr. was always great as usual. And along with him every other actor namely Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel Jackson. Special mention Cobie Smulders and Clark Gregg!!!!!"
"anshu-2894","10","3","7","13 January 2015"," Best superhero movie till date
","Hands down, best superhero movie till date. It had the right mix of story and action sequences. The movie spends the first half of its time in building the story. Although Marvel had already laid some foundation for this story in its previous movies. (Tesseract was seen in Captain America: The First Avenger) The second half of the movie is where you get to see all the action, hulk smashing the giant flying robot, hulk smashing Loki and hulk saving iron man. Geez, it seems like hulk was really enjoying himself out there. Well, coming back to the story so, S.H.I.E.L.D was trying to harness tesseract energy and thus it fell on the radar of the Loki(or we should say thanos). Now, Loki had made this deal with thanos that he will deliver tesseract to him if he helps him in conquering earth. So, Loki arrives on earth, steals the tesseract from SHIELD and uses it to create a portal and call an army. Now, it's up to avengers, our superheroes to stop Loki and save earth. The movie is packed with pretty bad-ass fighting scenes. You get to see the battle between Thor and iron man. You also get to see Thor using his hammer on captain America's shield. And of course, then there is the battle between avengers and Loki's army. Coming to characters, I think movie mostly revolves around iron man, Loki and hulk. Captain America seemed useless in this movie. Hope they use him in a better way in next avengers. Loki is clearly one of the wittiest characters in the marvel universe. NO wonder why people love him. All in all its a true entertainer and like I said the best superhero movie till date. If you haven't watched this movie then don't wait any longer. Just watch it and see hulk SMASH!!"
"joshtorzillo","5","3","7","10 October 2014"," Super Heroes, Less Than Super Movie
","This movie just did not do it for me. The movie was a box office hit: it made $623,279,547 in the United States alone, and is third on the list of top grossing films of all time. However, a movie's earnings do not suggest it was a great film. Obviously the concept was a hit: comic book superheroes converging to save earth and fight interstellar enemies. I just think the movie was flat, though. I myself am not a comic book enthusiast, so I do not personally care for superheroes and the sort, but the movie itself just seemed so bland. The characters actions seemed forced and there was just too much action for the movie to have any sort of depth. Of course, there had to be action, since they are superheroes, but I just felt like so much more could have been done with the film. I did not think the actors did very well, either. I think it was just the film, though: most of them are great actors. Crossovers and ensemble character films usually do not do well, and this film is a prime example. It was bland, predictable, and lacking in many fields, such as character depth and plot. Maybe it is just my own aversion to comic book films, specifically Marvel ones (I did not even like Guardians... shoot me now!), but I think many would agree with me in saying this summer blockbuster was severely underwhelming. There was nothing ""Incredible"", ""Mighty"", or ""Iron"" about it."
"TheRogueTomato","9","3","7","7 September 2014"," One of the best superhero movies ever
","I rarely go to the theater to see a movie, but this one had me going twice. And I've watched it another few times on Netflix. It is exactly what a superhero movie should be: Exciting, fun, and funny. <br/><br/>Yes, there are plot holes, contradictions, and absurdities in this movie. I couldn't even list them all without turning this review into a novel full of spoilers. But the bottom line for this and any movie in this genre is, did you enjoy it? And I enjoyed the hell out of it. <br/><br/>If you're the type who goes to a movie to nit-pick about every aspect that requires a suspension of disbelief, then you'll hate this movie. And you are to be pitied, because you'll hate just about EVERY movie. The rest of us will be so entertained that we'll have a blast while we watch it, and then laugh about the silliness afterward."
"scornwillow","6","3","7","24 August 2014"," Overrated, Clich√© Marvel Film
","Never saw it in the movie theater, but I had heard that it was great, and awesome. After some time it finally hit DVD, so I rented it, and I was completely disappointed. There was nothing amazing about it. The acting was okay, the story was meh, and the villain (which in my opinion is a big part of a super hero film) was just awful. People don't know about movies now a days, the fact that the quote ""Best Super hero move of all time"" is printed on the DVD cover, really makes me doubt the film industry today. If this mess of a movie can make over a billion dollars at the box office, and Masterpieces can't even get 100 millions is disheartening. Hands down the most over rated movie of all time. It's bland, its clich√© and I don't understand how people can eat this crap up."
"thedudeabides-2","10","3","7","21 August 2014"," Ridiculously good fun
","Way back in 2008, Marvel decided to make a movie version of one of their lesser known comic book characters: Iron Man. Of course, we are now familiar with the character and the success Marvel have enjoyed but it was a bit of a risky move for them. What was even riskier was the idea that they would follow up with a number of origin movies for their other superheroes, before throwing them all into one huge summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>It seemed destined to fail, such was its ambition, and yet, somehow, they have pulled it off. Avengers Assemble is not the best comic book movie ever made but it is probably the most fun. Marvel's biggest coup was hiring Joss Whedon to write and direct the movie. Whedon, who had already written a number of comic books before being asked to take on Avengers, is extremely comfortable with all of the characters, giving almost everyone a fair share of the runtime. <br/><br/>One of the best things about Avengers Assemble is the dialogue; it is quite a feat to make a movie about a group of superheroes saving the world, and yet some of the best scenes are just two people talking. That is not to say there isn't some mind blowing action, with some of our childhood favourites slugging it out against each other before uniting against a common enemy, but it is often the verbal sparring which will have you grinning the widest.<br/><br/>The cast are all on top form with Downey Jr. being the star attraction, but the best character in the whole movie is not human, and perhaps not even a superhero. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is an incredible feat, especially when you consider the previous incarnations of the character, and he is heavily involved in many of the movie's best scenes. <br/><br/>Possibly the most ambitious project to come out of Hollywood since four hobbits set off to destroy a magical ring; Avengers Assemble is a resounding success, ticking all the right boxes and leaving you wanting more."
"PStyles","6","3","7","23 July 2014"," Despite a Cast of A-List Stars, ""The Avengers"" is Just Another Superhero Movie
","I will start out by saying that overall, I did enjoy this film. I feel like the rating system here on IMDb is used so incorrectly by the majority of folks who use it. For example, if someone loved this movie, they give it a 10. If they didn't like it, they give it a 1, where the truth actually lies somewhere in the middle. Everything is NOT black and white in movies, and I feel like this movie is an unfortunate byproduct of that misconception. With a star studded cast and some pretty incredible visuals, ""The Avengers"" does many things well that a superhero movie should. What this movie doesn't do well is deliver a unique ""gosh that's the best superhero movie i've ever seen!"" experience, despite what the inflated rating would tell you. <br/><br/>The plot of ""The Avengers"" features a pretty basic premise; The US government, naive to their own research on a mysterious object called the Tesseract, accidentally opens a rift to another world allowing the Norse god Loki to enter Earth and essentially wreak havoc. This of course leads to the formation of ""The Avengers"", which is a collection of Marvel superheroes that many of you will recognize, either from the comic books or previous Marvel films. Together, under ""The Avengers initiative"", these superheroes go to battle with Loki over the sacred Tesseract which, when wielded by Loki, can open a rift to another dimension and potentially end the world as we know it. Sound familiar? It should, as this general pretense has been used many times over in the past. While the plot doesn't feature any large holes, it also doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, either. You can expect many ""mini"" battles between Loki and the heroes along the way, ultimately leading to the ""final showdown"" of the film. This is superhero movie 101, and while it works for all intensive purposes, ""The Avengers"" hardly innovates the genre in any way. Based on it's high rating, I had expected a somewhat unique experience for a superhero movie, but I was unfortunately let down in this regard. The movie does pace itself quite well, however, which kept me interested throughout. If there is one thing ""The Avengers"" does very well, it's keeping the viewer interested without any serious lulls in the action. <br/><br/>Next up is the acting/casting. This movie is literally jam packed with famous actors/actresses, from Robert Downey Jr. as the always recognizable Iron Man(my personal favorite from not just these films but all in the Marvel collection), Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, and Chris Hemsworth returning as Thor(my second favorite of these characters). There are many others, from Scarlett Johansson, to Samuel L. Jackson, to Jeremy Renner, etc etc. You get the idea. There are lots of famous people in this movie. The acting from these heavyweights of the industry is generally very good, despite a pretty generic script. You can expect a lot of cheesy one-liners, petty arguments, and general ""i'm a better superhero than you"" moments throughout the script. With a lack of clever writing and, in my honest opinion, a truly despicable villain(Loki just doesn't do it for me, sorry. He looks like a 15 year old boy with a deer helmet), ""The Avengers"" has a hard time distinguishing itself from the pack, despite all the talented actors involved with this film. One could really make the argument that the talented actors casted for this film ARE what makes the movie above average, because they really have to make the most out of what they are given in the script. <br/><br/>Overall, ""The Avengers"" offers an exciting, albeit predictable, superhero experience. The actors bring their A-game for this film and the electricity between them definitely makes this movie better. I do have to say I felt a bit of nostalgia watching some of my favorite heroes from childhood band together on the big screen to battle evil. Despite it's fairly long runtime, ""The Avengers"" kept me interested from start to finish even if I cringed at some of the writing from time to time. Overall though, I think it was the villain, Loki, who brought the viewing experience down for me. He just isn't believable as a true villain, and the ""twist"" at the end will leave you feeling pretty underwhelmed. Despite these fall backs, though, this is still an enjoyable film to watch. If you expect something more than a 2 hour superhero romp coming into this, you may find yourself a bit disappointed like I was. If you come into this thinking that you will see some cool superhero action and some great actors, you will be much better off. ""The Avengers"" is a cool superhero movie, but in my opinion, nothing more. This film isn't American Beauty or even the Dark Knight(best superhero movie ever IMO), so as long as you temper your expectations, you will more than likely enjoy ""The Avengers"". <br/><br/>For an exciting, if somewhat underwhelming, superhero experience, I give ""The Avengers"" a solid 6/10."
"mckenna366","3","3","7","11 July 2014"," It's amazing how much eye candy now influences the film industry.
","I shall start this review by mentioning the fact that The Avengers is one of the most overrated movies of all time. It's simply awful. If you agree with the large fanbase of idiots who enjoyed this film listen carefully. Joss Wheadon is an autistic oversized 5 year old who crammed his dreams and aspirations of being a superhero into a big budget, eye pleasing blockbuster with less than mediocre acting and terrible green screen. The storyline is so tedious (I don't even care if it's based on a popular comic series) that i wouldn't be surprised if a 5 year old wrote this movie. There is an incredible amount of bad acting (which deserves to be in a junior school play) displayed by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Huddlestone (despite being the only credited actor I respect on this film. Now you may argue that Robert-Downey Jr. is an amazing actor, but I disagree. His ego flourishes as Tony Stark which displays his incapicity to act in various roles. SUMMARY: The Avengers is an extremely overrated film which is no where near on the level as Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". It contains poor script writing, cheesy effects, acting and directing. I can already tell what Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is going to be like, and I have no doubt that the eye candy and cheesy jokes will brainwash 90% of the general public to like it."

","Failing to fins a suitable villain the writers then patently failed to think of a decent story, but they still had 2 hours and 20 minutes of movie to fill. So what to do? Probably after several drinks and very late at night, someone had a bright idea: Let's pit the Avengers against each other! That'll fill at least 90 minutes of movie.<br/><br/>And so we get a lot of contrived situations where one Avenger goes up against another. Of course, you can't pit a puny human against a demi-god, or the Hulk, or Iron Man, so the combinations are limited. Hawk-eye versus the Black Widow, Thor versus Iron Man, Thor versus Captain America, and so on.<br/><br/>Having exhausted all those possibilities, we finally get to the main action against the 'baddies'. For a supposed invasion of Earth, we get to see a dozen troop carriers, with about 1000 troops, who proceed to randomly shoot at anything and everything. Cue nuclear blast and the story ends.<br/><br/>And there we are. A film that's just one fight after another, with characters making senseless decisions, with indestructible heroes that defy the laws of physics, and SFX that detract rather than add to the experience.<br/><br/>And then there are the plot holes, and there are dozens of them. There are so many of them that it would take me 2 hours and 20 minutes just to list them.<br/><br/>If you want a film devoid of plot, with action sequences you can't follow, with a pitiful ending, then the Avengers is the film for you."

","Sure, the special effects are amazing: if you remember the ""FF"" movies that are just a decade old, they appear now totally outmoded. If you compare with the ""Transformers"" that are more recent, sure, the movie is better visualized: it isn't a change of shoot each second, it's more focused about the characters and less on pure crazy action thus you can follow what happens. Sure, the casting is experimented and it was cool to see that Johnny Storm has become Steve Rogers as the actor was really cool in the aforementioned ""FF"" movies. Sure, it has some good lines (about Legolas), a real understanding of those icons (example: Hulk trying to move Thor's hammer), original new mysteries (who are the shadow people?). Sure, it adapts one of the best comics stories (the super hero who turns bad and destroys a Shielb base was Millar's ""enemy of the state""). And all this for only ""4"" ?<br/><br/>Yes, because the first hour is totally boring: i have even slept in this black night. Also, because the screenwriter of super heroes lacks the talent of the comics writer. Stan the man who invented the Avengers could tell the same story in 22 pages: it was fast, easy to understand: Here, the plot is unintelligible, uses and abuses of scientific concepts and stupid name (tesserac?). Also, because i have the feeling to have missed a movie (what about the story about Black Widow and Hawkeye?). Also because the alien invasion is just destroy for destroy so the last hour is an astounding but hollow action scene. <br/><br/>In conclusion, it's finally better than ""Daredevil"" but faraway of the classic Raimi's Spiderman!"
"OllieSuave-007","6","3","7","18 November 2013"," Subpar Superhero Flick.
","This is an OK superhero flick featuring the Marvel Comics heroes Thor, Ironman, The Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. They are assigned to protect the entire globe from Loki, the stepbrother of Thor, and an alien invasion.<br/><br/>There are plenty of enjoyable action is this movie, helped with some slapstick humor. The action sequences, especially during the climax, were breathtaking and exciting, leaving the audience thoroughly entertained. However, the movie's main plot and story aren't very captivating or compelling, coupled with lack of chemistry and substance between the cast of characters.<br/><br/>I would like to have seen every superhero in this movie given a more elaborative purpose and equal screen time; it appeared that Ironman was the main focus of the movie and took away most of the glory - too much emphasis was placed on the character. Robert Downey Jr. was too cocky and tried too hard to be funny in the Ironman role.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just one battle scene after the other. Not much of a story here, but it's something the kids would love to watch.<br/><br/>Grade C"
"JamesMitchell451","10","3","7","21 September 2013"," A Comic Book dream come true
","Excelcior my fellow Marvelites! Marvel's The Avengers has finally arrived and I can safely and happily say that not only does it live up to the massive hype surrounding it, but it actually surpasses it. In The Avengers: Iron Man, The Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America all have to team up (Unwillingly I might add) in order to stop Loki and the alien spieces under his servitude(The Chitari) from taking over the Earth. I love this movies' script, for many reasons not the least of which is that it addresses what I was thinking ""Wait, I thought that these people always work alone. How are they going to be able to suck up their pride and fight as a team?"" Well... lets just say that when they first meet each other these heroes don't get along very well. In fact, it is more like a WWE smackdown, since when they first meet they beat the crap out of each other. The reason why this works so well is because of like I said if because of the script. The dialouge is so clever, funny, well-written, and overall good that it raises summer blockbuster standards for scriptwriting. The fact that the awesome director (Joss Whedon. You might recognize him as was the writer for for Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Toy Story, Serenity, Firefly, etc.) also wrote the script, and that he is such a huge comic book fan and he has such an eye for detail that I find incredible. There are so many easter eggs in this movie for Marvel fans to discover (Like in Captain America:The First Avenger), and they are all worth the hunt. The fact that he has written so many scripts and some comic books and directed some TV episodes, it makes sense for him to direct a movie with several different famous superheroes in one movie. I also find it amazing how none of the heroes become the odd one out, each of them do so many badass things that fans of each hero (If they aren't fans of all of them) will be more than satisfied. Everybody in this movie does terrific triple-A performances. It is hard for me to pick out who I liked the best but if I had to choose I'd pick Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and right behind him is Bruce Banner/ The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The 3D is surprisingly well done, while not Avatar-3D good, it is still pretty damn good. You are probably wondering ""Well how was the action?"" The answer: Really badass! You can always tell what is going on during the many action scenes unlike some other action films out there (Cough*Transformers 2*Cough) and they are all so intense that you don't want them to end. The Avengers is a truly amazing, dazzaling, and breathtaking film that I hold it even higher than The Dark Knight. Marvel has outdone themselves again and for films in general, but they have also obliterated it. It raises the bar for superhero movies. It is truly a movie spectacle that must be seen by all, DC films are going to have to step up their game now. Robert Downey Jr. was right when he said that The Avengers was Marvel's finest hour. I got one question though: What's next Marvel?"
"nmfund","7","3","7","16 August 2013"," How to Play It Safe, by Joss Whedon
","Walking into the movie theatre, I didn't expect very much. I'm glad I didn't, or I would've been disappointed. The movie starts off slowly, and from the get go, everything about it seems... for lack of a better word, dull. With the success of DC Comic's The Dark Knight, the shoes for superhero flicks were large to fill. Marvel's counterpart failed to deliver the same grandiose style, riveting story, and memorable performances.<br/><br/>To start off with, the story felt like a patchwork of scenes put together simply to bring earth's mightiest heroes together for what would turn out to be a forty-five minute, Transformers-esque brawl. Some people may say, ""That sounds awesome! Why are you complaining?"" If you said that, this movie is for you. If you want a little more than ""HULK SMASH!"", look somewhere else.<br/><br/>To Joss Whedon's credit, he saw that he had a potential home run and did everything possible not to screw it up. If his goal was to make as much money as possible, he was extremely successful. However, because of this ""playing it safe"" philosophy, the movie relies far too heavily on unexplained coincidences in the plot, character backgrounds found in previous Marvel flicks and also, without giving away any spoilers, blatantly ripping off the ending to a certain Star Wars movie that was panned by critics. The Avengers is a decent popcorn flick that killed at the box office; however, it does not transcend the superhero genre to become a truly great film."
"shafiq-siddiqui81","9","3","7","17 July 2013"," The Avengers - A Complete Package
","Marvel needs no introduction. Those who grew up in 70's, 80's and 90's read and watched comics and cartoons produced by Marvel and those whose childhood belongs to 2000 must have watched some amazing movies produced by them. It is simply close to impossible to create a master piece again and again; this is the reason why most of the sequels flop at the box office. But I simply don't know what formula lies with Marvel, from Hulk (2003) to The Avengers (2012), they continue to provide the best of experience to their audiences, including, Iron Man (2008/10), Thor (2011) and Captain America (2011). They are definitely the entertainers.<br/><br/>It was not a piece of cake to get all the superheroes together in any movie just like that. After all, screen play, plot, logic and script have to be extraordinary for making them stand shoulder to shoulder. Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures bang on the perfect script in which they united the amazing team of Superheroes as well as they grab the right cast. The story revolves around how the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury (performed by Samuel L. Jackson), gathers a team of all super heroes including, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) along with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to fight against Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who plays Thor's father's adopted son and threats Nick Fury to demolish the peace on earth and rule it. As Loki, just like Thor is not a human and possesses super natural powers and army there has to be super heroes against this God of evils.<br/><br/>The movie brings surprises in many ways, the interaction between all the characters whether in their super heroic attires or common suits is first-rate. The dialogues between Tony Stark and Captain America gives you many reason to smile and clap at many places (off the record, I managed to whistle as well). The action sequences of Hulk were worth watching again and again, just to note the expressions and daredevil stunts. Thor's entry is a treat to watch and the complete scene is remarkable, how Thor (The God of Thunder), Iron Man and Captain America try to show their strengths ‚Äì simply bravura. Samuel L. Jackson gets a much lengthy role this time, unlike Iron Man 2's role, and he simply proves his excellence with his performance, be it the beginning of the movie, communiqu√© with Loki and post interval. Same goes for Scarlett Johansson, she is fast and a nice element included in the movie ‚Äì it is a difficult task to get noticed as a normal human in the movie studded by superheroes. This time Hulk is much civilized, well you may say that, he knows how to control his rage and Mark Ruffalo perfectly portrays a role, am sure audience will love him over the previous Hulk(s). The only character from THE Avengers who under-performs (I am not saying that he has not performed well) is Hawkeye. In such movies where there are so many heroes it is really difficult for the villain to stand out but Tom Hiddleston as Loki excels and performs a role that is tailor-made for him. He looks comfortable and cold blooded both at the same time. <br/><br/>Like all the scenes and sequences the climax is also directed very well by Joss Whedon. Characterization is strong, script is clap-worthy and there are many other surprises ""action wise"". It is undoubtedly a Super Movie brought to its audience by a team of Super Heroes, called The Avengers. Watch this movie in Cinema, it is worth experiencing."

","I want my Noprize! How did Harry Dean Stanton know to wait for Hulk to ""shrink back down"" to pants size, but then ask is he's an alien? I liked the Council of Elrond scene, where the influence of the One Ring, I mean Loki's staff, causes strife among the Avengers. And when Bugs, I mean Thor, steps out of the falling elevator just before it crashes. I did not like the way the Darkworld warriors all collapsed when the portal closed, like in Independence Day. Same illogic as in Oblivion. Look folks, in Independence Day, the alien fighters drew their power from the mother ship. Don't copy stuff you don't understand. And don't copy DCStuff like the every cell phones a tracking device from the Dark Knight. You can do better. Black Widow is more deceptive thank Loki? Nice. Is that Thanos at the end? Apocalips?

Because they are all together, I couldn't really see the performance of each single hero.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, it's neither a bad movie or a great one. It's kind of at the 6-7 range. If you're a loyal fan, you may probably like it. Pure actions, not much drama. Just watch 'em fight."
"pcast99-1","9","3","7","31 March 2013"," A very entertaining comic book movie
","There was a lot of hype and build up leading up to this movie for the past few years, and it has finally come and I will say it has lived up to its hype.<br/><br/>This movie deals with Thor's brother Loki trying to take over the earth by harnessing the Tesseract, an energy source with immense power. Nick Fury then assembles Iron Man, Bruce Banner, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to stop him.<br/><br/>The movie starts out a little slow, and the plot is very simple, bad guy wants to take over the world and will do nothing to stop until he does. It's clich√©d but still pays off because of the amount of action. The violence itself is cartoon like, so it is safe for all ages.One other issue I had was the Hulk only has two appearances in this movie, but in each he is the best hero to watch and definitely makes this movie awesome. Mark Ruffalo also has given the best performance as Bruce Banner yet seen in movies, he has far surpasses Eric Bana and Edward Norton.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon understood this movie is about giving audiences what they want to see with lots of Marvel superhero's in one movie, thrilling action sequences, humor and pure entertainment.<br/><br/>This isn't a perfect movie but it is still a lot of fun to watch and even if your not a comic book fan you will still like this film, definitely give this a watch."
"stinabina_94","6","3","7","14 February 2013"," Good but also bad
","This was one of those movies I did not feel an urge to watch. I waited until it was shown in the television. I think one will find the movie more enjoyable if one has read some of the comics or know more about the Marvel universe than I. I frankly thought it a bit boring, very nicely made and worth watching, but I have seen better, and the only reason it deserves to be on the top 250 is because of the effects. but even if the effects are very well made, I suppose it also helps make the movie less interesting. just a lot of fighting and flying. it is also as if this movie is not allowed to be serious, always the serious scenes are broken by comedy, sometimes bad humour. That said, it is still worth watching, and it has good scenes and is pretty to watch. But not one I am eager to watch anytime soon again."
"danzogreen","7","3","7","31 January 2013"," overrated but not bad.
","I have seen the avengers 3 times now and ever since the first time i watched the movie i felt that even though it was enjoyable there was something about the movie that just kept it from being a masterpiece to me.<br/><br/>First I will point out the good things about this movie. The characters are very dynamic and well developed and some of the best conflict in the movie is between the hero's rather than the villain. Another thing is that this movie has well done humor that doesn't seem out of place.<br/><br/>Now onto my issues with the movie of which there are 3 and I'll start with the smaller ones. First off, no spider-man which is kind of ridiculous because spider-man is one of the main avengers but that is forgivable. The second issue is the fact that they never give a good explanation for why Bruce Banner can all of the sudden control his powers. Finally Here is the big issue with the movie, there is no moment in the movie where the hero's are actually in trouble by that i mean no matter how bad things got there was never a huge struggle and the hero's had everything under control. In fact the final battle was far too easy. They were facing an entire alien army for goodness sake but they never seemed overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty good super hero movie but falls short of the higher realm of superhero movies like the Dark knight, Iron man, Spider-man 2 and Watchmen."
"francischabot256","7","3","7","17 December 2012"," The Avengers succeeded at one thing. Proving that IMDb is nothing more than what it really is. A database about movies and not a place to look for legitimate reviews.
","It's my first review here. The reason why i don't review movies here is simple. It's because English is not my first language. But i found the Avengers score to be so ridiculous that i decided to make my first review. The Avengers is not the first overrated or underrated movie here. But usually such overreaction about a movie last for 2 weeks or 1 month. After the fans saw and reviewed it the score adjust itself when the people not sold to the movie start to see it. But in the case of The Avengers it seems that there's so much people who gave The Avengers a not deserved 10 that to this day even after the disc release the score is still way too high. 8.4 ? More than Scarface and only 0.2 point away from Apocalyspe now. You got to be kidding me right ? But enough with my IMDb criticism here's my review of the movie.<br/><br/>Personally i try to review movie with an open mind and rate a movie for what it is and what it tries to be. If a movie features some of the best special effects or action sequences ever i'm gonna consider it in my review. But what actually makes a good movie ? Directing, acting, casting, special effects, soundtrack, costume, script, editing, makeup, cinematography ... soul ? Personally i don't think a great movie needs to masterize all those. Few movies actually did. Shawshank Redemption was really close. But i think a great movie needs to be at the very least top in at the minimum 2 or 3 categories. So let's see for the Avengers. Let's start with the script. Honestly it's one of the worst script i've seen on the last 10 years. It makes Tron Legacy script looks like a chef-d'oeuvre. The directing ? This is where The Avengers shine a little bit and it's the only place it does. It's a miracle Joss was able to make something good out of this awful script. The acting was not bad but it was uneven. Tom Hiddleston did a good job as Lokki (Fassbender would have been better). Downey was good as usual but sorta under the autopilot. Ruffalo was okay but did not play a big role. Renner and Johansson did the best they could with uninteresting characters. But they were certainly not able to outdo themselves to make those characters interesting. Evans was awful as usual i can't stand this guy. Hemsworth was not really credible as a semi-god. But can't really blame him when a semi-god gets owned by a modern day Mr Hyde. Overall the acting was galaxies away from Fifth Element. I have a lot of respect for most of the actors in the Avengers. Who is to blame for the not exceptional acting ? The script ? The directing ? The casting ? Lack of interest in the project by the actors ? Maybe a little bit of all of those.<br/><br/>Now let's get to the name of the game which is the action sequences and the special effects. And this is where i disagree with people giving this moving more than 7. While the special effects were technically great those were very far from being in the top league. Tron Legacy had far more interesting special effects and Tron Legacy did not succeed. Avatar was leagues over The Avengers. Avatar is major league. The Avengers is a farm club. Inception too even if i did not like it as much as i wanted to. The Avengers special effects don't have a soul. They are artistically nothing to write home about. I already forgot them. When i got out of the theater after seeing Avatar 3D i felt like when i was young and saw Terminator 2 for this first time. I felt something i had not felt in years. I was impressed by the special effects alone. Everything else was not important. The Avengers special effects are meh! It's like a 10 years old kid designed them and they spent millions over millions to make them technically look good. Now let's get to the action sequences. Hero is league over that. The firth Element is league over that. Terminator 2 is league over that. The Matrix is a god creation when it comes to action sequences if you compare it to the Avengers. Now i'm not saying the special effects and action sequences were bad. Cause they were good. What i'm saying is it's not worthy of a 8, 9 or 10 and not even close to it when you consider the script and uneven acting. The special effects and actions sequences were certainly not good enough to make this movie great. There's hundred and probably even thousand of movies with better special effects and action sequences (when you compare them to the movies released at the same time).<br/><br/>Now when i started this review i intended to give the Avengers a 1 star. But doing so would make me as bad as the people who gave this movie a 10. So a decided to give it the score it deserves which is imo a 6.9. Now personally i think that IMDb should think about the way it calculates the weighted average. 10 and 1 rating weight way too much. Let's be honest for a second we have enough fingers to count the number of movies worthy of a 10 or 1. I'm astonished to see that close to 40% of the people gave The Avengers a 10. I really don't see how someone could think this movie is perfect. Even a fan of Marvel. The script alone is enough reason to reduce the score. I don't mind short movies with no script when they embrace it. But sadly the Avengers was close to 2 hours and a half and actually tried to tell a story. And this is where imo the movie actually failed."
"Brittany-Jurczyk","Null","3","7","18 November 2012"," Avengers Who?
","The Avengers was a fantastic movie bringing all the Marvel movies together seamlessly. This is what I may have said if I'd ever seen or read anything Marvel in my life. Now, I realize this isn't the movie or producers fault, I'm just speaking for myself who happens to be utterly ignorant and oblivious to the world of comics in general. To start out the movie, I was happily surprised to think I was following the movie without any background knowledge. Suddenly I came to the realization that I was mistaken, being thrown into some sort of futuristic space ship setting. I was continuously introduced to new characters that didn't have character development as I was expected to be read up on that information before hand. The importance of the characters and their role in the movie tended to be a roller coaster ride. At the beginning, Scarlett Johansson grabbed my attention and stole the movie with everything she had to offer to the action side of the movie. She even took on 3 men without a blink. Somewhere along the line she ends up standing in the shadows without much to offer until the ending scenes. Chris Hemsworth's role in the film seems lost to me as well. The back and forth between helping Loci and wanting to take him down seems almost as if he's lost on which side to take. This was distracting to me. As a whole, the characters were interesting, however didn't exactly connect the story well. By the middle of the movie it dawned on me that it was becoming more and more predictable. From what I've gathered, no super hero movie has ended in the super hero's loss. Loci shows no sign of changing his ways from ""evil"" thus, the outcome become inevitable no matter what Loci throws the Avengers way. From that point on, every conversation of confusion between the characters and talk of what the next step will be to take seems pointless. The wondering and guessing games could have been done without as far as I'm concerned. The ending of the movie seemed to be too far fetched and far too drawn out to be enjoyable. Plausibly, they all should've died before the Hulk came around. The way the creatures were destroying buildings, it was hard to accept the fact that, even with super powers, they were destroying them one by one. The setting of this battle was also a little out of reach. Showing everyone walk away unharmed and guarded by the NYPD is beyond realistic given what the other creatures were capable of. None of the pedestrians seemed to even be worried about the danger in the aftermath, only thankfulness and gratitude for those who saved them. Is that how it would really happen? I surely wouldn't think so. As for the meaning and the plot line revolving around the Tesseract, I couldn't even being to explain that to someone. The power it holds and the large question ""why"" it holds the power it holds still confuses me. The knowledge needed for this movie before going into it seems to outweigh watching the film out of pleasure. While I understood the concept of the movie and could still gather main points, I believe that it reached out to more of the large Marvel fans that have been following for years, or decades. This movie was slightly disappointing, but what do I know, I'm still asking the question, Avenger who?"
"bc022","9","3","7","27 October 2012"," How this movie is anything less than a 9 is beyond me
","This was by far one of the best Marvel movies made to date. The action, acting and comedy laced in were on point through out the whole film. The best part has to be when Hulk did his smashing of Loki and called him a puny God. That stuff was super funny and entertaining. I can't wait until the next Avengers and what it brings. All the characters were super entertaining and I'm glad they were able to bring in A list actors to do the job. Do NOT go cheap on the 2nd one please! Thanos at the end was a great teaser so definitely looking forward to that. I didn't mind Mark being the Hulk this time and he would be good to play the next movie as well. It would be nice to see some guy play the Hulk more than once and he does look the closest to the old Bruce Banners from the original TV series."
"dalakast","7","3","7","27 September 2012"," The Avengers - Your character defines your point of view.
","Living in a world of more than 7 billion people, one must consider this as a critical fact, without trying to counter-argue for any reason whatsoever: the diversity in opinions can be unimaginably huge.<br/><br/>And what is the reason for this? What are the main variables that are to be held responsible for someone's opinions? Well, there is the environment we grow up & live in, for two big ones, with all their subcategories, like the people that surround us and their beliefs of any kind. If you grow up, for example, in a family that values honesty, they'll probably push you into becoming an honest being. If you grow up in a family that enjoys watching comedies in their free time, you'll probably grow a ""thing"" for comedies later on in your life - no matter how attracted you may become to other genres of movies, a comedy will always be something you enjoy for various reasons, the remembrance of your happy family moments for one.<br/><br/>Let's say you're a fan of Sci-Fi movies. You most likely grew up watching such and you've definitely been taken your breath away by certain ""classics"", as we call them nowadays, that left you with some kind of a mental mark about how awesome they were. Alien, for instance. A totally breath-taking Horror film, a masterpiece for it's kind, it's era. <br/><br/>So, to my point: It is wrong to compare any new film to the one that let you breathless. I mean, feel free to judge that what you just watched is better or worse, but you can't direct a whole review to why a movie ""rocked your world"" or ""totaly sucked"" based on your mental mark about your favorite movie and it's perfect, to you, characteristics, specifications & moments. Of course, there are reasons and places to do so, if for example there is an award to be given between two or more, but nothing more or less.<br/><br/>I did enjoy The Avengers. I did enjoy the cast. I believe that Robert Downey Jr. acts in a very stylish, awesome for me way, that I might have enjoyed the movie only because I like him as Iron Man. Mark Ruffalo and Christ Hemsworth are very amusing to watch as well, their impersonations of The Hulk and Thor being incredibly amazing. Overally the cast fit their roles well-enough to create an enjoyable, rocking atmosphere that will hold you tight in place until the very end.<br/><br/>There were plenty of moments where I was slightly disappointed, like the extreme damage and conditions that Iron Man's suit could sustain - the movie could have been better at certain points like these, but the overall experience compensated. Hey!, it's based on hardcore comic books after all, and director's Joss Whedon great attention to it's making is clearly noticeable, if you've read the comics.<br/><br/>The movie was worth my time, and I give it a seven out of ten. I've seen a couple of better Action Sci-Fi movies, matter of personal preference, and there always must be place for even better ones, since human capabilities can't be imagined. Thus, a seven from me to The Avengers, makes this Action Sci-Fi a must-see to those that agree with me. An outstanding production."
"Ziya90","9","3","7","15 September 2012"," The Dream Team
","The film opens with a spectacular action sequence and you almost understand that the movie will be in epic scale that disappoints or does not, that's another story. Let's talk about the team members first! I know that I am in the minority and sorry, but my favorite Bruce Banner was Eric Bana, it is and it will be, not Edward Norton. In fact, as an actor, I like Edward Norton much more than Eric Bana, but as a character, Bruce Banner, I think that Norton didn't fit the character at all. I mean that it was like I was watching Edward Norton, not Bruce Banner, it was not convincing for me. As for Mark Ruffalo, he was believable as Banner, so better than Norton, but worse than Bana. My only personal problem with Hulk was I couldn't like this ""bad-ass"" Hulk. I know that many of you will surprise when you read that, but I really tried, but I couldn't. It is not important, but also I would prefer my giant to be bigger and taller. Black Widow is, one sentence, she is so hot! Period. Captain America was better in his own movie. He is ""cold"" here. I don't know he was unlikeable in this movie. As action, I can't say that his parts were bad, but it was disappointing. My favorite scene in the whole The First Avenger movie was the shield fight and in this one, there is not any scene in the same level (for Captain America) And I didn't like this new costume either. The conversation between him and the agent in the plane was realistic? or poorly written? You decide. Hawkeye is cool, but before this movie, honestly I didn't know about that character, may be because of that I didn't feel any kind of excitement towards the character. I just ""watched"" him. The Iron Man is The Iron Man you know, so Thor is, but there was a minor problem about Iron Man, he was too powerful in this movie, but really too powerful! Despite the parts take place in the helicarrier feels like Star Trek a little bit, it was great, great action! The main villain of the movie, Loki has some problems as a character. It reminded me Magneto, especially when he ""finds himself"" in a cocktail. It was a pointless scene if you ask me and as a villain, yes he is ""paper-tiger"". He can't be a dominating villain not because of the actor, because of the script. As for one for one fights, Whedon delivers, he doesn't disappoint! Iron Man vs. Thor fight was breathtaking, Hulk vs. Thor fight was great too. Dreams came true... However, ""the battle of words"" between Iron Man and Captain America was insulting for me, it was far fetched. In general the team work works. The very long final climax made the film, despite at times, it reminds you Transformers as many people realized. Yes, the cube, the machines, all these recalls Transformers, but there is the dream team, different type of action, a lot of creative ideas, better direction, better action, you just forget it or you just don't care about it. Some people ask where is the military? Well, I have two answers for that which relieve you I hope: if the military had engaged the enemy, the movie would have been just the copy of Transformers movies and the movie would have been clich√© and boring. There were not S.W.A.T. also, that would make the movie clich√© and boring too if you ask me. Only The Avengers and the enemy, think like that. As said before, I enjoyed, but didn't like Hulk in this movie. As I seen, most of the audiences loved the ""the punch"" and ""the slamming"" moments, even some people said these were the best moments of the whole film! Sorry, but I disagree. It was just too funny for my taste. I mean those moments ruined the tone of the film for me. Also that fight could have been a serious one, but no problem. It is like I liked this bad-ass Hulk, but also I didn't like. Another thing I disliked about Hulk was he was moving like a monkey at times and that annoyed me. The action, the one-liners, everything else was great!"
"Tehmeh","9","3","7","12 September 2012"," Joss Whedon, thank you sir.
","The Avengers is a movie that could've gone wrong in a billion ways. I didn't believe this could actually work, even with Whedon on charge. I thought the balance between showing enough of every character, handling our heroes with the credibility they deserve, the whole story concept...I thought it was almost impossible to handle.<br/><br/>And it probably is almost impossible to handle. Guess what? Joss Whedon and the cast handled it. They nailed it. The Avengers is an excellent movie.<br/><br/>We've seen plenty of Marvel movies that do something well, something OK and something bad. Usually, there's something lacking. X2, for me, was nearly the best Marvel movie to date and I can't find significant flaws from it. Many Marvel movies are mediocre and some of them downright suck (Fantastic Four) beyond belief, so the Avengers could've gone wrong or been just ""OK"". I grew up with those comics, imagining these characters in action. It wasn't just action, you really got into the personal drama as well. It was part of my life.<br/><br/>Now, I'm a grown man. And never before has my inner child cried this many happy tears. Let me tell you why Avengers in simply a great movie.<br/><br/>1) Acting. Downey jr. is very good, sticking to his Iron man role, and yet having scenes that don't involve just cracking jokes. Mark Ruffalo - I simply loved him as Banner/Hulk. I've grown to like Ruffalo more and more, and he just nailed Hulk. What about the actors of Thor and Loki? In the movie Thor, I didn't...quite like them. Somehow, they do well. No one's a liability, I'm even satisfied with Chris Evans. Scarlett Johansson is as beautiful as ever, doesn't really do her best but she isn't your useless Megan Fox either. Everyone, every actor did at least OK, most of them good.<br/><br/>2) Contrast and structure. In Avengers, there is plenty of humor, and it isn't too forced. Even though you know the jokes aren't THAT great, you still laugh. You buy it. There are also a few sentimental scenes and they mostly succeed. Remember Wolverine crying ""NOOOO"" in X3 and Origins? Yes, that sucked. None of that crap here with Avengers. When it's serious, it's serious and you take it seriously. When it's funny, it's funny and just for the right reasons. Also, the plot. I'm not giving out any spoilers, but...you know it isn't THAT great of a plot, and you know it would be hard to make it work due to it's ""scale"". You know what? It works just fine. Somehow, Whedon is able to take something that seems stupid, clich√©'d, out of place...and make it work. It's never that intelligent nor ingenious but it gives enough reasons for what's happening. <br/><br/>3) Handling the characters, our heroes. Every single one of them gets plenty of screen time. Every single one of them has at least a couple of amazing action scenes and a bunch of excellent ones as well. I can't stress this enough - you can see every one of them actually ENOUGH. Not kidding. Another thing - the characters are treated with respect. Whedon is a fanboy himself. He wanted to do these characters justice. He wanted to show and portray these heroes RIGHT. He succeeded. Oh yes, Hulk too. Especially him. You'll love him. Justice is served. None of the characters is an idiot, everyone gets treated with respect.<br/><br/>4) Action. Visuals. My mouth was open for the last 30 minutes. It literally was. I was cheering, I was pumped. I was a child again. The incredible action scenes, visuals, characters, everything. Absolutely everything clicked when it mattered the most. <br/><br/>This is what happens, when you give a capable fanboy a crapload of Hollywood money. You don't get sucky transformers sequels, no. You get quality. You get your inner child the satisfaction he/she never got before from these movies. You get the Avengers.<br/><br/>This is almost a perfect Marvel movie. I seriously doubt there are many filmmakers who could've nailed this so well. X2 is still my favorite superhero movie, but man...this is right up there with the best.<br/><br/>Excuse me while I watch my Avengers blu-ray again. And again."

There is nothing wrong about this film, the casting is perfect, the script is perfect, the film is just perfection. I went to see the film with my family and my mum isn't a huge fan of superhero film's but after watching this film she wanted to re-watch the other Marvel films as she loved this film so much, which goes to show the brilliant cast, director and writers have gone above and beyond to produce the perfect superhero films that even gets people who don't usual enjoy them into becoming a lover of the films. One of my favourite things about the film is the tension between the heroes at first and the bonds they end up having at the end of the film Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) develops a great bro-romance with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Hands down the best film I have seen in 2012, and best superhero film EVER, I'd love to see how they top this film as the expectations are running high. This film is lacking nothing, if you haven't seen it then you need to watch this film ASAP."

","Positives: *The movie looks awesome, CGI is unobtrusive and the costumes look almost exactly like the comics. *Traditional but well told superhero blockbuster story, putting Michael Bay to absolute shame, simply by focusing on the avengers and not some lame characters no one cares about. *Every superhero acts like they should (except maybe Hawkeye, but he's the only one I don't know from comics) *Rescued the hulk from the absolute pits of the last two movies made about him and Mark Ruffalo made him the best part of the whole movie by far. *A satisfying conclusion with a very surprising (and exciting) reveal after the credits.<br/><br/>Negatives: *Hawkeye doesn't leave much of an impression. *Enemy baddies could've been explained a little more than they were. *Kind of predictable, I guess.

","Looks like another parallel universe version of the Avengers. In the original comic, Hulk was on a rampage, and they got together to stop him. In this version, they got together to stop Loki.<br/><br/>So, truly all star cast assembled to make this much anticipated movie. I like the fact that all the actors really look their part except Nick Fury. He kept reminding me of all things, the Red Skull.<br/><br/>It's difficult to come up with an enemy that's big enough to warrant an Avengers assemble. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon was the first director to successfully direct the motion of the Hulk. Hulk looked most realistic in this movie. He also must have been a long time Marvel comic fan, because all the other characters' best moves were captured in this movie.<br/><br/>I liked Captain America in this movie lot more than the Captain America movie.

"jerekra","9","3","7","25 August 2012"," Final piece to the Puzzle.
","Having seen all of the other Marvel films that lead to this film and being a huge Marvel Fan I was very excited to see this movie. I feel that this movie is very good and totally worth the wait.<br/><br/>Loki comes to Earth and uses the Tesserect and his magical powers to try to take over mankind. Shield decides to put into action the Avengers plan and recruits Bruce Banner, Iron man, and Captain America to join Black Widow on a team of the best on the Earth. Thor also joins with the team later as the planet is still under his protection.<br/><br/>This film has great flow to it. It starts off with Loki coming to Earth and then goes into each member of the Avengers joining the team. It really started strongly and I totally forgot about Thor and then he joins the team too. So a lot going on that I liked early which is important to a film like this.<br/><br/>All of the members of the Avengers are very good. Robert Downey Jr is great once again as Stark/Iron man. Chris Evans does a good job as Captain America (but I think he was missing something tho). Hemsworth is amazing as Thor again. I like Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye but I feel that something was missing from that character as well, maybe its cause Im a pretty big Hawkeye fan. I thought Mark Ruffalo was OK, but I really liked the Hulk. And Scarlett Johansen is good and her behind is AMAZING! As far as Acton goes, this may be one of the best films I have ever seen in that regard. Tons of great action scenes in this film that I cant do justice trying to speak about. You'll just have to take my word for it.<br/><br/>The only real complaints I have are that Loki and his army he uses to attack Earth aren't well explained. I think Loki is good, but he just doesn't come across as a formidable villain in this film or one that people even fear. I cant really say too much more about this without giving a lot away.<br/><br/>Great movie. Great action and characters. Highly recommended."
"paul_haakonsen","7","3","7","18 August 2012"," More superheroes...
","First of all I must admit that I am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general, but I have seen the movies leading up to this, simply because they were available and I had the time. And I had read up on the hype around this movie, so I might as well give it a go as well.<br/><br/>And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy, well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was, for me at least, rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure, it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.<br/><br/>The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch, as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However, when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly, I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.<br/><br/>However, one thing did make me wonder, with all the destruction in New York, you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way, that was just stupid, especially with so many people living there. In fact, you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie, which was sort of lame.<br/><br/>Another thing puzzled me, when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie, he was out of control, smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.<br/><br/>And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters, they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" was good entertainment, even for an anti-superhero guy like myself. Great action. Lots of destruction. And great special effects."

","i haven't given very many films nine captain America being the biggest let down on superhero movies coming out now days. i was cautious to see this movie because it was a huge budget with lots of famous cast as captain America was but i had to see it as i did others. i was surprised of the cast given all they can in this made this one of the best i have seen in 2012 but still i could not give 10 stars as i did with THOR. i loved all the actors and actresses in this movie but i felt as Paltrow should have given a bigger role as she only given short scenes in this movie. i love the Hiddleston he is destined for more great movies maybe playing mephisto and sepritoth in a final fantasy movie a great actor. most of all Downey jr. stood out because of hes great acting skills he become a guarantee bet on movies now days a household name lol. reason i could not give 10 stars this film lost that 1 star in the cutting room film jumped in places some characters did not get screen time they should have such is hulk, captain America, nick furry, and as i mentioned before Paltrow. other then that visually spectacular action movie should be seen on big screen 3d if it wont kill your eyes"
"stephenrtod","9","3","7","11 June 2012"," Took it Seriously
","In terms of quality, I would compare ""The Avengers"" to ""Superman"" starring Christopher Reeve, i.e. Absolutely no hokeyness whatsoever. The story was superb, the writing crackled with energy, and the acting was excellent. I thought that that the pacing was magnificent - suspense actually increased as the story proceeded and the perils became more and dire and catastrophic.<br/><br/>Each actor and actress seemed to me to be utilized to the optimum not only in terms of their skills as characters, but, moreover, in terms of their thespian skills. I thought that the movie was a real tour-de-force, a sort of how-to-really-do it, beckoning sequels of similar high quality to follow, I hope.<br/><br/>I was relieved and glad to see Josh Whedon make full use of Liam Hemsworth as Thor, something I thought was sadly lacking in Hemsworth's first venture in portraying the Viking god. Mark Ruffalo finally gave us the first truly satisfying Hulk since Lou Ferrigno! Even Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow, with ample opportunities to overact, to ham it up, utilized her minimalist skills to allow the audience to interface with the story. In the final set pieces of the movie, Downey and others also played down what was roiling inside of the characters' minds and hearts and souls -allowing the audience, once again, to interact and participate - as opposed to being dictated to or oversold on the emotions. For a fantasy and a superhero movie, that is quite a feat. Not only does Josh Whedon deserve tremendous credit for that result, but also Jon Favreau and Stan Lee - among others - The portrayal of Loki was on a par with Shakespeare's Iago, a character who takes great glee in being purely evil."
"loco_73","Null","3","7","7 June 2012"," Superhero Collage
","Joss Whedon is a nerd treasure, after having earned his geek street cred with some of the most iconic TV shows and characters around. My favourite of his creations remains ""Firefly"", an all-around extraordinary show, at the same time my deep dislike for Fox after the cancellation of said show, also remains intact. It was the popularity of the show and the loyalty of the fans which brought Joss Whedon back with his fond and well deserved closing act (?) to the Firefly saga, in the form of the excellent but oft overlooked ""Serenity"". It was through directing ""Serenity"" that Joss Whedon showed that he can easily and comfortably venture beyond TV land and into feature films. His colleague JJ Abrahms (and his gang) also made that same successful leap.<br/><br/>It thus came as no great surprise that ""The Avengers"" turned out to be such a fun ride, not to mention an insanely profitable one. It speaks to the vision and talent of the man who helmed the project, and what that imagination and talent can do when given the appropriate resources.<br/><br/>Whedon managed to take the several superhero movies which served as interconnected instalments or prequels of sorts to this movie, ""Iron Man"" 1 and 2, ""The Incredible Hulk"" ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and ""Thor"", and successfully and quite masterfully bring them all under the umbrella of ""The Avengers"", a fitting conclusion (though I'm sure based on the end-credits that a sequel is in the works) to this whole Marvel Universe enterprise.<br/><br/>I am not as floored with the movie as the audiences apparently are, but given the number of actors and characters populating the screen, Whedon did an admirable job letting them all share the spotlight, while keeping the story rolling. He was able to imbue the story with enough substance and gravitas so as to prevent the movie from becoming just another unremarkable, brainless, big-budged popcorn dud (yeah, yeah ""John Carter"" and ""Battleship"" you're what I had in mind) <br/><br/>""The Avengers"" does not come close in quality to the quite unfairly overlooked ""X-Men: First Class"" (or any of Nolan's Batman flicks), but for what it was meant to be, a summertime season opener, it more than achieved its purpose (and probably set the standard, at least money-wise, too high and potentially out of reach for the other big-budget releases of the summer).<br/><br/>If nothing else, I can say I had fun watching ""The Avengers"", but with Joss Whedon at the wheel you do get something extra in terms of quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Bravo Whedon! I'm looking forward to you spreading your wings even further."

","I've never given a 9 rating to any action film... well, I think I rated Avatar pretty high, but that had to do with the overt political statement too. Avengers makes no specific political commentary and that has nothing to do with why I love this film. It's just an excellent ensemble cast and freekin mega fun. The writing and acting make it work. That's where most action films are lacking. Avengers has got genuine wit. Great subtext and character development. Dialogue. Deft banter. The way the relationships build is convincing and unforced. Plenty of camp, but well balanced and never becomes mockery. And the action is perfect. So many action films try to dazzle so much you can't tell what's going on. The Avengers goes totally ballistic in the concluding battle, but you can always tell exactly what's happening on screen. I am not going to go deep. I'll leave that to the pros, and there are already plenty of positive reviews. I just wanted to say that this is one of those rare big-budget action films that lives up to the hype. Major winner. Kudos to the makers. If the follow-ups are this good, the franchise will outlast the cast."
"flapdoodle64","10","3","7","11 May 2012"," Earth's Mightiest Nerds Heave a Sigh of Collective Relief
","Comic book nerds, like other nerds, worry a lot about film adaptations of the works they cherish. This is for good reason, since the majority of Comic Book Movies (CBM's) created so far are still bad to awful. But ever since Brian Singer's X-Men in 2000, they've been mostly getting better. <br/><br/>X-Men was revolutionary because it was very good, camp was minimized, and it was the first watchable film to feature a super team. <br/><br/>'Avengers' is revolutionary for the 1st two reasons, and because it weaves together 3 previously existing movie franchises plus supporting characters into a unified, cohesive whole. Imagine if someone tried to blend The Terminator with James Bond. <br/><br/>A lot of us nerds were worried that this movie would be a big, crowded, confusing, silly bit of idiotic posing and exploding emptiness. But fortunately, it is not so. The script is true to the respective characters and is great fun. Especially to anybody who grew up reading Marvel comics. <br/><br/>We called ourselves Marvelites back in the day, and when we were 12-years-old reading Marvel comics, we felt that the Marvel Universe was somehow real in a sense we couldn't articulate, and deep down we all wanted to be heroes living in a world of other heroes. This movie gets you as close to that as you can, at least within a theater. <br/><br/>We comic nerds like our heroes, and we want our heroes to have interesting and distinct personalities. We like them to have weaknesses and emotions, but we like them to suck it up and be heroes when the chips are down. And at the same time, we don't want them to cross the line into corn or camp. <br/><br/>Well, I guess you can't avoid a little corn, but thankfully there is no camp. <br/><br/>This isn't Citizen Kane, mind you, but then, Citizen Kane didn't have the Hulk. So there you go. <br/><br/>Based on what my non-nerd friends say, this film is good fun for non-nerds too."
"griffolyon12","10","3","7","4 May 2012"," Earth's Mightiest Heroes Unite, and it is Awesome!
","Imagine taking only the best parts of each individual Marvel superhero movie, and then putting them all into one movie. That is Marvel's The Avengers, the first ever superhero cross-over movie. <br/><br/>In The Avengers, Thor's brother Loki comes to Earth, seeking a cosmic cube known as the Tesseract, which acts as a doorway between realms of reality. Loki steals the cube to unleash an alien army, bent on trying to take over the world, and the Earth's Mightiest Heroes: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk, must unite to stop him as The Avengers. <br/><br/>It's a simple plot, and writer/director Joss Whedon doesn't try to make it any more complex than it needs to be, because he would rather shift the focus to bringing the characters together and giving each character significant development. That is what is so spectacular about The Avengers, it is like the superhero equivalent of Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven. Evil bandits (aliens) are going to attack a town (Earth) and the town must recruit a series of defenders (The Avengers) to protect them when the attack comes. What separates The Avengers from other superhero movies though, is the fact that it is bringing together Robert Downey, Jr.'s Iron Man with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, and Chris Evan's Captain America. <br/><br/>The movie gives each character an equal amount of the spotlight, allowing each individual character a moment to shine, and shows an arc for each character as the movie progresses. Whether it is Iron Man realizing that a true hero must be selfless and not self-obsessed, or Captain America realizing that his blind faith in the government is not always the right way. Joss Whedon deserves huge kudos for making this all work, with a sizzling script that is clever and witty, and a great directorial hand coming up with comic book panel-style shot designs, the movie excels from start to finish. And the action, if you want explosions, The Avengers has them, and plenty of them, but to be honest, I was most enthralled by the moments when the characters were in a room talking, arguing, and revealing backstories about one another. <br/><br/>The dialogue was so crisp, and the acting so marvelous, with a surprising turn by Scarlett Johanson as SHIELD spy, Black Widow, The Avengers is never boring, even when there is no physical explosions to be seen, but rather explosions between the character relationships. Most importantly though, the movie speaks the message of unity, of disparate people having to come together and set aside their differences to fight a common threat, and there is no greater message that can be delivered to today's children with this movie.<br/><br/>By the end of The Avengers, there is a realization that superhero movies have forever been changed. Never has a superhero movie been made on such a large scale and been successful. As great as Joss Whedon and all of the actors are -- in particular my favorite performance being Chris Evans as Captain America -- the real winners are Marvel Studios. No movie studio has ever rolled the dice this big on a series of movies. They made five individual movies that all come to a head with this one, gigantic epic, and the pay-off is more than worth it, not just making this the best Marvel Studios production since they started with Iron Man in 2008, but it's one of the best superhero movies in general. This is Marvel's finest hour. Avengers Assemble!!!<br/><br/>I give The Avengers a 10 out of 10!!!"
"jaxbubba","8","3","7","2 May 2012"," Joss Whedon is a genius!
","Joss Whedon is a genius! The ability to bring this cast and these characters together, and actually make a pretty phenomenal movie is a tremendous accomplishment. But even more than that, he was able to finally make ""the Hulk"" true to his comic book character (i.e. funny, and bad ass); he even made dull Captain America and Thor entertaining; but the true star of the film has to be Robert Downey Jr.!!!!! Without his comic relief in the first 2/3 of this film, this movie would have bombed miserably. I understand the importance of character development, but it's Tony Stark (Downey) who steals the show, and makes the film bearable.<br/><br/>Kudos to Scarlett Johansson, her role as Black Widow, was really a thing of beauty. Strong female roles are hard to find in Hollywood, much less play with true abandonment; however, Johansson shines on the screen as the kick-ass siren. With any good action adventure, an evil antagonist, equally as wicked as his counterparts are good, must be pertinent to the film's plot to be a successful film. In this case, Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki (Thor's evil half brother), as cements his role as screen villain extraordinaire.<br/><br/>However, the crowning part of the whole film has to be the film's final 30 minutes. The ending battle of good vs evil is fantastic! The many one-liners come fast and furiously, and the action sequences are out of this world (literally)!!! At a cost of $220 million to make, you can definitely see it up on the screen! I am sure with salaries, percentage payoff to the actors and director (Josh Whedon); that it will be a very long time before Paramount sees any profits to this film; moreover, gathering all these stars again for a sequel is also highly unlikely. So enjoy this very entertaining bit of nostalgia while you can¬Ö I highly recommend seeing this film; I would even suggest paying the additional cost to see it in IMAX. I am sure the ending battle sequence will be more that worth the cost of admission!!! The summer has started off with a BANG, let's hope the momentum continues!!!

Thou some characters shine a little more than others, everyone are given their share of screen time, it doesn't feel rushed, it doesn't feel forced, all scenes feel natural, and very well deserved to be in.You get to know the history about some characters like black widow, and hawkeye , and it remove all doubts about them being implemented in the team, everyone needs everybody in order to succeed. As i said before, avengers is transformers, without the sucky part, no one can say its another cgi fest, cause its an excellent movie.<br/><br/>As to my favorite superheroe movie, i have to say dark knight still is, cause the story was a little better, but avengers is following closely as second spot surelly.

All you people are concerned with is special effects and unnecessary action. If those two elements are in a film for you the character development, creative ideas, acting, script, and cinematography doesn't matter which is very sad and leads me to worry about the misleading rating system for the future of filmmaking. This amateur film is currently rated 101 on IMDb. So you suggesting that this film is better than Batman Begins, Heat, Pans Labyrinth, Blade Runner, Rosemary's baby, The Deer Hunter, Jaws, Warrior, Let the right one in and the list goes on. If you think that ""The Avengers"", is better than the small list of films I mentioned then I feel sorry for you because you are mixed up in that group I mentioned earlier.

This didn't from the outset. It felt like a high budget TV episode. The look felt stark and unrealistic (or actually, too realistic probably). It seems to have been filmed for 3D, because even in 2D you you just get lots of weird camera angles and a strange tone to it.<br/><br/>The story... well, I just found it hard to pay attention for even the most shortest of times. It just was people doing stuff, but no sense of direction, or story, or building menace. In fact the menace looked like a Stargate TV series villain. Or something from a kids' movie.<br/><br/>And the thing is with Stargate, I love the characters. But I don't with this film. They give me no reason to love them. So their actions are thus uninteresting.<br/><br/>It doesn't surprise me, seeing afterwards, that Joss Whedon directed it. And it shows - he's a good writer, but doesn't have a lot of directing experience.<br/><br/>Having said that, what do I know... look at the numbers it's made!<br/><br/>But for me, I couldn't even watch it all the way through.

Iff you compare that for example with X-Men First class or Ironman the story lines are much better so i don't really understand why the reviewers before me don't talk about that enough. The enemy is very weak(almost a single shot would kill them) and i still don't understand why Loki was doing in the plane and why he would let them catch him... And the attackers were saying that there boss would come what happened with him ? Also no variation in the enemy and what about the hoovering cockroaches who only flew against buildings did nothing. From characters the black-widow was pointless she is just shooting with a gun and Hawkeye is shooting with a bow how is that faster than a gun. This movie was saved in the first part by Tony Stark character extremely funny and the Hulk character in the second part of the movie.

","I like super hero movies; if well made they are lots of fun. If they are done by a Master-they are very good (The Latest Batman, the first X-men,the 1st Spider Man). I watched all of the characters in this movie in their previous solo's: enjoyed Iron Man the most (Robert Downy Jr. is one of the best actors ever); thought that Thor was very entertaining and funny (and definitely a pleasure to look at...);I enjoyed the last Hulk with E.Norton, and watched Cpt.America @ home (saved on the ticket...)and thought it was OK.<br/><br/>We went to watch it after seeing the rating. SO: This movie is entertaining, if you like lots of CGIs and action; there is NO Original/Surprising story. The acting is good (they brought GOOD Actors, you wouldn't expect less). We laughed twice (The Hulk character provided the much needed relief). You will enjoy it on a big screen. BUT THAT'S IT. 8.6? Really? How many times you can watch Manhattan destroyed?! Time and time again in every other CGI movie.Grow up and get more original.(And Yes,AVATAR was better). I gave it a 5 to lower the expectations of people who go to watch a movie on the big screen,instead of watching it @ home.If you like CGIs and a predicted plot it deserves between 6-7.

","I went to see The Avengers in a movie theater in Paris. It actually seemed kind of strange that it premiered there a week before it did in the United States. Nevertheless, I wanted to watch it in order to prove to myself that some Marvel Universe productions based on comic books can be outstanding. Unfortunately, as I left my seat I thought that, like all the previous one-superhero- shows, it disappointed me entirely.<br/><br/>Why, should you ask?<br/><br/>Basically, the plot is childish, but I wouldn't expect more from a big budget blockbuster made only to pleasure the masses. As of now, it can somehow achieve the greatest opening ever. Wow. It already made a fortune from the great marketing campaign that started weeks before the opening day. That's truly brilliant, considering WHAT is being advertised throughout the world as one of the best movies in years.<br/><br/>I must admit, it is strangely awesome that they were able to assemble such a cast of stars and pack them into one two-hour film. The names speak for themselves. But what can be achieved with so many highly-paid actors when the whole idea behind the picture seems dull? I love to see all of the well-known faces shown on the screen together at one particular moment, but when the scene isn't entertaining the point is really becoming unimportant.<br/><br/>The dialogues are cheap. They do not show any insight into the characters' positions in the circle of The Avengers. Of course, in order to fully understand who is who and the relations between the heroes it is mandatory to watch all of the movies that show the origins of every single person. <br/><br/>Now I want to point point some out a few aspects that make the movie a little more enjoyable. There were a few nicely implied gags that made me laugh. Most of them were connected with Hulk's turbulent nature. And that is always a good thing to make fun of. Also the many sarcastic, but highly intelligent remarks made by Tony Stark made me believe that Iron Man must certainly be the most amazing guy in the entourage. Additionally I would like to note that you don't have to watch the movie in 3D in order to get the best experience (the enormous potential of this technology isn't actually given). All of the epic major explosions, blasts, rampages and spectacular fights are providing great special effects in themselves. This is the part that is probably the most pleasurable - when the Avengers team do not speak to each other, but just fight their way through evil forces in order to stop Loki, Thor's brother. Action sequences are decent and the camera motions that shifts between all of the battling heroes deserve a recognition.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to say that I would much rather read the comic book while riding a subway to work than waste my time seating in the cramped cinema on a Thursday evening. Now I just have to hope that all the other 2012 epic superhero productions will be better. Because even after this 'slight' disappointment I still believe that this year will provide the greatest entertainment in this genre that the world has ever seen."

Tony Stark adds excellent spark and quick one liners, just as he does in Ironman 1&2. Thor, Captain America and Hawkeye all play there part in taking down Loki and his army of aliens but for me the HULK is, for the first time in a movie, genuinely scary and fierce as he destroys almost everything in his path. The film really works as it stays well clear of any LOVE interest that slows down so many other superhero films. Black Widow is the female lead and she kicks butt with the best of them.

Now the work of more than 70 years is crowned with the latest product ‚Äì movie of colossal proportions, designated to be a box-office hit.<br/><br/>More than 200 million dollars gross on the opening weekend, already over 1 billion dollars gross worldwide, 8.7 rating on IMDb.com and 242 (out of 260) fresh reviews at rottentomatoes.com ‚Äì those are only some of the astonishing numbers that surround Marvel's The Avengers. It's a dream-come-true movie for the comic book lovers which finally unites most of the greatest super-heroes created by Marvel. It is no surprise that this picture is breaking box-office records, on the other hand, its high IMDb.com rating and universal critical acclaim are unexpected and force to treat The Avengers as a serious film and not as another Michael Bay movie. Those were the standards that I used in order to assess the feature.<br/><br/>First of all, I must point out that the story is very conventional and lacks boldness. It is a bit ironic because the movie shows us a bunch of courageous heroes and one of the main values that The Avengers highlights is bravery however its creators rely on a simple and time-tested plot formula. The movie begins with the presentation of the threat when we meet a dramatized villain. Our superheroes struggle to defeat the villain because of the lack of team work. During the movie their personality disorders are probed and eventually overcome, they learn to work together and finally win the battle thanks to a heroic act of the main superhero. It is funny because there are tons of other movies that would fit to this generalized plot summary and most of them are better examples of making money rather than good movies.<br/><br/>As if that would be not enough, the feature is stuffed with unoriginal ideas and tasteless jokes designed for the American audience. The villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - god from the Norse mythology, shares the basic ideas (and he does not have much of them) with all of the greatest threats of the USA enemies (real or fictive) starting from the commies and finishing with the latest ones including S. Hussein, M. Gaddafi and the whole North Korea. Those ideas are the enslavement of human beings, cruelty towards them and basic misanthropy. I can only imagine how fellow Americans rage when dreadful Loki declares that humanity craves for subjugation. And his method of achieving the success is even more banal, yes, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking about the divide et impera principle. Hey, if it worked for Caesar and Napoleon why shouldn't it work for Loki?! That bastard (actually in one scene Loki's brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) reveals in another tasteless joke that our mighty villain is adopted so this is not just a disproportionate cursing) has stolen everything! Speaking about jokes, as I already mentioned, most of them are not very new. They range from the standard laughing at someone enduring the pain to laughs triggered by villain's failure. For the sake of truth, I should say that there are some amusing characters like Captain America (Chris Evans and his ""Ma'am, there's only one God, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that"") or agent Phil Coulson (and his laughable passion for the Captain America and his cheesy dying scene) but I am not sure if they were supposed to be amusing in a way that they were.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie is not a total failure and has its moments. Firstly, Robert Downey (as Tony Stark/Iron Man) and Mark Ruffalo (as Bruce Banner/The Hulk) do a great job, giving their characters depth. Tony Stark's wit and charm (""JARVIS, you a fan of Jonah?"") helps to make a likable character that seems to be really created and not borrowed from some stereotype. Bruce Banner, on the contrary, is a shy guy who is ashamed of his alter ego and there can be seen a certain sadness in his eyes every time we see him (though, I still think, that making him a doctor in an Indian slum was a standard Marvel's overreach). Another plus of the movie is its visualization. CGI really looks great and I can clearly see where the movie budget went. Fighting scenes, although I find them painfully long, are nicely done. It is a pleasant experience ‚Äì seeing it at the theater. However, the same can be said about The Transformers¬Ö <br/><br/>To sum up, The Avengers is clearly not a movie which I would rate highly for its content and lasting legacy. I do not believe that there is much originality in this flick and it certainly does not raise the bar for comic book movies because there simply are better movies in this category (we all know what I am talking about). However, it still is a decent form of entertainment and its visual aspect should not be forgotten. So if you have not seen it I should suggest to approach it with caution and if you did see it, well, I suggest waiting for another Avengers movie and we will try again to look through the debris of gigantism in search of dramatic life.<br/><br/>2012-05-17"

","You've already seen the Avengers and that's OK. <br/><br/>You've seen it in every other Marvel movie yet released. You've definitely seen the finale, and even the McGuffin, because they took it straight from the first Transformers movie. The Avengers is great fun, but it's fading from memory faster than who won last season's American Idol. <br/><br/>While fans of Joss Whedon will likely be pleased, I think his victory with the Avengers is a double edged sword. He carefully corrals the thicket of big names here, but in the process we're stuck with a laundry list of clich√© scenes, a very weak villain, dialog that exists purely to waste time and characters who rely far too much on their costume to get them through the movie. <br/><br/>One can't shake the feeling, no matter whose names appear as writers, the Avengers smacks of committee construction. Excluding Sam Jackson, most of what is here is by the numbers. There are precious few moments of humanity in a story that should be overflowing with it. In this respect, think this movie is a polar opposite of Ang Lee's HULK. A film that was painfully boring, but also full of human touches - it had a style that could have been robbed like a gold mine to add more character in the place of the dreadful and endless expository dialog exchanges before we're shuttled to the MIchael Bay Transformers action scenes we've seen a thousand times by this point. <br/><br/>But is it bad? Heck no. The Avengers is ultimately a good time if you can settle for less. There are no motivations for anything in the film other than to recycle everything that's already been done and play it safe to please an audience. Yes, you've seen the Avengers already, but that's OK.<br/><br/>B-"
"zardoz-13","10","4","11","13 May 2012"," One of the Best Super Hero Epics!!!
","Since the epilogue in ""Iron Man"" (2008) when Nick Fury broached the idea of the Avengers Initiative to wisecracking Tony Stark, Marvel Comics has been patiently whetting our appetites for ""The Avengers."" This imaginative ensemble epic assembles not only Iron Man and Hulk, but also Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. Agent Phil Coulson is back, too. Ostensibly, these paragons of virtue are all that stand between Thor's scheming step-brother Loki and the fate of mankind. Happily, Loki brings more to the table than he did in Kenneth Branagh's anemic ""Thor."" Indeed, Thor and Loki seem to have matured considerably during the interim. Loki ranks as a first-rate villain; he is ready, willing, and eager to kill anybody who confronts him, and actor Tom Hiddleston relishes every moment. Ultimately, ""The Avengers"" qualifies as Marvel's ambitious attempt to deliver an all-star, no-holds-barred, alien invasion thriller to rival both ""Independence Day"" and ""Transformers"" franchise. Of course, we know that our heroes won't capitulate, but this 142-minute, PG-13 extravaganza takes everything down to the wire. Inevitably, the extraterrestrial villain--only hardcore Marvel Comics fans may recognize him‚Äîwho boasts about subjugating Earth is as presumptuous as audiences who fail to appreciate the artistry of ""The Avengers."" Unlike other ensemble pieces‚Äîlike the venerable ""Star Trek"" movies that always relegated some regulars to obscurity, ""The Avengers"" gives everybody a chance to perform an integral part in this larger-than-life smackdown. Reportedly, ""Serenity"" director Joss Whedon shot more footage of Captain America than reached the screen. Nevertheless, the fish-out-of-water, World War II hero still participates in a major way. Melodramatic, with more humor than you might imagine, but just enough tragedy to make things bittersweet, ""The Avengers"" doesn't wear out its welcome. Moreover, this far-fetched nonsense holds up under repeated showings. I've seen it four times, and it loses none of its spontaneity.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" opens with audacious Asgardian exile Loki (Tom Hiddleston of ""Archipelago"") cutting a deal with malevolent aliens elsewhere in the galaxy and then appropriating a formidable source of energy, the Tesseract, from Nick Fury's (Samuel L Jackson) SHIELD outfit. If you're interested, the Tesseract showed up initially in ""Captain America, the First Avenger."" Once Loki gets his power-hungry hands on the Tesseract, he plans to unlock a portal in space with the expertise of Professor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsg√•rd of ""Thor"") so an extraterrestrial horde, the Chitauri, can invade Earth. The Chitauri are reptilian warriors with humanoid body structure in silver armor that cruise the skies as trios in chariots. Along the way, Loki recruits Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner of ""The Hurt Locker"") to do his evil bidding with the help of his glowing scepter. Meanwhile, Fury recruits his own team, first persuading Steve Rogers (Chris Evans of ""The Fantastic Four"") who has not quite grown accustomed to the 21st century to join him. Chiefly, Captain America doesn't know what most of the popular phrases mean. Former Russian spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) heads off to Calcutta to round up Dr. Banner. Eventually, Iron Man shows up, too. Thor barges him when he discovers that Loki is up to no good. Everybody boards a futuristic aircraft carrier that does more than ply the seas. Whedon does a masterly job of interspersing comedy with drama. Moreover, he manages to ante up enough time for each hero to make a contribution as they struggle to defeat Loki.<br/><br/>Whedon's ""The Avengers"" emerges as the climax to several recent Marvel Comics super hero escapades. Thor and Captain America toplined their own respective origins stories and generated well over a $100-million in box office receipts. If you've been keeping track of Marvel movies, you know the least successful super hero of the quartet is the Hulk. Unlike ""Iron Man,"" ""Thor,"" and ""Captain America,"" the pugnacious green gargantuan never formulated the right mix of leading actor, atmosphere, and narrative tone. Marvel's two ""Hulk"" movies failed to forge a charismatic hero after Marvel's major success with him on prime time television. Director Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" (2003), with Eric Bana as the title character, took itself far too seriously and tackled unpleasant issues such as child abuse. Marvel rebooted the character with director Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" with Edward Norton as the eponymous character. This adventure surpassed ""Hulk,"" but remained half-baked. Unfortunately, actor Edward Norton feuded with the studio over the film's interpretation of the material. Happily, for Hulk, lightening strikes the third time. Mark Ruffalo looks ideal as Dr. Bruce Banner and Whedon literally has remade the Hulk in Ruffalo's own image. Hawkeye and The Black Widow aren't exactly in the same league with luminaries like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, or Hulk. These two are conventional agents of SHIELD with special skill sets. Neither, however, possesses Herculean prowess. Lastly, ubiquitous Agent Phil Coulson hasn't changed an iota. Like Nick Fury, Coulson has appeared in most of the films. More than any other character, Coulson makes the greatest impression in ""The Avengers"" when Loki throws down the gauntlet.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of super hero movies. First, you have the brawny, exciting sagas, with sparkling verbal repartee, like ""Iron Man"" and ""Captain America,"" that are lightweight and exhilarating. Second, like ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" you have those that are dark, literate, complicated, and rely as much as possible on realism. ""The Avengers"" belongs to the first category, and Whedon's opus ranks as one of the best. The action never sacrifices its momentum for expository information about any of the heroes. Iron Man has lost none of his quirky, anti-heroic personality. Captain America is still as straight as one of Hawkeye's arrows. Hulk acquires a mystique lacking in prior incarnations, and Thor becomes the hammer wielding equivalent of an intergalactic lawman. Again, Loki's machinations keep thing interesting. ""The Avengers"" is the kind of movie where you need to stick around even as the end credits roll to learn more about the villains and the heroes."

","Having cracked the problem of super-hero movies with successful runs on Spider-Man and X-Men (both franchises contracted out to major studios), Marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters - Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - and did very well with a series of one-off movies which were commercially and critically well received. Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks moving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so I'm ignoring Abbott and Castello's role in bringing together Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).<br/><br/>The problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be nothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully judged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble pieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always going to be critical in this movie - is perfect.<br/><br/>I won't say anything very much about the content, because there is so much in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they haven't been changed for The Avengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action is stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...<br/><br/>By the way, thank you so much for saddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title ""Marvel Avengers Assemble"" (which communicates even less to a non-comics audience than ""The Avengers"") and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title screen."

","While the other Avenger films aren't bad this one takes the cake because it's smaller cast makes it easier to to get to know all the characters while in the later films it just throws in characters left and right and for those who haven't seen every MCU movie it's impossible to keep up with them."
"leftistcritic","2","2","4","14 January 2019"," Another annoying superhero movie
","While I rated Ant-Man and its sequel, along with Deadpool, well, this movie was not great. Like most movies of this genre it was just a big fight scene and scenes of people using their powers, interspersed with the glorifying of the U$ military. I would never, in a million years watch this movie again.<br/><br/>There is more to say on this film, however. I don't like this film for the same reasons that I don't like the 2009 Star Trek movie: it just ends up being one big battle scene and you don't know what is happening or with whom, becoming extremely hard to follow. I don't mind sci-fi films or those with battles, but it needs to be something organized where you can understand what is happening rather than not, as that lessens the enjoyment of watching movies such as this. Perhaps I am also negative about this film as I generally do not like superhero movies as they seem a bit too elitist for my taste, which is why I like films like Deadpool or Deadpool 2 which lampoon this absurdity directly.<br/><br/>I'd like to end by saying that this film will obviously be liked by many and probably did swell in the box office, so in these opinions I am likely in the minority, but that is fine as I am wholly principled about my opinions on this film."

","I watched this again recently (2016) after I've already watched all the other Marvel and superhero movies that came after it and this is still superior by a wide WIDE margin. The only superhero movie that eclipses this one is Dark Knight, imo.<br/><br/>Considering the problems we think DC is encountering, trying to cram up their heroes into one movie, the Avengers did it. FLAWLESSLY. The dialogue isn't exactly Glenn Garry Glenn Ross of course, but 99% of it keep you interested. The transitions to each scene are unbelievably fluid; the end of each scene almost always has a witty connection to the next. The objective viewer doesn't struggle at all to ride the wave of the movie.<br/><br/>Try to imagine if you haven't seen this movie but you've seen all the others. Try watching it again.

"antoniokowatsch","3","2","4","28 August 2016"," Doesn't live up to the comics
","Disclaimer: I am a comic book collector so my review is slightly biased by proxy. But bear with me for a moment.<br/><br/>The Avengers comics are some of my favorite Marvel comics (besides the ""New Avengers"" and the ""House of M"" comics) but the movie didn't live up to the legacy of the comics. The jokes in the movie were really good I gotta give them that. But humor alone isn't a good foundation for a movie (unless we're talking about movies which pertain to the Comedy genre, which is clearly not the case here)<br/><br/>The biggest problem that I personally had with the movie was the fact that 50% of the action in the movie happens on what appears to be a spaceship, that is reminiscent to those of the Start Trek franchise (I mean, an invisibility cloak? Come on now. Is this a joke? Because I'm pretty certain that the Avengers Quinjet didn't have this feature in the comics, /last time I checked, anyway)<br/><br/>In my opinion they should have simply titled the movie ""Attack of the spaceships"". Because that's the only consistent theme in the movie: spaceships.<br/><br/>Also, all of the main protagonists acted like little children throughout the majority of the movie. And then at the end they miraculously got a hold of themselves... *movie logic* Furthermore the HULK's development was completely unrealistic. At first he is this uncontrollable mess that can't be reasoned with. But then at the end he has absolute control over his alter ego ... *movie logic* (such a learning curve is unrealistic to say the least)<br/><br/>On a side note: the new Captain America suit looks goofy. What were the costume designers thinking? A helmet? ... Remove the helmet and give him his protruding wings on his headpiece back. For the love of God.<br/><br/>Instead of aimlessly pumping out movie adaptations Marvel should take it slowly and try to focus more on the quality of their movies (Quality > Quantity)<br/><br/>p.s. I'm not even going to rant about the fact that Marvel had to introduce yet another Universe just to make the movies work (because they are a-canon by nature ergo non-compliant with the original Marvel canon and the respective origin stories of the Avengers). <br/><br/>p.s.s. the reason why I'm so passionate about these types of movies (comic book adaptations) is because most people don't really care about the franchise. For them some fight scenes and explosions are completely sufficient. Not for me, thought. I genuinely care about the franchise and would like to see movies that do the genre justice. After all, people like me (Nerds) were the ones who made the comics a success to begin with. Long before there were any blockbuster movies about super heroes."
"WebHead62","9","2","4","14 December 2012"," Fun and well acted
","Going into this movie I was afraid there would be no plot and mindless action, and the characters wouldn't have enough screen time because there were too many. Surprise surprise the plot was pretty non existent, but that didn't really stop this movie from being a lot of fun. I give most of the credit to the actors. If you care about the people you are watching you will automatically enjoy the movie more. Every single character in this movie is played to perfection by their actor or actress which makes you care about the characters which helps make up for the lack of plot because lets be honest, the entire movie takes place on a flying aircraft carrier with the superheroes arguing with each other just waiting for the big finale in New York. Mark Ruffalo finally makes the hulk likable and the CGI hulk was pretty bad ass. Tom Hiddleston is an awesome Loki. He's not as good as he was in Thor, but I'm not sure that was even possible. Even supporting actors like Clark Gregg who plays Colston plays his part perfect. It could have been better. It's predictable and maybe the first hour is a little slow, but it's funny, well acted, and the action scenes are great so its worth a watch."

","Marvel started the MCU with it's first movie Iron Man back in 2008 but up until that point Marvel wasn't really on the radar for good comic book movies failing with every movie they put out in the early and mid 2000s from Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider, The Punisher, Daredevil, Electra the list goes on but that all changed with Iron Man and the creation of the MCU idea a series of movies that would build a roster of Superheros and Hero's from the ground up giving the main Avengers Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk their own separate movies to develop their characters and story as the time line moved forward and finally after five movies and over four years of waiting Marvel brought together the Avengers for their first team up and while all the movies in the MCU before this had made a massive profit and were loved by fans Avengers Assemble was Marvels biggest movie success that broke box office records achieved stellar reviews by both fans and critics and even after all the movies that came after it Avengers Assemble is still to this day one of the best comic book movies ever made giving die hard fans what they always wanted from their favourite comic book characters and creating a whole new generation of comic book fans that still continues to grow in 2020.<br/><br/>I really loved how the lesser known characters who were just cameos in the previous movies like Hawkeye and Black Widow got their chance to shine and evolve in this movie for example in Iron Man 2 Black Widow didn't do anything until the last 10 minutes of the movie and her character was very under developed same with Hawkeye in Thor he only got three lines and didn't even get to fire a single arrow at the time I was worried this is what was gunna happen to the none superhero characters that don't have their own movies but to Marvels credit they gave each character appropriate screen time and showed off just how badass Hawkeye and Black Widow can be and we got more character development and defined personalitys that make them the awsome characters they always have been.<br/><br/>The special effects and CGI is spectacular in this movie and really makes you appreciate just how amazing modern day movies with CGI and green screens can look when done right.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this movie if your a comic book and MCU fan even if your not and your just looking for a cool action movie to watch it's fun and badass."

Also, let me say I totally understand why the government stepped in during Civil War (2016). The Avengers rival Power Rangers in the kill count, sometimes demolishing entire cities and leaving probably millions either dead or homeless, and if you add that to the people that die because the Avengers didn't save them, well you've got a death toll that is sky high.

","In the beginning of the film I was a little bored. It progressed very slowly, and I feel like all marvel films are a little slow to begin with. Overall the movie was very entertaining and during the climax I was evidently at the edge of my seat. Truthfully I think the storyline was a little plain though. ""Bad guy is the not the of the good guy"" kinda thing, with minions who fight for him.<br/><br/>The cast, as always amazing, I love all their characters. My least favorite is probably the arrow dude, I can't even remember his name but some of his moves were pretty awesome. My favorite has to be scarlet Johanssons black widow.

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2012. The movie is directed by Joss Whedon, produced by Kevin Feige, screenplay by Joss Whedon. The story is written by Zak Penn, and Joss Whedon. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston. Loki launches an invasion of Earth leading the heroes of the Earth to band together and stop the invasion.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a great action movie. The movie incorporates the grand visuals found in the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and combines them for one spectacle featuring the heroes that we know and love. The movie focuses on the spectacle rather than having a complex narrative focusing on specific characters. In this way it is more of a large set piece with pre-existing characters rather than a full narrative movie. The spectacle is impressive to watch with the ending battle in New York City being the highlight. The scenes leading up to that moment are impressive as the heroes band and fight amongst each other. The movie is about the heroes as a whole rather than individuals.<br/><br/>The Avengers has great chemistry with its leads. Not only does the audience see visually impressive action but also the dynamic between the superheroes. The movie relishes in the heroes it has on display and it is a treat to watch for comic book fans. Audiences can see the heroes have their quarrel and what happens when Thor's hammer hits Captain America's shield. The story concerns the heroes and it is believable that Nick Fury's Avengers squad would not get along at first. It makes for an interesting story as the squad eventually overcomes their differences and begins to work together. This is a classic trope that is applied to a superhero story.<br/><br/>The flaw of this movie is that Loki has not been built up as a massive villain before. Loki always seemed more like a joker and a specific villain for Thor rather than a large scale villain that spanned into Iron Man and Captain America's stories. I still enjoyed Tom Hiddleston's performance and watching him on the screen is sure to delight.<br/><br/>I would recommend The Avengers.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","If you are a big fan of superhero movies, this is the best choice for you. Plenty of supernatural power and high technology are served. Also a variety of characters too. This is the first time 6 legends of MCU met each other. Moreover, this is the debut of the villain that creates the most connection with audience. Absolutely, I can say this is a unforgettable movie.
The film started in S.H.I.E.L.D. There were a research about Tesseract, one of the most powerful weapons and energy sources that came from space. This ambition of humanity brought Loki to the world. He destroyed everything to get Tesseract and throne. Moreover, he use his wand to control Hawkeye. Therefore, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to have heroes to fight and that made 6 unique persons to be Avengers. Tony Stark, or Iron man, was the first one in Avengers. Then, Natasha, Hulk, Captain america, and Thor followed. Could they beat Loki and how? Or could they bring Hawkeye back?
I like all of the actors and actresses in this movie. They could present their characters and understand them deeply. Especially, the 6 Avengers. The first one, Robert Downey Jr. , as Iron man, he is a very high experience actor and his performance represent Tony Stark very good. His funny habit made us more enjoy in this movie. The second one, Scarlett Johansson, as Natasha, she is female delegate that as important and talent as male. Although she didn't have any supernatural power, her mind and her physical is very strong. And Johansson can do it so well. Next one, Mark Ruffalo, as Hulk, although he wasn't the first man who act as Hulk, he can handle it perfectly both human form and Hulk form. He made us believe it was a monster inside him. The fourth and also the first Avengers, Captain america, played by Chris Evan. He is the one who had highest leadership, suitable to captain's position. He could make people love Captain america even though he didn't have any supernatural power except a Vibranium shield and America flag colored suit. The last one, Hawkeye, presented by Jeremy Renner, I really like him in this movie. He did so nice in the scene he was controlled. It looked like he was really controlled.
In this film, I think it was a gorgeous to see all the Avengers met each other and fight together. The story was continuously and smoothly from the beginning to the end. On the other hand, maybe, the way to pull Hawkeye out of control had to be harder. Also the way to beat enemy. But totally, this movie was still great and worth watching."

"davidmvining","7","0","0","25 November 2019"," This is the most cohesive film version of a manchild playing with his action figures I've ever seen.
","It reminds me of Van Helsing, but better.<br/><br/>The tesseract, the blue box MacGuffin from Captain America has awoken and called out to the cosmos. SHIELD, the organization tasked with protecting Earth and is experimenting with the tesseract, begins an evacuation as the little box becomes more active. Arrives Loki, slightly grungier and less interesting than we last saw him in Thor, is there to conquer. Telling Earthlings that we were made to be ruled and that freedom is a lie. It saddened me to see Loki, the made driven by a surprisingly complex combination of jealousy, anger, and ambition in his previous appearance relegated to generic bad guy, but oh well. The point of this movie isn't the conflict between antagonist and protagonist. The point is to get a bunch of protagonists together, struggle to work as a team, and then decide to work together as a team against a bigger threat.<br/><br/>That team is, of course, all of the heroes we've met over the last few movies. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk are joined by some smaller players like Black Widow and Hawkeye. The movie begins in a place where almost none of them have any previous relationship to each other, and the most fun from the film is the different heroes figuring out who the others are. Most have heard of Captain America, but he's still finding his feet and has an impression of Iron Man that's pretty accurate if a bit incomplete (impulsive and reckless without noting the heart of gold). Thor shows up and knows no one, only there to grab Loki, so the two Earthlings Iron Man and Captain America have a mutual beat down with Thor over who gets ownership of the captured Loki, drawing a stalemate. Hulk is brought along in his Bruce Banner disguise to help track the tesseract because it has a gamma signature and Banner is the best at tracking gamma rays.<br/><br/>Loki does his best Joker impression and intentionally gets captured so he can try to implode the team arraying against him from the inside. He knows of Hulk (supposedly because he started the movie by infiltrating SHIELD and gaining a few insiders through magical mind powers) and wants him to become the big green rage monster and cause destruction. It's not the worst plan in the world, but it's not great either. What it actually is is an excuse to get all of the Marvel heroes into a room and on one side of a larger conflict.<br/><br/>What helps the movie most is its balance of tone. It never gets too serious, keeping things light with quippy dialogue, conflicts between the heroes that never really turn too sour, and a death that's used for its dramatic purpose before being forgotten quickly enough to not color the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The action of the film is brightly lit and cleanly filmed. The fight between Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor in the forest at night (as Loki sits and watches) moves around dynamically but never becomes confusing. We understand geography easily and the introduction of Captain America later in the fight is handled with ease. The real bright spot in the film, action-wise, is the battle in New York.<br/><br/>With six heroes, one main antagonist, and a disposable CGI army, the film keeps the separate lines of action incredibly clear. Distinctly different locations (from a street to the top of Stark Tower to the top of another, clearly different, building to flying through the air), the film is able to make the visuals immediately communicate where the action is happening and who is involved, creating a marvelous sense of geography in such a large place of chaos. There is a long take late in the fight that passes from one hero to the next, and the amazing thing isn't the special effects, but the fact that it's more of an underline of who is where and not a clarifying moment. The conflict ends with the annoying ""We're all done now, bye!"" chestnut.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, while the experience is fun, I think the less interesting version of Loki as antagonist combined with the fact that the movie seems to have nothing to say beyond the facile idea of ""good guys need to work together"" keeps it from being anything more than an entertaining rollercoaster. Of course, the real goal was to entertain, and I think it does largely succeed."

","Bringing in Joss Whedon to direct and write Avengers Assemble fitted perfect, considering his history of tackling many characters within hundred and twenty or so minutes. After all he was director/writer of Buffy the vampire slayer. Never before has their been a superhero team up to this magnitude on the big screen. With a good sense of humour and someone who doesn't take superhero mesh ups too seriously Whedon gets the tone spot on! Loki played by Tom Hiddleton is entertaining once more. Vastly entertaining and cunning he is more than a match for our team of heroes. This film introduces the characters and builds them up into team work few the vehicle of Nick Furys shield. Each actor feels made for the part, big Sam is the epitome of Nick Fury. Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as Tony Stark like only he can and Scarlett Johanson is back a Black Widow. Each character is in their own world when founded to join shield. Captain American aka Chris Evans is trying to adapt to the modern world. Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo now taking over from Edward Norton, is still trying to remain safe without incidents. Iron Man is feeling uninitiated and unwanted from the shield and Thor played by Chris Hemworth is on earth to retrieve his brother. Loki retrieves the tesseract a power source energy and encounters the other, an extraterrestrial, whom in exchange will give him an army. This isn't the most indepth story but is lighthearted and never dull. Each character has different strengths which make them likeable and full engaging to watch. The visual effects are stunning and in world of their own and with a strong antagonist this film has soul and purpose in the comic book world."

Other will claim it's Back to the Future, or the Batman movies. Some might even say Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>For me, it's gotta be the Avengers.<br/><br/>What Joss Whedon pulled off with this movie is nothing short of extraordinary. He takes all of these larger-than-life characters, each with their own backstory, and makes them share the screen in a cohesive manner. The Avengers is funny, epic and, most importantly, revolutionary. It doesn't quite get five stars, because I believe Marvel has proven that they can do even better since, but this movie is still an absolute blast every time I watch it (and boy do I watch it way too often...)."

","This is one of the best films I've ever seen, not just because it's a fun action film, filled with characters that I've grown to love, but because it was the first of its kind, setting the bar for other multiple-character franchises. It's a first, and because of this it absolutely has its flaws, but it's definitely a game changer.<br/><br/>Despite having seven lead characters (counting all Avengers plus Loki), everyone got at least a few moments of screen time devoted to their development. With seven leads, that's pretty amazing. We have the quiet moments, the little gestures and phrases that have been picked apart time and again by the fans that have granted a depth to the film that wouldn't have been possible if this were the first time we met any of these characters, and that's the real beauty of Avengers. It's a team-up flick, but it's a team-up of characters we've all been introduced to before. (Even if you hadn't seen any of the previous films, there was a sort of pop culture awareness around most of them by the time it was released that you'd be hard pressed to go in blind about anyone except the characters who didn't have their own film yet and were, however regrettably, less important because of it.)<br/><br/>Combine that with a well-loved director who isn't afraid to sucker punch his audience, and you've got a perfect mix for a film that doesn't just thrill audiences with fight scenes that are larger-than-life, but gets people to invest emotionally in a fictional world. Avengers was released more than two years ago, but the film is still being picked apart and very much alive in the hearts and minds of the fans because of Marvel's expert world-building. In every show, every film, you see threads that lead back (or forward) to other events in the Universe, and it's this sort of continuity that the fans love. They pick up on every little reference, read into every word of dialogue, every prop placement, every choice that the creative team makes, and this is what has made Avengers so successful. It stands up to that test, and even with ten films under Marvel's belt, there's still very few inconsistencies. (Especially when you compare it to the next largest Marvel franchise, X-Men, which has some major timeline problems around Wolverine.)<br/><br/>All in all, this is a film that should be in every collection because it's not just great, it's revolutionary."

","Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk. Iron Man 2. Thor. Captain America: The First Avenger. The Avengers is the ultimate culmination of all those movies, which ranged in quality from slightly above-average to excellent. In my review of the first Iron Man, I called it the pinnacle of Marvel cinema. It has now been topped. The story goes that after Captain America, the Tesseract ended up at the bottom of the ocean, and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. pulled it out. Now Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wants it, due to its inherently unlimited power, which will give him the ability to rule with an iron fist over all of Earth. Unless the Avengers can get past their differences and stop him. I have recently come to the opinion that director and screenplay heavily influence acting (this may be a bit late to realize this, but whatever). It certainly seems to be true in this case. Joss Whedon is apparently great fun to work with, and his writing talent is well-known. Both of these might be reasons why each actor performs better in this movie than in previous Marvel films. The highlights are Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo, each playing characters with hidden emotional depth that boils to the surface in the most commendable of ways (especially the latter actor, for obvious reasons). Though this trio leads the pack, said pack is composed entirely of very strong performances, something not usually seen in ensembles, but which Whedon pulls together with the greatest of ease. Joss Whedon originally signed on for this project in April of 2010. He threw out former writer Zak Penn's screenplay and replaced it with his own. No disrespect to Mr. Penn, but I sincerely doubt his version was better-written than this. Whedon's script shines brightly in nearly every conversation, each one punctuated with his trademark, never-miss humor. Another thing he is known for is the characterization he imbues his writing with. From Buffy to The Cabin in the Woods, Whedon has never created a character that is anything less than compelling, a rule that still applies, even to a cast as large and star-studded as this. Interestingly (and wisely), this doesn't feel like Joss Whedon's The Avengers. This really does feel like Marvel's The Avengers, with Joss's cherry on top. The characters still match perfectly with their prevous cinematic versions. The character development is so strong, in fact, that in battle, none of the characters feel like more superpowered thugs; they are actual people, fighting for their lives and humanity. Of course, superhero movies aren't usually known for their characters. The special effects department really outdoes itself in this film. From the nether regions of outer space to the showdown between Iron Man and Thor, visually the film never fails to dazzle. The action sequences are filmed and edited with a sort of grace, with Whedon's signature shaky-cam and midshot zooms thrown in occasionally for good measure. Unlike most movies, the action scenes are not edited in quick shots. The camera rotates around our heroes as they kick extraterrestrial ass, and various other techniques are employed to keep action shots as long as possible. Though unconventional, this ensures that the action is just as absorbing as the dialogue, and works well to this effect, allowing both of those aspects to support each other. This attribute is extremely hard to come by in movies, but where you can find it, treasure it. Upon leaving this film (which I only did after the final credits had rolled), many of those leaving with me were laughing and talking animatedly about this film, recalling various scenes and how the quality fared in relation to other comic book films. My opinion is that this is the second-greatest one of the bunch, second only to The Dark Knight (story and thematic depth beat witty banter and numerous explosions any day). However, for those simply looking to be entertained, right now, you simply can't do any better than this."

I feel like this is for kids and teens and i like movies that are for adults and rated r, gore, not all the time, but most of the time. This film was enjoyable for the most part and all the Avengers did as they were expected to. A couple cool cinematic scenes during the final act which is clearly the only GREAT part of the movie. There are other good parts in the movie in the beginning and other times but not as good as the final act. The middle part of the movie is kind of boring but i feel like they were saving the budget for the end. I mean my eyes were on the screen the whole time so it wasn't like it was a bore. I cant wait to see Age of Ultron because Ultron look Bad ass. Overall, the movie did a good job representing the Avengers and i wanted to see al MCU movies in order but its all mixed around so that kinda makes me sad, but im not a BIG fan of these movies but these movies will stick with me forever and i will never forget about these Avenger movies.

","This film in essence is a fan boy film and hits all the spots you could've asked for as a marvel fan. Most the negative reviews I've seen of this film pull on aspects like too CGI dependent and compare it to films like dark knight or watchmen. Although films like watchmen and dark knight are superhero flicks like Avengers it's a very different ball park. Avengers is a fun ride with enjoyable characters, a great villain, good action, and it manages to do what no film of its time was able to. Successfully pull multiple main characters into a shared story which doesn't feel like overkill. The CGI element wasn't that big of a problem for me either. I do love practical effects and they trump CGI for me most of the time but when you've got such a heavy sci-fi story like this one you can't dream of using practical. It would be way too expensive and would take something away from the film for me. If you've never seen avengers and you love action, comedy and colourful costumes I urge you to check this out"

"ericlassiterthesecond","8","0","0","15 June 2019"," Epic, Exciting and Well Made.
","This movie started off the big budget franchise we loved for 7 years by now. Ok, let me get into why I liked this film. Starting with Story,
The story is interesting as it kept my attention from beginning to end and it was so exciting for us to have our heroes come together to fight against Loki but The Avengers doesn't have much of a story as it doesn't have layers to its story and its very simplistic compared to the complexity of the other Avengers films. They told a cohesive and understandable storyline in this first Avengers film.
Second, let's get into the characters of this film.
The characters have really great banter between them as you have really good chemistry between each member of the Avengers. The main characters have backstory established in the previous MCU Solo Films that built up to the Avengers and the characters are elaborately written. Cap as an example is a brave Soldier as established in the First Avenger and his character see's in Tony a man who wouldn't sacrifice himself or any kind of character inside the suit. Tony see's a man who got all his powers from a bottle who isn't worthy but they both prove each other wrong in specific MCU films such as Tony who almost killed himself to stop the Chitauri Invasion on Earth. Tony is a great character who's trying to do good and has guilt over his mistakes that he's done but I wish they had gone more into this backstory. The only character I didn't like was Loki, the villain who you couldn't understand and you didn't know why he was invading Earth. He's just a big threat who wants to Invade Earth because he just wants to but all the heroes have arcs until they cooperate with each other.
Third, let's explore the themes of this movie. There's deep themes of Sacrifice, Teamwork and Heroism. The Avengers mostly are working as a team and from beginning to end, they learn to cooperate with each other so they can defeat Loki. All the heroes are saving the world from Loki. An example of Sacrifice is Tony who almost sacrifices himself to save Earth from the Chitauri invasion.
Fourth, let's explore the acting. The cast is amazing. Robert Downey Jr is the best actor here as you cannot imagine anyone else in this role and Chris Evans shows the bravery of his character here. Scarlet Johansson is attractive and she's a fun female character who's a interesting spy. Mark Ruffalo has more charming humor than the other Hulk Actors and he's always having fun in this role. For me, the cast was great as everyone did a good job on their performances and roles.
Next, let me analyze the visuals. The special effects here are stunning as they all look realistic and the visuals are overly authentic as there's never a look at really fake looking CGI or special effects. The movie did well in this category. Therefore i like the movie and rate it 8/10."

","Despite its oversized running time, ""The Avengers"" is populist entertainment at its finest. All the elements that make up a crowd-pleasing blockbuster are here: There are the lovable characters played by charming movie stars, the snappy rat-tat-tat dialogue, the truly breathtaking special effects, and the sheer size of the entire project. From beginning to end, this feels like an event unfolding, and its hard to accomplish that kind of exciting, bombastic tone and extend even to non-devotees like myself. Luckily Joss Whedon is in full command of the medium here, deploying a truly impressive array of all-around technical and filmmaking talents that are well-matched by a superstar cast blessed with both acting chops and movie star charisma. For most of its running time it's a lot of fun, but in the last half hour it becomes a downright floor-shaking spectacle that showcases extraordinary CGI and sound effects in every frame."

","The marvel adventure could only go one way after the dismal Captain America, and thankfully things have got better! The combination of superheroes actually seemed to work for me, and the storyline was better than I expected. Clever that they've used a villain from another world and another movie...but does leave me wondering where the next Avenger film can go from here?!<br/><br/>The most pleasing upgrade for me is the Incredible Hulk. From Ed Norton's boring and dull portrayal of this green monster...Mark Ruffalo has transformed this beast into an integral character with all sorts of edginess that keeps the viewer hooked! Ultimately though, once again the stand out actor is Mr Downey Junior himself, who just seems to get better with every marvel film he is in! The witty lines and the persona which he displays as Iron man is a joy to behold!<br/><br/>With the storyline needing to be a little farfetched, Marvel have done well to keep it just this side of the line of reality! Whilst recognising that something extraordinarily and extravagant would be needed to bring these superheroes together, there are times in the film that it's in slight danger of crossing that line! Still...not bad at all in my book

","""Endgame"" prep began with me deciding to rewatch the three Avengers films starting with 2012's ""Avengers Assemble"" as it was called in the UK. I can't believe it was only 7 years ago, it seems like so much longer.<br/><br/>Thanos (inexplicably, given what's to come) lends an infinity stone to Loki, so he can head to Earth and conquer it. In return, Loki will acquire the Tesseract, use it to transport his Chitari army across the galaxy and then, presumably, hand the stones over to Thanos. Following the loss of the Tesseract, Nick Fury instigates his Avengers Initiative program, pulling together some of the exceptional people known to SHIELD to form a response unit, to the threat of intergalactic war.<br/><br/>Happily, ""AA"" still holds up really well. The effects are still strong, only one little scene of Captain America outside the Helicarrier clearly looking like a CGI stuntman and some weird scaling on Hulk in the final stare down with Loki. There are some awesome scenes in it, iconic even. Hulk chasing Black Widow down the corridor before leading into the fight with Thor, the ""Puny God"" moment and essentially the whole Chitari showdown battle.<br/><br/>Character wise it's strong too. Starting some relationships that continue to pan out in the series. Friendships between Romanov and Banner and Stark and Banner. The immediate antagonism between the opposites of Stark and Rogers, but also starting Cap's distrust of organisations that would pay off in The Winters Soldier. The character whose probably least like he is now is Loki, much more vicious and condescending in this than he becomes... though even there, there are moments, between him and Thor.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film though, it does have quite a large block in the middle, between the capture of Loki and Barton's attack that feels a little draggy, again there's a lot of good character work here but compared to the later films it's a little slow. Though it has funny moments, it's obviously not as referential as the films could become later, when there were a few more of them.<br/><br/>Though it's been superseded in quality over the years, ""Avengers Assemble"" remains a high point in the series and a real indicator of what a combined cinematic universe could offer."

","Initiating the first crossover of Marvel's cinematic universe, as well as for The Avengers, the first installment brings us more than action and a whole solid story like Iron Man could be.
The film tells us an alliance of Supeh√©roess that unite to defeat Loki, Thor's evil brother, which the latter had to defeat in his solo film.
The film has a well-carried narrative, the CGI does not feel that it clashes during the film, it is intelligent to bring us an antagonist rather than entertaining as others of other films, and has a coherent reason why it does evil, while the performances They are still cool as in their films, the characters have these characteristics which make it more realistic and nothing flat, which is half questionable is the soundtrack, I mean, this is NOT very important in this genre, but placar√±as, it was necessary to repeat the same Music sequence like 12 times??? ...
Although out of it, it remains in Baundcrrack and is not distracting or annoying, but prestandole attention, questionable.
While in other sections, it feels pleasant and serves, Tony is still arrogant but aware of everything that is happening, and saves the world carrying the missile that was going to destroy NY sending it to a kind of portal where the ¬® ¬® henchmen ¬® of Loki.
Thor is still arrogant as in his film, but this one concentrates on the same Loki and what he can cause.
While the Hulk has a bigger role than normal, now does not destroy things because if or destructive things, now is right and does well without feeling generic.
Much of this battle takes place in Midtown Manhattan, where the sharpest sequences involve the huge snake-lizard-wavy snake dragon Machine from Loki, which seems to have a mind of its own and is backed by countless coils. At Any given moment, a Avenger flies into the mouth of this leviathan and penetrates its full length, emerging at the end of the business. You Won't see that in ""The Human Centipede.""<br/><br/>""Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms,"" predicts critic David Edelstein in New York magazine, confirming something he had vaguely suspected about them. If you're right, it's time for the desperately needed movies to reeducate the nerds in the joys of sex. ""The Avengers"" is well done by Joss Whedon, with style and energy. It Gives your fans exactly what they want. If It's exactly what they deserve, it's moot.
Anyway, it's a good movie anyway. 3.5/5"

","The Avengers was awesome. It should not have been. There were so many characters that writing a coherent screenplay and doing each character justice should have been impossible. But nevertheless, Joss Whedon managed to write an awesome screenplay.
My only flaw, because let's get it out of the way, was that the first act was slightly slow. But it needed to be slow to give the characters motivations, and bring them together convincingly. I was also surprised at how funny the movie actually was.
All the character, be it Iron Man or Black Widow, we're given sufficient screen time. Nobody look out of their depth. Everyone was in the movie for a reason, and in the final battle, all the characters proved to be useful.
Also, this movie gave us the best version of the Hulk. Technically, the movie was flawless.
Marvel has always suffered with it's villains. I am happy to say that Loki is one of the best villains ever. He was manipulative, cunning and charming at the same time.
Before this movie, so many superheroes coming together seemed like a dream. Marvel was betting everything on this movie. And this movie succeeded. It has changed Hollywood forever.

This movie is a prime example of a movie that gets better as it goes along. The Battle Of New York is arguably one of the greatest action sequences in film history.

Iron man teaming up with Captain America? Thor measures strength with hulk? So many childhood dreams are flowing in the air. And I want them fulfilled now!<br/><br/>The start gives a cold push to the plot in attempt to set up the main line but then also without any rush users us individually through every hero to finally make that eruption of boiling joy upon seeing Marvel iconic creations together. The pace after that runs down like a mountain river and your brain engorges the evens demanding more and more.<br/><br/>Those who expect some twists or mind-bending storylines would be disappointed cause this is obviously an attraction to boost the popularity of this particular comic world to the global recognition. Instead of exercising your brain just relax and try not to jump from all adrenaline that fills you constantly during the whole sequence.<br/><br/>Every character either old or seen for the first time builds up a pretty solid reputation and furthermore tries to look better among others that predictably gives us a peculiar showcase of abilities that increase a desire to meet with them closer in their spin-offs.<br/><br/>Finally through masterful visuals covered by supreme score by Alan Silvestri we get what was expected and even more: a big bold statement of Marvel that shows the ability to bring comic books into life in a jaw-dropping manner; and along with Samuel L.

"tabuno","7","0","0","17 January 2019"," A Disparate Collection of Super Heroes that Don't Quite Come Together
","6 May 2012. Few ensemble movies, especially superhero movies offer the balanced, cohesive narrative that make for a well edited, rich character developed, and strongly compelling storyline. Unfortunately for The Avengers, though record-breaking at the box office not withstanding, The Avengers, can at best, be considered entertaining, but is more aptly described as a rather forced piece of movie scriptwriting and directing that attempts to corral a rather disparate bunch of superheros with mixed results. Unlike the more acceptable and appealing television series ensemble of super people in Heroes (2006-2010) or even the more enjoyable animated feature film of super family members in The Incredibles (2004), and the funny team of disparate members including the straight man (female) Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984), The Avengers awkwardly introduces its Superheroes almost in sequel form, some with even chaotic brief flashbacks, that results in an uneasy alliance that feels quite uncomfortable as if the Jess Whedon himself was having trouble with his dialogue between the superheroes. As an example, Gwyneth Paltrow, unlike Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984) is never given the opportunity to really have a solid place in the movie. And even the highly praised performance of Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, even this bi-polar identity is left in doubt as The Hulk is presented as two different personas, earlier in the movie as this Beast and then later somewhat more questionable as this conscientious animal (which as an animal is quite unlikely a transformation). There is an apparent imbalance in the presentation among Ironman and Captain America and Thor. X-Men (2000), Fantastic Four (2005), and Star Trek (2009) all have a much more polished set-ups between their disparate ensemble characters. Instead Joss Whedon has introduced dollops of solid stand-up comic one-liners and humor that seems pretentious clever cover-ups even as they hit home. Unlike his own previous ensemble work in the well received Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) and Angel (1999-2004) series, here Joss Whedon is seemingly unable to recapture the same smooth but edgy magic as those earlier television series. The storyline also seems to veer in several isolated superhero scenes that make the overall rhythm and flow of the story rocky in its depiction on the screen, there seems too many characters and too many simultaneous events going on at the same time, almost more the actor script contractual obligations of screen time rather than for the integrity of the story itself. Inception (2010) probably includes some of the best integrated separate story lines that are presented simultaneously in its unique movie within and movie within a movie technique or Pulp Fiction (1994), Traffic (2001) and The Air I Breathe (2007) interweave several plot strands in a nicely, enriched presented fashion. It is apparent that some efforts at making this movie stand out with a few enhancements in special effects (like the destruction scene shot from the perspective of one of the vehicles being hurdled in the maelstrom) and several minutes of dialogue of lofty sounding metaphysical and emotional depth, yet the overall impact is more superficial without the emotive and intellectual probing found in even more singularly focused superhero movies as Green Lantern (2011), Elektra (2005), Spiderman 2 (2004) or Spiderman 3 (2007). Of particularly, note it almost seems like the news media has been influenced by over-reporting the critical acclaim of this movie as Metacritic rates it only a 69 which while good isn't really outstanding by any means, contributing to a rather false marketing effort in itself suggesting that some movie critics are in league with the movie industry itself."

","When the world is threatened by Loki who's determined to bring an army of evil-doers to Earth, a couple of superheroes are gathered together in order to form a team and defeat the upcoming invasion. The only thing that apparently stand in the way is their ego, each one of them having an idea of his own, while teamwork is a word which apparently they don't understand.<br/><br/>It's a movie which features a great invasion of Earth while Ironman, Thor, Captain America and a couple of others must fight back to defeat it, and at the same time, struggle to work together as a team. It's one of those movies which amazes through its visuals, presents a good but overused plot in which MARVEL Superheroes show- off their powers while saving the world. As I said before, it looks astonishing, the characters are well described and put into picture, also very well played by their actors, the fighting sequences are top-notch and almost everything is very good. Of course, except the plot which simply wasn't enough to make it a masterpiece. It is good enough to make such a movie entertaining and sustainable, but not good enough to make it truly great. <br/><br/>I like these kind of movies, where very popular characters with superpowers fight their way through saving the world, but it tends to be a bit boring to see how the world is attacked by a not so impressive force of evil, this time led by Loki (very well played but not so impressive as villain), over and over again. Oh, and as a result, the ending is very predictable. Something with a bit more depth could have helped a lot in terms of story. Yes, they tried to add a bit of additional suspense and even comedy through their opposing characters, almost making them fight each other, but it isn't enough from my point of view to make it a truly great movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a must see for Marvel fans, for superhero fans and for everyone looking to have a good time. You won't be disappointed by any aspect of it. Just don't expect a breath-taking plot, as there won't be one."

Robert Downey Jr. is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie! Mark Ruffalo makes the best Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" to date, with a serious and human, yet comedic performance!

Chris Hemsworth isn't a remarkable actor either, but he has nice charisma and fits the role as Thor! Scarlett Johansson is smoking hot and sexy, and much more relevant than she was in Iron Man 2! Jeremy Renner was Agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye! Samuel L. Jackson was epic in the role of Nick Fury! Tom Hiddleston is really strong and serious villain!.

Bruce Banner was flat flat flat. At least when he turned into the Hulk he had some passion."

","I was really looking forward to the Avengers and, I have to say I was disappointed. Lousy acting (Samuel L. Jackson (who's usually reliable was wooden and had no real take on the character), Robert Downey, (good thing he wore waterproof mascara for his close-ups) Scarlett Johanssson, who needs to go back to acting school, Mark Ruffalo, (what was his take on the part? he just looked confused and lacked confidence), dead spots that almost put me sleep, some very cheesy F/X using miniatures, particularly noticeable in 3D. Lousy photography...the 3D glasses made everything seem dark and drab, I found myself taking them off and seeing much brighter scenes. I'm sure if you're a 12 year old (sadly I'm not) this movie is the best thing you've ever seen, but there are so many other movies of this genre that are so much better on every level (X- Men, and the Batman series in the capable hands of Christopher Nolan to mention two). Captain America's padding in his shirts was laughable (did they run out of CG's, because he looked much better in his own movie). I'm comparing this movie to Avatar because I was also disappointed with that one too, as it relied totally on on special effects, weak story- line, to make it's success. Oh well, I'll look forward to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" because I know Christopher Nolan will not let me down."

","Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) come off as actors playing dress-up.<br/><br/>But despite the assured performances, The Avengers is unconvincing: The illusion doesn't stick. The story ties itself into knots to rationalize why these disparate superheroes would ever band together, under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), to thwart the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Right from the opening scene, a belabored set piece boasting one of the most listless car chases ever filmed, the movie feels off. Everyone talks too much. The pace lumbers. Extraneous characters eat up screen time. You hunker down in your seat and shrug it off, patiently waiting for the film to kick into gear. By the end, you're still waiting."
"azeeliramli","6","6","20","29 April 2012"," Entertaining popcorn flick it may be, but best superhero movie it is NOT!
","INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>After watching both Ironman movies, all Hulk movies, Thor and Captain America, watching Avengers is a sensible thing for me to do.<br/><br/>WHAT'S HOT <br/><br/>Great casts. Majority of them carry their parts well. Its nice to see all the familiar faces from previous movies.<br/><br/>Great action scenes and impressive visual effects. The final New York scene is awesome. So many things to focus on, sensory overload! <br/><br/>Ironman. On the field, Steve Rogers may be the unofficial leader of the team, but it is Tony Stark who performs most of the important, life-saving duties. The backbone of The Avengers.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson and Cobie Smulders. Enuff said.<br/><br/>WHAT'S NOT <br/><br/>Loki. I understand that sometimes a couple of jokes here and there can be good, but when some of the jokes come from the result of the main villain being stupid, weak, being thrashed around, that's not good. What makes a good superhero movie is, among other things, the villain. His or her on-screen presence should instill fear, uncertainties, and in some ways, respect.<br/><br/>Alien soldiers. There is no doubt that Ironman, Hulk, Thor and Capt America can kick aliens' ass anytime anyday, but Black Widow? Come on... I understand that this is a comic book movie, therefore any logic should be thrown out of the window, but Black Widow beating many alien soldiers without much difficulties is way too much. No doubt that she is a formidable fighter and can overcome many human opponents as we have seen in Ironman 2, but to be on the front line during an alien invasion is a no-no. She is more suitable for espionage, covert, intel-gathering, kind of duties.<br/><br/>Black Widow. Same as above.<br/><br/>Familiar story lines. Using a space portal to send alien soldiers and ships to attack earth? We have seen that in Transformers : Dark of The Moon. Huge alien attack craft that looks like 'fish'? Also seen that in the same Transformers! Destroying alien mothership using a nuclear warhead? Seen that in Independence Day.<br/><br/>Police / Army. I know this movie is about a team of superheroes saving our world from alien invasion, but the apparent lack of support from the police and armies in fighting the aliens is so glaring. The freedom of 6 billion people under threat and yet you rely on less than 10 persons? The results are our heroes performing less important tasks such as saving civilians cornered by weak and easily defeatable alien soldiers (as evidenced by Black Widow) in a bank and rescuing people trapped in a bus! Delegate those things to the police, firemen, or ground troops, and focus on the bigger task of defeating Loki and closing the space portal.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>An enjoyable movie. I had a good laugh on some of the scenes, mostly involving Hulk. In my opinion, The Dark Knight is still the best comic book movie, and maybe the title will go to The Dark Knight Rises in 2 months time."

","So Avengers finally out but is any good. No. Not good. Not bad but not good. Is movie that plays to lowest common denominator. Only stupid people like film. It go too far, makes comic fantasy into very silly. Comic not this silly, comic in my country have adult themes and messages but this is punching and more punching. Few funny things. Mostly funny punching. There is lots of punching. First it gets silly then stay silly then feel like blaming you for being silly too... with punching. Script make sense only if you hang on toilet wall. Not make sense in film. People say film awesome. Batman awesome, has story. Makers assume you smart enough to feed yourself. This one assume dumb enough to chew off own fingers if try to eat hotdog. Is OK. Just not good. Iron man was good. He good character, funny and engaged with reason why he punching. Captain American not bad but too silly. This one just too silly. Liked hulk a bit but was there hulk film? Don't think so. Hawkeye rubbish. Heros are legend, god, monster and funny armour man who drink a lot... and Hawkeye. He has a bow and arrow. He not scary. My kid has bow and arrow. Used to. He shot cat, made him eat it. Only way they learn. Why they call avengers? They not avenge anything. They should call something else. Maybe call them justice league. That has nice ring. And cute girl in tight clothes. Nice touch. Was OK and approve. So. Not bad film. Like watching poor version of iron man or good version of Captain American. bit disappoint. Recommend for people with nothing better to do. Maybe people with little brain. For big brain wait for batman instead or read book. They are paper things with word, sometimes picture. If liked film you might not know this."

","huge rating on IMDb, woaw really ? well the movie must be good so...<br/><br/>but...hum... finally, after 2h and something, well it has nothing to do with a 8.7 movie.<br/><br/>Seriously, like it is mentioned in several occasions in other reviews, there is almost zero carachter developments, zero plot, zero reason for these heroes and villains to do what they are doing, who is behind loky, why the invasion, what's at stack on the long run, nothing but a series of pointless discussions and arguing between characters, nothing more.<br/><br/>the scenario is ten times viewed before, the hole in the sky with monster coming to manathan, i mean how long ago was ghostbusters made ? the kind of flying worms are super close to the transformer 3 same type of monsters. <br/><br/>the screenplay/storyboard work are just average, just a few stunning moment,, not epic developments, no just a basic movie for kids, that;s all I can see here.<br/><br/>To be fair and honest, if the rating of this movie would have been what it should be, around 6 to 7, i would have given a 4 or 5 rating but as obviously, some marketing companies are pushing the rates up, I must deliver a simple 1 to contribute to balance things for readers who keeps on looking at the rating before watching this in theatre or buying an expensive blue ray 3d DVD.<br/><br/>Really, a below average action pack movie, nothing more."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","5","16","28 April 2012"," About as spectacular and fun as you could wish for.
","So glad to see that this movie did basically nothing wrong. I had my fears and doubts about it, I mean, so many big superheroes in one movie, isn't that like having too many captains on one ship? But no, everything I feared for got greatly and cleverly handled in the movie and I liked it even far better than expected.<br/><br/>The movie simply made all of the right choices it seemed. It used the best elements from the Iron Man movies, ""Thor"", ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and the Hulk movies. Not only that, it also used the best of its main characters. Everybody of course has their own set of skills, powers and specialties, which greatly get used in the movie. Everybody gets to do something and gets about as much screen time as the other. Many people thought that Tony Stark/Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., would steal the show and get most of the screen time, since his character is the best and most fun one. But no, every hero gets their moment of glory in this movie and their moment to fully shine, even those without the superpowers, such as Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, played by Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson. <br/><br/>But if you would force me to point out one person that gets to shine the most in this movie, it would be the Hulk, played this time by Mark Ruffalo. You have never seen the Hulk do so much awesome stuff and he also definitely comes across as the most powerful one of the bunch.<br/><br/>It's so awesome and a true accomplishment that they actually pulled it off to get all of these characters and actors together for this one movie. Lots of characters from the Iron Man movies, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" reprise their roles in this movie, which makes all of the movies feel more connected than ever before.<br/><br/>It's also a real accomplishment that they managed to keep the same style and tone throughout the entire movie. This also caused Iron Man to not take over the movie for instance, with his wisecracking jokes, or Thor with his old fashioned, Shakespeare-like, dialog. The entire movie feels like one big whole, even when its purely focusing on just one of its main characters.<br/><br/>I also really loved the interaction between all of the characters. They don't all like each other and some are even somewhat suspicious of each other. A true ego-clash if you will, which also results at times the different superheroes battling each other. This is the sort of stuff that I'm sure of lots of fan-boys and girls wanted to see. <br/><br/>It also was a great move to make Loki the main villain of this movie. He was the best villain, in all of the Marvel superhero movies, in my opinion, so personally I was very glad to see him return, in such a big role again. And yes, every superhero has a go at him at one point in this movie, which again, is something that fan-boys and girls will be drooling at, especially since it's all something truly great and spectacular to watch.<br/><br/>And it really is a spectacular movie. Basically it's being like non-stop, action fun and the movie it's final perhaps is the best and most spectacular one you are ever likely to see. Truly some intense and awesome stuff to watch, when all of the superheroes for the very first time truly work as a time and battle side by side with each other. Stuff that will give some people goosebumps for sure, also because it's filmed so extremely well, with the help of some great looking special effects as well.<br/><br/>But how about the story? well, it's nothing too great or original but this hardly harms the movie. It's all about its main characters coming together and teaming up for the first time, on film. Really, the story is totally secondary and most of the time you wont even pay attention to it, since there is so much else good stuff going on screen! Joss Whedon did a more than great job with directing this movie.<br/><br/>This is basically how great, fun, spectacular, big budget, entertainment should be like!<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Avengers is a movie I have been waiting to see for 30 years. With the style of the Xmen & Spiderman films, in addition to the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain American films; it was pretty clear what type of movie this was going to be. Big, loud, slick, exciting, and light on story. Joss Whedon's influence has made for a much better movie, his witty and sometimes intelligent screenplay lifts this from a middle of the road Marvel movie to something that is a great popcorn movie. All the performances are spot-on, and the photography and cgi beautiful. This is very much a movie for the fans, but anyone can enjoy it. Don't expect a complex interwoven plot, but a classic good guys v bad guys movie. Loads of fun, so leave your brain at the door and dive in!"
"Greenwade","7","4","12","2 June 2012"," Big Audience, Small Impression
","The Avengers by Marvel received high ratings from several movie sources and although the film attracted audiences, it didn't leave the audience with an impression. If you want a simple, action-oriented flick with decent characters, laughs, good cinematography, and some small levels of character transformation, this is the movie for you. However, if you are looking for something that speaks to your soul, entertains, shocks, and leaves you with an unyielding catharsis, then forget about it. The Avengers was rated in three fields; cinematography, story structure (plot & theme), and characterization. Of these, it ranked highest in cinematography and store structure, although it ranked fairly evenly in all three ‚Äì a balanced and organized film. However, it lack focus and import regarding the theme, and the plethora of characters makes it difficult for the audience to connect with their trials. Consequently, when Iron Man undergoes his ordeal, the audience feels disconnected and cannot experience the catharsis intended. Overall, it was a good film with good acting, organization, and appeal, but when it comes down greatness, it doesn't fit the bill."
"dann-385-763059","8","4","12","1 June 2012"," Great super hero flick (ignore the one star ratings)
","To start with I cannot understand how anyone can give this under 5 out of 10 stars let alone the ridiculous 1 star ratings. We watched this movie knowing it was going to be a superhero flick so was basically going to have a lot of action scenes and naturally it's going to be full of CGI. Also I expected some one liners that would be witty and corny. If you expected anything different then your previous superhero movie experiences may of been categorized a little wrong. All up it was a great movie and lived up to my expectations which is usually not the case. It was a longer than expected movie and probably could of been shortened a little in the first half but all was forgiven once the heroes started showing off their skills. Some great witty humor, some lines a little corny. The storyline was not too predictable either. Unless of coarse you feel the superheroes saving the day is too predictable. I left the cinema wondering when the Bluray release date will be and debating who the ultimate superhero really would be."
"castala","8","4","12","31 May 2012"," Fine, but
","I've seen it in 3D and I'm afraid to say it's adding nothing to this film. In fact, like it happened in so many other films boosted for 3D, the lighting is too dark. For the rest, the movie is as funny as the first Iron Man movie. It's made with serious, but tongue-in-cheek humour. The cast in incredibly laughable. All the main characters are played by great actors, which is helping to support all the non-sense parts of the script. The craziest one is certainly Mark Ruffalo who's playing David Banner, a.k.a The Incredible Hulk. The man is always angry, and it takes a long time before we could see the deepness of his anger. But the waiting is good. The first part of the movie is just too slow, it takes too much time to start. As if the authors were trying too hard to explain every links with all the other Marvel movies made before. It's not always useful. It's nice to see some more great actors like Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johanson to join this team."
"alexdelliott","5","4","12","22 May 2012"," ...well it was okay I suppose
","STORY: Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D assembles a group of Marvel superheroes to stop Loki from using a device he stole to inevitably destroy the world. This really isn't treading any new ground as far as storytelling goes (I don't know how close it is to the comic). Yes the superheroes are all pretty cool but that's why they each have their own film. I feel that having all of them there didn't really allow for any development of the characters who all seemed to be competing for screen time. It was fairly unoriginal considering the films out there, an invading alien army comes to take over the world (by which I mean an alien army comes and invades America; the only place aliens ever seem to attack). I feel they tried to fit so much in that the story in general was entertaining but also seemed a bit rushed and not very original, as far as I could see it was something straight out of Hollywood. 2.5/5<br/><br/>EXECUTION: The film was directed in the same way you would expect from this type of film. It had the epic explosive feel of a Michael Bay film (to be honest I thought he may have directed it until I saw the credits at the end). There were some pretty impressive action scenes which do enough to keep you watching right the way through, it was never boring for even a minute. However it was all very formulaic and the whole point of the film seemed to be to show off epic fights and to allow for cheesy lines from our heroes which come rapidly about every 5 minutes. The acting was actually pretty good. I'm not usually a fan of Robert Downey Jr. but he played his role very well. Samuel L Jackson did what he does best, playing the ""badass"" he's known for. The acting was definitely the best aspect of the film. 3.5/5<br/><br/>VERDICT: It was okay, I went to see it with friends and we all thought it was a fun, solid action film. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Everyone seemed to think it was spectacular, I don't know if this was due to the hype or if it was people who read the comics. I just can't say I thought it was anything special, which was disappointing (although I seem to be against the world on this one so don't just take my opinion). See it if you enjoyed the second and third Transformers films or if you fancy unwinding with an above average action film. 2.5/5 + 3.5/5 = 6/10"
"adhipar","7","4","12","21 May 2012"," What's wrong with Americans?
","Okay, I'm expecting a full-packed action film but instead I get a more drama than action film. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not as I expected in an 'ultimate' superheroes movie. Ultimate as more superheroes = more awesomeness.<br/><br/>However, most of this film is more about battle of ego than saving the world, actually their ego are the real threats to this world. Except Hulk which seems there purely for action, the others need some push and a good person must die, like saving the world is not enough cause and a retaliation/revenge gives better reason. So some reel time is waste for this 'superhero drama' instead for action. I kind of disappointed with these 'selfish' superheroes. Luckily, Hulk gives several comic relief and save the movie.<br/><br/>The action is slowly build up towards the end (too slow for me) but it pays off in the final battle. Not as spectacular as I expected but in the end it provides just enough reason why there must be a team like Avengers in this Marvel Universe. <br/><br/>The thing that disturbed me the most is those Americans, those people who happen to be in the wrong time at the wrong place - well, not only in this film but also others like the Transformers series, etc. The city streets has become the battle ground and those mortal, ordinary people still there in the streets, watching very closely like it's just a parade or a flash mob and deliberately provide themselves as collateral damages. What's wrong with these people? Is every Americans so stupid or have suicidal tendencies? Audience can except the collateral damages, the panicked citizens, people runs for their life in the 1st 3 minutes of the battle, but after that the filmmaker should simply have a scene of these people watching from afar, behind road blocks with police guard, peeking from a secure hide-out etc.<br/><br/>The execution is good but the script could be improved. We already know they are superheroes and there are already prequels for each character so instead of taking lots of time talking out of their differences, let these characters solve their differences in battle over battle before the final one. Lots of battle, lots of action's awesomeness. Therefore, my grin could last for days. They also failed to explain why Hulk can transform from an uncontrollable destroyer into a cooperative teammate in no time which feels like I miss some important scenes.<br/><br/>The use of CGI - after several 'heavy CGI' films - is starting to become dull. It's like the film maker has no other choice to awe audience than using bigger explosion, more fatal destructions. Film like ""chronicles"" provide better use of CGI for enhancing the story while not as grande as this. So overall, I give it 6.5/10. Sorry for my English."

You're meaning to tell me this ranks up there with films like The Godfather and Shawshank Redemption? Come on now.<br/><br/>There were some really good parts. There were some almost unbelievably bad parts.(First 10-20 min. was like watching another flick entirely) Acting was up and down, but overall it wasn't bad by any means. dialogue was spotty, but had some good lines and few laughs. LOADS of CGI but the action was intense AF. So at the end of the day, it's entertaining. I couldn't watch it 5-6 times, but none the less entertaining.<br/><br/>Now for those who can't seem to understand how ratings work. Was it the best movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 10/10. Was it the worst movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 1/10. Simple. And for those expecting some original, new, fresh plot and amazingly moving dialogue. Seriously? Go somewhere else with that sh*t. What could they have possibly done that's creative with superheros? Especially ones that have been around for 60+ years.<br/><br/>Sorry, ranting a bit.

"zgarrison88","6","4","12","11 May 2012"," Can't Compare to The Dark Knight?... just did
","First off, I'd like to say that The Avengers was a GOOD movie. However, it was hyped up way too much, and after reading some review online, I think I know what my problem with it was. A lot of people are calling The Avengers the anti-Dark Knight. While I agree that these two movies are completely different, they are easily compared, and The Dark Knight wins by a mile. I was never really into comic books, but Batman has one of my favorites anyway. After seeing The Avengers, my only favorite was Iron Man, and only because of his own movie and, of course, Robert Downey Jr.. But getting to the point, the Avengers hardly had a plot. It was by far the coolest movie I have seen a while, but some of the things were just too annoying to get past. First: Transformers 3 much? Next: Many people say that Tom Hiddleston was fantastic as Loki. Maybe I wasn't watching the same movie, because he seemed to act without motivation and, indeed, a bit shallowly. Before being defeated, he reveals everything to the Black Widow, one who has clearly revealed her ploy already. For being a guy powerful enough to bring a massive army from another planet, he, and his army, were sure beaten pretty easily. Also, was anyone else perturbed by Hulk's sudden ability to control ""The Other Guy"" (a stupid name to begin with) at the end? It's details like these, along with the lack of plot and themes that make me give this a 7/10. However, still a very enjoyable film, and I highly recommend seeing... as long as you don't claim it an 8.8, or #30 on IMDb."
"Andybes_team","7","4","12","7 May 2012"," Great Superhero movie for Kids but nowhere near what I expected!
","OK glad to start doing reviews on IMDb. <br/><br/>The Avengers 'WHAT A MOVIE' seems to be the line on everybody's lips. Well I am going to say after seeing it both 3D and 2D that I can make an honest objective opinion.<br/><br/>The special effects which whether you like it or not is one of the movie's highlights. YES they are GOOD and nicely done BUT why the 3D? Why did I pay for a 3D movie where the 3D was never used in his pure awesomeness? Yes it's cheesy and cheap to see boulders, pieces of buildings tires, arrows explosions and all sort of stuff flying towards you but it's ALSO FUN & that's why you go to see it in 3D. Well let me tell you this movie HAS NONE of that. No Sir it's just simple digital 3D shots of New York and other stuff! NOTHING SPECIAL...sad to see that after 3-4 years AVATAR still holds the CROWN it should give you an idea about this.<br/><br/>Acting is good all the way to great. AND YES Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR. steals the show) which can be good if your a fan like me but can also be bad for the rest of the crew. He is great the others are OK. HULK is amazing but then again he is CGI!<br/><br/>The story and here is where it starts to get annoying. Guys some of these characters did not have they're own movie so it's hard to relate to them get to care for them especially when you won't have enough time to do so...So why so much Black Widow? Then again why no drama no connections between them. I honestly expected to see Captain America fall for Black Widow as the comic books say. Still it's the 1st part so there is time but make's you feel like you haven't been treated with the whole cake but a cookie.<br/><br/>Going to the action scene is where I get disappointed! Alien Invasion??? Where in the middle of New York with no real damage to the city. What happened to the BIG BOOMS and explosions. Where the hell was the ARMY? Where were all those special weapons STARK created for so long. Where the hell was WAR MACHINE as the Air Force Commander. No Sir here you will only see a bunch of cops (fat ones also) fighting alongside our 6 fellas to protect the city. And the only idea the government has is to NUKE the city 10 minutes after the invasion. Very ORIGINAL it was one of those sad moments in my life as a movie enthusiast where I actually did MISSED Michael Bay and his explosions and action scenes. Again you can make an idea about the War Scene.<br/><br/>Ending this review with my last disappointment! I know I know it'a a PG movie but PLEASE stop making it so if you going to loose every bit of drama left in the movie. Yes you won't see swearing in the movie or blood or naked women or at least people dying. NO NO this is a kids movie with superheroes that is no where near as good as IMDb score is now. I felt cheated because my expectation for this movie were huge!<br/><br/>Final conclusion both the new SpiderMan & Batman are going to swipe the floor with this movie so PLEASE stop calling it the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF THE YEAR!"

So many of them¬Ö..will Iron Man hold fort in the ""team""?<br/><br/>Honestly I didn't even care for Evans and Captain America as much as I did for Thor & Iron Man. And I must say with the runtime being 145 minutes, I wondered if it would be a drag.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT<br/><br/>The movie takes time to settle into the plot & setting up the characters, unlike Thor were I felt the movie just rushed through and could have been so much more.<br/><br/>The film IS LARGER THAN LIFE. Unlike Iron Man 2 or Captain America which left me wishing they had done more.<br/><br/>Loki does a great job of portraying the villain. Thor delivers, Black Widow & Hawkeye are manageable. But nothing can compare to the fact that Ruffalo actually fits this version of Hulk way better than Norton could have done. And of course, Iron Man rocks. Rocks like he never did.<br/><br/>By the time you reach the second half, the story has built in enough punch to make you wish there was an epic battle to follow and not a lame effort. And it does deliver. Great action, lot of mayhem, every superhero getting his screen time.<br/><br/>Hulk & Iron Man indeed steal the show.

","For those of you who are looking for more than just action sequences, this is going to be a very long film for you; my advice is: visit the restroom as often as you'd like, don't torture yourself.<br/><br/>Take away the very predictable first 45 minutes of team assembly and the final 45 minutes of predictable one-sided mano-a-mano, there's still 50 minutes in the middle to put together a decent story. But when all is said and done, you'll find it's impossible to describe what the movie was really about. After all, no one ever promised it's a movie about anything.<br/><br/>Worry not though, no one is ever going to ask you about the storyline. Your sole responsibility is to remember the details of the special effects e.g. how the smoke coming out of a broken rotating blade is sucked back into it.

","when i was twelve, i was so excited about the avengers coming together, after seeing ed Norton in the incredible hulk, and then iron man, even captain America 1,( Chris Evans was good in it) i saw it once, and was thinking, THIS IS IT?? I saw it again and thought... WHY?????? the first half has lame jokes, extremely boring fights, and a whole twenty minutes dedicated to Tony fixing a over-sized fan. <br/><br/>The second half is even worse, there's no depth in these characters, once you see that the ""push"" by Nick Fury was fake, and col son is alive, so the avengers come together over a lie. which aggravated me so much. <br/><br/>One of the biggest gripes I have.....WHERE IS ED NORTON???????<br/><br/>i mean Mark Ruffalo was OK, but seeing Edward Norton was the most exciting thing about the avengers, and then he's not even in it. And the hulk looks like Arnold Schwarzanegger overdosing on steroids. <br/><br/>I can't stress enough how much Hawkeye sucks. He was a pawn for half the movie. His character was dull and boring. And then this movie is hailed as the best Marvel movie ever. WHAT!!!????? Iron man. The incredible Hulk. THE GODDAMN SPIDERMAN MOVIES!!!!!!!!! Marvel is just disappointing left and right. <br/><br/>And I love Marvel. the X-men and spider-man movies are the best ones. <br/><br/>And then the second avengers was better, but still lacked a lot of the things the first one was missing. Give Marvel to talented directors. GOSH!!!!!!! Christopher Nolan is already with DC, so why not get TALENT like Brad Bird, Matthew Vaughn, DANNY BOYLE, Neil blomkamp. just UGH NO MORE JOSS WHEDDON!!!!!!!<br/><br/>this movie just sucks"

","Loki is looking to unleash hell down on earth and make people bow at his feet. Nick Fury is forced to assemble the world's greatest superheroes, in hopes of saving everyone. The Avengers must put their egos aside to make everything right again and stop Loki. <br/><br/>I'm hoping to see Age of Ultron later this week. In preparation for it, and to get myself more pumped, I decided to watch The Avengers again for the fourth time. This movie has almost everything you can possibly imagine. Ever wanted to see Thor face off against The Incredible Hulk? How about Thor fighting Iron Man? You'll get that here and more. If you're not fond of some of the superheroes in this movie, there is plenty of others to choose from. It really is a Marvel fan's wet dream. It's one thing to make great action, it's another to combine that great action with near-flawless storytelling. Joss Whedon manages to pull this off. This must have been an incredibly hard script to write! Whedon manages to deal with the pressure to give us a thoughtful script. I loved how the first 30 minutes or so focuses on introducing each character. I thought it was really neat how they delved into what everybody was going through at the time. The action scenes may take your breath away. I'm what you call an adrenaline junkie. I've seen tons of action movies, but there aren't many that make my jaw drop like this one. The last 40 minutes or so are filled with mind blowing action. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe. The performances are excellent. These superheros may have incredible abilities, but they have flaws. The character development was superb. Robert Downey is awesome as Iron Man. His obnoxious behavior tests my patience, but he is perfect for Iron Man. Captain America isn't my favorite by any means. Chris Evans is great at playing him though. He even manages to make him somewhat likable! Chris Hemsworth is tremendous as Thor. Mark Ruffalo isn't the best Hulk, but he does a really good job nonetheless. Scarlett Johansson was my favorite! She has a lot of depth to her character. Her checkered past, and reluctance to be a heroine made her character all the more interesting. She also has some great fight scenes. Wait until you see the stunts when she's tied up in a chair. Tom Hiddleston is amazing as Loki. He is so manipulative, smarmy, and I couldn't stand him. If you hated Loki in Thor, you'll hate him even more here. What a job! Samuel L. Jackson is the epitome of coolness. Jeremy Renner is very good as Hawkeye. I wish they'd have delved into his struggle a bit more, but I won't carp too much. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Skarsgard, Paltrow, all do what they have to do well. <br/><br/>This movie is the closest thing to perfection. I can't see Marvel topping this. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it never fails to blow me away. I'm so pumped for Age of Ultron<br/><br/>10/10"

","The Avengers is a great movie and I think it's because of what they wanted to do with this film in Phase One of Marvel's cinematic universe and this movie pays off quickly.<br/><br/>The action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just top-notch. You already know what the plot is about so I don't have to go over it, but I will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor. The ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this film.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and he does get a lot of screen time. Chris Evans plays Captain America and he does an amazing job, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner were both good as Thor and Hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters. Mark Ruffalo was cool as Bruce Banner / The Hulk and he does motion capture for the Hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero. Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff and she could not done better in this film, but the one person who really was great is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother and he makes a good villain. James Spader is gonna do better as the title character, Ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 Marvel Studios film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", which will be released this Friday on May 1st, 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as Ultron.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson is going to rock as Quicksilver, but I think Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's sister, Elizabeth, is hot as Scarlet Witch and she's gonna do great in that part, but Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is good in the screen time he has in this film, but he only has a cameo or small part in the new Avengers movie, which I will review on Friday May 1st, 2015 and I think it's going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie season.<br/><br/>The visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie, especially The Hulk in this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is fantastic and amazing. I could not believe the music that I heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it. The film's running time feels like it's three hours long, but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long, so the movie moves on very quickly.<br/><br/>Overall, I love THE AVENGERS and I am giving it an 8 / 10. Marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future Marvel movies and it's not like every day that a four-year plan pays off with such praise and hype, but this paid off wonderfully."

","Okay Avengers is good. The dialogue is witty and the action is action. Not a movie so much around telling a story as it is telling jokes. I like that style. But going by the director, Joss Whedon's, quote, ""Make it dark, make it grim, make it tough but for the love of God tell a joke."" Well, you got that last part right. But where's the build up? And I'm not talking about the boring beginning.<br/><br/>I guess I just feel like the characters got to wisecrack each other but they didn't really demonstrate that they ""got"" each other. I feel like I'm missing something. We didn't get that one moment that was serious, something that I feel like Joss said himself was important to the build up.<br/><br/>As I said, I find the beginning to be rather boring. It doesn't grab me with a defining character moment. I don't feel like Avengers is one of the great movies. I don't even feel like it's the best of the series. They did better in The Winter Soldier. They did a better ensemble in Guardians of the Galaxy. It wasn't as passionate as Spider-Man 2. It doesn't compare to the writing of The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>They built up to this film with five other character flicks which, I guess, is the reason why this works. I just feel like something more meaningful could been done. I feel like we could have seen how the characters relate to each other. Guardians of the Galaxy could be accused of having the same problem but I feel like they at least joked about relating. Avengers doesn't do that. Hawkeye is there and he does nothing. Iron Man attempts a sacrifice and we don't feel much. Cap is there and he doesn't offer as much American spirit as he could. Thor has some good remarks. Black Widow is hot and... badass. And if there is something I like about life it's a badass hot female.<br/><br/>What I'm doing at the end of the day is nitpicking. I mean what I say about this film but it is fun. It is a good comedy. Don't let a couple flaws distract from this. I actually feel like in some ways this film was a build up. We have them all together and they know each other so perhaps they can accomplish more in The Age of Ultron."
"Marco_AGJ","3","3","8","9 February 2015"," The Avengers
","I'm not exactly sure I get the hype, but this movie felt pretty sub- par. I'm not an extremist that think films should have a cult format, I do enjoy big production, though blockbusters have seen better days. They basically put together some comic book heroes of some sort and tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for having them all participate in the newest world/New York saving.<br/><br/>Not a good idea, the rushed pace to make every character fit the length is easily noticed. I'm no super-here expert‚Äîquite the opposite ‚Äîbut I'm pretty sure Scarlett Johansson's past doesn't involve two parents made of stone, so I'd argue her acting is not at its finest.<br/><br/>Not that the script helps. Hollywood makes amazing stuff but its stigma of being shallow, focused on silliness can be entirely summarized in this particular movie. The cheesy lines aiming for climatic humor, the grand scale explosions, lots of known names in the cast. Nothing really stand out because nothing has sufficient time to shine, everything feels cramped.<br/><br/>Destruction on this scale demands a villain with capital V. Loki is never that guy. With the exception of a scene that turned out to be faked with Johansson he never looks threatening. It's hard to tell where everyone came about as well as Loki himself because every few minutes a new super-hero pop up on screen.<br/><br/>The biggest problem in having that many unworldly people together is the fact that everyone comes from different imaginary worlds. Hulk seems to be the top dude on the street while Thor is portrayed as a god. There's also a guy that shoots arrows. Scarlet's character also seems to have a gymnast-like elasticity and a way too harsh personality for having just that. The desperate attempt to make everyone's role slightly equal is absurd.<br/><br/>The effect are top-notch after all. Expected from a blockbuster of this magnitude. This might appeal to hardcore fans of comics but I can't see how anyone would enjoy it beyond that. At being a dumb- action movie it does a pretty awful job."

"estreet-eva","5","3","8","1 December 2014"," Is too many good guys a thing?
","In a late scene Hulk beats the daylight out of the one credible super-villain in the film - Loki - and you realize having a team of superheroes - even one that spends a lot of time bickering - does tend to unbalance the scales of justice to the home team. The superheroes also include an indestructible beast - the aforementioned Hulk - and an immortal god - Thor. Like the old Jerry Seinfeld line about Superman - ""why would he needs the rest of the Superfriends - he's Superman!"" Why do you need, for example, Hawkeye - essentially Katniss Everdeen with piercing blue eyes - or Black Widow whose superpower seems to be looking good in leather? This leaves Robert Downey, Jr.'s Ironman who, by contractual arrangement with the $25M a picture actor gets all the good lines. Two in particular, when he calls out an extra for playing Galaga and refers to Thor as ""Point Break"" are instant film classics. Unfortunately, Whedon, like the rest of us, is slave to RDJ's ego so he's left to give just dull exposition dialog to the boring and largely obsolete Captain America (""there's only one God and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that"") and one-note Samuel L. Jackson (""hey you guys, we need to fight back!""). Having said all that, although a little talky, the film presents expensive-looking prolonged and noisy CGI action sequences which distract, if not entertain. The movie understands its nerdy male audience by lingering on the backsides of the female characters whenever they exit the shot for a meaningful but not creepy length of time (Gweneth Paltrow runs with this trope by only achieving ambulatory movement by strutting at all times). An excellent cast (actor's fees only must have hit the $100M mark) also contributes to a worthwhile outing. In short, this confused story of overwhelming good versus one overcompensating pasty evil younger brother with bad hair staring at for its 2 1/2 hour run time."
"roblesar99","5","3","8","13 July 2014"," The Avengers Assemble ... Only to Disappoint
","Don't get me wrong. I liked ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". ""Iron Man 2"" and ""Thor"" were disappointing in my opinion, but I was still anxiously awaiting ""The Avengers"". Now, after having watched a couple of times, I can soundly say that ""The Avengers"" is a disappointment.<br/><br/>While ""The Avengers"" isn't all bad, it fails in many departments. For starters, Loki is a terrible villain. He never felt like a threat and neither did the Chitauri Army which appears in the film's final act without explanation. There is lack of suspense and the film suffers as a result.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the plot is also contrived and clich√©d. The death of Agent Coulson kind of fails to evoke any emotion as he isn't fully developed as a character. For some strange reason, Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner can now control his powers for the sake of the story. The main heroes fight among themselves before finally realizing that they're all being selfish. The story here is nothing more than the good guys versus the bad guys, something that has been seen countless times before.<br/><br/>The performances, meanwhile, are passable, but not commendable. Robert Downey, Jr. has the pleasure of saying some of the film's best lines, but at times, it feels like the movie revolves around him. Mark Ruffalo does an okay job as Bruce Banner, but I dare say that I would've preferred Edward Norton. Meanwhile, the two Chrises do the best with what their given, compared to Scarlett Johansson (who merely serves as eye candy) and Jeremy Renner (who is largely forgotten as Hawkeye.)<br/><br/>The movie ends with the same action-packed explosion-fest that has ended so many past Hollywood blockbusters. Yet, despite the caliber of the people involved with ""The Avengers"", the finale feels like something out of the ""Transformers"" movies, which isn't really a comparison to be proud of.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Avengers"" is a disappointing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although it offers some witty dialogue every now and then, along with the occasionally exciting action sequence, it is bogged down by clich√©d storytelling and a remarkably weak villain. Considering this film cost $225 million, it could've been much better.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.<br/><br/>I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.<br/><br/>My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed."
"martynumnums","9","3","8","4 December 2012"," Adrenaline pumped thrill ride that delivers near perfection
","I did not envy the mammoth task that Joss Whedon had in front of him. Some seriously good characters had been developed in some very impressive comic book films already, so he had to tread very carefully in order to not destroy what had been carefully created. He then had to bring them all together into one film and make sure that they 'all' had a purpose and that one did not outshine the other.<br/><br/>So did it work? Well the answer is YES, beyond anything we could have expected too.<br/><br/>Okay the plot is not original in anyway and it was fairly predictable but I wasn't going to see The Usual Suspects, after all what do comic characters do? They fight bad guys and save the world and that is exactly what we get. What really surprised me, is how some of the characters that only had minor roles in the previous films rose to the occasion and held their own, The Black Widow and Hawkeye really played their part which, before I had seen it, I was sceptical about. Captain America never really over impressed me in his own outing, he was good but that's it, in this he shone through becoming a vital leadership role, coordinating the Avengers throughout the end battle. Thor did his bit, probably the only character that didn't bring us anything special. Loki was outstanding, clever, funny and likable, something that Bruce Banner amusingly points out. Of coarse Iron Man steels the show, did we expect anything less from Downey Jnr, however a close match was The Hulk, who delivers some of the best moments in the film.<br/><br/>The end battle is everything you expect it to be and if you are seeing it in 3D you are in for a real treat. The humour is absolutely spot on. What Whedon does best with all of the characters, no matter what world they are from, they are very human in nature which I think is the biggest key to the success of the Marvel comic book films, everyone has a sense of humour and through major life threatening situations they still keep it. Nobody is too serious.<br/><br/>There are a few people that feel they have to go against the norm and put a film like this down, maybe they feel that by becoming a Simon Cowell and are very hard to please that makes them feel powerful and respected but the truth is that it is very sad that people behave like this. The bottom line is that all films are really supposed to be is entertainment, if you want to cry you go see The Green Mile, if you want to laugh you go see American Pie, if you want gore you see Hostel and if you want to see blockbuster action you go see Avengers Assemble.<br/><br/>A film should be taken for what it is and if you go see this film for Oscar winning performances and clever plot twists then I'm afraid you will be extremely disappointed and quite frankly you should keep your opinions to yourselves. People are relying more and more on reviews to decide whether they should bother to go and see something and a good film reviewer should be flexible enough to see through the eyes of the audience it is aiming for.<br/><br/>Ignore the bad reviews, if it's big scale action with vibrant characters and great humour you are after then you cannot miss this gem, the last time I was buzzing like this after a film was when I saw Jurassic Park on the big screen for the first time when I was 13 years old. Bring on the sequel!"
"baileesoftball2","8","3","8","12 November 2012"," The Avengers
","Marvel's The Avengers is a 2012 American superhero film produced by Marvel Studios. The beginning of the movie focuses on the re-building of the Avengers team. In The Avengers, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from overpowering Earth. Loki, with his long and flowing hair, had teamed up with the alien race. Together they tried to steal the Tesseract, which, in turn, could destroy the world. Captain America was the first to be introduced. He started in World War II and was awoken in 2011.He was the first member of the Avengers team. Each member of the team had a unique characteristic. The Hulk had enormous strength, Captain America in bravery, Iron Man's had ability to fly, Thor's unbearable hammer, Black Widow in sexiness, and Hawkeye's unbeatable arrows. The biggest challenge happened in the beginning of the movie, when the Avengers had to face each other. The argument of how to approach Loki turned the members away from each other. Whedon, the director, forced his heroes against one another to get them to bond. This movie was mainly classified as action and adventure.<br/><br/>The Hulk played a huge role in the making of this film. Having lived his life previously to fighting and not having the ability to control his body, he moved to India. With the thought that he would be able to live a ""normal"" life, Bruce Banner was happy with his decision. Unfortunately, the Avengers needed him to become the Hulk again. Now not only does he have to deal with his anger management problem, but also with depression and self-hatred. Overall, the movie was well put together. Between the graphics and the 3-D realization, one would feel to play a part in this movie. Although the 220 million dollar film had a plot line that will leave viewers breathless, it could also be confusing to others. Since it is a continuation, some people who haven't seen the previous five movies or know the storyline of the Avengers could get lost. However, Whedon does an excellent job at trying to catch new viewers up. Will the Avengers recover from lost time and defeat Loki, or will the Earth be destroyed? From the comic books to live film, The Avengers is an excellent movie for all ages."

This movie meant a ton to me, and I was hoping it would be great. And as I pressed play, and the villain, Loki, appeared, I knew I was in for an event.<br/><br/>The Avengers exceeded my expectations by far, cementing it as one of my favourite movies of all time instantly. You could say that I'm shallow - that the Avengers is nothing more than a CG extravaganza that pales against the likes of the Dark Knight. But you're wrong.<br/><br/>The Avengers has a heart that other superhero movies, or, even, other movies don't. It's funnier than most comedies I've seen. It succeeds in not taking itself so deathly seriously that it loses what makes a superhero movie a superhero movie - it relishes the implausibility of what's happening. At the same time, however, it's technically fantastic. It's well-acted. The characters are well-fleshed out, likable, and receive a lot of development, and Joss Whedon expertly juggles every single hero Marvel threw at him. Everyone feels like they belong on the team, even Black Widow - who I was worried was going to be 'the female character', ended up being a standout in the movie. The dialogue is fantastic, and I was very impressed with the pace.

I began to watch the film, in an almost empty cinema and found myself bored. I laughed at parts that were not meant to be laughed at and the supposed comedy just left me confused. I made a decision, and walked out of the film half way through. Unsure as to whether the huge hype had just made the film a complete let-down, I decided to give it another chance when it was released on DVD. I realised where the film had gone wrong. As a Marvel fan, I knew the back story, the characters and previous movie plots. However the Avengers failed to explain any of this. No character development what so ever, and although I was aware of the story, I found myself having to wrack my brain to remember things from the comics. The film is just another generic superhero movie. Nothing new, nothing special.

I was never a superhero fan, but The Avengers blew me away, with Black Widows kick- butt moves, Tonys constant sarcasm, and <br/><br/>-Spoiler alert, if you haven't seen the movie, don't go on- <br/><br/>Thor and Captain America little battle over who understands 21st century phrases, it's entirely amazing! If you take all that away, you still have the plot line and action! Honestly, if you haven't, I really recommend you to see this movie when it comes out.

","This was a highly anticipated title for me and may be for everyone else as well. But when I actually saw this Movie, I don't think this movie deserves this type of rating. Its so much over rated.<br/><br/>I don't mean this move is bad, the movie is good but so over rated and you will only find kid's stuff in there. I think this one is really made for little kids. Don't watch this movie expecting something like Iron Man 2 or Thor. It is not very well written and the plot is not very strong, not a serious movie. I think having this type of budged and all the great actors is such a waste. And I believe only the kids have rated it so high.<br/><br/>If you want to enjoy this movie then do not expect anything like iron man or Thor, you will be disappointed if you will have those expectations.<br/><br/>The major issue with this movie is its script and weak plot, the antagonist is incredibly cheap and stupid as well. They could have used some better ideas. Although there are a lot of special effects and a lot of actions which is good. But it just do not fits it to an 8+ it is an average movie which deserves something 6/10. So don't believe the hype.<br/><br/>Thank you, Khurram Saeed."
"drakonlorek","Null","3","8","22 August 2012"," Good, but why is Cobie Smulders in this?
","One of the best super hero movies I have seen, but it is only that. It isn't supposed to have any deeper meaning or advanced plot. This is a movie mainly for comic fans. I'm not much of a comic reader, but I still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>There was a couple of things I couldn't quite ignore though. I thought the invasion was pretty terrible. The aliens sent in only a couple of worm things that contained a few alien CGI soldiers and bumped into a couple of buildings. It was not exactly an effective way to take earth. The second thing that kind of annoyed me was the aliens. Just to keep it PG-13, there is no gore, and the aliens are nothing but CGI bad guys.<br/><br/>I was worried there wouldn't be enough screen time for each of the super heroes, considering there were so many, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they all had their roles and input. What really annoyed me though, was Cobie Smulders. What an unnecessary character to throw into the movie! She did nothing of importance AT ALL! I don't know if Cobie's character is in the comics, but it's still just annoying to see her on screen. It's just a cheap business trick to have more stars in the movie and of course adding a fine movie to her resume. Every time she was on screen, it just reminded me that the film industry is just a business like everything else.<br/><br/>I'd give it 8.0"
"bosicans","6","3","8","22 August 2012"," Not good, not bad
","This is basically a movie that's here for a purpose. As a viewer you'll certainly have some fun, even though the movie is too long for my taste. It should be 20 min. less in duration, especially at the beginning where all the unnecessary dialog is taking place. Other purpose is for a Hollywood to make a quick buck - you have all the well known characters from their previous movies, that are just here in one place all together. Screenplay is weak, as well as the basic idea and main villain. If you can kill ""those aliens"" with guns and arrows, you don't really need super heroes now do you. And the final and maybe he most important purpose is to make more cash for the upcoming movies that will feature all of these characters individually. Well known Hollywood formula: milk the cash as long as you can."
"tgrock","7","3","8","21 August 2012"," Inadvertently Hilarious, Entertaining Movie
","It is quite unfortunate that after Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, the Marvel films switched from being serious films to complete jokes. I was expecting ""The Avengers"" to be a really bad film. However, instead of being painful to watch like Iron Man 2, Captain America, and Thor, ""The Avengers"" is really entertaining as a whole.<br/><br/>It is certainly an interesting film. It is sort of like the movie Machete, except much better. It has a B-movie feel to it, but is extremely entertaining. The villain is so clich√©, it is hysterical. Part of what really makes this movie shine is the horrible acting and dialogue by several of the actors and actresses. The three worst actors in the movie are Loki (the villain played by Tom Hiddleston), Nick Fury (played by Samuel Jackson), and Agent Maria Hill (played by Colbie Smulders).<br/><br/>While the idea of watching a movie with horrible dialogue may not be appealing to some, there is another side to the movie that works well in an admirable fashion. And that is the super heroes, particularly Iron Man, The Hulk, and Captain America. These actors really add some emotion and movie star pizazz to the movie in the same way that Liam Neeson did for The Phantom Menace (which is probably the worst movie of all time). <br/><br/>The effects and action scenes are all top notch. Though some of the action scenes with the Black Cat and Hawkeye are a little unconvincing considering they are just normal humans with no super powers or technology.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it is fun to also see Robert Downey Jr. make fun of the campiness and unbelievable other Avengers."
"darthmatthew-442-606491","7","3","8","21 August 2012"," Poor in quality, but it was what it was meant to be
","The Avengers has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year, arguably of the decade. When so many super heroes are in one movie, the fans and nerds will flock; and that's what they did. I would say that it did not disappoint. Mostly. <br/><br/>Looking back on the experience, I have to say that the quality of The Avengers was surprisingly poor. the acting really didn't stand out with the exception of (guess who) Robert Downey Jr, completely overshadowing the rest of the cast. The dialogue, much like the acting was really skimpy. Most of the general conversation felt like it needed more time spent on it, and it seems most of the work went into the multitude of witty jokes that actually ended up working in their favor.<br/><br/>The story, much like the dialogue, felt familiar, and at many times I couldn't help but feel a sense of deja vu in the plot twists and the action scenes. The pacing in the story was also off, and in between the intense and exciting action sequences I felt bored of the cheap, although sometimes hilarious dialogue.<br/><br/>The characters were actually quite shallow. Individual character development was pretty much non-existent, with the movie focusing more on the relationships between the characters, and even that was shallow.<br/><br/>However, all of this aside, The Avengers was actually a good movie. The plain fact is that this movie is absolutely everything that fans wanted, and with that was able to bury most of the problems it had under romping good fun, something that many other movies have tried and failed to do. The Hulk smashed, Iron Man blew stuff up, Captain America bashed the badies, etc. If there was any analogy to describe The Avengers, it would be that it is like UFC. It's kinda cheesy and doesn't take itself too seriously; however when the good guy slams the bad guy, everybody cheers. When Hulk smashed, the crowd erupted. When Loki says some snide comment, there was booing and hissing. The Avengers was not a good FILM, it was merely an exhibition of the superheroes power, and that was exactly what the fans came to see, and I can appreciate that."
"rajrulz40","10","3","8","18 August 2012"," best film until today
","better than the dick(DARK) knight rises. must watch don't miss it superb movie best great awesome funny and action movie u should watch it........<br/><br/>If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre<br/><br/>Must watch it.............."
"Otterman_MK2","8","3","8","10 August 2012"," Utterly flawless, though not quite a classic
","Let me just cut straight to the main point: Joss Whedon has made the impossible work. Not only has he made it work, but work well. Marvel Avengers Assemble is just as good as the hype would have it, though fails to surpass it.<br/><br/>To avoid confusion, this is the same film released in the US which is titled Marvel's The Avengers, but has been re-named in the UK to avoid any confusion with the classic 60's television series The Avengers. Despite its awkward title (I'll refer to it as Avengers), Avengers fulfils its very goal in bringing together the characters of the Marvel cinematic universe and making an incredibly entertaining action movie. The greatest challenge of this film, no doubt, was bringing these characters together and giving them all a fair amount of screen time whilst trying to make their relationships work. Not only does director Joss Whedon do this, but he manages to include a nice level of believable character development and emotion to a film that is first and foremost and action movie. Whilst the action scenes were undoubtedly entertaining, it was in the film's smaller moments, in which the characters share the screen (particularly the chemistry between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner) that make the film such a success. When these characters have their individual movies, they are learning how to deal with their personal problems. In this movie, they are learning how to deal with working together as a team, this being the main purpose of the film. It really is a marvel (sorry!) that Whedon has managed to make this work, let alone being as entertaining as it is. The film packs in humour, emotion and tension without becoming a clustered mess.<br/><br/>The special effects were all impressive, especially on the motion-capture used to create the Hulk, and the Iron Man armour. The final battle did admittedly remind me of Transformers 3, but unlike that film, this never regresses into chaos, and the film feels very in-control of itself and you always know exactly what is going on. The action itself is nothing special, but it's watching these characters work together as a team that is so much fun. The film is a little biased towards Iron Man action, containing more Iron Man than the last two Iron Man movies put together, but fear not, this is a good thing.<br/><br/>Performance wise, all performances were on top form, even from Scarlet Johansen who has vastly improved her 'Black-Widow' character from the wooden acting we saw in Iron Man 2. For me, the stand-out performances were from Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ Hulk. I was initially biased against replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, but can safely say Ruffalo is the best Bruce Banner we have seen to date, and I love the fact that Ruffalo did his own motion-captured performance as Hulk. Tom Hiddleston steals every scene as the villainous Loki, evolving his character from the lost prince of Asgard we saw in Thor, into an utterly unstoppable and menacing force of hatred.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, just making a film 'work well' doesn't raise it to instant 'classic' status, but what is really incredible about Avengers is how utterly flawless it is. There's nothing particularly special about the film, but it's just fantastic watching these characters share the same screen. When appreciated for what it is, Avengers is an entertaining ride, not taking itself too seriously whilst focusing on thrills and fun, incorporating emotion and character development into the mix. I look forward to re-watching it."
"MattsMovieWatchingWorld","7","3","8","6 August 2012"," Marvelous action, but average characters in an average superhero movie
","This movie is getting immensely good reviews, universal critical acclaim. I'd hate to be the sore thumb standing out giving the movie an average review, or what sounds below-average compared to all the other reviews, but I was having a hard time enjoying this movie. Part of the problem was an overwhelmingly distracting midnight-premiere audience. I liked it better the second time, a few weeks later when the theater was much less attended, but not a whole lot because of reasons I'll explain next.<br/><br/>Though this is a combination superhero movie, the idea of which I really like, and though it's likable how the interactions between the heroes was important, I wasn't so completely sure the relationships between the heroes was very believable. Sometimes it seemed so, but not really. I expected there to be more time devoted to the heroes getting to know each other, as if they were actually unaware of each other before the start of the movie, but instead they all knew each other pretty well pretty early. It seemed the heroes showed a little less respect to each other than they probably should have. In fact, in several parts, heroes got into fights with each other, which I really don't like seeing in the movies. I would have liked to see Captain America, my personal favorite of the Avengers heroes, in more of a leadership role than what he was given. But would the Captain's shield, forged by mortal Muggles back in the 1940's, really be able to deflect Iron Man's or Loki's power beams (which is maybe just a minor complaint)? Speaking of Loki, he and his brother are back from Thor, and Loki seemed to stand out a little more as a good villain than he did in Thor. But then there is the awkward situation that those characters, as gods or demigods or whatever you call them, contribute to the story. This combination superhero movie makes the point that a team of superheroes can do more than what one superhero could do by himself. But because Loki, a god, was the main bad guy, I spent most of the movie believing that Thor, also a god, would have been the only hero capable of stopping Loki.<br/><br/>I would also have liked to see more of the supporting characters from the pre-Avengers movies show up in this movie. Erik Selvig from Thor and Pepper Potts from Iron Man were good showing up, and it had to have been hard bringing back most or all of the Captain America characters what with them being from the 1940's. But I wish we could have seen Don Cheadle (or Terrence Howard) as Rhodey from the Iron Man movies, William Hurt as General Ross from The Incredible Hulk, Anthony Hopkins as Odin from Thor, or the heroes' girlfriends, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster from Thor, or Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter from Captain America (pictures of Jane and Peggy both appeared briefly, so that was okay). The existing supporting characters were good for the most part, particularly Nick Fury and Phil Coulson (though I don't know how Nick Fury's apparent lack of superpowers puts him in a rightful place to lead S.H.I.E.L.D. or a team of superheroes). But I also have to say it was awkward that Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) and Clint Barton (Hawkeye) were on the Avengers team. Though Romanoff is pretty good at spying and kicking butt, she's not a superhero. I'm sure that some showbiz news story reported back in 2009 or so that Black Widow would be a villain alongside Whiplash in Iron Man 2, but it was a disappointment to me watching Iron Man 2 that she never turned out to be a villain (she's still not a villain in The Avengers). Her name ""Natalie Rushman"" as used in Iron Man 2 seems to be completely fake, and her name ""Black Widow"" was used a couple times in The Avengers, which was infinitely more than the number of times it was used in Iron Man 2. And why is she called ""Black Widow""? She's not African-American, she doesn't have a dead husband (that I know of), and she was never bitten by a radioactive spider. Hawkeye doesn't have any interesting or significant name either, and his superpower is nothing more than notable skill in using a bow and arrow, and though he appeared briefly in Thor, which I didn't notice the first time I watched it, I couldn't tell how his involvement made the movie much more interesting. So describe this movie as being about four superheroes (not five or six or seven), one supervillain, a supervillain's army of evil baddies, and four Muggle supporting heroes. Maybe I'm just not familiar with the comic books these characters are based on, and maybe I'm just overthinking this a little too much.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the action was marvelous, and if I was to judge this movie entirely by its action, it would be the best or almost best action movie ever made. While still sitting in the theater my first time, I was a little bothered by how pessimistic about this I seemed to be, but walking out of the theater I felt a little more optimistic, that I'm sure I'll like this more when I see it more times."

"cosmo_tiger","8","3","8","1 July 2012"," Superhero movies keep getting better & better. They realized good acting & writing are needed. This is worth the hype. I say A-
","""There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could."" After the God Loki finds his way to Earth, steals the powerful Tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him. After years of recruiting Nick Fury's (Jackson) team is ready. This is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but I'll do one anyway. I have to start by saying that I never was a huge comic book movie person. When they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look. Over the years they have been getting better and better and I think the success of the ""Batman"" movies by Christopher Nolan has raised the bar. He has shown that a real story, plot and great acting can make a typical ""popcorn"" movie into a legitimate movie. All the years of honing the genre have led to this. Not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast. Downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that ""Crash"" did. After years of movies like the ""Fantastic 4"" and ""Spiderman"" they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie, but a great movie period. Good acting and writing are needed. Both are on display here. I have said for years that I am not a comic book movie fan...this movie may have changed my mind. Overall, not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movie...period. I give it an A-."

","The Avengers was exactly what I thought it would be: loud, funny, action-filled and FUN. It was a BLAST watching all of the superheroes we've come to know so well fight together and with each other. Hulk vs Thor? YES PLEASE! The Hulk definitely stole the show in an AWESOME way. You probably won't blink once during the action/fight scenes. You wouldn't want to miss anything! All the greatness being said...there just could have been a little bit more to the story. All the fighting and loud noises distract you that there isn't TOO much of a story going on other than ""team-up and save the world from an alien race we don't know much about."" This is where I think I have been spoiled by The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight set the bar for story-telling for superhero movies; it was deep and really touched a nerve. If you cut it, it would bleed. I also wanted Hawkeye, to play a bigger part! ALL of that being said, you get what you expect from watching The Avengers: a REALLY good time where you don't have to think too hard to really appreciate it."

","I wish there were 20 or 30 more of these movies! It's really fun to watch superheros interact, especially when their back stories are so well done via previous movies. Other reviewers are correct saying that these actors are choice to play these characters. My only complaint is that hey - the 'super' villain Loki was never really very threatening. He was always a sort of weakling in Thor, though interesting. In this movie his only trick is tapping a cane against your chest to control your mind, and being a ruthless jerk, I guess. Scary, practically speaking, but it's not an equal match to four or five movies worth of enemies that we already know the good guys can chew through individually. The bad guy aliens came through the hole in the sky at a rate of about 1 every 3 seconds, kind of trickled through. I'd say we didn't even need the Avengers to dispatch those flying motorcycles - the US Air Force could have handled this whole bunch pretty neatly, though NY would have suffered a bit more. So then why were the Avengers necessary? I dunno, it just seems like the big terrible event that had everyone so worried wasn't that bad. I want a really really scary threat, like the new spider man has to defeat, not some whiny loser like Loki."
"JeffersMorningToYou","7","3","8","10 June 2012"," A very solid action/superhero flick, at best
","Now I'm always getting a ton of hate for my opinion on The Avengers, so I'm prepared for many people to disagree with me. To start off, I am a huge Marvel fan, have been since I was young, so I'm not someone going in without a clue.<br/><br/>Avengers is a solid superhero movie, with superb acting from much of the cast (it's fairly unanimous Ruffalo and Downey Jr. stole the show), great visuals, and terrific action choreography. But I still believe it to be overrated, and that is when people jump out at me. I'm not saying it's a bad film, I definitely enjoyed the viewing, especially in theatre. I couldn't really see myself caring to see it again though, not to say I would never; I just don't have a strong urge to. I am still excited for the sequel, there's no doubt about that, it will most likely be more of the same, and enjoyable. <br/><br/>The thing about Avengers, and all of the other Marvel Studios productions (Thor, Captain America, Iron Man series) is that I don't feel they do what Christopher Nolan's Batman series has accomplished - and that is transcend the superhero genre. There is so much emotion and depth to both Batman Begins and even more so The Dark Knight, that Avengers could not even hold a candle to them. I suppose you could argue that would be due to the fact that the source material might be better for the Batman films, but I still feel the overall atmosphere of the Marvel Studios movies are less character development, more poppy in your face action sequences and quirky one liners. Again, that is not to say that is a terrible thing, it just doesn't bring Avengers, or any of the others up past 'good' for me, they do not reach great. Some people argue that the character development is great, and although I will agree that it's much better in The Avengers than any of the other Marvel films - because it had to be - it still doesn't reach compelling to me, just entertaining."

This is a great movie for comic book fans, kids, and anyone who loves some good ol action. I really didn't think this movie would've'e been as good as it was without Iron Man, Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America. So I loved everything about this movie:Acting, action, plot, special effects. The only problem I personally had was just that hulk wasn't in it as much as I wanted. But when he was there it was just epic. Also that the hulk really reminded me of a a gorilla at the end of the movie which i found just funny. But other than that I can ignore the fact that Odin just sent Thor to earth, the Chintari just dying after the mother ship blew up, and the excessive comedic relief. I found it quite strange that the world was in danger of being taken over and all the characters took it so lightly and making jokes. But still this movie was just awesome. 10/10 best movie this year."

","I was quite worried about the early trailers and storyline behind this film, after continuing a story line based on the cube in the movie Captain America first avenger, which was an atrocious movie. I was also worried about the casting of captain America, i was afraid that he would ruin the entire movie for me if he wasn't given good lines and action sequences. But i had faith in Joss Whedon having been a fan of the firefly, i believed if anyone could make the avengers it would be him...........and he did! The movie was a complete both in pleasing the viewers and the an earning millions of dollars profit. Already it has beaten harry potter DH part 2 and Avatar in both opening nights and weekends and box office records. Alright now to the movie itself. The acting was fabulous in most parts, Robert Downey doing showing us once again what a great choice it was to cast him as Ironman, delivering hilarious lies and portraying tony stark brilliantly. Chris Hemsworth, loved him. Not much credit goes to this young star but i think he does Thor brilliantly. Mark Ruffalo was great as the roll of Bruce banner, though i probably prefer Ed Norton, the lines were specifically chosen to fit Mark Ruffalo(Thanks to Joss Whedon). The hulk itself was quite cool, though at parts looked fake was a good CGI impersonation of mark Ruffalo, the hulk was sensational character and hilarious at parts as well. Tom Hiddleston, the villain Loki, was sensational as well. He was a well crafted villain from the start, though i wish at some parts they made more of a confident bad guy who feared nothing rather than a crazy villain at parts. Chris Evans, finally came into the roll of captain America( due to good lines and development of his character. The other characters fitted in there part not overly special though. OK fight scenes, wonderfully crafted and directed. Hulk vs Thor was an epic fight scene which it should have been having the two most powerful marvel characters in a fight against each other. The Thor vs Ironman was very good except that Ironman would not stand a chance against Thor in the comics, However nothing compares to the action sequence at the end, with this epic action scene comes some cool and lines and comedy moments the avengers must defend the city against an alien attack. beautifully directed again and incredible graphics come together to make this awesome fight which was one of the best action sequences iv seen. So don't sit around, get 10 bucks and go down to the cinema and watch this movie and enjoy the action scenes,the wonderful script and comedy."

It is definitely a film to watch this summer!!! <br/><br/>I will not give away any spoilers, but it is a must that you stay after the credits, as is custom in every marvel film.

"ladymidath","10","3","8","26 May 2012"," Best Movie Of The Year
","Okay, what can I say that has not already been said. This movie is brilliant. It has everything. Action, great acting, a fantastic cast, mind blowing effects, humour, suspense, in short...everything. I had seen all the movies leading up to this. Hulk 2 Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor and Captain America. I knew The Avengers were going to be good, but this just blew me away. All the original actors were back in their roles except for Edward Norton, but Mark Ruffalo did a fine job. Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner Tom Hiddleston Clark Gregg Cobie Smulders Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Samuel L. Jackson were all spot on. I loved the interaction between the various characters, the clash of egos, the tension. It was not just put there because the writers thought it would *move the plot along.* It was there because all of these guys have very specific personalities and at times they clashed. Samuel L Jackson was very much in charge, that man is perfect as Nick Fury, it's as if the role was created for him. The exchanges between Captain America and Tony Stark were amusing and at times downright clever. Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr were perfect. None of the actors hit a wrong note but special kudos to Tom Hiddleston. As Loki he made the film what it was. He was the perfect antagonist. That smile of his was enough to chill, yet the scene between him and the Hulk had the entire theatre roar with laughter. I am not going to go into a real description here as many of the reviews already have but I will say this. The Avengers is one of the best comic book movies to date. It ranks up there with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, V For Vendetta and Watchmen. Thank you Joss Whedon for understanding the medium of comic books and having the vision to be able to bring The Avengers to life. I just hope we see more film like this in the future."
"jtm1583-376-890995","9","3","8","21 May 2012"," Everything a super hero movie should be
","I went into the Avengers with ¬†no expectations. I'm not really all that big on the super hero movies, but I don't dislike them either. I have at least seen all the newest Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man, and Hulk movies, being a teenage boy. However, when I heard about the Avengers, I just thought it sounded stupid. Then, when it was released, I kept hearing great things. So I thought, ""maybe"". Then, when some friends invited me to go see it in IMAX, I thought ""Scarlett Johansson on a screen the size of my house? Heck yes!"" So, I was pretty open minded. And it was great.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too many spoilers, so I'll just break it into sections: Acting- 8/10 ¬†¬† ¬† <br/><br/>¬ïRobert Downey Jr. gave a great performance as the narcissistic billionaire, Tony Stark. I thought his lines were very well scripted- some of the best in the movie, and he delivered them well.¬† ¬†¬† ¬†<br/><br/>¬ï Chris Evans did well in his part as the confused Captain America, who is still used to living in the 1940's (you will be slightly confused unless you've seen CA- I watched it afterward and it cleared things up). I do think he was slightly out shined by RDJ, who really stole the show, but they both did a great job playing off of each other to show the tension between them. ¬†¬† ¬†<br/><br/>¬ïIt is a little hard for me to pass judgement on Scarlett Johansson's performance, as I was slightly distracted ¬†(and by slightly I mean very) by her hotness, but I think she did well. ¬†¬† ¬† <br/><br/>¬ïMark Ruffalo did quite well as the tortured Bruce Banner. He managed to create a complex, layered character with what was possibly fewer lines than any of the other super heroes in the movie. (don't quote me on that) ¬†¬† ¬† <br/><br/>¬ïChris Hemsworth did surprisingly well as Thor, also. I watched Thor last night and was very underwhelmed with his performance. It doesn't even compare to the Avengers. ¬†¬† ¬†<br/><br/>¬ïJeremy Renner did OK as Agent Barton, though I felt he tried to play up the ""Bad-A Mercenary guy"" a little too much. ¬†¬† ¬† <br/><br/>¬ïTom Hiddleston did very well as Loki, once again. I was impressed with him in Thor as well (he was just about the only one). He portrayed a bad guy that was, without a doubt, a bad guy, but that maybe was just a little misled and misunderstood as well. He managed to make a lot of little, as his character was one aspect where I felt the writing flopped a little bit. ¬†¬† ¬† ¬ïClark Gregg did fine as Agent Coulson, though his character was ¬†different than in the previous movies. ¬†¬† ¬† <br/><br/>¬ïCobie Smulders was just OK. I think perhaps shes more suited for comedy. ¬†¬† ¬† <br/><br/>¬ïSamuel Jackson did great as Nick Fury, as expected.<br/><br/>Plot- 7/10 It was much better than I expected. Very few plot holes, if any, unlike certain other summer blockbusters (cough cough Transformers). The only thing I was ever really confused about was some of the backstory with Thor and Captain America, since I hadn't yet seen them.¬†<br/><br/>Special Effects- 10/10 Amazing. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>Conclusion- 9/10 Overall, it's everything a super hero movie should be."

"Kevbo1985","9","3","8","17 May 2012"," The Avengers Delivers On All Counts
","With each subtle hint at a future collaborative effort of various Marvel superheroes, it seems now that the entire world's anticipation was growing to an immense level. Now that The Avengers has shattered various box office records and is on pace to top the $1 billion worldwide gross mark, I'm sure anyone bothering to write up a review is doing so simply to state his or her case for how they enjoyed it, not so much to tell others what to expect.<br/><br/>As far as that goes, I was incredibly impressed with The Avengers. My initial expectation of an action-packed, SFX-laced adrenaline rush were met with ease, and nothing less would have been satisfactory for any decent superhero picture. I also expected a movie with a hefty dose of comedic relief, mainly because of Robert Downey's lighthearted take on Iron Man in both of his solo pictures. This also turned out to be true, and added just what the film needed in between extremely heavy scenes of fast-paced, chaotic action.<br/><br/>One of the strong dividing lines throughout recent years has been the casting choices for the various superheroes that have gotten both their own pictures and inclusion in the Avenger initiative. Going all the way back to the newer incarnations of the Hulk, fans were unable to come to any semblance of a conclusion on who would be best for what and why. ""Why Chris Evans as Captain America?"" is a commonly heard question, as is ""Why didn't Edward Norton come back as The Hulk?"". Unfortunately, you cannot please everyone with so many pivotal casting decisions, but I tend to feel that, overall, the characters portrayed in The Avengers are properly matched up to capable actors. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job as the mild-mannered Bruce Banner, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson are easily up to their respective characters Hawkeye and Black Widow. The rest of the team has experience in their roles, from Downey's Iron Man and Evans' Captain America to Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. But, when combined on screen, you cannot tell the ""rookies"" from the veterans.<br/><br/>Simply put, The Avengers is the best Superhero movie you're likely to come across in terms of sheer entertainment. While I personally wouldn't rank it as my favorite (a reservation I still hold for Watchmen), it's without a doubt worth the price of admission and the incredible amount of hype it's received. An incredible feat of film production and merging talents, The Avengers is destined to be remembered as a high-water mark in superhero cinema."

","What can be said about this movie? Not much, only that it is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I personally thought this movie would fail, simply because there are too many people (heroes) to follow along with in one movie. How can the director please every fan, especially if they all have different heroes. I am very happy to say, they pulled it off very well. I have no favorite hero, but I was pleased with how every character was introduced and developed. The action was amazing, the destruction was epic, and the acting was very impressive. With very few flaws here and there, this movie is a perfect 8. I can safely say that this movie exceeded my expectations, and I would recommend it to anyone that is into destructive, realistic, and well acted movies."

","The Avengers. I can't believe how impressed I am by seeing this movie. The first scene in which Nick Fury gets demeaned by Loki was awesome. The 3d content was good but not very good. In other words, the movie was a heck of a goddamn ride. Completely AWESOME! Robert Jr. as Iron Man was at his best. But, for me, the Hulk stole the show. The film was one of the best action-adventures I have ever seen and surprisingly their was a lot of comic content in it too. There is a scene when the Hulk punches Thor in such a comic way that you tears come to your eyes as you laugh. Thor was better in the Avengers than he was in ""THOR"" but Hawk eye and Black Widow too did a heck of a job. To me, the film was an outstanding performance by all of the actors and Loki did his best as the villain. Still, the HULK ruled the movie! Mark Ruffalo at his best. AWESOME!"

At first I don't really like the team up of Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, HULK, Hawkeye, and Black Widow in a squad against the naughty God of Loki. It is very true for a fictional movie to be irrational and illogical in some part of it, but the combination itself seemed weird, especially they came from a very different time and dimensions. Though it was explained very briefly in the movie, I still can't find it successful to convince me with it. I quite excited with the first 60minutes when the team was built up again, with all conflicts and funny stuffs. Thanks to Mr. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) for his sense of humor. Actions were of course, as expected. You could never get enough of it. Though I might afraid you gonna find it somehow too 'easy' somehow, some part of it. My favorite character certainly goes to Miss Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) with her witty techniques of interrogation. The cast was used very wisely. They played a very beautiful role in this movie. Storyline of every superheroes movie wasn't really worth discuss for. Good versus evil, justice win over the bad guy's plan and etc. Two things I like the most are the enough time (141minutes) with no boredom, and when the teammates were scattered all around. But I don't really think when the superhero music played and they assembled with Capt. Steve Rogers took the lead was the climax that we really wanted to watch. Old-fashioned, and too usual. And I believe the ending wasn't that satisfying too. It was very entertaining though. Worth every penny. And I don't know, may be it's still one of the best movie in this year. Should get almost 5. Almost."

To accomplish this momentous task, Marvel brought in Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Serenity) to both co-write and direct this film of sky high expectations.

On top of the wildcard director, the film also has to bring in all of the stars from the past Marvel Cinematic Universe films into one movie without taking away from the other casts members.

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","9","3","8","12 May 2012"," The best comic-book adaptation ever
","This is one of the films me and my friends were dying to see this year (the others are Prometheus, The dark knight returns, The hobbit). When it came to the theater I was completely out of my mind. Finally we bought the tickets and the show was about to start. The idea of making movies about comic-book heroes one by one and then mixing them all in one film is a genius idea (economically and sociologically). Iron man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America were great movies but this was beyond great. This is what a comic book hero film should be. 1) The acting. All of the actors are so comfortable and relaxed that one has the feeling they truly ARE those characters. Most of them are Oscar nominees, some of them Oscar winners. Mark Ruffalo is the best Bruce Banner (hats of to Norton but he was not Banner), and he gives the best dramatic performance in the movie. Robert Downey Jr. is, I believe, no longer acting, he is Tony Stark. Cris Hemsworth, I had the feeling, never really stopped playing Thor and gave the exact same performance as in his own movie. The greatest surprise was Jeremy Renner. He was mind blowing as Hawkeye. He got the very essence of how Stan Lee imagined him. Scarlett Johansson gave a slightly different role that in Iron man 2 (probably because she had a bigger and more important role here) but it worked just fine. The only one that was a little off track was Captain America. A young actor such as Chris Evans just couldn't break through on the screen with all the other strong characters. And of course, the almighty Samuel L. Jackson is the master, the student and the God as Nick Fury. It's really a shame he had so little screen time as he did. 2) The story. An amazing idea of creating a super villain that uses an alien army to conquer Earth is something new, a fresh idea. The fact that it was Loki (another great performance) makes the idea even better (because of the relationship with Thor). The movie is divided in three parts, and the first and third are the best. The problem is the second part of the movie that was a little too long. 144 min. is a bit to long. Everything that was said could have been said in 15 min time less. The end battle is so nerve-breaking that I literally had no more nails to bite off! Quite a long story that concentrated 2/3 of the movie on the heroes themselves is great, because every story that deals with people (heroes or not) is a good one. 3) The music. Alan Silvestry can do a good job, but here he did a little less good. In my opinion some sequences should have had better musical backgrounds. The only sequence that the music fitted perfectly was the very end of the movie. All in all, a MARVELous movie, with magnificent performances, a great story with many layers of emotion, humor, drama and psychology. If you haven't seen any other movie of these heroes you might have a problem understanding who is who, and the relationships between them, but in the end you get it all (and that is a sign of a great script). Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best superhero movie ever made!"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","3","8","11 May 2012"," ""The Avengers"" is worth every penny of the $207 million it has grossed thus far
","Some sad news and some happy news. Sad news: so far, it looks like we can expect an overall sour year for the movies just like 2011 was. Oh, well. Happy news: there will be at least one great film to remember at the end of the year. And next year. And the year after that. ""The Avengers"" is the movie that comic-book fans, as well as the entire world, have been awaiting for a long time. Take me, for example. I'm one of a handful of people from my generation who has never read a comic book. So I know nothing about how this movie, or the films that predated it, follow their source material. I saw this film with a crowd of folks, many of whom undoubtedly were familiar with the comics, and I think I cherished it just as much as they did. It is one tremendously smashing movie; one not to be missed! I need not report that the film brings together the heroes of recent Hollywood extravaganzas. What I do need to report is just how seamlessly and smoothly that transition is. The movie brings together the characters of the ""Iron Man"" movies, ""Captain America: the First Avenger,"" ""Thor,"" and the ""Hulk"" pictures while paying idiosyncratic respect to each of their characteristics and personalities. None overshadows or takes away from the other. Hard to imagine, since it features Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), one of the biggest egotists in recent movie history. Yet he does not steal the show from the mostly personality-free Captain 'America' Rogers (Chris Evans). The same applies to the ""in-between characters"" such as Nick Fury (an eye patch-toting Samuel L. Jackson) who seem to bind these sagas together.<br/><br/>That is the key to this movie's success: the way it brings these characters together and allows them to play off each other's personalities. The casting is also perfect! Robert Downey, Jr. is no stranger to praise from me and he shells in another solid performance without, I must reiterate, taking away attention from his co-stars, which is something he would have done if he were as egotistical as his character. Chris Evans, as Captain America, has more to do than he did in his source picture: a movie I was not too enthralled by. The same applies to Chris Hemsworth as the extra-terrestrial being Thor, who before I thought was just a Triple B: Big Blond Bore. Keeping his equally boring love interest out (except in a brief reference in the middle) was a smart choice on the filmmakers' part. And Scarlett Johansson proves James Agee's theory about casting in the movies: it's about finding the right people, not the biggest talents. Miss Johannson is not the biggest or more versatile talent in the movies today, but she is dead-right for the part of Black Widow.<br/><br/>A testament to the strength of the characters. I will not reveal who, but one beloved figure is bumped off. Now a supposedly important character died in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and my emotional response to that moment was zip, because I did not feel I understood that character as a human being. The death scene in ""The Avengers"" is so strong, and the director gives it just the right amount of time to play out, that it left the entire auditorium silent...after a big gasp of disbelief.<br/><br/>Watching ""The Avengers,"" I was constantly given a sensation that I've always adored: the impulse to sit back, eyes wide, and say ""Wow! That is really cool!"" There are sequences in this picture, most of them action-moments, that are so jaw-droppingly strong and brilliantly executed that they really do make you wonder just how much effort the makers of the movie put into them. It was not all computers; I can tell you that much. Yet there are parts done exclusively with computers that truly are impressive and great to look at. The highlights are giant alien worms which fly over and through New York City in the final sequence. The movie was directed by a promising talent by the name of Joss Whedon and he demonstrates his discipline as a creative artist in the movie's thirty-minute final battle. As some folks in Hollywood (Michael Bay in particular) need to learn, it takes discipline and restraint to make a lengthy battle keep going without losing its edge. Mr. Whedon has both. At the same time, there are laughs in this movie so strong that I found myself still giggling by the time the next scene was up. I am really tempted to give a few examples, but I don't want to spoil them for anybody who has not seen the picture already.<br/><br/>Do I have anything negative to say about ""The Avengers."" Well, both of the epilogue scenes were utterly pointless; I'll admit that. And some of the one-liners placed in the middle of the climax seem out of place, and distracting from the carnage going on around them. Most of my gripes are nitpicks. Key example: the director uses mirrors in several scenes and there was one, regarding Black Widow and some interrogators, where I wished he had toggled in instead of out. I think you can tell I have to get desperate to shell out any complaints.<br/><br/>I know a young woman who has seen this picture a total of three times now. I am really tempted to go and see it a second time myself. ""The Avengers,"" which clocks in at two and a half hours, is entertaining from beginning to end. It also features some truly memorable music by the underrated Alan Silvestri. This is the kind of music where you find yourself humming after the movie's over, not just ignoring during the show. ""The Avengers"" is worth every penny of the $207 million is has earned thus far. I hope it gets more. It is one of the best movie-going experiences I've had in a long while."

While his early efforts to secure the power cube involved hypnotizing S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) into service, Loki finds himself blocked from further mayhem when Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) launches the Avengers Initiative, teaming superheroes and faithful allies to fight a common foe. Making up the squad is Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Despite tensions and secretive motivations dividing the group, the Avengers must learn to work together to thwart Loki's devious plan of global conquest, using combined powers, rage, and intelligence to rise up and defeat their powerful enemy and his relentless army of alien aggressors.<br/><br/>As to be expected when dealing with a multitude of iconic characters, ""The Avengers"" is one stuffed burrito of a motion picture. Not only must an original plot be established to introduce a worthy conflict for the heroes, but most of these figures of justice require an update since their last adventure. This leaves the opening half of the script sprinting forward with Loki's rise to power as he clears a power cube runway for his space overlords, while the rest of the time is devoted to dissecting sensitive superhero headspace, catching up with the likes of the recently thawed Steve Rogers, who's having trouble acclimating to contemporary society. There's Tony Stark too, growing domesticated with assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) while working to perfect a sustainable energy plan using arc technology.<br/><br/>Every major personality receives time in the spotlight, as Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn make a herculean effort to bring together these forces of nature with a clean understanding of trepidation, finding each member of the team greatly unnerved by Loki's scheme. Bruce Banner's journey is especially interesting, with ""The Avengers"" rebooting the good doctor for a third time since 2003. Well played by Ruffalo, Hulk's second banana position is ideal for such a tragic figure, challenging the production to articulate the doubt and turmoil raging within Banner without the need to stretch simplistic internal instability over two hours. Here, the doctor is a troubled man housing a dark impulse, while Hulk is displayed as beast of fury gradually finding an attitude of heroism, with plenty of HULK SMASH! action worked into the viewing experience. A few of his scenes are sure to elicit standing ovations.<br/><br/>It's rather remarkable how well Whedon manages the chaos, establishing a crisp story of alien invasion while massaging conflicts within the group, staging a few hero vs. hero fight scenes that highlight the not-so-friendly competition between these strangers. Thor is particularly troubled in this script, displaying the God of Thunder as a conflicted man, torn between the defense of his adoptive home and his commitment to the safe return of Loki back to Asgard for a proper rehabilitation. It's an emotionally loaded subplot that doesn't exactly get its due, yet remains tangible due to the Hiddleston and Hemsworth's snarling commitment to the toxic reunion. With so much to juggle, including the interests of S.H.I.E.L.D personnel (Cobie Smulders and Clark Gregg co-star), it's a wonder anything gets accomplished in ""The Avengers."" Credit must be paid to Penn and Whedon, who knit a fresh adventure out of dangling plot lines, creating a distinct comic book tone to the effort, with larger-than-life acts of bravery and transport (the good guys take refuge in a flying aircraft carrier) punctuated by distinct superhero charisma radiating from the majority of the cast.<br/><br/>The finale takes to the streets and skyscrapers of New York City (a tired setting for the ultimate showdown), where the Avengers begin to exercise their teamwork abilities to successfully repel the Chitauri invasion. The sequence is enormous, with a few bravura shots providing a sense of scope to the superhero resistance, sold with incredible visual effects -- the Hulk's attack blasts are worth the price of admission alone, joining the fray in a comfortably exaggerated manner. The action is intense and extended, keeping track of the Avengers as they unite and scatter, hitting such thrilling notes of unity, it's easy to forget the film's occasional faults. And true to the Marvel universe, a few seeds are planted for further development in future sequels and personal adventures.<br/><br/>With such a high-flying spirit and big screen heft, it's difficult to imagine anyone walking out of ""The Avengers"" unsatisfied. Whedon and his team have pulled off an impossible task, juggling ego and backstory with flair, introducing the world to a united front of superheroes while most of these characters are still in the midst of their own individual narratives. It's an enormous picture, supplying requisite jolts of courage and contemplation with panache."
"TheArthurFleck","10","3","8","10 May 2012"," Fantastic Assemble of The Great Avengers.. I loved it...
","I think this is the best super hero's movie ever created ever. What if someone breaks this record?? But it will never happen. Was this movie satisfied all super hero lovers?? Oh yeah. When the movie started I was thinking Iron man will get more applause than others. But Hulk got more response than Iron man. Especially climax scene, when Hulk came into the battle field in motorbike. Wow he came just like that. About the story, same old story saving the world from the Destroyers. But the screenplay and dialogs are very casual and especially humors are really good. Movie starts with Loki has joined with enemy of Asgard and planning to acquire the blue cube. Then what, he came to earth and got that cube from Nick Fury (Director of S.H.I.E.L.D). Then as usual Nick Fury wants that cube because it will destroy the earth. So he has to assemble the super heroes, because Loki has the alien's army. Rest of the story we all know. I told about the response from the theater for the Avengers movie. From the six super heroes (Iron man- Robert Downey Jr, HULK- Mark Ruffalo, CA- Chris Evans, Thor- Chirs Hemsworth, Black Widow- Scarlett Johansson, Hawkeye- Jeremy Renner, Loki- Tom Hiddleston and Nick Fury- Samuel L Jackson) initially Ironman got the number fans but the end of the film some of them were changed to HULK not me ÔÅä. I like Hulk too. Apart from the avengers I like Loki. He got a great style.<br/><br/>I think all credits should goes to Stan Lee (Creator of the Avnegers) and Joss Whedon (for the making of the Avengers). Finally- 10/10.i mean it. Every super hero lovers and non lovers should see the film."
"byrann_gowan","9","3","8","10 May 2012"," I have one piece of advice for reviewers:
","GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! Like, right now. Just drop everything, and go see this movie!!! It is 100% worth it.<br/><br/>When Loki, the god of mischief who we saw in ""Thor,""played by Tom Hiddleston, threatens the safety of the world, SHIELD director Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, brings together a team of superheroes, most of which come from the last few Marvel superheroes movies: Iron Man, played brilliantly once again by Robert Downey Jr., Captain America, played by Chris Evans, The Incredible Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo (taking over for Edward Norton), Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, Black Widow, played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, and Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner. Together, they must stop Loki from initiating his plan.<br/><br/>Let me just say this as my starting point for the review: A movie about a team of superheroes is always risky to make, the risk being that perhaps one of the superheroes will get the short end of the stick. Well, I can easily say that each one of the Avengers get their own scenes, their own stories, and their own moments. In other words, thank God for Joss Whedon and his team for coming up with a script in which everyone plays a good part of the story in some way.<br/><br/>Now the actors: Each one of them does a very good job in their role. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, is very good as Nick Fury. Tom Hiddleston really knows how to deliver the bad guy character, especially when it comes to the Norse god of mischief. Jeremy Renner is great as Hawkeye, as is Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow. You can tell that there is something between the two characters. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and Mark Ruffalo proves that he is one of the better actors when portraying Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Chris Evans is great as Captain America, and of course, like I said, Robert Downey Jr brilliantly plays the Iron Man character well. Just seeing someone so noble like Captain America argue with someone really arrogant and cocky like Iron Man is always a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>As for the action sequences and the special effects: do I really even need to comment on this part? This is the reason why you are seeing this movie (or at least the main reason). You want to see these guys battle it out in awesome battle sequences, which they do. The 3d, believe it or not, is actually pretty good in those sequences, specifically when something blows up and debris is flying everywhere and when Hawkeye's arrows go toward the screen.<br/><br/>All in all, a really great movie. Joss Whedon, we trusted you and you did not let us down, buddy. If you want, I'll get you a beer and we can talk about the sequel (speaking of which, stay after the credits). The Avengers lives up to the excitement, with a script that never loses the heroes compassion, and with great action sequences. A 10/10 for me."
"kunalkhandwala","9","3","8","9 May 2012"," The ultimate super-hero movie
","It all led to this. Back story after back story of super heroes that included a billionaire- playboy-genius-arms merchant who invented a powered suit, a physicist whose accidental exposure to gamma radiation created a monster, a Norse God of Thunder who landed upon Earth and a patriotic soldier who froze through a generation after fighting a World War. These Marvel characters were approached by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D in post credit scenes to join him in an initiative that would form a team of superheroes who would protect the Earth from its nemesis. Director Joss Whedon manages to Assemble this team of distinct, combative and snappy heroes who pounce upon the opportunity to take each other down. So far, undermining the threat from Asgard.....<br/><br/>Essentially, as a sequel to 'Thor', The 'Avengers' revolves around the Tesseract, a cosmic cube that opens up portals and possesses unlimited energy. Evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) arrives through the portal and steals the cube from S.H.I.E.L.D's headquarters, leaving trails of destruction and havoc. In a desperate attempt, Fury summons the Superheroes to save the day from Loki's malicious plans of dominance. It is then upon the film's most spectacular visual effect, (S.H.I.E.L.D's Aerial Aircraft carrier Base) where the Avengers Assemble. Within its confines is Loki's looming threat of destruction with an alien army, Doctor Banner's anger-management issue and the ever-confrontational Superheroes who yet have to come to terms with sharing a room and an objective. No sooner had they settled their issues, does the Alien army arrive through the portal opened by Loki over the Manhattan skies. The Avengers will need leadership, team-work and relentless power to overcome their countless enemies and hereon begins the absolute Mayhem that one would expect from such an assembly of heroes. <br/><br/>Reminiscent of the carnage of cities as seen in the 'Transformers' movies, Manhattan gets bombed, shot, smashed and almost nuked in the climax battle. But what makes Whedon's destruction unique is that it has our superheroes having fun while doing it. Stark's humor and Hulk's raw awesomeness will overpower the usual exploding and flying. <br/><br/>Captain America's disciplined, mature understanding also makes him an efficient leader. Chris Evans provides the composure to the Avengers' leader and while his gun-fist-shield defense is mediocre in comparison to the likes of his contemporaries, he does well in his stunts and brings credibility to his powers. Black Widow is played by the stunning Scarlett Johansson whose stealthy moves as a gymnast and effective use of martial arts give her a deceiving advantage. Hawkeye spends half his time on screen on Loki's side after he was hypnotized in the beginning. In the climactic battle, Jeremy Renner looks better when he is a part of the team and his Hawk-like precision with arrows is fun to watch in the midst of bigger powers. Chris Hemsworth was impressive as the Norse God of Thunder and he returns to correct his evil brother Loki. His confrontations with Ironman and The Hulk provide enormous entertainment while his place in the team with the inseparable Mjolinor is vital when combating the immortal villains. Mark Ruffalo proves to be an edgy, anxious yet intellectual Doctor Banner whose angry side is the film's most enjoyable action star. The Hulk smashes his way through his team-mates, through buildings, aliens, their transports and in what was perhaps the best scene of the film, through Loki's condescending remarks. Robert Downey Jr. makes a mega action movie fun to watch.<br/><br/>It's not that Ironman's screen time dominated The Avengers but if you've just had a hearty laugh, it was because Tony Stark said something. Beyond the entertainment value, Ironman delivers the awesomeness with his suit's super-cool evolution. The most striking feature too, is that Stark embraces the idea of the Avengers Initiative and understands the power their combined forces possess. Even with his ego, he values team-work to execute any plan. With such a mighty force to defend the planet, the villain had to be more powerful, cunning and deceiving in order to make the movie work. Tom Hiddleston does just that as Loki. With the malicious smile and unsympathetic attitude towards humans, he makes a villain we want to hate. Even though his staff is a separable weapon, it is his immortality that makes him formidable. Loki had to be ambitious, conniving and audacious to overcome the Earth in presence of the Avengers and Hiddleston adds that credibility to the Asgardian. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon takes his time in bringing the characters and plot together before heading into a full-blown battle. His other big achievement is balancing the screen times for each of the characters. Because of that, we realize that we are watching the Avengers and not just another superhero movie. Action and entertainment are abundant especially when these superheroes are confronting each other. Just as he builds up the tension, he introduces a character in heroic fashion thus giving us those cheering moments.<br/><br/>Certainly there are aspects that can see improvisation in future but for all the build-up, effort, time and big-budget that went into making the ultimate Super-Hero movie, The Avengers was well worth the wait and it smashes the hype in true Hulk style. No matter what format you watch it in, there's just a lot going on to notice technical details so be prepared for repeat viewing. One can't help but admire the initiative taken by Marvel a few years ago. With one idea of the Avengers, they created a gargantuan ecosystem in movies that will garner Billions of dollars for decades to come. Each of the super-heroes will have sequels and The Avengers of course, will return to save mankind from foes too powerful for our measly human forces. If that's a lot of sci-fi fantasy, we will gladly take all of it.<br/><br/>9.18 on a scale of 1-10."
"tyhumphrey","8","3","8","9 May 2012"," Joss Whedon is magic!
","Absolutely fantastic as far as Marvel movies come. While I was not able to sit through Captain America, Thor, or the Incredible Hulk standalone, this was a great tie in for all of them. Joss Whedon pulled this off with stunning visuals, not unlike Ironman 1 & 2.<br/><br/>The good stuff being said, I could not help but feel like comparing it to the Transformers movies during the final action sequences. I'm not sure why, but it somewhat felt like a close attempt to a Michael Bay style action flick. <br/><br/>In the end its better than the other Marvel movies (with the exception being iron man) by a long shot, and as long as you can keep Dark of the Moon out of your mind through it you should be able to find a lot of fun with it."
"malaysian1789","9","3","8","9 May 2012"," Avenging Time!!!
","As a major Marvel comic book fan in my younger and more glamorous days, I am by no means exaggerating when i say i have been waiting for an Avengers film to be made for the last 15 or so years, at times the concept of having so many Superheroes contained in one film seemed an impossible challenge, but Joss Whedon (who also made Serenity, a fantastic sci-fi film if you haven't already seen it) has attempted the challenge and succeeded. With great results.<br/><br/>Focusing on a plan by Loki (younger brother of Thor) to destroy the world, we see Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury finally put together his ''Avengers Initiative'' plan that has been referenced over the last few years throughout Marvel films (usually after the credits, forcing people like myself to sit in the cinema for 10 minutes after everyone has gone and look like a complete weirdo to Cinema Staff waiting to clean the screen). We thus see a crew of erratic and potentially volatile characters (Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America and ''Hawkeye'' doing his best Legolas impression) reluctantly join each other for this major operation and what ensues is both action and hilarity, and then more hilarity.<br/><br/>Yes, whilst being an ''action'' film, Avengers contains more slapstick humour and one-liners than the majority of comedies made in the last decade, notably from Robert Downey JR as Tony Stark, who just seems like a naturally funny guy in real life. The action set-pieces are great and don't drag on for too long *cough Transformers cough*, whilst the flurry of different personalities at disposal in the film means that there is enough variation to make the 143mins zoom by. Personally, The Hulk stole the show for me, a surprise considering the last two films about his character were so poor. The majority of people watching the film will know what to expect, so i'll keep this review short, but to sum up, great film, does what it says on the tin.<br/><br/>9/10"

"zfanni","8","3","8","8 May 2012"," Pure Sophistry's Avengers Review
","By the time this review is up, most of us have already seen this movie¬Ötwice. The Avengers hulk-smashed all box-office records and will undoubtedly become one of the most successful movies of all time ‚Äì and it should. The Avengers successfully brings together separate Marvel heroes (and their franchises) by refusing to be overburdened with their separate backgrounds and character arcs. The main plot concerns Thor's divine brother Loki, who was defeated in Thor and is now in the service of some alien priest-thing (known as the Other) who promises Loki an army of unbeatable alien warriors with which he can become ruler of Earth. In exchange, Loki must give him the Tesseract, a cube which is an endless source of energy. Simple end-of-the-world type stuff, right? The movie has an infectious enthusiasm about its opportunity to put so many heroes in one film, and this makes seeing each character in action fun in a giddy, comic-book geek kind of way. Who needs to see Captain America cry over lost love when we can have the Hulk pummel a god of Asgard through five different layers of concrete! What are these aliens and why are they here? Who cares! They all just get their heads blown off by a thousand Stark Industries rockets fired from Iron Man's shoulders, so stop asking critical questions!<br/><br/>Hawkeye and Black Widow: These two members of the Avengers team are by far the least compelling ‚Äì they don't even have their own movies (or review paragraphs)! Hawkeye is a super-assassin with a quiver that can arm his arrows in innumerable ways (to act as explosives, grappling lines, etc.), and Black Widow (who was in Iron Man 2) is a Russian super-agent who apparently knows every martial art and thinks the best weapon to use against an alien horde is two small pistols. These characters are the movie's weakest point, as they both make references to past missions they shared together and troubled histories, but since their backgrounds are given no context these references leave us wondering what the hell they're talking about. The Avengers' aversion to the other heroes' emotionally-contrived backstories in favor of fist fights and sardonicism is abandoned here as it attempts to bring dramatic depth to the two Avengers members we care about the least. Let's get back to the heroes with actual powers! No one cares about your 'ledger,' Scarlett Johansson! <br/><br/>Iron Man: How would a movie be able to poke fun at Captain America, Thor or the Hulk without Tony Stark? Whenever The Avengers threatens to get serious and dramatic with its characters or scenes, the man in the iron suit is there to save the audience from tedium with sarcastic wit. And while Iron Man's sarcasm gets overextended at times (yes, we are aware that Tony Stark is irreverent!), Robert Downey Jr. always shows an underlying seriousness about the Avengers' tasks that brings some actual poignancy to his sacrifices later in the movie. Along with the Hulk, Iron Man is one of the more complex and developed heroes that is shown to be more human than comic-book caricature. Having a robotic suit as a power also balances the more biological (or divine) powers of Iron Man's teammates, as we get to witness super-tech fighting along with super-strength. How can we not love Iron Man? <br/><br/>The Hulk: Surprisingly (at least to me), Mark Ruffalo's Hulk becomes perhaps the best hero of The Avengers. Instead of being obsessed with Bruce Banner's childhood traumas and anger issues so that we empathize with a ""green rage monster,"" The Avengers presents a Banner that is much more focused in the present: he wants to help those in need and wants to avoid turning into ""the other guy."" Why? Well¬Öbecause then people get hurt. This also allows Mark Ruffalo to create a more interesting Banner that is concerned with something other than avoiding the Hulk alter ego and an American military interested in his power. Bruce Banner initially arrives as a member of the Avengers for his knowledge about gamma radiation and his ability to tract the Tesseract cube, not for his ability to hulk-out. Ruffalo brings a quiet, sarcastic apathy to the team (and also plays the Hulk through motion capture), which makes us connect with Banner before we see the Hulk ‚Äì who, thanks to Johansson, we sometimes fear and even wish to not appear. Banner's condition is initially presented as something the team must avoid triggering, which means that when he arrives in full control of his power (which isn't really explained), we actually move from fearing the Hulk to rooting for him. Banner's ambiguity extends to how we feel about his alter-ego, which means that this is (finally) the Hulk done properly. So it isn't surprising that some of The Avengers' more humorous and kick-ass moments come from Ruffalo's 'other guy.' From the moment that Hulk is told to ""smash,"" we watch him tear apart an alien army and everyone (including the audience) breathes a little easier knowing that he's on our side. I'm actually hoping that Ruffalo gets his own Hulk movie franchise.<br/><br/>Oh, and we of course have Samuel L. Jackson as the Avengers' coordinator Nick Fury, who reports to a nameless human 'council' that wants him blowing up New York to prevent an alien invasion instead of depending upon a superhero team. Plot device, anyone? Jackson is fine in the role, and like every other character in The Avengers, fits in his proper place to produce a coherent and entertaining blockbuster."
"alsumrall2001","8","3","8","8 May 2012"," Best Written Film of this Genre Ever?
","It is appropriate that this film was better than the sum of the films that preceded it. It is very close to be the best written film of it's genre and it ought to be in the Oscar running for best screenplay. Just a few redundancies from other films kept this film from becoming great and those redundancies may have been mandatory as this type of film has to be slaved to a legacy of comic history. It was the first film of it's type, at least to my knowledge, that generated appropriate spontaneous uproarious laughter/cheers from the audience from brilliantly surprising scenes. And you won't see them coming, they will just happen. The acting is uniformly excellent throughout. A highly recommended film."
"Wuchakk","8","3","8","8 May 2012"," The Hulk steals the show!
","Hyped as the greatest superhero film ever made, 2012's ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining superhero team flick. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), introduced in 2011's ""Thor,"" comes to earth intent on an otherworldly invasion and total conquest. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of the Federal agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers together ""earth's mightiest heroes"" to prevent the invasion ‚Äì Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Black Widow, Hawkeye and, believe it or not, the Hulk.<br/><br/>The film's hype and record-breaking success raises expectations that are letdown by a set-up that goes on & on and isn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time is spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which creates a somewhat one-dimensional vibe. Lastly, although Loki is an excellent villain, the otherworldly army known as the Chitauri are stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who are way too-easily slaughtered, excepting the colossal mechanical snake-creatures.<br/><br/>Despite those few negatives, there are numerous highlights: Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow; straight-laced and Old-fashioned Captain America at odds with the overly-hip Tony Stark/Iron Man (Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. respectively); Chris Hemsworth as the noble Thor; Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury; a touching subplot concerning the Black Widow & Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner); and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>Speaking of Bruce Banner, the Hulk easily steals the show. The best scenes and literal punch lines have to do with the Hulk. As much as I like both the '03 and '08 film versions of the green goliath, this is the definitive rendition.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: ""The Avengers"" is definitely an entertaining superhero team flick, but it has its shortcomings. A slow build-up, the one-dimensional setting and a weak army of foes work against the movie, but it's filled with a myriad highlights, including the Hulk and the witty dialog. The third act delivers the goods as a wholly kinetic and engaging superhero team flick.<br/><br/>The film runs 142 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

","As they say in comic books - ""Bam!"" ""Ka-Pow?"" While that's not really what the superheroes of The Avengers have to say (they are much more articulate), their actions are fairly true to their comic book roots. KIDS FIRST! youth film critics Julianna No one and Talia Rashba each give the film a full 5 out of 5 stars, and are quite articulate on their reasons for the top rating.<br/><br/>Talia Rashba http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S78fik503mg<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely fantastic! It is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad. <br/><br/>The story is about a group of famous superheroes that come together to defeat the evil Loki, who has stolen a powerful energy cube that he intends to use to take over the world. The superheroes include Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Each with a unique and special supernatural power. At first, the superheroes fight about being a team, but, eventually, they work together.<br/><br/>The Avengers could have ended up being a typical superhero movie, but it isn't. Because there are so many heroes, it is much more creative and entertaining. The Avengers is packed with fabulous actors. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man. Just like he was in the Iron Man movie, he thinks he is better than everyone else, but luckily, he is really quite funny so you end up liking him a lot. Captain America (Chris Evans) is strong and serious, and he is always ready to get the job done. Actor Mark Ruffalo plays the ferocious green form known as the Incredible Hulk. He really stands out and takes over the scenes he is in. Superhero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has some of the most incredible battle scenes. And Black Widow, portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, is the one who convinces the others to put aside their differences and work with each other. <br/><br/>An interesting fact is that actor Lou Ferrigno, who has played The Hulk in almost every film since 1978, is actually the Hulk's voice in the movie. <br/><br/>The Avengers is written and directed by Joss Whedon, who does an amazing job. He makes sure that there is a lot of humor in the movie and that the action scenes really grab your attention. The special effects were incredible. The superheroes change from their everyday selves into their supernatural selves in an interesting and fun way. The fight scenes and explosions are unbelievable. Also, there is a really neat headquarters for the agency that you just have to see for yourself! <br/><br/>Even though it is rated PG-13, I think kids ages 11, as well as all adults, will love this movie, especially if action is their thing. I am giving this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommending that you see it right away! <br/><br/>Julianna No one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeT6pETKFaQ<br/><br/>Looking for a hero? Well, look no further, because The Avengers is in theaters everywhere! This action-packed and comedy-filled film is a movie that appeals to comic book fans and all movie-goers with its great storyline and a strong cast/ <br/><br/>The basis of this movie is the world is under threat from another world, Chitauri, and there is a need for more than just all the world's defenses to save it. The world needs the ""Avenger Initiative"", which is a plan put together by S.H.I.E.L.D., an international peace-keeping agency, which calls for S.H.I.E.L.D. to bring together some of the world's greatest heroes: Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. Nick Fury, played by the always intense Samuel L. Jackson, leads the S.H.I.E.L.D. agency. <br/><br/>I have watched all of the individual movie releases of the Hulk, Thor, Captain America and both Iron Man movies and loved them all, but, as most, was concerned whether they would work together to create a great movie. Well, they have done that and more, with a storyline that allows the main characters to, at times, shine on their own but at other times pairs them up perfectly to bring great balance to the story. <br/><br/>Josh Whedon, director and co-writer, and Zach Penn, co-writer, blend the action sequences in with very well-timed comedic moments. I love how they bring so many different levels of conflict into the movie. There is brother vs. brother, between Thor and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the film's antagonist. There is internal conflict each of the main characters has with themselves, as we watch Dr. Banner trying to control his inner demons. And there is the overall conflict of our world vs. the other world, called Chitauri. <br/><br/>There is also the conflict between the heroes themselves, which leads to many of the funniest parts of the film. My favorite scene is when the heroes first come together on the S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft and are discussing the devastation that Loki has brought to Earth. Thor jumps to Loki's defense and states, ""He's my brother,"" to which the Black Widow responds, ""He has killed 80 people in two days."" Thor responds, ""He's adopted!"" It's one of the many laugh-out-loud moments. <br/><br/>My favorite character(s) would be the Avengers as a whole, as they each have their own unique and likable traits. I love the special effects, particularly the touch screen computers that float in the air, and the use of CGI in this film as it was worked into the live-action sequences. The CGI Hulk was especially well done and was much more human-like in this film and funny as well. <br/><br/>This movie is great for all ages and I rate it 5 out of 5 stars. It's a must-see movie for comic book and non-comic book fans."

Ghost Rider/DareDevil/Fantastic4 as the worst. I thought Capt America and Thor was OK as far as their own movies. Throw them all together and... WOW! Things I liked: each hero was showcased in some form or another. IronMan's rocking arrival. The internal conflict among heroes. Things I didn't like: Although Scarlett played her role very well, I do think showcasing Black Widow was a mistake. Those tiny pistols against the army? *ping* *ping* it did look pretty pathetic. Secondly, I realize that Capt America's uniform is original... but he stood out like a bad Halloween costume. Perhaps a VERY dark blue would have been better? Best scene... Hulk and Loki. I've never seen 500 people erupt in cheers and clapping... a few standing ovations as Hulk responded to Loki's rant. I'd likely pay the $13 simply to see that scene again.<br/><br/>I'm curious to read the script. I wonder how much of the film is choreographed in the script. There wasn't a lot of dialogue, but when there was, it was excellent. By far the best pure action movie I've scene that I can remember. Awesome, awesome, awesome!<br/><br/>To those that haven't seen the movie... make sure you watch the credits *wink*"

","I know there were some concerns out there regarding the former creator of Buffy and Angel doing the screenplay and directing, and there were also a few eyebrows raised when Disney took over the Marvel brand. But everyone can relax, because this flag is up the pole, and everyone is saluting.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is especially his arrogant self as Tony Stark, and I loved the scenes where he and Gwyneth Paltrow are acting like a couple. His interactions with Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo set the stage for the internal conflicts with each other and Samuel L. Jackson. The dynamics of the characters could not have been any better.<br/><br/>And speaking of the newest member of the Marvel character crew, hats off to Mark Ruffalo who took a role once played, poorly, by Eric Bana, and somewhat better by Ed Norton, and not only made it his own, but made Bruce Banner come to life in realistic ways. His persona as the more aggressive scientist with self control and determination lends to the idea such a being might be controlled, or at least directed.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston play beautifully off one another, which gives us the impression of the Asgardian egos and the depths to which they extend. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are perfect as the bodyguards n√©e assassins who are as courageous as they are talented. And Clark Gregg reprises his role from Iron Man and Thor to remind us there are always dedicated men who are simply trying to do their job, in spite of extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>The story is fast paced, and wastes little time in exposition, with smidgens of personal lives and assignments interspersed in the film. Overall, the cinematography is exceptional, the graphics are phenomenal, and the entire film has the flow and character of the Comic Books (okay, Graphic Novels) of our misspent youth. I went in expecting an epic, and was not disappointed. Rated PG-13 for violence and a mild reference to drugs, anyone who ever read the stories and those of us who love the prequels (let's face it, folks, Iron Man, Thor, etc. were all prequels to this event) will love this film. I've already reserved a copy for my collection, and you should, too."

This movie holds up to all the standards of good movie-ism(?) and I am extremely excited to see what comes our way in the future from this movie.<br/><br/>(Not sure if the next paragraph counts but ""spoiler here"" just in case)<br/><br/>Thumbs up for all the actors as well who accepted to return!

","I gotta say when I went to the cinema I had high expectations. But this movie went over my expectations. It has a good storyline and I like the idea of putting many known heroes in the same movie. Actually I wonder why no one has done that before in a Hollywood movie recently. It was fun to watch these brilliant characters come together and fight together.<br/><br/>One of the good things about this movie is that it has the humor from Iron man which is excellent. Even though this movie is an action movie with a lot of explosions it has scenes where everyone in the cinema laughed so much you couldn't hear the movie anymore. The action part is also great. It hasn't got too much special effects and every single on of them is accurate. In fact all of the computer work is brilliant. The acting is very good too. All the actors get their characters so well. Robert is so great at acting Tony Stark you could think he isn't acting.<br/><br/>I didn't see any fails or wanted something different and I had a real blast while watching so it deserves nothing less than a 10/10."
"MarcusJ13","9","3","8","8 May 2012"," Everything you could have wanted
","The Avengers was a film with so much hype it was of course difficult to see it really living up to expectations. The film absolutely does and then some, wasting little time with exposition we meet all the characters fairly quickly making for an impressive feat in that the film ran at over two hours. If you have seen at least some of the films starring these characters you will be more than aware of them, but even if you haven't it is not difficult to pick up on the characters that have had their own films. In the case of The Hulk it really doesn't matter. So newcomers are welcome but some familiarity with Thor may be of preference although personally I didn't have it. In terms of the development it seemed as though there was an inevitability that some would get the upper hand. Namely Iron Man, Captain America and Thor with some coming for the Hulk. The likes of Black Widow and Hawkeye having less but still getting enough to get by, even if Black Widow's felt a little like it was produced in short bursts. <br/><br/>Even early in the film I felt like Iron Man was stealing the show, this felt like a strength as egos can become rife in the characters if they are not written properly. Luckily we didn't have to endure poorly written blanket egos on screen. The Hulk was probably the character that stole the show throughout the entire film at least outside of the villain Loki. The Hulk was approached in a humorous manner devoid of complete seriousness from Eric Bana's and semi seriousness from Edward Norton's. The character is played in some way for comedic effect and once the Hulk is on screen he has the largest presence out of all of characters and Mark Ruffalo played it brilliantly knowing exactly what he was there for. Back to Loki, where he worked as a strong villain never quite making for a hammy comic book villain tailored for a family audience or the dark interpretation that has become typically associated with Christopher Nolan's Batman films. In terms of action it was excellent, earlier parts of the film were lacking light at all so it may be worth missing 3D. However the action later in the film worked brilliantly in 3D, especially for a post conversion. For some viewers it may bring back memories of Transformers: Dark of The Moon but at no point was it a cluster of images. The Avengers works as a film not requiring multiple things happening on screen and unlike the Transformers films the action always stayed exciting and left you wanting more. It also utilises humour in a brilliant way using it fairly frequently without reaching gag territory. All in all it is a very fun film and should you not like superhero films (because if you do you don't need me to tell you to see it)then you should just see it as it works as just a fun and sometimes epic summer blockbuster."

"jflores-20","10","3","8","8 May 2012"," A fantastic movie!
","I'm one of those fans that was extremely hyped up about the possibility of an actual ""Avengers"" movie coming to the big screens. However, when production started, I was terrified. It seemed to go by so quick, and I was afraid that giving this huge and potentially epic movie to Whedon could've back fired. I mean I know that he was up and coming, and this his previous work was good, but for something of this magnitude? I was fearful. All I have to say is thank you for giving Whedon the vote of confidence. He absolutely nailed this movie. It was not only a home-run, in my eyes, it was a grand slam. He was able to bring all of these different personalities (on/off screen) and make it work. The story line was solid. The vision for this movie was vast, and Whedon, along with the writers, producers, and FX crew, exceeded expectations. This movie blew me away! It had a great pace to it, and the actors delivered.<br/><br/>My only critique would be, ""Captain America"". To be honest, I was never really sold on Chris Evans. He did a decent job in the solo movie, but I don't know, he's just not Captain America to me. It seemed like he followed orders more than taking control of the team, with the exception of that sequence towards the end. I understand that this is all a build up for another Cap Movie, and ultimately, Avengers 2. I think that it's just Chris Evans. He doesn't demand that ""On-Screen"" presence that you'd figure Captain America to have.<br/><br/>Aside from that, this movie was absolutely excellent. Great story. Awesome acting (especially from the Loki character). Amazing action. Unbelievable FX. And ""they have a Hulk!"" how could you beat that. 9.5 out of 10 in my book. And all's I got to say is, Avatar....watch out. The Avengers are coming for the record books."

","Marvel Studios has finally brought the whole team together, after years of hinting at the Avengers initiative coming to fruition to fight united against evil, they have done it. <br/><br/>The Avengers was not only a reunion of Marvel's best loved superheroes, but it is a fun and funny, action-packed blockbuster movie to kick off the Summer movie season as it opened to an astounding $207.4 million, the single biggest grossing domestic film opening weekend of all time.

"rpscot55","9","3","8","7 May 2012"," Fast Start, Slow Middle, Worth The Wait, Great Film!
","This is a well done comic book superhero film for everyone. Special effects, even in the 2D version are definitely worth the price of the admission ticket. We all thoroughly enjoyed the film. The film does get off to a good start and then it does slow down a bit to construct the plot and the character interaction to make it all work. But, when that is done, the film becomes a roller coater ride of special effects and action that is a treat to watch. Good Humor, Good Plot Build, Good Character Development, and Just Plain Well Done. The only reason we didn't give it a 10 is because we did not see the 3-D version and the slow build in the center (that, by the way is totally necessary) that makes the film worth seeing! Be SURE to see this while it's in the theaters! First film in a while that is worth every penny."
"MBunge","7","3","8","7 May 2012"," Whedon is an amazing assembler
","I went to see this with a few friends and one of them described it probably as well as can be. He called it probably the best comic book adaptation he's ever seen. Of course, what it's adapting is one of those all out action issues so there's not a whole lot of depth and significance to what happens. This is about good energetically punching evil in the nose while Joss Whedon's style of comedy flows in and out like a rapid tide. But while you can't put this on the same narrative level as The Dark Knight or even Batman Begins or Superman II, this is one kick ass thrill ride of a motion picture. It is stuffed to the gills with so much great stuff that Whedon deserves some sort of award just for keeping it all from collapsing in on itself.<br/><br/>Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the Asgardian god of mischief who was lost to the void at the end of the Thor movie, returns here in service to an alien horde. He comes to Earth and steals the tessaract, the glowing blue box from the Captain America movie, and seeks to use it to open a portal that will allow the alien army to invade and conquer the world. To stop him, super-spy Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson. Loki, meanwhile, uses his power to seize control of the minds of Professor Selvig (from the Thor movie) to construct his portal and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to assist him. A whole lot of fighting ensues, particularly on the incredible S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and the streets and skies of New York City, as The Avengers try to defeat Loki and repel the alien threat.<br/><br/>Let me say again, Joss Whedon does a tremendous job hear managing all the moving parts in this script and the production. There's a very large cast of characters and they're all put to some use and there are a whole lot of special effects and action scenes, nearly all of which are spectacular. There's also likely more humor here than in any Marvel super-hero flick to date and while some of it is a bit much in that way Whedon always goes for a laugh just as the tension or drama is kicking into high gear, most of it is simply damn funny.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Robert Downey Jr. and Tony Stark pretty much owns every scene he's in, but Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo prove to be excellent sparring partner for RDJ in their scenes together. Scarlett Johansson is also very effective in a surprisingly large role. Whedon is known for his female characters and he's taken Jonhasson's window dressing role from Iron Man II and remade her into a tough, smart woman who still blanches a bit at being normal amongst geniuses, super-humans and extradimensional gods. I do have to say that large doses of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury turns out to a better idea in theory than in practice, sort of like Mace Windu, but Cobie Smulders does a nice job as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and Clark Gregg is wonderful as Agent Coulson.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good time, I'm not sure there's any way you'll be disappointed by The Avengers. If you are, maybe you need to stop going to see this kind of films. I wasn't that impressed with either the Thor or Captain America movies and felt Iron Man II was burdened with having too much stuff crammed into it. I am impressed with this film, even though it's packed to the brim with even more. It's made me excited about a possible Black Widow movie and hopeful of seeing Ruffalo in yet another Hulk film, as long as Whedon's involved.<br/><br/>Not that you need to hear this from me, but don't miss this."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","3","8","6 May 2012"," Marvel's Version of Justice League
","In the recent decade, Marvel studio's has triumphed over several competing movies with a wide variety heroes or anti-heroes all with different skill sets and abilities. But never has it been decided to make a film that unites the greatest Marvel characters of all time,...until now. It's an interesting concept because ideas this massive can either fail without recompense or it moves beyond the status quo. It's a high risk but with the right balance, things will pull through. As for this movie, the whole execution plays out well but there are still some things that could have been done differently.<br/><br/>Starting off with one of the bad things is that this movie is a super- sequel. It's not like Marvel studios just decided to go with this idea from the blue. This whole movie was built up through the story telling of all the Marvel characters that are at the center of this story. The problem with this is that if a moviegoer is one who doesn't like skipping films and watching sequels out of order, this could be somewhat frustrating. Because then, the viewer will want to know how all the other characters came to be and not focus on what is currently happening in the movie.<br/><br/>Back to the good, all the actors in this movie are phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. still keeps his charm as the smart mouthed but yet intelligent billionaire Tony Stark. Chris Evans is still cool as Captain America. In some ways, he reminds of The Rocketeer (1991) because of his hairstyle and clothing that he wears. It screams out Cliff Secord every time Captain America was on screen. Mark Ruffalo was great as Bruce Banner. Even The Hulk was given some comedic parts in the film, which was great, because it shows he's not all brawn. Chris Hemsworth is also fun to watch, especially when he's whacking his hammer into everything. <br/><br/>I will not say what every other actor does in this film because in the end, it can be seen that every one of them, superhero or non-super hero, gave it their all in this film and it shows. One thing I wished was added in this movie, character wise, were some other anti-hero Marvel characters such as Ghost Rider and The Punisher. I know they don't belong to The Avengers but it would still be fun to see them beating up the baddies too.<br/><br/>As for the action, I'd say that there definitely was plenty of it and it wasn't overdone either which is good too. It truly is a sight to see how The Avengers coordinate their moves on how they take out the villains. And it's not like every scene was the same either. Every character had their own special moment to how they took out soldiers of Loki's army. The one that is the most fun to watch in my opinion is The Hulk just because it is a situation like this where Banner can run amok and tear apart anything he wants at any time. The musical soundtrack was composed by Alan Silvestri, which does not surprise me at all. Silvestri is good at this kind of material and there's nothing else that's needed to be said.<br/><br/>The only other flaw I have to confront with this movie is that the whole concept of allowing an alien race to come and take over the Earth through a time portal, is almost an exact replica to Michael Bay's Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011). Even the flying behemoth gunships that come out of the time portal resemble the Decepticon gunships too closely. Seriously, who hasn't seen this whole plot device before? But what makes this worth seeing is that the heroes in this film are not running from their enemies (cough cough* Sam Witwicky), and screaming like a woos. Again though, these flaws are so minor, no one will really care or probably even make the connection. There really isn't much to not like about this film.<br/><br/>Even though it bares a small resemblance to other major blockbuster films, The Avengers will hold its own as one heck of a comic book ensemble. Altogether, the action, comical dialog, music, and special effects help this movie excel to big heights that no other Marvel franchise has achieved."
"Mafesto","10","3","8","5 May 2012"," This. Is. Entertainment!
","If you were into comic-books/manga as a kid or, like me, still are: You remember that feel you got/get when your favorite character does something, just, incredibly awesome, like knocking the villains block off?<br/><br/>That feeling is what this movie is built upon. Seeing your favorite heroes just doing awesome stuff upon awesome stuff, over and over again. The acting's great, the effects and feel you get when watching the movie in a theater is close to unmatched.<br/><br/>This movie does just about every kick-ass thing, and more. However: this movie is no Watchmen and no Dark Knight, it doesn't establish a dark feeling and it's far from deep storytelling and character-development. It is all about capturing our inner 12-year old fanheart and bringing them to light for a while.<br/><br/>Watch it, enjoy it."
"goughy1908","10","3","8","4 May 2012"," i am very impressed.
","This was an excellent superhero movie. I personally don't believe that the 'rumored' justice league movie of 2013, starring superman, batman, the flash, wonder woman and green lantern, will have an easy time living up to this film. The special effects were great and the 3d was very impressive. I think the hulk was an amazingly animated character and defiantly stole the show with his comedy, action and overall awesomeness. This film is defiantly worth the watch, especially in 3d. I so hope that there will be a sequel, with many more heroes joining the avengers, such as ant-man, black panther, the fantastic 4, spider-man or wolverine."

","Ever since Marvel Studios started turning its properties into films with the release of Iron Man in 2008, The Avengers was always going to be the endgame in one of the most ambitious blockbusters projects in recent times. Fans have been dying to know ‚Äî is it worth the wait? In The Avengers, Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has set his sights on the conquest of Earth and makes an alliance with the alien race called the Chitauri to give him the army he needs. To bring the Chitauri to Earth, however, Loki needs the all-powerful Tesseract (AKA the Comic Cube). Breaking into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, Loki steals the Tesseract, which forces Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to reactivate the Avengers Initiative, uniting Earth's Mightiest Heroes: Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the recently defrosted Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the deadly accurate archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and deadly thighs super spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson). To stop this new threat, they must all use their physical and mental abilities ‚Äî and work together.<br/><br/>By allowing all the major characters their own films, we have presumably gotten to know them, so the film doesn't have to waste time with introductions and can jump straight into the action. In the first 10 minutes, Loki breaks into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility with plenty of gun fire, magic blasts and car chases. Although an early fight scene involving Black Widow was a bit weak, using too many quick cuts and close-ups, the rest of the action ranges from good to fantastic.<br/><br/>There are three big action highlights: a three way fight between our heroes, a battle on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and the climactic Battle of the New York. They are all well-shot, perfectly edited sequences. Even though there is a lot going on, like the Helicarrier sequence in which many of the characters are fighting in different areas, it is still easy to follow thanks to the editing skill. The massive Battle of New York has a very similar feel to the Battle of Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but unlike Bay, Whedon knows the focus needs to be on the superheroes battling alien invaders.<br/><br/>As you fantasised about, the Avengers are finally together and they all have great chemistry. Downey continues to show off his quick wit, but Tony Stark has finally found a intelligential equal in the form of Bruce Banner; both talk enough techno babble to put Star Trek to shame. Downey keeps a reckless side to Stark as he tries to taunt Banner into becoming the Hulk. Stark is distrustful, cocky and unwilling to work with others, but he learns, and when push comes to shove he becomes a team player who shows what a true hero is.<br/><br/>Evans was an excellent Captain America, bringing out all the nobility, resourcefulness and willingness to step into danger that makes the character famous. He stills has his values, and despite being arguably the weakest of the main four, he's willing to stand his ground. When the Battle of New York starts, he shows his leadership skills as he helps civilians to safety. Despite the fact he should be adjusting to the modern world, he answers his call to duty.<br/><br/>Ruffalo offers us the best performance yet as Bruce Banner, making him a stoic and reserved character, not the dower being he has been in the past. Banner is a brilliant scientist who is more agreeing of the Hulk. He offers some darkness as he reveals his past, but it does not linger as he tries to be good. As the Hulk, Ruffalo gets to kick alien butt and provide us with some great action set pieces, and he even provides a lot of comedy through this physical actions and expert comic timing.<br/><br/>Thor does not go through any character growth, but that is because most of it happened in Thor (2011). It is simply a continuation of what happened previously, showing Thor has matured. Hemsworth continues with his grand performance as the Norse God and even has an odd joke.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston continues to show he is a great and compelling villain. Hiddleston keeps Loki's oily charisma and the aura of mystery that his plans and actions are never clear until the last moment. He has a bigger thirst for power and he's more menacing and threatening: he kills a man in front of a group people just for purposes of an eye scan. Hiddleston offers a very theatrical performance and he more than holds his own with Jackson and Downey in his villainous delivery.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon was an inspired choice to write and direct because of his knowledge and love for the source material. He was able to blend together the different elements seamlessly, whether it was sci-fi, technological, fantasy or espionage and makes sure all the previous films were recognized. The characters were balanced, no one is sidelined and everyone has a moment to shine in some form. The dialogue was witty with some keen observations such as Captain America not understanding a modern reference and other instances of humour in their general interactions when the action was not happening.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a very entertaining film that continues Marvel's excellent track record in filmmaking. Despite the long running time, the film is never dull and only people with the biggest aversion to superhero films would dislike Marvel's latest adventure. This film has set the bar very high for this year's blockbuster season.<br/><br/>As a final note, there is a post credits scene that happens in the middle of the credits, but word is that for the North American release, the ""extra scene"" rumored to have been filmed at the premiere runs at the very end. So, you'll want to stay in your seat til the very very end.<br/><br/>Please visit www.playeraffinity.com"
"DJChrisE","10","3","8","2 May 2012"," Earth's Mightiest Superhero Movie!
","I've been waiting for this movie since i was a kid reading Avengers #177 where they're all defeated by Michael/Korvac, and thinking, ""hang on, they're not supposed to be ALL defeated!"" I was hooked on these guys since then. 1978 i think.Anyway, i was more than worried about this film because it was to be very much MY film! I'd invested a lot of myself in these characters. I wouldn't be at all pleased if it didn't live up how awesome i know these characters have been written over the years. The battles, scars and losses they've had to endure. I thought it was going to be a kid flick! Pure and simple. That it wouldn't round the character's personalities enough, and the script would be too simple. Plus Joss Whedon WAS under my radar as a director. I hadn't gotten into Buffy or Firefly and anyway, let's just say i wasn't overly keen on the director. Nothing personal, or derivative of his craft and skills, but this was a boyhood dream taking form. People i spoke with about it all rated him though. So, as per usual i tried to keep away from as many clips, interviews, rumours etc as possible. I like to go into the show knowing as little as possible. I only watched trailers. Anyway, i went to see it in 2D on Wednesday 25th with a friend. Full of expectation and dread, heheh. All i can say is, Whedon has made an Avengers movie we fans can be so proud of. The Dark Knight for me is a monumental film, and easily was the best supe movie project ever executed. Until now that is. THE best supe team is now all together in a live action film. And they have been drawn together beautifully by Whedon's script. The mind boggles as to who else they will bring into this universe. Respect is due to the research, and his interpretation of how these characters work together. He nailed it. I'm not sure anyone else would have. Maybe not even Nolan himself! Whedon's view of them was almost exactly how i have interpreted their relationships over the years. I've seen The Avengers twice now already, and will probably go again before the Bluray release. That will be an occasion too, i'm sure. I've got to give the score a mention too. It's on repeat in my headphones at the moment, because its bloody great! You hardly notice it during the film because of the awesome visuals and dialogue, but i recommend having a listen to it alone. Alan Silvestri is a master of action cinema. He did Predator for god's sake! He delivers royally here. Check it out. I couldn't be happier about The Avengers. When Iron Man came out Downey-Junior was perfectly cast, and to top it all, a great movie was made, i thought maybe it could be the time when a really cool Avengers movie would be made. And so it has transpired. A huge BRAVO to all involved! AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!"

"Enchorde","9","3","8","1 May 2012"," Brilliant movie!
","Avengers is a splendid movie, and that's saying after having quite large expectations. True, I liked most of the recent super hero movie (except Iron Man 2 which was a bust) but Avengers excelled and outshine them all. I feared that putting all the super heroes together would make them cancel each other out, but instead it let them exploit their individual strengths. For example, Iron Man's sharp comments and one-liners are better and sharper than ever.<br/><br/>But above all, Avengers is an almost perfect mix of comedy and action. It says a lot when a movie running at 142 minutes never even feels long or have parts that loses tempo. Avengers is a non-stop action, without ever becoming repetitive, and spiced up with gems of humor, one-liners and jokes. Whedon should have a lot of credit for both writing and directing this with a good story but extreme care for the details. Such skill is rare and makes Avengers to an action movie masterpiece. To mention a few details I loved was Hulk's punch to Thor and Iron Man's nick Capsicle of Captain America. I only frowned when the chitauris spontaneously died when their mothership was blown up (felt too much SW 1 about it) as they were biological creatures, not robots. But that was a minor point, and the only I can recall.<br/><br/>The casting is great and all the actors and actresses do their parts very well. An honorable extra mention to Tom Hiddleston (surprised) that in my mind makes Loki perfect, Robert Downey Jr for his brilliant one-liners and Mark Ruffalo that perhaps plays the best Hulk ever.<br/><br/>I have to think back quite some time since I was so fully entertained by a movie. I hope sincerely there is a sequel (in the care of Whedon). There certainly is an opening for it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"TooDrunkToWalk","8","3","8","29 April 2012"," Style.......lots of style, and when all the style is done, some more style
","There is one word that sums up Avengers and that is style and it has awesome witty dialogues that are funny as hell.<br/><br/>There was always this fear with Avengers that it would fail to give every character its due, but every single superhero gets time to do his thing, do it in style and look really cool doing it. The interplay between the characters is brilliant. There are lots witty dialogues and most of them range from being very funny to being downright hilarious and there are many scenes that had the audience laughing really hard. Without intending to give much away, there is one scene towards the end involving Hulk and Loki that may just be the funniest scene ever in the history of movies. Each characters gets his due, they play off each other brilliantly. Above all the movie when it decides to get the audience to laugh does a hell of a job.<br/><br/>The story is one of weaknesses and it never immerses the audience in the movie and you always feel that you are watching really cool stuff happening from a distance. The story, which is quite simple really, can be summed up in two sentences. Loki has a deal with some aliens that if they help him take over the earth, he will give them a blue cube sort of a thing, which is very powerful. Loki builds a gateway, something like the one between Earth and Asgard in Thor, and the aliens arrive and the Avengers beat them and Loki.<br/><br/>Though Loki is the main villain, and he does get nasty and clever at times, he is not who the heroes end up fighting in the final battle. A whole army pops out of the sky, (quite literally) and while all along you are told an army is coming, when it does arrive you sort of wonder who are they exactly. Consequently the army itself, which in this instance happen to be essentially aliens from another of the nine worlds in the Thor story, seem very replaceable, and it would really not make a difference if the army the Avengers end up fighting were huge giant robots. Essentially what the movie makers are telling us that now a big army has arrived and the heroes have a hard task, and that isn't exactly great storytelling.<br/><br/>Secondly given the way this alien army is disposed off, by essentially shooting them with guns and arrows, you sort of wonder was this threat big enough to require the Avengers, I mean the army or the navy would have taken care of it, really. In other words the threat doesn't exactly overwhelm you when it arrives.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the story however is that when all the fighting is done there are no lasting impacts, I mean everyone walks off as if nothing happened and things are normal. The kind of invasion that has just taken place would quite frankly be one of those world changing events, but not in the movie, everyone just walks off as if nothing happened.<br/><br/>In terms of performances there is not one performance which seems uncool, everyone has they fair share of funny lines to say and look really cool and do things in style. One set of dialogues sums up the final battle, and it goes like this:- <br/><br/>Loki - I have an army <br/><br/>Iron Man - We have Hulk.<br/><br/>This in essence is the final battle for you. Hulk is good enough to wipe out the entire army, and really owns the final battle. Had it not been for the fact that the aliens were just too many in number and even Hulk is not someone who can be everywhere, the other heroes might not even be required. So to give the other heroes something to do there are enough aliens to keep everyone busy and a nuclear bomb thrown into the mix. However don't let this give you the impression that the movie is about Hulk, no its not, its about the others as much as it is about Hulk, just that Hulk is the biggest weapon the Avengers have against the alien army, and he pretty much owns every scene he is in. Some of the comedy involving Hulk is just awesome as well, and let me again remind you not to miss the Loki and Hulk Scene towards the end.<br/><br/>So in short the focus of the movie is not on an in depth story, its purely about style. The Avengers is a great example of how if you put enough style into a movie, the simplest of plots can provide tonnes of entertainment. I keep harping on the fact that Avengers is an ""entertainer"" meaning that if you want to have a good time you need to go this movie, you will have a really very great time. The story has its flaws, but if you are out with friends and looking to have fun, you won't exactly watch Schindler's List will you, you will go for something like Hangover. Avengers is awesome entertainer and right up there with the best of them and is a definite must watch.<br/><br/>Lastly a lot of talk was on how the Avengers will compare to the Dark Knight and really there is no scope for comparison. I mean trying to compare the two movies is like trying to compare an Apple and a Television Set. I mean they are so different to each other that a comparison is not possible. The only similarity is that they both have Superheroes in them, and that is where the similarity ends. They both are trying to be very different movies, and to try and compare them is futile.<br/><br/>So go watch Avengers, you will have a great time.<br/><br/>8/10 (only because I cannot rate it 8.5/10)"
"sawant062","8","3","8","29 April 2012"," Total Entertainer
","The movie is complete entertainer. What DC has created with Justice League, Marvel has answered with Avengers. Though Wolverine is to be a part of Marvel world, as he has a complete Movie franchise at his disposal, we do not get to see him here. The Bunch of characters assembled for the Group (or rather force) are so conflicting, yet they perform good enough in the movie. The SFX in the movie are good and not sketchy. The character development is good, especially of Iron Man and Captain America. The constant tiff happening between them reminds of Batman-Supermen ego battles. The sequel is about to come, guessing by the scenes after titles. The 3D is better than the last 3D movie. Personally I liked the characters of Tony Stark, Captain America and Bruce Banner. Yes, The HULK. His comments in rage are comic as they are meant to be."
"u_sims","10","3","8","29 April 2012"," Finally, The Avengers is here. And does it live up to the hype? OH YES!
","The Avengers (titled rather cheesily 'Avengers Assemble' in some countries including the UK) has been anticipated ever since Iron Man in 2008. Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger have all built up to this pinnacle of Marvel movies. The star-packed cast includes Robert Downey Jr. returning as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as God of Thunder from Asgard, Thor. Also Mark Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton as gamma-ray exposed scientist Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk. Scarlett Johannson returns as Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow from the second Iron Man and Jeremy Renner stars as expert marksman Clint Barton (Hawkeye.) Tom Hiddleston plays villain Loki and Samuel L. Jackson returns as SHIELD director Nick Fury. Cobie Smulders, Clark Gregg and Stellan Skarsgard round out the cast.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is relatively simple; Loki wants control of The Earth after the events of Thor and will do this with the help of an alien race and the Tesseract from Captain America. SHIELD then puts together a team of remarkable people to fight the battles that they never could, to quote the inspirational words of Nick Fury. And to quote Tony Stark, these are a demigod, a super-soldier, a man with breathtaking anger management issues and a couple of master assassins. They must protect, or avenge, The Earth.<br/><br/>This film was first heard about four years ago and has gained a substantial amount of hype ever since the teaser trailer in the summer of 2011. Nine months and numerous exciting trailers and TV spots later, it is here. And yes it delivers, very well. One of the best things about this is the characters. Because they are all humans, you feel for them and care about them. And Loki, a fantastic villain played tremendously by Hiddleston, has a way of getting under all of their skins, hence his title of the God of Mischief. The acting is great and it goes without saying that Downey Jr. is amazing and hilarious. As is the whole movie; Joss Whedon's superb script delivers many witty and memorable lines so much so that you will want to laugh out loud in a lot of moments, mostly involving Stark or The Hulk. Particular scene involving the green behemoth and Loki or Thor are outstanding. The action is brilliant as well and I would recommend seeing it in 3D; the last third of the movie is definitely improved in three dimensions. From the fast-paced, exciting, opening scene through recruitment and the Manhattan carnage, this is an exciting, emotional, funny and perfectly executed film with great CGI. Also there are many moments where you just want to yell out AWWW YEAHHH!!!<br/><br/>There are just a few bad points here; but they are minor. First, I would have liked to have seen Nick Fury and Agent Hill fighting more in Manhattan, despite doing some things on the Helicarrier. Also it dawdles a bit too much on the first half, however this doesn't detract at all from what is DEFINITELY a 10/10 motion picture."
"atonementor","8","3","8","29 April 2012"," In the end, Stark went for it
","Till now, The Avengers is the most spectacular motion picture of 2012. I doubt that there is any other film can beat that. The soundtrack is beautiful. The acting is well-done. The directing¬Ö oh my, is marvelous! I know Joss Whedon is good at doing ""teamwork"" films like Firefly, Serenity, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, etc. but I was stunned when seeing The Avengers.<br/><br/>Damn, he's that good! Containing a group of superheroes in one live action feature film is an amazing idea, but make it work is a whole different thing. And Joss Whedon just did that radiantly. I am also keeping an eye on Zak Penn, who wrote the script of The Avengers. He had done an excellent job there.<br/><br/>Well, I do realize that most of reviews on IMDb have already talked about how wonderful this movie is. And I admit that I am not as good as other viewers at this point. So I just talk about one thing really got me in this movie. Above all those magnificent details about the soundtrack, the script, the visual experience, etc. one thing is very small and even not in the league of those really got me: Tony Stark went for it.<br/><br/>What did he go for? I won't tell you, see it yourself. What Tony did in The Avengers had brought back the Stark I knew in Iron Man (2008). And for me, Tony Stark is the most admirable character in this film. Well firstly, I like Loki. I still like him, just love Tony more. Can't wait to see him in Iron Man 3, which directed by Shane Black (he did Kiss Kiss Bang Bang).<br/><br/>Long story short, ladies and gentlemen, go watch The Avengers. It's worth your time. People start to compare this film with The Dark Knight Rises. Come on, guys. Don't ruin the moment. Not everything needs to be compared. The Avengers is wonderful motion picture, so does The Dark Knight Rises may be. That's it. Accept it."

The comedy was great to it makes the whole movie to fit.<br/><br/>No movie is flawless, but what can I say about this guys. I love the actors in the movie I really liked the story. But some scenes the could think about the little thing, I don not want to spoil it and review it you most see to understand. I I don not think everyone sees that little mistakes. But without any regards I will give it a 10 because I have not seen any movie yet that has this good scenes in it. <br/><br/>GO AND SEE...."
"rv-dielive","10","3","8","28 April 2012"," What's great and not so great about Marvel's The Avengers
","Yes, its a superhero (super cast) marathon, insane CGI and production values at its best, blah, blah, blah. Everyone knows that, what people don't know is why Avengers will work for most and not for a few.<br/><br/>i believe the real heroes of this movie are two guys Joss Wheton (Director/Writer/Screenplay Writer) Seamus McGarvey (Cinematographer) <br/><br/>I have observed the movies which really work as an integrated unit are the ones where the director himself does the screenplay. As a film student myself i can safely say that no matter how hard you try if the director and screenplay writers have two different work spaces (unless they are people who get along on a very personal level) they would never get it rolling on film. That's why people like Christopher Nolan/Peter Jackson take their movies into outer space. OK, Enough crap. <br/><br/>What's bad?<br/><br/>The fact that its another superhero bang bang movie with the typical marvel unrealistic (non human) plots. The story moves in a predictable direction and the thrills were expected (only well presented). The fact that there's currently no Spiderman/Xmen in Marvel's 'Avengers' scheme of things will disappoint a few fans (Although Marvel Studios are onto Sony Columbia and Fox to get individual character rights for sequels). So surely a group of people will find it ordinary or not worth their time.<br/><br/>What's good?<br/><br/>You will run out of answers when you think of could this movie with this plot have been made any better at all? All the fan favorite marvel characters in the film are given as much character development and depth as a 142 min film could've allowed while at the same time make sure the visuals make it into the trailers and get audiences rolling in. The cinematography is fantastic for example there a couple of scenes where we (camera) are in the car and we see ourselves rolling! and the action scenes are done so that you can register/admire them properly (Michael Bay should have a look into this!). Joss Wheton is top class all through. Classic big screen adventure!<br/><br/>For the majority of the fans. You will clap, cheer, hoot at Robert Downey Jr's quirks, Dr. Banner/Hulk's smash comedy and will admire Chris Evans commands as Captain America, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The visuals are fantastic, the plot is entertaining all through. 3D is an added feature which i personally enjoyed tremendously. If you have a group of friends to go with, this movie will surely make your weekend!"
"lagudafuad","8","3","8","28 April 2012"," Best of the best
","Earth's Mightiest Heroes come together under one roof, led in battle by the perfect soldier himself Captain America, to face the Asgardian Villain Loki or as Hulk put it ""Pewny god"".<br/><br/>First thing, what happens when u put Bruce Banner and Thor in a vessel way up in the sky and then Banner sets Hulk loose?<br/><br/>Chaos like no other.<br/><br/>I have to say watching this film will put you at the edge of your sit for the total 2hours 15mins. Sadly to say Nick Fury's (Samuel L Jackson) acting was the weakest among the group and Mark Ruffalo's was the best.<br/><br/>But the hero to watch out for is the Hulk, this massive walking gamma radiation will make you laugh, trip, and then roll on the fall clutching your ribs.<br/><br/>You don't believe me? Go get a dose of The Avengers.<br/><br/>This movie is CGI invasion, almost everything at the final frontier (final battle) was CGI incorporated. So well crafted was the CGI and so well mastered were the actors themselves that they flowed with the scenes with ease.<br/><br/>The comic relief in the movie were both The Hulk/Banner and Thor, these were the high notes:<br/><br/>1. When they took down an invading alien ship 2. When Hulk and Loki met face to face. 3. When Banner and Thor discussed Loki.<br/><br/>I felt the comic relief was well crafted into the movie; kudos to the script, the screenplay and cinematography were also on point.<br/><br/>The screenplay was done by Joss Whedon who worked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, he made every scene especially the fight and battle scenes so interesting a sight. The comedy/action scenes were precise and will leave you gasping for breath, as you never expect them. Even now that I told you where they are still... you won't see it coming, trust me.<br/><br/>Directing in its part had to be done by a master director, because having all this heroes together, you have to be able to mix and match, so that none is underutilized and none is hugging the screen time, nice work Joss.<br/><br/>And watch out for cool camera angles, one had Captain America assessing a scene and we get to see it from a reflection.<br/><br/>Again a wonderful performance by Tom Hiddleston (Loki), when he played Loki in the 2011 Thor, he did it so well I actually thought he knew the guy. Here too he did the same, I hope this won't be the last we hear of him.<br/><br/>Wasn't so exciting, was the Iron Man character (although that is my point others may view it differently), his humour always went over my head all through the movie. Black Widow and Hawk Eye, they held their own as they had no powers or a special suit, they made sure they had their share count of dead robotic bad guys. Captain played an important role in the end, but the thing that was worth the watch in his character is the way he was oblivious about things. Thor was graceful as usual, but the Hulk was the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>All in all, go see it."
"ngozems","10","3","8","28 April 2012"," Indescribable!!!!!!!!!
","If I could rate this movie higher, I would. I have never sat down to rate a movie, ever...so well done to the entire cast and team. Very good job done. I have never been into Marvel and my introduction to the world of Marvel was Iron Man and the Hulk some few years back...yet this movie has made me want to look for these comics and read them. Care was taken in developing this work and it shows. The dialogue was witty, action was great...amazing how they all work so well together in the movie. Beautifully produced. I already want to see it again!<br/><br/>Can I say though, for Cineworld Milton Keynes, 3D was not too fab, if you are seeing in 3D, the action scenes are where 3D works best, all other normal dialogue scenes are clearer with the 3D glasses off.<br/><br/>So there you are, what are you waiting for? Go see this movie...well worth every last penny!<br/><br/>......by the way did I mention a couple of hot sexy guys?(*wink)"
"ishanpotter","10","3","8","28 April 2012"," Avengers....ASSEMBLED !! (contains spoilers)
","Back in 2005 since Marvel Studios had just been formed they were toying with the idea of making an 'Avengers' film.At first they provided subtle hints in some after credits and well as in-movie scenes.Nick Fury appearing at the end of Iron Man and Stark appearing at the end of Incredible Hulk movie'(both talking about the avengers initiative) -we already knew what was in store for us.Finally after 5 films and a wait of 11 years (in total) we get this great film from Joss Whedon (of Buffy:TVS fame) who takes the foundation that was built in prior films and brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history.<br/><br/>Seriously I cant even begin to review this movie and i fear i wont be able to write much about this EPIC movie.This movie has to be seen to be believed .So ill just write down what i loved (or hated) about the movie character wise.<br/><br/>LOKI Tom Hiddlestone gives an excellent portrayal of Loki. He appears more evil this time around compared to Thor movie.My favorite Loki scene is where he demands the people of the city to kneel before him.reminded me of ''KNEEL BEFFOORE ZOD''<br/><br/>Capn America Portrayed by Chris Evans.This time his character is more likable compared to CA:TFA .He has the best dialogs (apart from RDJ) .The image of Chris as Human Torch is entirely wiped out from your mind, Best Capn scene :''Why should i take orders from you?'' scene.<br/><br/>Black Widow: portrayed by Scarlett Johansson .She has a better role this time compared to Iron Man 2.Wasp should have been in the film instead of her.<br/><br/>Hawkeye. Weakest Character of the movie.(and i am not talking strength wise or anything) Little to none back story provided.Didn't get a film based on him apart from a few minutes in THOR. Also got converted into being Loki's minion pretty fast . But the scene where he shoots at the Chitauri army without even aiming is bad-ass.<br/><br/>Thor. portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Simply awesome. He has the best entrance scene in the film. Fav Thor scene : Are you afraid of a little lightening ?'...'No i am afraid of what comes later'' scene<br/><br/>Nick Fury played by Muthaf***king Samuel Jackson .Finally he gets his own movie.His mother will be proud.And why was he trying to shoot the jet with a pistol?Who does he think he is ? Tintin?<br/><br/>Maria Hill played by Cobie Smulders. Kids back in the summer of 2012 your aunt Robin decided to join the Avengers. She had a good role BTW.<br/><br/>Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr.On second thoughts he doesn't even play the character.Robert Downey IS Tony Stark.Many people I know have just seen the Iron man movies and will go to see Avengers just to see him. Plays the character efficiently and wisecracking at his best . Fav Iron man scene : Suiting up Mark VII Trivia:(he wears a black sabbath shirt in this movie. Black sabbath wrote Iron Man theme in the first movie)<br/><br/>Hulk/Bruce Banner Easily the best character of this movie.Mark Ruffalo surpasses Edward Norton in his portrayal of the green giant.Each and every scene he is in is awesome. Finally we get to see a good hulk after two mediocre HULK films. Fave hulk scene : Loki Rag doll scene.<br/><br/>Final mention to : AGENT COULSON portrayed by Clark Gregg. R.I.P Phil Coulson ! Marvel has lost a great character with his death. His death is perhaps the biggest shock of this movie .And he couldn't even get his capn cards signed :'(But at least he died with a bang. Agent Sitwell makes a brief appearance. fave Coulson scene ? all of em.. Trivia:Joss Whedon is known fr killing of beloved characters in his shows.<br/><br/>Technically speaking :By Hollywood standards This movie shouldn't even exist because it is way too risky. But somehow they have managed to pull it off flawlessly Marvel has already announced Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and Avengers 2 (where its pretty evident that the main villain is Thanos). They should bring War Machine back in Iron man 3.his absence is noticeable. Honestly I don't think any other 2012 movie can beat this one (though the DARK KNIGHT RISES might just do it)<br/><br/>BTW speaking of team up movies ...does anyone remember the live action JLA movie of 1997 :p"
"kat_777","8","3","8","27 April 2012"," Iron man all the way....
","It was a spectacular experience watching this movie in 3D. Without the 3D effects it will only be a still those who love epic action movies. Movie starts off with a very slow pace and then it gathers speed since the entry of iron man.<br/><br/>This movie has a large number of academy awards nominees. Robert Downey Jr; Gwyneth Paltrow; Samuel L Jackson; Jeremy Renner; Mark Ruffalo etc.<br/><br/>It is Robert Downey Jr's movie indeed. He delivered a spectacular performance as a guy who can't help but to tell wits in each and every sentence he says. Th audience loved watching Iron man in action. I was happy with entry of Gwyneth Paltrow as well.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo managed to stick to his own personal standard as well. He portrays a man who is very caring, soft and tender but later turns out to be someone who is disastrous to the environment, when he gets angry. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johanssen shined well in this film. She was very flexible in action as well as acting. Her addition made this movie much more thrilling. She look very cool with curled red hair. It is definitely one of her best looks since Vicky Cristina Barcelona. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth too was good.<br/><br/>Chris Evans looked a lot different from his earlier films. He managed deliver the maturity his character Captain America needed.<br/><br/>The whole film had a lot of visual effects. The 3d effects mad the movie look more attractive. one can definitely go for the film to look for their favorite super hero. Definitely the fans of Iron man will love the film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"clsrocks","9","3","8","27 April 2012"," An honest confession !!!!!
","So much to say yet so little space .I feel like I am short of words today. But after watching this flick in IMAX reald 3d I figure all of you would be as speechless as I am. Where do I begin Where do I end? The moral dilemma I am in to write this review.<br/><br/>But Joss Whedon was one guy who knew exactly where to start and where to end in this Marvel fantasy epic. Yes the marvel cinematic universe was already in place. All the characters had been pre-established and had their own individual fan following. So how do you get a bunch of franchises all into one? Just do what Mark Millar did in the Ultimates Vol.1.So you have a ready-made script which you need to modify very little of. Minor adjustments to make the 'Hulk' look like a good guy etc. and presto you have a script. Casting was never a problem anyway. Since Merril Lynch gave you 300 million USD to make this visual effects extravaganza the CGI was hardly ever going to be a problem with Industrial Lights and Magic on your side. But where Whedon succeeds is the characterization. Every one from Chris Evans(Captain America) to Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) have their own screen time to develop their characters and story. Marvel has done this before in X-men etc. but this movie just outdoes everything they ever made. The brilliance of Mr.Whedon is clearly seen here. I guess all those years of working in Buffyverse finally paid off! I initially thought it would be a Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) ride all the way. I even wore my Iron Man T-shirt as well. Thankfully it was not so everybody pitches in equally and its fun to watch.<br/><br/>The plot line is pretty simple and straight forward. A bunch of aliens try to attack earth with Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) leading the way. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to bring in 'The Avengers' to bash the alien scum out of Earth. We all know how it turns out but its fun to watch it the way it happens, the way joss makes it happen. Yes the final battle sequence feels a little 'Star Warsy' and 'Transformersy' with the alien airspeeders flying all over the place and huge gigantic slug like creatures falling out of the sky but its still amazing to watch and is a visceral treat. I just can't wait for Avengers 2 to come out.Hope they do the 'Civil War' storyline (also by Mark Millar the genius that he is...). <br/><br/>Wondering where the confession part is in all of this¬Ö.. well here it is .I enjoyed it like a guilty pleasure. For me it was revenge. Revenge on everyone who calls us avid comic book follower's geeks or junkies! It was a slap in the face to all the cocky bastards who criticized me ever since I was in sixth grade until now for reading comic books calling them kids' stuff. Those same guys would be inside the movie screens this week watching the 'Avengers' I am sure. If they are not well the they're even dumber than I thought. This movie brought back my memories of being a kid with bronchitis sitting on his bed dosed up with meds with nothing but a 'Captain America' and 'Iron Man' issue to keep him company. Of course I had the 'Justice League' and 'Batman' but since this is a marvel movie I will leave out the DC guys till TDKR comes out.<br/><br/>I am no 'Captain America' but I am a patriot. Yeah the movie released in India a week earlier before the U.S which was uber cool. Also Bruce Banner is on the run and hiding in Calcutta so yes he speaks Hindi. Also the end credits track is played by Soundgarden (Chris Cornell) who happen to be one of my most favorite band of all time (Yeah my first love is comic books second is guitar based hard rock...go figure!!!!).Their lead guitarist is a guy of Indian origin. He is called Kim Thayil and he rocks hard.<br/><br/>So to sum it all up whether your young or old assemble your fellow avengers go to your nearest movie screen and shout it out loud "" Avengers Assemble!"" and make Marvel all the money they deserve for giving us a fantastic movie experience."

","The Avengers or Marvel's Avengers Assemble here in the UK for ridiculous reasons is the long awaited teaming up of the characters from Marvel's recent and successful movies. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and steals The Tesseract, an energy source being worked on by scientists at S.H.I.E.L.D. In response, S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative and assembles a team of superhuman men and women that comprises of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Loki's brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who join S.H.I.E.L.D Agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in attempting to stop Loki from subjugating the world's population.<br/><br/>There was always the danger that things could go 'tits up' for Marvel when producing a film on this scale and with so many well known characters and actors/personalities involved. I'm delighted to say that they have pulled it off and that The Avengers is a terrific film. The plot itself plays second fiddle to the assembling of the team and I don't think this was a bad thing. Obviously Marvel will be hoping for a sequel or five to come after the film so it was essential that the characters interactions and developments with each other were given high priority. The sharp dialogue is thrown between the characters with more force and precision than a throw of Thor's hammer. In the end the story is similar to every other superhero movie; bad guy brings destructive forces to Earth in an attempt to rule and/or destroy humanity while superhero(s) attempt to stop them. In Loki and Tom Hiddleston though, there is a bad guy who carries great menace and feels more dangerous when he is doing nothing than when he is thrashing his weapon around. I think that Hiddleston gives the best performance of the piece.<br/><br/>The time given to each character seemed fair and worked well. There was a risk that this could have turned into Iron Man 3 plus Other Guys and as you'd expect given his character traits, Downey Jr does get more dialogue than the others but not so much that he overpowers the film. Captain America becomes the de-faco leader of The Avengers, Thor has a vested interest in bringing Loki to justice and while I'd like to have seen more of Dr. Banner, the Hulk had the best action scenes and also the biggest laugh of the entire film. Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Sam Jackson also have plenty to do. It is testament to how good the film is that there are no characters who feel forgotten or underused.<br/><br/>I've said in the past that I wish action blockbusters would be more fun. They always seem so straight and serious (i.e. Battleship), but The Avengers is the most fun film I've seen in a long time. The action was frenetic and thankfully avoided too much shaky-cam so I was able to keep up with it. It is also one of the funniest films I've seen for a few weeks. Marvel's films always have humour intrinsically wound into them but never before has there been so much and that it's hit the mark so often. I can't think of a big Hollywood movie that has made me laugh this much so far in 2012.<br/><br/>As well as being action packed and fun, the movie also looks incredible. I saw it in 2D (and wont go on a rant as to why, but basically I'm sick of crummy, dark, 3D) and it still popped off the screen. Highlights included the fantastic and believable technology used aboard S.H.I.E.L.D's ship and most spectacularly of all, the giant Centipede like bad guys who looked phenomenal. The sight of them ripping through New York City is something that will stay with me. The main character's design and costume were all excellent. Iron Man looked even cooler when covered in dents and scratches and The Hulk's design is far improved from his Edward Norton days. For me the best costume though was Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow outfit because of.. um.. well.. the.. the colour's nice. Yes the colour.<br/><br/>My only complaints are mild and that is that the horde of alien bad guys didn't really do much. It was only really numbers that they had on their side. Another small problem I had was trying to remember where everyone fitted as I've only seen each of the lead-up films once so couldn't quite place some people, words and ideas. Those though are extremely pernickety and minor problems.<br/><br/>Overall The Avengers is one of the most entertaining films I've seen in years and at the end of the day we go to the cinema to be entertained so what more can I add? Only that this film has become greater than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>www.attheback.blogspot.com"

","I have waited 4 years for this movie ever since I heard the rumour it was going to be made..<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this and was scared of being disappointed the plot was great to me there was no other way to group the avengers together without causing a lot of questions at the end.<br/><br/>It had humour that lifted your spirit and made you enjoy it even more, the touch of drama made me feel inspired.<br/><br/>The action was amazing.<br/><br/>Although a lot of people criticise that you have to watch Iron man 2, Thor, Captain America etc... To understand this movie I think that is entirely wrong.<br/><br/>Yes to me watching them would make the movie a bit more understandable but not as much as others imply.<br/><br/>As long as you know who iron man, Thor, hulk, captain America and the other casts are you should find the movie just as amazing as I did. Even at that without the knowledge of the other casts just knowing those 4 characters would be enough to find the movie entertaining."

","I am from India so I don't have much of the comic book reading experience which others from US have. But I've been waiting for this movie for over an year now. I have read so many reviews and saw so many Trailers of this movie before actually going to the movie I felt like I watched 90% of the movie. But when I actually saw this movie it blew me away. First and Foremost kudos to Whedon for a wonderful masterpiece. Screenplay was extra ordinary and the way he put all those powerful characters in one frame was simple brilliant. I don't know why but I always thought Iron Man will be like the central character of the movie. But it was great to see HULK made a big impact than any other character. I saw the UK Press conference where Mark Ruffalo said that he was the first person to act both Bruce and Hulk. It was simply amazing. I have never seen such a huge audience and rush for a English movie in so long after Avatar than I've seen today. If you haven't watched it yet. Do not waste any time. These type of movies come only once in a lifetime."
"Filmazer","8","3","8","27 April 2012"," In a classroom, ""The Avengers"" is definitely an ""A"" student but not necessarily the brightest or the most creative.
","If you are a fan of any of the marvel characters in the movie, like myself, you will not be disappointed. You will exactly see what you have expected it to be in full length since the release of its trailer, no more, no less.<br/><br/>Every superhero gets ample screen time and their interactions with one another is pleasantly entertaining.<br/><br/>The surprise here is the Hulk, whom I think is far more fun to watch here than in his own movies. Accolades to Ruffalo, who did a great job with Banner. (I'm not sure if he can be as good as Ed Norton in a standalone but as part of an ensemble, he's perfect and I can't say the same with Ed Norton if he is to reprise his role here.) The CGI version of this Hulk is also way better than his previous versions - rightly proportioned, just the right tone of green and with an improved face that looks just like the comic version and even a bit like Ruffalo's. Simply awesome!<br/><br/>My gripe(s) with the movie though is with its overly simple and uninteresting main plot. Tom Hiddleston is a charming lad but alas, Loki as the lone villain against such a powerful team is simply too weak and a non-threat. Throughout the movie, I never quite felt that anyone (except perhaps Loki himself) was in any kind of serious Jeopardy. Btw, speaking of weak enemies, how about an alien army (more like a skirmish team) on hover-boards? Hmm....looks familiar....don't they work for Skeletor? Perhaps that's what the whole portal thing was about. Together, it feels just like a plot-line pulled from an episode of ""He-man and the Masters of the Universe"". Also, if the alien mother-ship can be so easily destroyed, who needs the avengers? Just launch a few nuclear missiles at it as it comes through the portal, duh!<br/><br/>Aside from that, there really isn't much else to complain, especially with the understanding that this movie serves as an introductory episode in the forming of the team more than anything. Walking out the theater, I wanted to see more, and agree with Joss Whedon when he said the sequel(s) will be smaller in scale. By that, I hope he means only the amount of CGI shots, not what is at stake or the magnitude of the catastrophe/adversary the avengers has to face, since the team bonding/friction seems to be the true strength of the franchise. (Leave a big chunk of exploding machines and collapsing skyscrapers to other movies please, since we have probably all seen enough of that by now.) Besides that, it also needs to be cleverer and more emotionally engaging. It will then be perfect."
"jjvz1989-224-63907","6","5","17","1 May 2012"," Avengers, the most overrated superhero movie to grace our screens.
","The hype regarding the avengers movie has proved to be just a fan-boy created hype. The movie is all style no substance and the best of the characters and the best actor by far, Mark Ruffallo as Bruce Banner gets a backseat ride as marvel poster boy (although better as Sherlock Holmes) Robert Downey Jnr. tries to make it a one man show. Chris Evans has grown as an actor, he is no longer a sarcastic wise cracking idiot, he is now the leader struggling to find his place in other words depressed a'la Kirsten Stewart in twilight. People that find the time to whine about the voices with regard to every Batman actor ever gracing the silver screen will delight in Chris Hemsworth's attempt at Asgard as a province right next to Queensland, Australia, a more irritating growl hasn't been heard since Christian Bale took over the mantel. Tom Hiddleston seems bored and irritated by the role which he perfectly played in Thor, it seems the paycheck was large enough to get him to appear but not large enough to make an effort. Hawkeye, why even include him? he is a character best left killed off every second week in a marvel comic. Samul L Jackson, remember him for Pulp Fiction, forget him for everything else, David Hasslehoff has never seem to be a better choice for any role until it was announced that the ultimate fury would be played by Samuel. Black Widow, wow more useless than the Power Pack, less Russian than the state of Kentucky and more wooden that south African oak. You should be thanking you're lucky stars that the nude photos actually leaked, it gave you somewhat of a career. Let's get to the actually headache inducing story, David s Goyer should be knocking down doors at Marvel Entertainment, threatening to sue them if he does not get his royalties cheque. It is almost like they tried to take every superhero movie ever made and bash it into one script, American City in trouble, Check. Everything falls to the front, Check. The heroes do not get along ala Fantastic four but love each other as they are, check. Josh Whedon influenced sci-fi, oh check check and more check. I am rooting for the next film to include a scene where Kolkata is attacked or maybe even better, Johannesburg, South Africa. The Cap lands in hillbrow, all of a sudden a Nigerian drug dealer arrives, aims for his head but shoots him in the leg (they can steal another idea because plagiarism seems to be the only method they make movies, ""you should have bought American"" just before he falls into a coma). You get the idea (maybe hawkeye stand on top of a tower in Chicago or Port Elizabeth, and a gust of wind takes him tumbling into oblivion where he belongs. To sum up the story, Armageddon (the city Scenes), every marvel movie ever produced, steel magnolias and every David Goyer script. Simple as pie. give this a skip, don't give into the hype that every teenager wants you to believe, they are the same guys that transformers to the top of the box office while movies like Senna, Drive rotted in obscurity. I am looking forward to one Josh Whedon venture though, Much ado about nothing and I cannot wait for a stand alone film of Mark Rufallo as Bruce Banner."
"adamross1984","7","5","17","26 April 2012"," Very good, but not the greatest.
","Hey guys. I've written a HUGE review of this. Here is the first few paragraphs. Head over to www.thecrat.com to read my full review.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: if you're anything like me, you want to go into The Avengers as blind as possible. I will try to avoid addressing the majority of the plot, but when I have to clearly address plot points I will mark them as spoilers.<br/><br/>2012 is gearing up to be the biggest year in film ever. With new entries into some of the most beloved franchises of all time (Lord of the Rings, Alien, James Bond and Batman) it is a good year to be a film geek. The first of the year's massive releases arrives in the form of The Avengers (sorry, Hunger Games, you have the box office, but not the scope to join the heavy hitters). The question everyone (or just geeks) is asking: is this the best comic book film ever? I would have to answer with an emphatic no. This film is big, huge in fact, and it gets a lot of things right. But I also think, considering the pedigree and lead-up to this film, The Avengers should have been a game-changer. Unfortunately, it is not.<br/><br/>The Avengers is the culmination of the 'Marvel Studios' Cinematic Universe'. Marvel has created a series of films starring their heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and The Incredible Hulk) that all coincide in the same reality (just like the comic books). This connectivity has been planned from the start so that when Marvel was ready, they could join these characters into a single film. That moment has arrived with The Avengers. The Avengers is primarily made for fans of these films: if you have skipped the previous films and missed the back-story, you may find that your enjoyment of this new entry is limited.<br/><br/>The plot of The Avengers sees the demigod Loki (the great, snarling Tom Hiddleston) planning to enslave the entirety of the human race. Minor spoilers: after his exile in Thor, Loki finds himself in a strange portion of the universe, one controlled by an alien race known as the Chitauri (the identity of this race is inconsequential, and it is revealed within the first few moments of The Avengers). Loki plans to use the Chitauri's numbers to achieve his goal of world domination. Once Loki makes his presence known on earth, it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to unite earth's mightiest heroes into a force capable of combating Loki and the Chitauri.<br/><br/>The man primarily responsible for this cinematic interpretation of the comic is Joss Whedon. Whedon acts as the writer and director of The Avengers and it is far and away his biggest undertaking yet. Mainly known for his television work (Buffy and Firefly), Whedon has only ever directed one other film: the low-scale (compared to The Avengers) Serenity. Marvel Studios has a reputation of hiring risky or untested (in big budget films) actors and directors to make their films (the recovering addict Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, the relatively unknown Chris Hemsworth as Thor) and the majority of these decisions have paid off gloriously. Unfortunately, Whedon isn't exactly one of them. Despite being an authority on geek culture, Whedon's pacing, plot and cinematic eye are good, but they still leave a lot to be desired. This is a quantum leap in terms of his career and Whedon (mostly) steps up to the plate. The Avengers would be a daunting prospect for any director, let alone one with a single film under their belt. Whedon is largely regarded for his writing and in The Avengers it is very much hit and miss. He nails the characters' voices and his dialogue is mostly fantastic (except for a few Downey Jnr quips ‚Äì but knowing him, I'd imagine they are improvised).However, his basic plot framework is quite muddled. A film of this calibre should function like a well-oiled machine, not feel like it is made out of spare parts. To read the rest head to www.thecrat.com"
"melssnailshop","1","8","33","2 May 2013"," Terrible, worthless, piece of trash
","Why are critics digging this movie for everything good in it, because it's vice versa for every other movie out there. Usually, critics bash movies for their mistakes a blind spots that ruin the movies, why not here? I can name over ten things that make this movie so bad! Comedy, in the end of the world, are you kidding me? Loki, a villain, for six people, are you kidding me?! Iron Man is way too perfect, as he is in every movie there is! Black Widow is a pathetic excuse for heroine. Along with Hawkeye, who even Jenner said wasn't good at all, was the worst character of 2012, and yes, I did see most of the movies from the 2012 area. This movies is nothing but a generic version of Batman Begins, and I say that one rather than Nolan's other two because, frankly, in my opinion, saying this a generic version of The Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises would make me go to hell for bad respect towards some of the best movies ever. Why can't Marvel fix their villain problems, Mandarin was terrible in Iron Man 3, especially that terrible twist. Anyways, I could continue, but you get my point. Hulk had no veins, this movie was cut from 3 to 2 hours, and if it would have been 3 hours, it would have gotten me to give it a ten out of ten stars. Sorry if you take this as a lecture, I'm just listing why I did not like this movie."

","This superhero flick may have looked like gold in the trailers and merchandising, but the real thing is a bloated, bland hodgepodge full of bad acting, dull scripting, and under-average action scenes. the only two good actors in the movie are Robert Downey, Jr. (Iron Man) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki). Believe me, I think the LEGO sets based on the film are more interesting and the mini figure of Thor is better than the one in the movie because he can't talk. Hulk (the actual green guy, not the nerdy scientist) has only a few lines of dialogue, bummer, I know. I don't want to spoil anything else, but don't spend $40 seeing this film."

There's an intelligent sharp script, virtual non-stop action, incredible special effects and 2 1/2 hours that just fly by. This one of those rare comic book movies where everything is done right! It's beautifully directed, the acting is good, there's nice doses of humor and (refreshingly) the characters do NOT get along at first so we can see them grow and become a team. There's not a lot to say about this film because EVERYTHING is done well! Just go see it and enjoy! Also stay through the closing credits for a very humorous bit at the very end."

","The epitome of Hollywood. Prepare to spend the next two and a half hours of your day in a movie theater feeling as though you are on a ride at Universal Studios. Don't get me wrong, it was extremely entertaining...but entertainment only gets a few points in my book when it comes to critiquing movies. It is very predictable and follows a plot line that a twelve year old could have come up with. No disrespect to any Avengers fans but it was extremely cheesy. Who would have thought that the Incredible Hulk was so strong? I wish that I could relate to not only the heroes but also to the villains.

","The Incredible Hulk was a really fun movie. It really never captured the real incense of the Hulk, and focused to much of the character of Bruce than the character of Hulk, but it was still a fun film. My second to least favorite. 7/10.<br/><br/>Thor was my least favorite, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It had good humor, surprisingly good action, but was executed in a really cheesy way. The atmosphere was too open and never really entertained and moved like the others did. 6/10.<br/><br/>Captain America was a good addition. It had a really great pulpy feel to it, while the others mainly focuses on modernized aspects. But the ending lost it's steam (and added itself to my list of worst endings ever in cinematic history.) 8/10.<br/><br/>Iron Man was/still is one of favorite superhero movies of all time. The plot was great, the character of Tony was brilliantly hilarious, and the overall tone was exhilarating. 9/10.<br/><br/>So my overall expectations were very high. I kept reading positive critic review after positive critic review, and people praised the film as one of (if not the) BEST superhero movie ever, even surpassing that of Nolan's Batman trilogy. So, as any excited person would, woke up early, took a speedy shower, and jumped into my clothes. I bought IMAX 3D tickets, sat down, and started getting jittery of my excitement. Thoughts went through me. ""AMAZING!"" ""BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!"" I couldn't wait to see these transform and lie before me. This was going to be the best cinematic experience of all-time. Bad thoughts didn't even enter my mind, they weren't even present at the back of my head. This was it... The lights dimmed, the theater went quiet, the Marvel logo flashed onto the screen. This was IT... Now after all that big, gigantic build-up, you would expect nothing but good things. But you're wrong...<br/><br/>I didn't like it. It's simple as that. The strange thing is, people around me found it fantastic, like it was a modern masterpiece. I found it to be extremely entertaining but that doesn't make up for: the bad dialogue. I found the Dark Knight to be more humorous than this. The jokes were hit-and-miss, only a few scenes leaving a grin upon my face. But the rest were so cheesy and so over-the-top that I cringed in horror.. The atmosphere. I found nothing in this movie. It was surely style over substance. So half the film is taken place inside an aircraft, and all the action-packed spectacle takes place in the last thirty minutes, but before that? It was boring! I mean it. And I thought this was build-up to an epic showdown that would redeem the entire film! Boy, was I wrong. It was cheesy dialogue scene to yet another cheesy dialogue scene. It wasn't even trying that best. And I found the entire film kind of anti-climatic. The villain Loki was so badly cast (and I don't mean the actor) that I found no tension between the characters and him. All the action was all-together forty-five minutes, that making the rest of the hour joke after joke, that never succeeds at being funny. And back to the atmosphere.. It was so clunky, so goofy, so off-the- wall. It had no tension between the villain and the Avengers, the cheesy one-liners were cringe-worthy, and the final payoff left a bad taste in my mouth. I predicted that the Avengers wouldn't find themselves in a dilemma and I was right. They killed a few robot characters and they won: how could I have not seen this? And robot.. that sounds quite familiar? The whole Manhattan showdown that takes place at the end (the only excitement the film consumes) was so reminiscent of the Transformers saga. And robots are so contrived that the whole scene still came off a little goofy...<br/><br/>I'm really sad that I didn't enjoy this, but the final, ""big"" payoff wasn't anything new or special. The strangest thing of all this is that people found this to be a masterpiece. The film is placed in the top 250, which it only deserves a high six or low seven. But if you enjoy Michael Bay films, this is your piece of pie, although it is messily put together... <br/><br/>5/10."

","Great anticipation. Great cast, terrific writer/director. What could go wrong? Plenty.<br/><br/>I suppose the challenge of presenting the The Avenger's assembly was a thankless chore. So much needed exposition, the Marketing Department's requirement to wow audiences, the pressure in creating a summer blockbuster. And that's the issue; a blockbuster was concocted rather than a film with heart in the tradition of the Marvel-Film. (Or any film with damaged characters.) The first 30 minutes are a slog. The last headache-inducing in much the same way the noisy Transformers films were (Transformer's action being the template for the coda of ""Avengers"").<br/><br/>Mr. Whedon forgot to truly assemble these divergent superheroes. Tossed off one-liners do not replace or exemplify heart and truth. Instead, we lurch, uncaring, between sequences: this one belonging to Iron Man and Captain America, the next Hulk and Thor. Ms. Paltrow must have enjoyed a (multi) million dollar pay day for a few minutes of screen time. Mr. Hiddleston becomes tiresome in a one-note part. In a lapse, Ms. Johansson bears no trace of Russian accent. (Guess Rosetta Stone should be congratulated.) The amazing Mr. Renner (with two pages of dialogue, tops) is simply a placeholder, as is Thor, whose continuing grudge with brother Loki is toothless. Missed opportunities all.<br/><br/>There are a few bright spots. Mr. Ruffalo as both the troubled Banner and Hulk, and the unforgettable Mr. Downey whose attitude is enough as he delivers the best lines. Forget the rest. They're interchangeable and disposable.<br/><br/>Yes, it is fun and top notch in FX. So what? Any big budget, FX driven film lays claim to those same superlatives. The result here is a disappointment. Maybe Whedon should resurrect Buffy.<br/><br/>Maddeningly, way too much but not enough, much like the coterie of villains in ""Spiderman 3"" where Peter Parker's struggle to own his responsibility is lost in the noise. Mr. Whedon is not the first director to lose sight of story in whiz-bam-boom, and here he's not sure-footed in the execution. Maybe Avengers II (pre-sold with the Skrulls) will be better now that we (kinda) know more about these assembled superheroes.<br/><br/>Technically, the 3D showed a few seams: grainy and indistinct. This seems part and parcel of conversion in Post rather than in capturing in the format.<br/><br/>There's no sense asking you to pass. You've probably already seen it. Dissenting voices are few, but please carefully consider before reflexively braying, ""IT'S GREAT!!!"""

"judywalker2","6","5","18","5 May 2012"," Another mediocre superhero movie
","I couldn't wait to see th Avengers. I thought that it would be on the same level as the Iron Man movies, Thor and Captain America. Sadly its more on par with the two Hulk movies instead. I have to admit that I am a fan of superheroes but I really wasn't into the Avengers as the cartoons contains too many whiny characters, well the movie is no different. There is too much preaching by Nick Fury, Captain America is too angry (angrier than the Hulk in fact), way too much Tony Stark and too much exposition about science that we really don't care about. The only characters that really shine on screen are Black Widow (wonderful kick ass fight screens, woman with power without superpowers), Hawkeye, Thor, Loki (until he starts getting boring) and Agent Colson. Joss Whedon usually knows how to temper his characters better but in this movie he really put together some awful dialog. Yes some of the jokes were funny but in between there were long periods of just boring stuff. It's too bad I know this will make a lot of money but it could have been so much better. It could have been a real classic but instead its not worth viewing more than once."

"ashleynwaldron","10","3","9","11 December 2014"," A great movie
","Firstly... For all the viewers complaining who aren't comic book fans, and don't like comics... What did you expect? It's a movie based off of some of the most popular comic characters in Marvel Universe. That's the point.<br/><br/>Now, I'll admit, there's not a lot of surprise. Not a lot of twist, or plot. It's a character driven superhero film. Not about the great twist, or the psych thriller. That's not its purpose. It's not meant to be a movie to make you thing, or to shock, stun, surprise or terrify you.<br/><br/>We enjoy comics for one reason: they're fun, and good characters. I mean, think for a second... Imagine X-Men without Wolverine, Gambit, and Rogue. Imagine reading about Hydra without Captain America. What makes comics great isn't just the story, or even mostly the story. It's the characters.<br/><br/>The Avengers pulled together a great cast of people who lived and breathed their characters. Robert Downey, Jr. gets most props, but I didn't find any of the Avengers to be severely lacking. Even Scarlett Johansen as Black Widow pulled the part off fairly well.<br/><br/>So yes. Plot? Simple; some might even say childishly so. Plot twists? Absolutely none. Worry about characters dying? Of course not, they're the good guys. An ending we couldn't see coming? Nope, everyone knew going in that the Avengers would win.<br/><br/>But it was a good, simple movie, with great characters. And honestly... I enjoyed the change of pace. This was a movie anyone could watch. My 6 year old son loves it, my 45 year old father loves it, and even my 65 year old grandmother watched the entire thing with the family, and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>So yeah, if you're looking for twists, plots that make your head hurt, something that makes a 'statement' or fights for a 'cause' you will be disappointed. But if you're looking for a good family film with great characters, a lot of laughs, some serious moments, and some really cool gadgets? This is the movie for you."
"siddarthrao244","5","3","9","11 December 2012"," Ridiculously overrated....
","The only reason I walked into the screening because of its ridiculous hype even by the most trusted critics beyond that even the featurette or trailers did not interest me at all. I felt like I watched something out of a kids happy meal and if we are going to expect movies like these in future receiving undeserving acclaim and astounding attention, then I guess it is indeed an offense of naming and giving out Razzberry awards. As I would believe that there are movies with poor reception to be actually highly underrated. The movie starts off with a lousy science experiment at one of the S.H.I.E.L.Ds lab where a portal opens up allowing Loki from an alternate universe to pop in and to begin with his agenda of destruction and dominance. In response to the threat the director of S.H.I.E.L.D Nick fury opens up the Avenger's initiative which has all the super humans or superheroes to team up for you know what. The movie is a cocktail of a lousy plot, poor acting( except for Robert Downey Jr whose presence in the film made it tolerable to some extent). Worst of all it was Samuel l Jackson in his role as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick fury. I seriously had a problem of tolerating his presence on screen with his unethical portrayal of his character. He only wouldn't be the sole perpetrator, as everyone else(except for Robert again) also portrayed their respective roles like they were starring in some sort of parody of the original. Praise would go to the visual effects and the action sequences which I don't think it is much of a giant leap for mankind in the present date with a good budget of 250 million!, well of course hats off to the animators and sfx designers who did an excellent job to save the sinking boat, at least making it an visual spectacle. The movie is strictly for kids who would certainly enjoy it. So if you are thinking of spending some time out with your kids for the weekend . You won't disappoint them"

","Honestly, maybe it's better to go watch some cartoon series The Avengers or read some comic books about them, then watch this movie!! So much flashing scenes, flat and undeveloped characters, dull conversions that after half of movie you really start think how can someone glorify this piece of c**p! Only good thing is surprisingly solid performance of Cobie Smulders and Tom Hiddleston and really good last action fighting scene (even if it's unconvincing and completely transparent), that I luckily didn't sleep over. General observation was be that this kind of blockbusters must have really great and very well elaborated scenery that will naturally lead watcher from individual rampage to team assembly of world greatest heroes (The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon series showed how to do that in just 90 min). Hulk is completely lost, Captain America is to plastic, Iron Man is working his daily shift, Thor looks like some intruder on private party and Nick Fury is completely clueless what to do, but still everything turns up fine. To funny and unconvincing scenery in combination with pail looking main characters can only outcome with disaster called The Avengers!"

","I have seen ""The Avengers"" twice now. I really wanted to like the movie and after seeing it for the first time, I didn't quite like it, so I gave the movie a second chance to absorb myself more and found out that my first Judgement about the movie was quite right.<br/><br/>The Avengers has some awesome special effects (just like every other movie these days Transformers, Battleship, Darkshadows etc). There are a few scenes in particular that I liked in the movie :- + Black Widow's introduction was quite amazing + The Fight scene in the S.H.I.E.L.D Carrier was intense and amazing + The Final Fight Scene is truly breathtaking and heartwarming too (psstt you know what the Iron Man does) Almost the rest of it was quite Formulic, bad guy tries to take over the world, brings the army, Avengers are assembled and huge intense action scenes.<br/><br/>I really wanted the characters to interact with each other more and get to know about each others strength and weaknesses. I also would have loved an intense plot with maybe a twist to surprise us in some way. I am really hoping that they take the criticism of the movie made by the fans at heart and improve on everything what they did here.<br/><br/>I still have high hopes for The Avengers in there next movie and I am really hoping that I would get to give it at least an 8 or a 9 the next time around.<br/><br/>P.S I saw the deleted scenes of the movie, they all fitted quite well and added more to the story, don't know why they decided to take it out."

Jeremy Renner and Robert Downing Jr saved this film. Renner is a top notch action star in the making. That aside, the Avengers is beautiful to watch, great effects, decent story but the ending was lame compared to the build-up and, having watched how Christopher Nolan realistically and magnificently does his Batman movies, this isn't even a close second to them for me."

","It so happened that ""The Avengers"" has quite naturally and comfortably occupied the box office throne. It almost effortlessly managed to get to the very top and join the selected company of such distinguished titans as ""Avatar"", ""Titanic"", ""Harry Potter"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".<br/><br/>In addition to the dazzling box office glory, ""The Avengers"" is enjoying an unprecedented public love of epic, almost unhealthy, flirting with obsession proportions.<br/><br/>Currently ""The Avengers"" confidently occupies the 39th position among the best movies of all time on IMDb ‚Äì higher on the list than ""Citizen Kane"", ""Alien"", ""American Beauty"", ""Vertigo"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Once Upon A Time in America"",""Amadeus"",""Some Like It Hot"", or ""Gone With The Wind"".<br/><br/>The reviewers on Netflix are ecstatic and gush with admiration: ""This was the best super hero movie ever! It had a great plot, and I enjoyed it incredibly!"" ""It has heart! It has humor"" ""Not a dull moment. The cast did an amazing job"" ""I loved this movie. It was fantastic"" ""This movie was amazing! All of the heroes were excellent"" ""The truth is that you can't scream enough praise for this movie""<br/><br/>¬ÖAnd in the middle of all this euphoric madness, in the midst of all this frenzied rage, in the epicenter of all this outrageous triumph of the mediocrity produced by the never staying idle, overworked Hollywood assembly lines, we can barely hear a few sane, sober voices saying in a childlike amazement ""Wait a minute¬ÖThe Emperor is naked!""<br/><br/>Yes, despite its colorful, glaring clothes mostly made of special effects, ""The Avengers"" is almost completely naked: there is no story, no good scenes or dialogs, no acting (because there is no substance), no core, no depth, no intrigue, no tension, no mystery, no heart, and, yes ‚Äì no humor.<br/><br/>What is called humor in ""The Avengers"" does indeed have one positive component in it: there is no bathroom jokes so common in the modern comedies. No one is burping, vomiting, breaking winds, showing naked buttocks, doing any other indecencies or saying any other obscenities. Unfortunately, the humor in ""The Avengers"" has also a negative side: it is very primitive and quite unfunny.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""The Avengers"" are impressive, but chaotically purposeless, and not breathtaking or intelligent or deeply symbolic as in ""Avatar"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>The amounts of an exciting action in ""The Avengers"" are vast, and the density of the movie stars would make any blockbuster jealous. Nevertheless, those looking for anything more than a liberally seasoned with primitive humor collection of sloppily connected action sequences and special effects will be utterly disappointed.<br/><br/>However, judging by the box office success of ""The Avengers"", nothing else is at all needed... A bunch of the familiar from childhood pathetic cartoonish super heroes cheerfully kicking butts of a little less cartoonish, but still pathetic villains and almost effortlessly but incredibly heroically saving the world in their spare time is just enough to make most movie goers extremely happy.<br/><br/>There is nothing mysterious about this - after all, the most popular restaurant in the world is not a restaurant with the best food, or the most famous and skillful chef, or the nicest location, or the most elegant atmosphere, or the most exquisite wine list.<br/><br/>The Emperor of restaurants is McDonalds ‚Äì a familiar from childhood good bargain with standard, very basic, not very healthy, but at the same time very addictive menu.<br/><br/>Those highly praising the story, the acting, and all the other non- existent components of ""The Avengers"" become like a patron, who after visiting a local McDonalds would suddenly blurt out something like ""What an elegant atmosphere we enjoyed when we visited McDonalds last time! The waiters were so attentive! The menu was so intriguing! The food was of finest quality and don't forget about the location ‚Äì the nicest in town!""<br/><br/>The hard truth is that whereas in my hypothetical example with McDonalds everyone understands that the patron talks nonsense, most of the moviegoers will not notice a striking discrepancy between the cheap, unimaginative fast food action they see on the screen and all the high praises that ""The Avengers"" receive¬Ö<br/><br/>Indeed, Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

For this to be #34 in the top movies of all time is shameful. I'm sure many people can think of 250 movies that're far superior to this one.<br/><br/>The acting itself was fine, although it did seem a little awkward at times.

","I remember the Avengers comic books from when I was a kid, a while ago. While this movie is not perfect, it does catch the spirit of the comic book quite well. The characters are drawn like they are supposed to be because there is not a lot of emotional stuff in comic books (except the love triangle of Archie, Betty & Veronica.<br/><br/>This movie takes a talented cast and puts together the story of a threat from Odin, another world no less. It does not really get to showing what Odin looks like, but it does have a couple of big time residents from that world, one good and one evil, that the fights center around.<br/><br/>There is some light comedy which is always needed to break up the action. A particular comedy blackout scene is Thor and Hulk beating up some bad guys. Then when the bad guys are done, Hulk and Thor are standing together and suddenly Hulk punches Thor out.<br/><br/>There is some confusion about bringing everyone together to wage this battle. Some of the battle sequences get a little muddy which is why I can't give this movie a perfect rating. All in all, it does well enough. This Marvel film holds up better than some of the early ones in that the action is spaced with pauses at the right times to refresh the viewer. To me the original Iron Man had this problem, so much action in the latter half that the mind went numb.<br/><br/>As for the women, well tight leather on well rounded women always goes over well in my mind. The only woman not in leather is Starks girl. Still there is something to be said for the imagination a tight leather outfit can bring to the screen. Helps the pg rating too. I was able to stay awake for this one which says something too.<br/><br/>I will not ID the entire cast here as that has already been done. What I am amazed at is the way the movie entertains without 4 letter words, much like the comic books of old. This is very much the traditional Saturday Afternoon movie that a whole generation was brought up on before face-book, cell phones, and all the change took place."

","The Avengers is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a magnificent cast. This movie is certainly what all Marvel fans have been waiting for, it's been building up since Iron Man came out in 2008, and despite all the hype it actually did not end up being even a little bit disappointing. Cast members reprising their roles continue to shine, such as Robert Downey Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson, but even the new members deliver great performances, such as Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo, without a doubt the best Bruce Banner to date, I hope to see him do a solo Hulk movie soon. It looks absolutely beautiful, Joss Whedon was the right choice to direct, it seemed like a messy concept bringing them all together and trying to focus on each character individually, it would have been hard to make it work, but Marvel did it right. An amazing ride from start to finish, the Avengers is the movie superhero fans have been waiting for, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure. <br/><br/>Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk and Black Widow are brought together by Nick Fury to form a gang to protect the world from Thor's brother Loki. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr."

Its definitely a light-hearted movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>It loses some points for basically being too oriented for a kids audience, it was not really my kind of movie because its almost like a Disney theme park ride, and simple minded in a sense.

"tomb_92","8","3","9","10 May 2012"," Essentially a dumb, loud, explosive action film, but a dumb, loud explosive action film done well.
","I had my reservations about Avenger Assemble for a long time- it is not my sort of film. The only previous films in the saga I saw before this were Iron Man (which I didn't like) and Captain America (which I did). What made Captain America for me was that it was interesting that is was set against the backdrop of world war II, and the redeeming feature of Iron Man was the witty dialogue between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. So the task is, how do they make a film with all of these stars, with so much back-story, set in the modern era, without it turning into Iron Man 2.5 (which it does in places), that lives up to the MASSIVE hype? Let's face it, since the film has been building up people's expectations for that long and with so many huge stars competing for screen time and the best dialogue it was never going to be anything but a little bit of a mess. What it is though is an enjoyable mess. They don't go down the route of the Transformers films (Revenge of the Fallen in particular) and just spend 2 hours making 2 dimensional robot characters smash each other up. Avengers Assamble is enjoyable because of the characters involved. It is to its advantage that the back-stories for most of the main characters have been established already, it means that we can just get on with the film and not spend to much time discussing the wherefores and the hows. It is also good that despite having only seen 2 of the previous 5 films I was able to understand perfectly well what was going on the film. The story is very simple and not at all confusing (unlike Transformers ROTF) and requires very little thinking. If you do take anytime to actually think about the film it is clearly just a ""slot A into tab B"" affair- very predictable and formulaic- but if you take it for what it is and enjoy the ride it is very entertaining. It is the characters that make the film. Unlike the Transformers films the characters are all unique and well rounded. They all seem to have their own part to play (apart from Black Widow, who aside from looking good and being the token female seems to have nothing to do and no real superpowers). It does turn a little into Iron Man 2.5 at times, after all it is clear he has the best powers and Robert Downey Jr. is the biggest star so it is hard not too. Some of his lines do get a little less witty and a little more silly at times but it is never really too much of a problem. Each character does have their part to play and it was interesting watching their interplay on screen. The film as a whole was nothing more than a formulaic affair, going from confrontation to confrontation without much to link it together, but this is not really a problem. It relies heavily on special effects, which is OK since they work well in the context of the film. The final huge CGI fest that was the end battle was done very well, with each character getting a similar amount to do (with the exception of Black Widow) and it was consistently interesting (unlike the climaxes of the Transformers films which were just dumb smash 'em up's for an hour). I do take issue with one thing though- a tiny amount of CGI in the climax battle was quite poor (Scarlett Johansson flying on the hover-bike thing)- almost unforgivable in a film that relies to heavily on special effects and which has such a big budget. The actors do a great job, for me Mark Ruffalo stealing the show with his unhinged, unstable Banner, though Tom Hiddleston was great too. It is this that makes the film so watchable. Without such interesting characters the film would just be a big dumb mess. In the end the film is nothing more than formulaic but a very well done formulaic film. The director Whedon clearly knew exactly what he was doing at every scene of the film. I think it is very commendable that with the amount of hype surrounding the film and the number of stars competing in the film that he has formed anything other than a complete mess. When it comes down to it Avengers Assemble is an enjoyable film, made so by the characters and the actors portraying them. It is very funny at times and surprisingly never boring. It's not particularly clever but it know's how to appeal to a wide audience and fans alike and it is an achievement."

","RATING: See it in theaters (Rating System: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the instant download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the half-brother of Thor has returned to Earth to pave the way for a wave of destruction at the hands of evil aliens. But secret agency S.H.E.I.L.D has been preparing by analyzing the mysterious Tesseract ‚Äì an blue-glowing cube of unharnessed infinite power. Loki steals the Tesseract and it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of S.H.I.E.L.D to pull together a team of the world's first super heroes to defeat Loki and return the Tesseract from whence it came. The heroes are known as The Avengers and they are Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>The Avengers is a recipe for disaster. It is an ensemble cast of players, each of whom is a third magnitude star in his (or her) own right. Whenever you get this many egos in the room at one time, there is bound to be in-fighting. And in fact, this is what happens in the movie. The heroes can't get along. They jockey for alpha-male status, only to find that they are equals, each with his own unique strength. And yet, both on the screen and in reality, they find a balance. Each actor brings his own ingredients to the mix. And each actor plays his (or her) character to perfection; as if it were their own film.<br/><br/>Another problem is backstory ‚Äì there is a lot of it. Some of these characters have been brought to the collective consciousness in their own debut films of the last couple of years (Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and Captain America). If you've seen their films then you have an idea of who they are already. The other two needed a bit more introduction and it was skillfully interlaced with the action.<br/><br/>And then there's the problem of interaction ‚Äì 6 main players plus Fury and Loki implies 28 different relationships. And that's a hard act to pull off in just 142 minutes.<br/><br/>Still, writer/director Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Serenity"") pulls it all off with apparent ease. The story is relentless in its pace and still fills us in on who the characters are and what they contribute. There's an amazing scene when the characters are at their lowest point (close friends are dead, the team is dispersed) and they expose each other's weaknesses. The souls of our heroes are left bare. This gives us nowhere to go but up.<br/><br/>And indeed, up we go. To beat their combined foe, the team must pull together: each member using their special gifts to turn back an invading force.<br/><br/>But as amazing as the film is, there are problems. The last climactic scenes are a series of improbable battles in the heart of New York City. Mind you, these battles are carried out with much more precision than the garbage whirlwind of the Transformers films. But, due to the PG-13 nature of the film, we find little bloodshed and a lot of tumbling skyscrapers.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with the film: just how strong are these super heroes? Hulk, besides being hulking, is apparently impervious to direct bullet and missile fire. Captain America can apparently withstand the full force of alien hand grenades. Iron Man takes a licking and keeps on ticking. And Thor, with his mighty hammer seems to be able to stop anything, but still goes flying when monsters whip their tails. And for the other two (who remind me of the Professor and Marianne from Gilligan's Island ‚Äì ""and the rest""), when there is a battle they are sent off to do reconnaissance or direct traffic lest they be trampled or crushed. They may be more of a liability than they are worth.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to talk about the unsung hero of the Marvel universe: Stan Lee. Lee has a cameo appearance in every Marvel action movie. He is held as sort of the progenitor of modern hero lore. As such, he is a special icon in the comic book (and now movie) realm. All legends spring from his fount. There is a name for that kind of hero ‚Äì they are called gods.<br/><br/>So, for outstanding story, characters, special effects and an amazing ""boot"" (not even a reboot) of a new franchise, I recommend you see it in theaters."

It's the film you were all waiting for, the story and narrative go hand in hand with the other movies, and even if you haven't seen the other films, it's a fun movie on it's own.<br/><br/>The great thing, the best thing about the movie is that all the characters have equal time and story given to them.<br/><br/>Granted, Iron Man/Stark, gets the best lines and is the needle in everyones side, but everyone is given something specific to do which makes them standout (Cap Telling Hulk to Smash etc.).<br/><br/>But as always in films as grand as this, you find yourself asking, who was the best and who was the weakest.<br/><br/>Hulk, in my opinion was the best thing in this, because he worked in this, by not being too in your face, and also by having the two funniest scenes in the movie (one involving Thor, and one involving Loki).<br/><br/>Johanssen is sadly the weak link here. She is good, but spends a lot of the time looking scared of Banner. The rest of the characters are good, if not better than they were in their standalone film (most noticeable Cap, whose movie was the weak link in the Marvel universe, more than makes up for that film here).<br/><br/>Remmer and Rufflo are great additions, and Hemsworth is as good as he was in last years movie.<br/><br/>Irt's easily the flagship film of the year, and the one to beat for sheer spectacle and anticipation, and Whedon has given us an epic movie, which has amazing action, a witty script, and a lot of heart.<br/><br/>It's fanboy heaven, a crowd pleaser, and frankly, awesome..."

","Just came back from the screening of the Avengers and I liked it! One of the two things I was scared of is if the movie would give equal importance to all the characters(since this one has a lot of characters)meaning some characters get under played and others get more time on the screen but that never happened. The movie was well paced as well.<br/><br/>Another thing that I was skeptical about is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, I was kind of hoping that Ed Norton would do the character but that did not happen.

Hulk/Bruce Banner ( Mark Ruffalo ) - The unstoppable Force / the Green Rage Monster - oh my: what can i say here - Mark Ruffalo is the best HULK, he ties the absolute HULK: TV's Lou Ferrigno, who gives his voice to the big guy this time ( as he did in all HULK ,,Solo,, movies ). CGI work on HULK is absolutely Fantastic. I feel that Ruffalo plays the clumsy but genius professor Banner better than the others before him ( Eric Bana / Edward Norton ) and this time THE HULK can SMAAAASH ( 4 real ). Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is a nice addition to the Avengers Team ( he had a short appearance in THOR before ), i feel that he is a bit of an outsider in this one, maybe not that much screen time, but overall he just fits in nicely. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) finally we get a peek in her story outside of the Avengers, she does that catlike fighting that we loved in IronMAn 2, she has some psychologically gripping moments in this one that i loved even more than the fight scenes, nicely done. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has a dominating presence in this one - we finally see the mastermind / spy / agent finally in work, and he works his ,,magic,, well. Clark Gregg as Agent Caulson is back and he brings not only the comic character but the bad-ass Agent with a ,,punch,,. A nice addition is Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill. Last but not least: Tom Hiddleston as Loki the main villain - Thor's brother ( ,,he's adopted,, ) - He is the absolute villain, played so amazingly by Middleston that he levels the the other characters in each and every aspect, he just balances the movie out - some of his scenes are fantastic.<br/><br/>Now to the movie - i guess i can call it the best Superhero Team movie of all time. If u are not familiar with the other MARVEL movies u will not feel like an outsider, this is a Superhero Movie on it's own and a fantastic one. The pace of the movie does not feel to fast and to slow either, script and dialogues are all in place. The Movie has some of the most hilarious comic scenes ever put in any action ( or even some of the recent comedy ) movies, the synergy between the main characters is perfect in any way. Some of the fight scenes will blow you out of your seats, i had some moments that i really wanted to just jump up - or rewind and watch again. Every character has his moments ( or a few great ones) the team-fight scenes just take this to a whole new level. The CGI and FX are just what we are used from Marvel movies, and even upped a bit in this one. Set designs and costumes are also high quality, the design of the HELLICARIER, the MAcH7 suit is fantastic, i really liked Loki's outfit as well. Sound and Music department also did a great job, Alan Silvestri delivered again, the music really captures the mood of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally The Pro's: The assemble cast. The character interaction. The Hulk. Black Widow interrogating Loki. The SMAAASH Moments ( a lot of them ). The after credit scene. The Con's: 1 thing - this is not a 3D movie - it has it's moments but if u can avoid watching it as 3D u will not miss a thing.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5 / Fan-boy Rating 9+"

","While this is a perfectly decent movie, it certainly is not the 10 out of 10 some people seem to think it is worthy of, a victim of the over hyped build up by the studio maybe. To be frank, I found all the Avengers themselves lived up to expectations, but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore. The truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited, no matter how well they play their roles. The Dark Knight is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the super hero genre(so far) and the Avengers doesn't come close. Sorry guys I know I will have offended a few Marvel Maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you look deep enough within yourselves, The Dark Knight is one of the best films of all time, the Avangers is not, plain and simple. Worth watching but not worth the wait. Iron Man/Captain America are at least equally as good in their own right."

","I chose to watch this movie because it got a great score here on IMDb, but (like many others said) that must obviously be fake (paying people to vote or just paying to raise the score directly?).<br/><br/>I add a score on just 1 star to make the average more at level with what the movie deserves (around 5-6 stars). It does it's job of showing super heroes fight with lots of special effects, and nothing more. You don't develop any bond to any character. You know exactly what will happen and you know no hero will die. If they did die your reaction would just be: ""huh.."", because you didn't develop feelings for them anyway."
"robsta23","9","2","5","9 May 2015"," Definitely One of the Best Marvel Movies
","It is amazing various directors or filmmakers in general were collaborating to bring together a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to this movie. Never have we seen a good live- action movie with this many superheroes. The only superhero movie better than this one before its release was definitely The Dark Knight, but this is a film that is much more fun and exciting.<br/><br/>In the very first few scenes with Black Widow, we understand the film will have a very comedic tone to it while staying true to the action/adventure formula. I've only seen this film a few times, but every time I do I find myself smiling a lot, especially in scenes with my favorite avenger - Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. pulls the role off perfectly for every film involving Iron Man - even in the not-so- good Iron Man 3. If all this great comedy wasn't in the movie it would be a fest of eye-candy at the end and that's about it, which is not what I look for in a movie.<br/><br/>In the scene where all of the avengers are arguing with Fury, I feel like Stark and Banner could have accessed the information earlier and asked about it, and in that way they could have avoided the feud all together, but I guess this movie needed tension of some sort. It is also a little unclear if Loki manipulated their thoughts since his intention was supposedly to have the avengers tear each other apart from the inside.<br/><br/>If people are going to complain about this movie being clich√©, guess what - it's based on comic books. These types of films are meant to be fun and exciting, even if that means reusing formulas for action films. If the movie serves its purpose, it is a good film, and The Avengers' purpose was to entertain."
"alexxxhamilton","10","2","5","9 May 2015"," Awesome. As in awe-inspiring.
","I never would have thought this film would have been that good. Before seeing this film, I couldn't have given a flying monkey about superheroes (except for Spider- Man and Iron Man), but when I saw it, a new world opened up.<br/><br/>I caught up with the rest of the MCU and I went to see the even more impressive sequel on its first day of release, April 22. The action at the end was awesome, even though I don't think it was the highlight, especially since the Chitauri were quite incompetent. I was genuinely frightened for Black Widow when the Hulk was chasing her, and whilst the Avengers were arguing in the helicarrier I wanted to shout at the screen and yell: ""Get away from the Bruce Banner!""<br/><br/>Visually, it was stunning, Phil Coulson's death was tragic, and Tony Stark's one liners were great. ""Ah, finally! Someone who speaks English."" ""Wait wasn't his first name Agent?""<br/><br/>Nick Fury was great. You can see he doesn't trust the Avengers, especially Tony Stark. Black Widow felt a little too human.....but she fantastically outsmarts Loki. Tony Stark was......his usual and the ending clearly shocked him. The Hulk was also great: Bruce Banner embraces and fears the Hulk. Hawkeye....was really cool but we see so little of him. Captain America felt....weak because that's what he is next to some of the other Avengers, but he is the honest man trying to do what's best. He nailed the role so much that when I saw Chris Evan's as the idiotic Human Torch, I couldn't believe it was the same person. Loki was a really evil and likable villain, only that he stops feeling like a threat once he leaves the helicarrier."

"peterhill-84900","7","2","5","8 March 2015"," The Avengers! Earth's Mightiest Superhero film?
","The Avengers is the sixth film in what I consider to be a reasonably impressive series of movies. We start off with an intense opening that had me on the edge of my seat until the opening logo popped up showing it's beautiful face. The opening provides us with a decent explanation of who the bad guy is and what needs to be done to stop him. In this case, the villain is none other than Loki who's popped down to Earth because he wishes to rule it. Well if he can't have Asgard, there's no reason Earth should be any different right?<br/><br/>I appreciate how Joss Whedon managed to take the time to introduce each member of the Avenger's separately. The dialogue between Natasha (Black Widow) and Bruce Banner is a particular favorite of mine, it's fun but without going off track and becoming silly. We see Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans) doing the one thing he knows, go to the gym. To me, it's understandable to take out any stress on a punching bag whilst also probably being the only place he's familiar with.<br/><br/>Twenty something minutes in and we finally see Tony Stark and once again he shines, his humor and wit is fantastic and he works great alongside Gweyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) and the lovable Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). <br/><br/>Needless to say, the acting by all is brilliant in this film. No one made me cringe or hope they got struck by lightning just to stop them from acting. Which brings me to Thor played by Chris Hemsworth. The guys massive here and I totally brought that he was the god of thunder here. His first interaction with Iron Man and Captain America is breath taking and visibly stunning, because you know, every superhero has to fight one another. <br/><br/>This leaves me with the final Avenger. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Boy, was he wasted in this movie. I don't mind he was mind controlled, but did he really have to have a pathetic twelve minutes of screen time????<br/><br/>I would have forgiven this if he'd at least took on the Avengers, it would have been a nod to how brilliant the character is and would have been a middle finger to all those who thought he was lame. But no, I was not pleased with his offensively small amount of screen time. <br/><br/>I'm not just giving it a 7 out of 10 because of my issue with Hawkeye. To me, it doesn't have that ""watch again"" vibe going, I find myself ignoring the movie and going for something else to watch. Maybe it's the humor that at times, begins to irritate me. The whole ""That man's playing Galaga, he thought we wouldn't notice, but we did"" scene caused me to roll my eyes, was it necessary? No. Another reason is none of it really stands out anymore. <br/><br/>Yes the action scenes are fun to watch but nothing in the movie really makes me go ""Wow!"" every time I watch it, except the opening sequence. I'm not saying I find it boring, but I just don't care if Hawkeye is jumping off a roof or Thor's sharing blows with the Hulk. <br/><br/>Needless to say, is the movie bad? Absolutely not. It's a movie that is fun for everyone, the acting is spot on and the visuals look stunning. It's just not my most memorable movie in terms of scenes and the humor isn't all that great."

The avengers shows the potential of growing bigger and better things, and with this step in the movie I believe that no matter what they do with the future Avengers movies will come out better if not just as good as this one. During the movie I was wondering where Loki's scepter ended up because we don't see what happens to it after New York. I would also like to point out thanos in the after credits and how they Will eventually have a thanos movie with the infinity gaunt just like in the comics.

","Such an amazing movie . Can't wait for the next one ! I have got to say one of THE best movies I've ever seen.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible."

","Josh Whedon was very articulate in the way he shot this film. I believe that with so many characters coming from different films, that he did a great job of introducing all the characters and keeping them entertaining through out the film. The acting was great, and the script made the characters come to life. I know that a lot of work went into the design of the HULK and other C.G.I. characters and objects through out the film. Me, as a designer myself, really enjoyed the effort into the film that was placed. Keeping the audience entertained with that many characters can be really difficult; and Whedon did a great job with keeping all the characters in character and making the presentable in a good fashion to the audience. Over all the film was incredible and I enjoyed it!"
"Ceruleanveritas","6","2","5","9 November 2014"," About The Avengers
","I just watched the movie and don't have a whole lot to say except that I thought it was almost all style and no substance. Yes, the picture/visuals was beautiful, special effects amazing and action sequences engaging, but ultimately for me at least, there wasn't a decent story to bring it all together, so what's the point? Also, where is the real suspense in a fight when nobody can be killed? All the Avengers and even Loki were either immortal or at least seemingly invincible, so after a while it felt like watching an endless fight that no one could win. Just a bunch of fighting and explosions for no real reason except to watch something ""exciting"" happen.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a little critical and demanding when it comes to movies, but if I'm going to invest my time, especially when it's 2 hours and 20 minutes of it, I want a little more than what I got with this movie. This was basically perpetual action providing mindless entertainment. Oh yeah, and of course a bunch of beautiful people running around in costumes. Again, all style and little substance.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, that's my two cent summary. Hope it was worth it to you.<br/><br/>Cheers"

It was a long journey but the end justify the means and it was epic! it was awesome!"
"Spondonman","7","2","5","26 July 2014"," Literally a block-buster
","It's yet another glossy Marvel fantasy which seems to divide opinion ‚Äì so I think it's one of best average films I've ever seen. It's entertaining, noisy, violent, and you just know who's going to win; mind you, New York was left in ruins yet again. The Marvel plot should run that New Yorker's should just leave everything as it is to save time for the next alien foul-up. Can the producers re-use any of the cgi cartoon conflagration scenes to pad out the next movie?<br/><br/>Bad god Loki forcibly gathers a force around him in order to take over Earth and get one over his brother the good god Thor. Meanwhile in the growing chaos Samuel L. Jackson is responsible for assembling a force of superheroes to save the planet: Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and eventually Hawkeye. It's a shame Capt. America didn't get his moments readjusting to life in the 21st century, I. Man's slappable whimsicality was reduced, Hulk sure had some fun in his far too brief meeting with Loki, Johansson looked just as serious and good with her kit on. Personally there could have been more room for character interpolations and plot and less building-crunching battle at the end, but I suppose that's what appeals more to the kids. But I must admit that in the thick of it I was wondering where was Popeye and could he have polished the baddies all off a little quicker than this lot. And fancy a future US government signing off the building of a mammoth flying aircraft carrier ‚Äì with teleportation maybe just around the corner the whole concept of travel ‚Äì and battle ‚Äì will be altered. I came away almost impressed at the style over substance brazenness of the film itself but very impressed with Tom Hiddleston's smooth performance as Loki; maybe an Eton education helps perfect acting with a cold heartless demeanour.<br/><br/>I loved the after-credit ending section tying back in to the plot, and although if stripped of the cgi it's pretty simple fare I enjoyed it. Not a bad nor a great film - even if compared to Battleship; but it's barmy and just lively and fast enough to suspend belief for two hours. And it does what it says it's going to do on the shield."

I just wonder if such a technology was used properly. Until the end the whole system and everyone seems to be just acting to support some story which was terribly boring. none of the intelligent mind can grasp it positively. Everything was so much made up that it feels as if it was made just to maintain a length until the fight scenes can be filmed. Its terrible that the producer even invested in such a weak project. The effect with hulk are the main attraction. most of the characters in my opinion degraded their image as a superhero during UN-REQUIRED fight shots.<br/><br/>For me this was a super enjoyable movie but i would love to see it using forward button.

I watch it over and over again, but I never ever get tired of it! This movie is absolutely one of the best, especially with Robert Downey Jr. He makes it seem that this movie is a comedy! I laughed so hard the first time that I almost cried. I especially liked it when Dr. Banner turned into Hulk and was shot by an airplane. The bullets didn't do anything, and the pilot kept saying, ""Target angry!"" I also laughed when Hulk went flying off the airplane. Thor was so dramatic, but I could totally see where he was coming from. You kind of want to throw a hissy fit when your own brother is trying to destroy Earth. Wow, the fighting scene was actually interesting and had a point to it, unlike the Winter Soldier. I explained that in my review for the Winter Soldier. Definitely not as good as the Avengers.

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","9","2","5","3 April 2014"," Avengers Assemble!
","The Avengers has it all. And then some. Six superheroes for the price of one ticket: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow and the Hulk. It's also the blockbuster I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. Joss Whedon, in his second film that he's directed, stages the most exultantly good-humored, head-on, rousing series, as well as some interesting character interactions and development between our heroes.<br/><br/>The plot works in a simple way. The world will end if Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the banished demigod, has his way. Loki hates his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and lusts to destroy Earth with help from an alien army. As head of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has one recourse: bring in the Avengers, a group of paragons with a rep for not playing well with others.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. still seems blissfully right as Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man (there's a disarming tickle in his portrayal). He mocks the costume of Captain America (a canny Chris Evans) and calls the World War II hero an ""old man."" The captain wonders what's under that iron suit, sparking a priceless Downey deadpan: ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" <br/><br/>But Downey doesn't hog the spotlight. Hemsworth's giant-size Thor gets big laughs dismissing his comrades in arms (""You're all so tiny""). And everyone gets to show their skill sets, including Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), the expert arch¬≠er, and Natasha, a.k.a. the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a killer in gymnastics and martial arts. Johansson has a terrific bit dispatching some Russian goons with her hands literally tied behind her back. Even Phil Coulson has a few moments here and there that really shine in the film.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo is the newcomer to the team, replacing Edward Norton and Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the nuclear physicist with anger issues that turn him into a hulking green rage machine. While I did like Bana and Norton as Bruce Banner, in my opinion, Ruffalo is the best Hulk. The reason for that is because he really plays the character like someone who's gone to Hell and back again on a daily basis. And that is how the character should be played: as someone who is cursed with this power. The computerized unjolly green giant is a jumbo scene-stealer. And it's hard not to cheer when Hulk wipes up the floor with Loki.<br/><br/>Fanboys, here my roar: this film is awesome. The first two acts are built up for character interaction and revelations, while in the final third, when Whedon lets it rip and turns the battle intensity up to 11, all your senses will be blown. I have one word for The Avengers: AWESOMETACULAR!"
"david-dtn","7","2","5","5 February 2014"," Overrated but worth a watch
","Avengers was completely over rated in my opinion and for many reasons. The four main characters were great Hulk, IronMan, Capt and Thor but the rest were just there to provide filler and the two assassins Hawkeye and Blackwidow had way too much screen time especially Blackwidow played by Scarlett Johansson. She is in almost every scene and is a really poor choice for this role in my opinion. I could think of a handful of actresses who are more deserving for this role than Johansson and put that with the fact she is is the weakest of all the actors in the film and you really begin to grate at the sight of her. As far as the look of her character black widow i would say she is no where near what she should look like. In all of her fight scenes she looks non atlethic and you can clearly tell when the stunt double fills in for her. Her fight scenes were laughable and really brought the rest of the great cgi fight scenes down. The second half of the film drags a bit with a lot of the Chitari henchmen being used as cannon fodder for our heroes and are are dispatched so easily you would wonder why there were sent in the first place as most of them are incompetent or just plain stupid! Its a solid enough film just let down a lot by Johansson and Jeremy Renner who was used as filler since the cgi fight scenes between the Hulk, Capt, Thor and iron man must have cost a pretty penny and they obviously felt it was too much of a risk to over spend in case the film bombed. Its a pity because it could have been a lot better without the unnecessary padding."

"tareknabulsi","6","2","5","10 December 2013"," The Mark of A New Generation of ""Good Films""
","The Avengers falls nowhere short of delivering a fiery and action packed roller coaster ride of explosions. The movie spends its time passing on the spotlight to each avenger, showing off his or her unique ways of dominating enemies and overcoming hazardous obstacles. Seeing all of our favorite superheroes unite under one common enemy is an exciting thought and was inevitable from one day working its way into a movie. Having an army of superheroes to save the world from utter destruction isn't always a bad thing, but for a film, sometimes less is more. <br/><br/>While The Avengers offers many good fighting scenes, special effects, and cool futuristic gadgets that make your head spin, the fundamentals of a good film are simply lacking. The main problem with this movie is it's plethoric cast of superheroes. There are way too many to center on at once. As hinted earlier, the movie focuses too much on showing off each character one at a time, constantly switching the audience's support from one to another. Throughout the movie, there is a constant struggle for dominance between each avenger that involves boasting, smack talk, bouts, and interferences. Pretty soon the audience is divided up rooting for their favorite hero, and the whole idea of the main villain is dropped completely! <br/><br/>The story is simple and clear: kill Loki. Scene after scene however, that mission is forgotten by two or more of the avengers trying to display their macho-ness to one another. Unlike many great movies, this plot line is drastically linear and bare to the bones in meaning. In the midst of the film, I thought I was watching an intense WWA match from the future. Six superheroes is just too many for one movie. The filmmakers did a good job focusing on each hero, but that is all they had time for. I can't help but think, if they only had two, maybe three main heroes, they would have had enough time to develop a more interesting and meaningful plot. <br/><br/>Decades ago, we saw for the first time great and innovative movies like Star Wars, Terminator 1 and 2, Platoon, Alien, and (just last decade) The Dark Knight. All of these films were able to focus on several main characters, villains, and a storyline that were all intricately tied together and saturated with meaningful and thought-provoking ideas. In light of The Avengers' wide and warmly welcomed reception, it seems that the standards and expectations for ""good films"" has switched to a more dry and corny interpretation. All The Avengers truly has to offer is wild action scenes, interpersonal conflict, and imaginative applications of special effects. These assets however are known for never having the capability of elongating a films success and keeping it in the fond memories of its viewers. Movies like Star Wars, which originated in the 70's, lacked horribly in intense action, and animation, but the qualities of a good story and its creativity keeps it so popular to this day. Other examples of movies that only glimmered for their achievements in animation are ones like Avatar, which was quickly forgotten because it lacked a fundamentally solid story to remember. <br/><br/>The Avengers is merely eye-candy that satisfies Marvel fans and audiences seeking captivating fight scenes. It is more appropriate to label this work a collection battle animated scenes rather than an actual movie."

I also liked the development of some of the less well known characters and links made to other Marvel Movies. There is also a great deal of humour to add another depth to this immense movie. All I can say is, very well done Joss Whedon! A very,very good movie, I cannot wait for Avengers 2 in 2015!"

","The best film ever. Mark Ruffalo had some doubts, but he aced Bruce Banner. I mean, the special effects were awesome and I loved the plot. Joss Whedon combined the two best genres: action and comedy and he made an epic movie out of it. The type cast was relatively good. My favourite character has to be Iron Man as of all his gadgets. It was very clever how it began with the Avengers hating one another and then they had to put aside their differences and avenge humanity. In my opinion, the best part was the Battle of New York. I loved how everything flowed from one hero to another. It was action packed and the film had a great climax. It was awesome how in the credits, Thanos revealed himself. A perfect conclusion to Phase One of the saga. I cannot wait for number 2."
"J_Force","8","2","5","23 June 2013"," The Best Super Hero Movie Ever
","This movie is an epic adventure for everyone. If you've been waiting for a bunch of super heroes in one movie your dream has come true. I was really impressed with the action in this movie, i was also impressed with the background music as well. The story to this movie was the way it should be and making Loki the villain in this movie was the perfect choice. This has got to be one of the best action movies in history. It was also pretty hilarious watching all the reactions the hulk made to all the characters,especially when he grabbed Loki and tossed him like a rag doll.I think iron man was the most exciting thing about this movie. If you watch the extra ending of the movie you will find out that Thanos might appear in the avengers 2 that is coming out in 2015. It will also have you looking forward to the guardians of the galaxy movie coming out in 2014. Overall its an awesome movie."

","The Avengers(2012) was an awesome movie, saw it in theaters with my dad and my brother, all of us loved the movie I liked the post-end credits scene with Thanos, I hope he will be the villain for The Avengers 2 coming in 2015, It is my top 3 movies of 2012, It is one of my favorite movies, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was awesome 10/10 on him, Mark Ruffalo was a very good Bruce Banner/Hulk but Norton was better, I'll give Mark Ruffalo a 9/10 on his 1st role as The Big Mean Green Guy, I like the part when Hulk just beats the crap out of Loki when Loki kept on saying stuff and then Hulk says after he's done beating him up""Puny God"". It was one of the most anticipated movies of 2012 it was just awesome if you haven't seen it then rent it or buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray, Just see it it's AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"hinckleychris","10","2","5","5 April 2013"," A very positive review
","The first thing I have to say is that this is definitely a positive review. The Avengers is one of my personal favorite movies. I find the plot, the acting, and the action to be excellent. I find the idea of a ""superhero"" to be at once romantic and enticing. <br/><br/>Probably my favorite part of the movie was the dynamic and engaging characters. Loki functions very well as the primary antagonist, showing his very ideological views early in the film. A majority of the movie is spent focusing on The Avengers as people, however. All of them are extremely different. Tony Stark/ Iron Man is extremely cocky, Bruce Banner is quiet and studious, and Steve Rogers/ Captain America is the natural leader and soldier type of the group. Hawkeye and The Black Widow add another dynamic to the plot. A large amount of the movie is comprised of the characters attempting to form a team, which in the end they do.<br/><br/>My other favorite part is obviously the great action scenes. This film definitely does not run short on the action. When The Avengers work together, they show that they can work very effectively as humanity's last stand. The first fight on the flying aircraft carrier is nothing short of epic, and it also shows them that they can't beat Loki without becoming a team. This teamwork is demonstrated in the final fight scene in New York City, where we get to watch The Hulk destroy hundreds of alien soldiers alongside the rest of The Avengers.<br/><br/>A new trend seems to have sparked up in the last decade or so. Live action superhero movies and superhero shows are becoming more and more mainstream and insanely popular. Every member of The Avengers has a blockbuster movie behind them (Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 1-3, The Incredible Hulk, etc.). I think that we love these movies because it gives us a world we wish we had. A world where good always beats evil, where the heroes and villains are clear, and where individuals can make a huge impact for the good of everyone. I believe that The Avengers gives us this world and I love it for doing that.<br/><br/>In the end, I believe that The Avengers is a great movie. Josh Whedon, Stan Lee, Zak Penn, and many others brought us a great story about how super heroes are people too. For me, this movie has no major flaws. The comic relief, action, acting, and overall themes just work really well for me. I can't wait for the sequel!"
"Sisiutil","9","2","5","12 January 2013"," A movie that shouldn't work, but does--remarkably well
","Full disclosure: I'm a big Joss Whedon fan. Buffy, Angel, Firefly, even his comic book efforts (Fray, Buffy Season 8)--I've loved them all. Even so, like any Whedon fan, I know he's capable of disappointing us (most of Buffy season 6, Titan A.E.), so I didn't approach this film without some reservations.<br/><br/>Even with the very talented Joss at the helm of this movie, you see, it still shouldn't work. Consider the following impediments: First, there are too many characters involved (six Avengers, three S.H.E.I.L.D. agents, and one villain, just for starters) to do justice to them all; Second, Whedon has really only been somewhat successful on television (Buffy, etc. had more of a ""cult"" audience rather than broad mainstream appeal) and less so on the big screen (Serenity was a flop); Third, in the finished product, there are a number of plot ""conveniences"" used (Thor is able to visit Earth despite the end of his own movie making that impossible, the Hulk suddenly gains control and is able to direct his rage, the alien invaders die when their mothership is destroyed, etc.) And yet, it all works, and works very well indeed. For that, I give credit mostly to Joss Whedon (surprise, surprise) who not only directed but also co-developed the story and wrote the screenplay, and also to the extremely talented cast.<br/><br/>As a long-time Whedon fan I can tell you that all the best things about his previous successes are evident here. The Avengers works because Whedon is extremely talented at writing for ensemble casts. Buffy, Angel, and Firefly worked BECAUSE each had a large cast, not in spite of that fact. It's the characters' relationships that matter, and the conflicts that arise between them even though they're on the same side. Thus, we get a fan-boy wet dream three-way fight between Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America early in the film that is completely logical. The tensions between the disparate members of this would-be team threaten to tear it apart--which is why the spectacular action finale is so rewarding, because it's the fulfilment of the desire we've had, as an audience, to see these characters come together. (The best moment in that final battle is a brilliantly-shot sequence that follows one Avenger to another as they work together to fight the alien invaders. It isn't just great action, it's the fulfilment of their collective characterization; the action has emotional heft, not just spectacular visuals.) While none of the characters really have a major arc (that would be too much to expect in a film that is, as I've asserted, fully loaded already), they do each get significant minor ones: Stark challenged by Cap to show that he can make a self-sacrificial play; Thor nobly, perhaps pathetically still trying to reach a remnant of goodness in his wayward brother; Black Widow struggling with the memory of atrocities she's committed; Nick Fury desperately looking for a way to make this dysfunctional group come together as a team; and so on.<br/><br/>And while we do get some early action sequences, the most rewarding scenes leading up to the big climax are, perhaps surprisingly in an superhero blockbuster, the character moments. As expected from Joss, we also get a lot of witty banter and great one-liners. But all of that is in service of building the characters and, more importantly, their relationships with one another. The actors deserve extra credit because in a film packed with so many characters and so much action, they have a relatively small amount of time to make their roles shine. Several moments stood out for me: the tension between government-man Cap and iconoclast Stark; Stark encouraging Banner to cast aside caution and contribute in the most powerful way he can; and especially that marvellously tense scene between Black Widow and Loki. (Isn't it interesting that although we first saw Black Widow in Iron Man 2--a film where, arguably, her character had less competition--we learn more about her and what motivates her in this movie that has so much else packed into it? Full credit again to Joss; his fans know how fond he is of strong female characters. She's even the one who really saves the day in the end!) We also get something else that Whedon fans are familiar with: a straightforward, easy-to-understand plot. Loki, the bad guy, wants to rule the world; with the McGuffin... er, tesseract... he can bring an alien army to earth to achieve that goal. The Avengers have to stop him or, failing that, fight his army. After so many blockbusters--especially superhero movies (Superman Returns, anyone?)--with convoluted plots, it's a relief to see one with such a simple story.<br/><br/>Other people involved in the film also deserve credit for its success. Seamus McGarvey is one of the best cinematographers around, and his talent is in abundant evidence here; the special effects are extremely well-done; and Alan Silvestri's score is epic and stirring--precisely what's needed for a film of this scale. All of their contributions come together in that thrilling ""Avengers Assemble"" scene during the final action sequence, when our heroes are standing together in a circle, facing their enemies, a team at last.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films in the superhero genre--up there, in my opinion, with the original Superman, with X-Men, with Spider-Man. In some ways it may be even better than those predecessors because, as I asserted above, it had so many more challenges to overcome to be successful. It works because, underneath all the action, this is a film with heart, with character, with humanity; a film about how seemingly incompatible people can come together for a common goal."
"brando647","10","2","5","24 December 2012"," A Major Win for Marvel, Whedon, and Fans
","Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have accomplished something that I never thought would've been possible. I am giving this movie a perfect rating and, yes, I'm aware that it is not the greatest film of all time and I recognize that it is not without its flaws. But it is a fantastic summer action movie with some of the greatest comic book action we've gotten so far in film and, when you really think about a movie with the scope of THE AVENGERS, this movie could've failed in so many ways. But it didn't. It amazed. It was beyond fun. It was an excellent finale to what Marvel has come to refer to as ""Phase I"", which means we can expect to see more story lines and characters overlapping in Marvel Cinematic Universe and it's made me so freakin' excited to see what the future holds for Marvel's film franchises. The movie begins as we see S.H.I.E.L.D. in possession of the Tesseract from CAPTAIN America, experimenting in the possibility of unlimited clean energy. Unfortunately, the Tesseract has attracted the attention of Loki and whatever dark forces he's bargained with. Loki has plans on using the Tesseract to open a portal to another dimension and bring war to Earth with aspirations of enslaving the human race. Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are in over their heads but, thankfully, the past year has introduced a series of superheroes that might come in handy in just such a scenario: Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America. But can these super-egos work together toward a common goal without imploding on themselves?<br/><br/>The odds were against this movie. There were so many reasons this might not have worked. Ensemble movies can be difficult, especially when you have a ton of stars and beloved characters to juggle. Every character needs ample screen time to justify their existence in the film and give each fan a chance to enjoy a hero moment with their favorite character. In addition to all of this, I was concerned that the villain for the film was a weak selection. Loki was the antagonist of 2011's THOR and, while this is only my opinion, THOR was the least incredible of the first phase of Marvel movies. Loki worked within the scope of that movie but I wasn't sure he could carry a movie of this size as the primary villain. Yeah, I was wrong. I thought Tom Hiddleston had done a great job in THOR and he pushes his character a little closer to crazier here. He's an ample villain for a first time teaming of these heroes and, for the final battle, he calls in more than enough reinforcements to give us the epic action we expect when you bring these four heroes to the big screen in the same movie. Joss Whedon is one of the few who could have pulled off an AVENGERS movie as well as he did. The man knows how to juggle a large cast and give everyone a chance to shine. He even manages to give Black Widow a healthy role while bringing Hawkeye into the mix (somewhat).<br/><br/>If you're at all a fan of Marvel's movies leading up to this point, I'm all but sure you'll be satisfied with THE AVENGERS. One of Marvel's biggest strengths has been finding the perfect cast and directors to bring their heroes to life. Now we get a half dozen together at once. Robert Downey Jr. steals the spotlight for the majority of the film but, seeing as how Iron Man is the most established and a guaranteed crowd favorite, it was to be expected. Chris Evans continues to prove he was an ideal choice for Steve Rogers, and Chris Hemsworth is still the perfect God of Thunder. One of the biggest surprises was Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I was a bit upset when it was revealed that Ed Norton wouldn't be reprising his role, and I thought Mark Ruffalo was an odd choice to replace him. But, man, he was great. Seriously, I hope he jumps into the character in the same way Hugh Jackman's embraced Wolverine. He's a great Banner and an even better Hulk, easily the best version of the Hulk we've had at the movies. The special effects in the movie are great, the battles are epic, and we even get a few hero vs. hero fight sequences that they knew we'd be itching to see. The Incredible Hulk battling Thor? I'm in.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum, my complaints are few and far between. The movie keeps a great pace, only slowing down once near the middle following the massive Helicarrier sequence. The alien menace (I won't reveal their identity on the off chance someone reading this hasn't seen the movie yet) were nothing more than cannon fodder at the end but it made for a fantastic battle. Other than that...? Yeah, nothing. There's a lot I loved about this movie. It was a great culmination of everything we'd seen building in the previous movies. The chemistry between the cast/characters was great with a budding friendship between Stark and Banner and a bit of a rivalry between Stark and Rogers. There's a lot going on and plenty of action to keep the pace rocketing through the nearly 2.5 hour runtime. THE AVENGERS was a major victory for both Marvel Studios and comic/movie fans."

","Loki opens a portal to steal the tesseract right from under Fury's nose while converting two of Fury's sidekicks to his cause. He plans on opening a giant portal so that aliens can invade the earth and he can become the ruler over earthlings.<br/><br/>Fury starts the Avenger initiative. Get all heroes, superheroes, semiheroes together to save the planet- even though his council doesn't agree entirely. So we get the scenes of these guys being recruited for the mission- as usual for heroes, against their will. There's Iron Man and the Hulk and their normal selves, some Russian agent chick, Captain America, and even Thor shows up.<br/><br/>For more than an hour they fight amongst each other as is required of movie characters these days. But they do capture Loki in the process. Oddly he seems to want to be there. They realize he's up to something and the Russian chick is sent to find out what that is. It turns out to be rather underwhelming. Now Loki's people attack the flying aircraft carrier where everybody is. That forces these goofs to join forces and get serious.<br/><br/>Loki escapes, opens the portal, aliens attack NY, the avengers respond and have to find a way to close the portal. But Fury wasn't entirely honest with them. He's up to something.<br/><br/>Everything goes pretty much by the numbers. Loki is the star here by far. Of the heroes, Downey's character is the only somewhat memorable one. He manages to be a bit funny, cocky, but not too arrogant. Renner is pretty intense and interesting. Thor is likable. The other's don't do a whole lot. Jackson as always plays himself, or rather a caricature of himself. Why does he still get hired? The Avengers isn't as awesome as Thor nor as awful as Captain America. It's somewhere in between. Your standard summer blockbuster with serious CGI carnage a bit too reminiscent of some Transformers movie. We clearly don't need to see another movie with giant alien worms destroying skyscrapers, please. Whedon did his work and saved this from becoming some crappy Michael Bay clone. The script and dialog are alright. The whole idea just doesn't work all too well for me. All these ridiculous heroes-some human, others superhuman, others CGI, together. At least when it's all and said and done it's somewhat exhilarating but about 40 minutes too long. Intros are fine but we don't need that much of an intro let alone the obnoxious bickering amongst the main characters."
"Strife405","9","2","5","19 November 2012"," Another Amazing Marvel Movie
","For the unfortunate enough to have not seen this movie, Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"", be prepared for a few hours of comedy and suspense. A classic Marvel film at the hands of Joss Whedon and you're in for classic superhero action, humor, and thrills. If you're one for large character development, going into the minds and psychological aspects of each character, this movie may not be for you.<br/><br/>The story starts with the secret organization S.H.I.E.L.D. experimenting on an energy source known as the tesseract. Before long, Loki, who is essentially the main villain in the film, comes to steal the energy source to raise an army. It's at this point that S.H.I.E.L.D. Director, Nick Fury, forms The Avengers.<br/><br/>We see a few familiar faces in the Marvel franchise such as Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, Captain America and Black Widow. It feels a bit lacking for the amount of superheroes has under their belt but what can we expect without waiting another five years for each individual hero to have their own film.<br/><br/>Many familiar faces as well as some fresh new ones come into play of the film. It isn't the first time we've seen the witty antics on Robert Downey Junior play the billionaire playboy Tony Stark and I'm sure it won't be the last as he pulls it off so well. Each scene with Mr. Downey Junior contains jokes and wisecracks at those around him such as his scene in the ship where he points out the man playing Galaga in the background, or jabbing at Doctor Banner, played by Mark Ruffalo, for turning into ""a giant green rage monster"". We see other major names such as Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, and Jeremy Renner. Each actor/actress doesn't fail to give good presentations of their character but there's always room for improvement. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow character doesn't seem as intimidating as displayed in her comic book versions but still a different look and feel for the Russian assassin. All in all the performance in my opinion was exceptional except for the few ticks that don't seem to fit for some characters.<br/><br/>After the initial formation of The Avengers, the main focus for the next hour is for them to find their resolve and eventually gain each other's trust. Using the death of an ally as a stepping stone to stop Loki, all their problems with each other were overlooked. Eventually, the last half hour of the film was used in the fight scene against Loki's army, the Chitauri, and The Avengers. In the end, everything is about the way it should be for a superhero movie, where the good guys win and another enemy ready to pounce.<br/><br/>In terms of sound effects and special effects, Whedon and the Marvel crew knows precisely what it takes for a superhero movie. We're taken from a flying battle fortress to a ruined downtown Manhattan under the attack of an alien army known as the Chitauri. The visual CGI is stunning and everything looks about as real as you can touch them. Although not quite as suspenseful as in theaters, the sound of each punch, background noise, and even the clarity of conversation between characters give you a sense of reality and a feel for actually being Another thing that was a bit of a personal let down was the lack of minor details. If you haven't seen each of the movies related to the characters in this one, then you're a bit lost on each of the personalities and backgrounds of each hero. Each hero is given perhaps a 30 second explanation or subtle hints on their whereabouts and relationships before the film. Another such detail was the fact that in the end of Thor's movie, the major issue was the fact that he could never return to Earth again. When making The Avengers, the detail seemed overlooked with no explanation just to fit another superhero.<br/><br/>It's easy to overlook the minor things to get the full pleasure out of this film. It's a classic good vs. evil superhero movie that most audiences can enjoy. You get to see your favorite superhero come to life again to take down another threat. It's very highly enjoyable and a good action/adventure film. I would recommend this as a film to watch."
"kennyparpart","10","2","5","19 November 2012"," why Avengers is a great movie
","Do you know what is better than one super heroes defeat a few enemies? No well I will tell you, a group a super heroes defeating thousands of enemies, that is why The Avengers is such a great movie. It is also amazing because it is the greatest team of super heroes every assembled, not just by Marvel but, all comics every created. This movie had a unique way to tell the back stories of the heroes, instead of just cramming all that information into a small part of the movie and making so you only got part of the story instead, they made prequel movies for each of the heroes expect for Hawkeyes which his back story was in Thor, Nick Fury which back story was in both Thor and Iron Man and Black Window which her back story was in the Iron man movies.<br/><br/>This movie is what comic book fans have been waiting for, for years, finally a movie with Marvel's greatest heroes Captain America, the Hulk, Black Window, Hawkeyes, Iron Man, Thor, even Nick Fury is there to lead S.H.I.E.L.D and almost forgot about Loki which makes appearance as the bad guy like always. Not only does this movie have greatest possible actors playing super heroes like Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, it has awesome special effects. Also this movie has great action scenes in fact, most of the two and half hour movie is action but, along with the action there is a lot of humor all throughout the film. This movie is possibly the best super hero of all-time best because of the perfect mixture of humor and action that all movies should have.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is two and half hours long which is a pretty long for a movie but, it never seems like you are seating and watching the movie for ten minutes because it is so action, humor and suspension. If you compare this movie to any other super heroes movie, it makes them look bad because of the great job the Directed Joss Whedon did on the movie mixed with the brininess of Stan Lee the creator of the comic books making it a great movie for people of all ages. Also the studio said they were going to make another one a few days after it came out so, I am not the only one who thinks this movie was great."
"estrimpfel","10","2","5","19 November 2012"," One of the best superhero movies out there today
","If you're a fan of comic books or superhero movies, then The Avengers by Marvel will surely not disappoint. Watching the movie three times myself, I each time have liked the movie more and more. Compared to the blockbuster superhero movies that have come out in theaters in the summer of 2012, this movie seems to top Spider-Man and Batman simply because of the cast of superheroes that are present in this movie. This movie seems to put together the best of the best superheroes for a one big hit movie. With the names of The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, this movie compares to an all-star game of athletes in any given sport. In comparing the movie to other movies by Marvel, this movie stands out in a good way. This movie adds more action and more punch lines than a comic book nerd could ever dream of. In terms of putting the superheroes together, The Avengers does a marvelous job. The Avengers is essentially a sequel to Thor and Captain America, taking elements from each movie. After Loki gets exiled from his home planet of Asgard as seen in Thor after attempting to rule Asgard, he seeks out to rule again. After Captain America gets unfrozen, he is seen working out when Nick Fury stops by. Nick Fury is the man responsible for recruiting and putting together the Avengers. At first, things are shaky as the superheroes' egos clash rather than mesh together. This is easily done by Loki, shifting the attention away from him and onto personal attacks against one another by the Avengers. The constant bickering between the superheroes could have a negative impact on the audience , but it doesn't diminish the movie as a whole. In the movie, the characters don't seem to have changed from their own movies, although Iron Man learns the value of working with others. Joss Whedon is one of the best directors in the film industry and this movie proves to be one of his best big screen productions. This movie sets the bar for superhero movies as none in my experience of watching superhero movies has come close to matching it. Marvel and DC Comics will have a big challenge ahead of them when they come out with new movies because any that doesn't match The Avengers would be a disappointment."
"Megan-Clear","Null","2","5","18 November 2012"," avengers and their team work
","The Avengers Since we can remember, there has always been that one person who we always looked up too. That person we believed was our hero, the one person who would always run to our rescue, whenever we called upon them. It wouldn't matter what the situation was; unfortunately as the years pass our hero's change. We become to know the real definition of a hero and our deception of them changes, a hero, which is a person, typically a man, who is admired for courage or noble qualities. Such as the character or characters in a book, play, or movie who have these noble qualities. Throughout the movie the Avengers, we learn that being a hero is not the easiest thing, it takes a lot of courage, time, hard ships and team work to accomplish the most impossible. As we see, when the heroic team, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, and Thor is reunited on the ship for the first time; tensions were high as we expected. They all had a different plan and understanding on how to defend their world and to take down Loki. Their inability to come together and be a team at first is a major factor is their main source of vulnerability and the outcome of Loki being five steps ahead of them. It isn't until one of their own is killed by Loki; that they actually become the Avengers. They put all their differences behind them and finally suit up to stop Loki from taking over their world. The courage each of them has to sacrifice themselves in order to make sure our world is safe is indescribable. The unstoppable force that forms when they all put their special talents and gifts together are unbreakable, their allegiance to one another is their upper hand to taking down Loki. In their finale desperation is stopping Loki and closing the portal, the viewer's get a glance at what a little bit of team work and courage and a passion for something can get you. Their team work got them to close the portal, each Avenger's courage is the reason they saved the world. And finally, their passion and pursuit to stop Loki was their unbreakable bond formed throughout the movie. Overall, the movie The Avengers, was not only made to show the comic story of the heroic team stopping Loki from taking over our world but also to show everyone what team work and courage can get you in life. You don't have to be the smartest or the strongest but if you have a big heart and a strong passion for something, don't let anyone stop you from achieving those goals. Even if it maybe you saving the world from an evil villain."

","Envision the Marvel Universe as a gigantic spider web. At the center of this web-- where multiple, independent strands combine lies Josh Whedon's, The Avengers. Marvel hits the big screen once again in this blockbuster of a film that unites six heroes' to be the Earth's last line of defense against a common enemy. Lead by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), hero's Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) are brought together to stop Thor's adopted brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, from releasing his army of alien soldiers on Earth while wielding the power of the Tesseract. <br/><br/>Loki plans to use the power of the Tesseract, which first appeared in the Captain America movie as the driving technology behind the bad guys, to open a portal that will allow his fleet of extra terrestrial militia to invade Earth. Early on in the movie Loki uses his scepter to take over the bodies of Hawkeye and Dr. Erik Selvig (played by Stellan Skarsgard, who first appeared alongside Natalie Portman's character in Thor). So it is up to the rest of our hero's to free their friends and defeat Loki.<br/><br/>While collecting our hero's we see that getting them to work as a team is proving to be difficult. On paper, it seems like the Avengers Initiative would be awesome. But between Starks narcissism, Nick Fury's secrets, and the Banner's temper it is hard to imagine how the Avengers Initiative could ever work. The lack of cooperation between the hero's purposefully adds to a more intense build up to the turning point in the film with the movie poster shot of all the hero's standing together.<br/><br/>If you have seen any of the five lead-in movies to The Avengers (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America) you might have notice talk of the Avenger Initiative in these films. Though, it is most prevalent in the Iron Man movies. I think Marvel did a great job of taunting the viewers with tiny and not so tiny hinting of the Avengers movie before it came out. Personally I think that is why the movie did so well‚Äîit was the anticipation had by superhero fans for this film¬Öthey knew it was a long time coming. The only thing I didn't like was that Spider Man did not make in appearance while Loki was trashing the New Yorkers back yard. Other than that, terrific movie!"
"arthurrunning","9","2","5","15 November 2012"," A for Avengers
","From the very first scene the Avengers was exciting, funny, and kept viewers intrigued. It had a very affective beginning which is important when trying to get people interested. I think it did a good job of updating us on what the Avengers were about and where they come from. For example, they talked a lot about Captain America's past which helped to fill people in that may have not seen that movie. Something else I want to commend is the lightly serious tone that was set. There were very serious issues going on and like many movies, the characters used a lot of technical terms that the average movie goer may not understand. However, they did a nice job of not making the film so serious. They added humor in all the right places that kept the movie from becoming too slow. The first time I saw this movie in the theater, people were literally laughing out loud. You don't really expect that from a hero action movie. I was also very impressed with the realistic aspect of the film. You could tell this was a very big budget film and not a single penny was wasted.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch. Chris Evans did a great job acting as an ""old"" man who was very impressed with all of the technology. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner had a great chemistry that made their roles very believable. Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson) was a breath of fresh air as he portrayed an agent unlike many of us is used to seeing. He also did a great job of making a character that was easy to fall in love with which is why the Avengers wanted to avenge him. Robert Downey Jr. once again proved he was the perfect choice for Iron Man aka ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" Tom Hiddleston (Loki) wasn't the usual villain but he did a great job. Finally, the one that claimed everybody's attention was Mark Ruffalo(Hulk). He captured the title as most memorable performance by far and excited little kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>The climactic fighting scene in New York lived up to expectations. It wasn't drawn out too long and it kept viewers on the edge of their seats. They even added another conflict on top of the conflict with the bomb that was heading for New York City. My one complaint about this movie was the predictable ending. I'm not saying I wanted Iron Man to die but it would have made the movie so much more realistic had he not made it.<br/><br/>The Avengers movie had everything you could possibly ask for in a movie. It had romance, drama, action, and a ton of humor. I give this movie an A and I can't wait until the sequel comes out."
"northcutt10","10","2","5","12 November 2012"," The Avengers is a home run........
","First and foremost I must confess that I am not an authority on Marvel comics nor can I tell you whether or not Joss Whedon's adaptation holds true to the history behind each character. What I can tell you is that I am a super hero movie junkie. I am a sucker for enticing action sequences and if things get blown up along the way even better. In The Avengers you get that and so much more. The whit and humor behind each of these characters is spot on and I had no idea I would laugh so much in a movie such as this.<br/><br/>If each of the lead in movies such as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are base hits then The Avengers is a home run. While you don't necessarily need to have seen each of these movies to understand the basis behind The Avengers it certainly helps. You not only get an understanding as to the characters themselves but you already have a feel for the tension and teamwork to come. The only Avenger who does not have a plausible movie franchise built behind them is The Hulk. (I am in no way taking into account the deplorable 2003 and 2008 attempts at taking on the franchise).<br/><br/>One of my favorite roles in the previous movies as well as The Avengers was that of Agent Phil Coulson. To me he was the heart of the team. He unabashedly believed in ""The Avenger Initiative"" and with a straight face delivered some of the best lines in the movie. While mocked at times its Agents Coulson's death that ultimately brings the unwillingly Avengers together.<br/><br/>The first twenty to twenty five minutes of the movie are used as a set up letting us know that the Tesseract (an energy source) has been stolen by Loki (brother of Thor). Nick Fury, Agent Coulson and the Black Widow all disseminate to pull together the main players, Tony Stark, Captain America and Bruce Banner. With that the Avenger initiative is an initiative no more. In the remaining 114 minutes Thor joins the action as well as Hawkeye returns just as we and the team witness the afore mentioned death of Agent Coulson.<br/><br/>It's been noted that Paramount spent around $260 million dollars to make The Avengers. I have no idea what percentage of that went towards the salaries of the cast but it was worth every penny. Thanks to Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth we already have a connection to the respective characters that they embody. Add to that illustrious mix of Mark Ruffalo, Scarlet Johansson, Tom Hiddleston and Jeremy Renner and you can see why I unabashedly love this movie. No amount of special effects can make up for a bad cast and thankfully in The Avengers we never have to worry about that.<br/><br/>Pulling together all of the essential elements from the cast, action sequences, movie score, and last but not least the writing Joss Whedon gives you the ultimate movie experience. I have watched this movie at least fifteen times and never bore of it. One would think that after a while the scenes would get methodical but I still get excited. (it helps that the score by Alan Silvestri sets the pace perfectly). Do yourself a favor and set aside a couple of hours and prepare to be amazed and entertained."

","The Avengers is a dream combination of some major super heroes. It is what you can expect out of a Marvel comics movie. It has some good action(largely thanks to The Hulk), and a few moments that will make you smile (Few involving Stark/ Iron Man). However more emphasis seemed to be on these 2 characters and the other characters sort of fell behind. The movie had the potential with so many superhero characters. It could have done much more and could have been even better. Having said all this, it is a one-time watch at least.<br/><br/>Not enough to deserve an 8.5 though.<br/><br/>Good but not that great."

","Aside from The Dark Knight Rises, this was probably the most waited movie of the year, was it the movie of the year? No, but it was still fantastic. Up there, there's a not very certain rate of this movie, but here's a true review of this movie. The Avengers was not so good as I expected to be, that I can admit, but I still loved it, I admired that Joss Whedon did a great job with the characters screen time, it all had a balance, so no character seems distant, that was a very important element of the movie, and they succeeded at not blow it up, that was a great thing they did. The Avengers is the reunion of Marvel's greatest heroes (Yeah, unfortunately there's no Spider man, well, he's probably only amazing for them and they needed great), so this movie needed memorable action scenes. Well, along the movie, there's some great action scenes, but they can't be compared to what they saved for the end, it was almost 20 minutes of fantastic action scenes, featuring Iron Man (at his best), Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. The special effects were tremendous, as they shoul be and they brought a very significant and pleasunt quantity of humour in this movie, that was really helpful and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Downey once again suits up as Iron Man, and he was amazing once again, bringing to the screen he's amazing sense of humour and smartness. Chris Evans wasn't at Donwey's same calibre, but he was still solid. Mark Ruffalo was amazing as The Hulk, his performance was very solid. Chris Hemsworth fired some good jokes along the movie, nothing more than that, I don't appreciate Thor that much. Scarlett Johansson was amazing and hot here as the Black Widow, which is a really strong character, by the way. Jeremy Renner was too distant, Tom Hiddleston wasn't an amazing choise to play the villain, Clark Gregg was great, Cobie Smulders was a surprise, I was seeing Robin turning into a serious secret agent, oh and L. Jackson was also great with his Nick Fury.<br/><br/>Overall, The Avengers is a great blockbuster, that didn't fail, Whedon's direction made this happening so good. Of course the story isn't amazing, they didn't care about an amazing story, only the union of these heroes. But The Avengers is not a perfect fairy tale, it also has its flaws, like, the long second act that was mostly placed at a submarine and weird enemies that bored he viewer when shown, but aside from that, The Avengers is a fantastic movie, that succeeds at uniting all these heroes together amazingly, it was amazing to seem all work together, The Avengers is not easily forgotten. Highly recommended, oh, and by the way geeks, this is the new geek porn."
"thomasedwardlawrence","9","2","5","4 September 2012"," A thoroughly entertaining action-packed thrill ride with a good sense of humour and a superb cast.

SHIELD set up a team to stop Loki. Awesome fight scene involving robot aliens. Roll credits.<br/><br/>The characters are fun, the story flows well, the action scenes were done brilliantly. The acting was top notch and the jokes weren't forced. Great! Not one major thing was done wrong.

","Before watching The Avengers, I watched Thor, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk and Captain America: The First Avenger. It's not required to watch these movies before watching The Avengers, nonetheless I watched in order to get familiar with those superheros and get the idea where they come from. After watching The Avengers, I'm thoroughly satisfied and I can guarantee that this film is the best of those movies I mentioned. Every moment of this film is quite enjoyable. I liked every dialog of Robert (Iron Man). Actions are elegant. Everything seemed perfect. One thing I'd like to mention that in this movie, I missed Edward Norton as the character of Hulk. However, Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) did great job I admire.<br/><br/>I like the expression of Tom Hiddleston (Loki) in this film but not in Thor. Of course he did better in this film than in Thor. <br/><br/>After all, this is one the best Action, Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen in my life."

","When it came to Super Hero movies before this, I thought that'd I'd only watch super hero movies just for fun with my family. Not even The Dark Knight, as great a movie as it is, got me so excited after seeing it. But after watching just a couple of the Avenger movies leading up before this, I had one thing to say going into this movie, ""Totally Worth It!"" The special effects were Awesome, the action was the best I've seen, and the cast really did a great job. But I think what really made the movie, were the jokes. Don't worry I won't spoil anything. The only reason I'm giving this 9/10 is because I feel the story could of gone a little deeper. But that's just my opinion, I'm just the type of guy that likes long and deep story lines I guess.

"Maleplatypus","10","2","5","23 June 2012"," One more masterpiece from Mr. Whedon - marvelous Marvel
","It is just amazing how this man (Mr. Whedon) turns anything into gold. Although there were some restrains and limits (given characters and all) to this story, Mr. Whedon and all (literally everybody) involved in production of this movie gave their best and made it one of the best American movies in many years. It is, however, a tough job to keep everything in balance (""superheroes"" and other childish and trivial stuff, producers' requests...) but despite of it Mr. Whedon did it again and exceeded by far all my expectations. I must note that he is at his best when his hands are not tied (Firefly & Serenity or Hush from Buffy, for example) and he's given full creative freedom but this movie is really something else. I've watched all the movies with separate characters involved (Thor, Captain America, Hulk and so on) and they were surprisingly good (although main characters only here gave their best). But this... Amazing! So witty, so fun, so close to reality (""making sense"") as it can possibly be, so full of those details that make your eyes sparkle and your brain filling with serotonin. Mr. Whedon knows how to pull out the best from anybody he's working with. Such a rare and precious gift and so NOT Hollywood. Maybe that's why he is so damn underestimated by Hollywood's and television mainstream)<br/><br/>Not only highly recommended but a must see. Again and again."

"filmsploitation","9","2","5","29 April 2012"," The Best Marvel Film Yet.
","Let's be honest. This could have been one of the biggest disasters in (short) history of Marvel film Studios. Too many characters, an untested (for blockbusters at least) director, a raft of egos, a film packed full of CGI effect heavy action... It could have been, shudder, another Transformers 2. Or worse even¬Ö Transformers 3. <br/><br/>And with any other studio it probably would have been. Thank god then that Marvel have once again proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that when they bring their A game, few others can come close. <br/><br/>Marvel have been on a rare run of form that has seen Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and, too a lesser extent, Iron Man 2 all become both critical and commercial successes across the globe. It's fair to say then that The Avengers had some rather large shoes to fill. Well fear not as Marvel and Serenity director Whedon deliver what is probably their best film yet. The Avengers in short rocks. <br/><br/>The story: After a familiar villain returns from exile with an army of disposable bad guys in tow, Shield boss Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) has to do the unthinkable... get a disparate bunch of superheroes to work together to protect the Earth from an seemingly unstoppable invasion. Queue the arrival of the cocky Iron Man, buff demi god Thor, man out of time Captain America and sometime hulk Bruce Banner along side Shield mainstays (and as yet without their own solo movies) Hawkeye & Black widow. <br/><br/>Yes the story is as simple as that. But in honesty the 'why' is almost less important than the 'how'... because Loki's army never really feel like the insurmountable threat they are billed as and therefore the danger at the heart of the film just doesn't exist, but it's Wheldon's handling of his trademark character interplay (never more importantly mastered that it is here) that really makes The Avengers stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>See because if you didn't know (and if you didn't know where the hell have you been over the past 10 years and what the heck have you been watching!), writer & director Joss Whedon was the creator of TV gold such as Buffy, Firefly and Dollhouse (not to mention a host of rewrite credits including films like Toy Story). He became renowned for his expertly drawn three dimensional characters, sparking writing and groundbreaking story ideas. So it's no surprise that the character interplay is by far the strongest part of The Avengers. In part that is because Wheldon's script delivers - pathos, humor, dread. Often in the same scene. That said if any part of this film would work it was always going to be the script. But it would be nothing without the top notch cast all delivering their A game. As usual Downey Jr shines as the ever humorous Tony Stark , but Evans, Hemsworth and Ruffalo all more than hold their own and, naturally, Sam Jackson could be cool reading from the phone booth. This film was always going to rely on the balance of these characters, potentially the films biggest downfall. As it turns out, it's actually The Avengers strongest asset. Even adding the yet only glimpsed at Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) doesn't leave anyone short changed, finding enough space to make these characters feel fully drawn. Watching The Avengers and seeing what Wheldon has achieved, I honestly doubt if there is a director in Hollywood today who could have managed to balance the ensemble cast as well as he does. <br/><br/>That's not to say the action isn't good... far from it. Wheldon puts together some of the best action seen in a blockbuster for some time. Well shot, expertly paced and best of all it isn't edited in that hyper kinetic super quick style that has plagued action films since Bourne & Bay hit he scene. But best of all because these are characters you care about, of actually care about what happens in the action scenes. These aren't faceless robots or badly drawn planks of wood, these feel like real (albeit super powered). Whether it's The Hulk smashing Thor through the bowls of the Shield super ship or Iron Man blowing bad guys out of the sky, the action is clear and often breathtaking. <br/><br/>Villain duties fall to Thor bad guy Loki is there to provide the films big bad and is played with relish by the always brilliant Tom Hiddleston. Cocky, arrogant and dangerous, Loki's interplay with Black Widow, Iron Man & Hulk lead to some of the films best (and often funniest) moments. <br/><br/>Does it have faults? Of course it does. The first hour takes a while to get going (mistakenly leading me to think I may not have been blown away by the film), Loki's army are a bit meh, lacking in reason or real threat with their own power coming in numbers rather than skill and I would have liked to see a little more of Thor. But these are pretty small issues in what is for all-intense and purpose is one hell of an film. <br/><br/>Oh and it would be remiss not to mention that, finally, after two previously flawed attempts someone has finally gotten The Hulk right. Less conflicted then we've seen before, Ruffalo brings a likable but suitably dark edge to a Banner and when Hulk finally does smash he does so better than ever. <br/><br/>So a great script, a superb cast, some of the best action we have seen on the big screen for some time... The Avengers is probably one of the top 3 superhero/comic book movies ever made. All this from a filmmaker who has been mostly ignored or abused by Hollywood for he past decade. In Joss we geeks have always trusted and now secret is out. <br/><br/>www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk"

So after long time I went to cinema hall with my cousin and watched the assemble of 4 superhero Hulk, Thor, Iron man, Captain America to save the world with help of Director Nick Fury and his agents Black Widow and Hawkeye.<br/><br/>As movies starts it is more concentrated to storytelling and linking of the previous movies Ironman 2, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor and Hulk. The first half part is about summoned of these superheroes. Another part is packed with superb visual effects and sound effects also dialogs are awesome. Especially Iron man's dialogs are hilarious and quick witted.<br/><br/>The movie is well balanced with story and action scenes some movies are failed to adopt this phenomenon such as Transformers 3 Dark side of moon and Ghost rider 2 spirit of vengeance. These movies are concentrated to only special effects and lacked in story whereas The Avengers has overcome from this. A mention about Phase 2 sounds like a another part of the Avengers that is part 2. <br/><br/>This is one of the best action movie, watch it in theater that would be better than home.

"Filmaddict94","8","2","5","28 April 2012"," The Avengers assembles mind-blowing!
","The Avengers Review<br/><br/>On Friday 27.04.2012 I dressed myself with my Captain America t-shirt, and went to watch The Avengers in 3D. I was really excited and the movie was mind-blowing. I was expecting this movie to be good, but not as great as it was. I can still criticize it a bit. I think that the way the characters were introduced was mostly good, but I think that the Iron Man introduction was not the best. I think they shouldn't showed Iron Man in his suit. For those viewers who haven't watched any of the earlier Iron Man movies; it would have been better if we saw Tony Stark/Iron Man without his suit. I think it's important that people who doesn't know the characters get to know the human inside the suit. That isn't much of a problem from me, who have seen Iron Man and Iron Man 2. This is just something which could have been a little bit better for those who have not seen any Iron Man movie. <br/><br/>This movie is better than all The Transformers movies, but the same thing is repeated here. The thing that I'm talking about is that a kid is talking about what he saw, and he thinks its super cool and awesome. I've seen this in many movies before and I don't like it much. In reality it would have most likely have been considered a serious and dangerous incident. I don't think any kid would have reacted that way, because kids are smart enough to understand that what was happening was really dangerous. In this story, New York is being attacked from a different place in the universe. They get there through a portal that Loki opened for them. In this story everybody should still have been shocked after they won the war. I really don't think there would be anyone who was talking about it being cool. There is one woman who reacts in a much more realistic way, she was very thankful for Captain America and The Avengers saving her and them all. That is realistic; they should all be thankful, but not talking about it like it was being an action movie. What I mean is that in that situation a kid would be thankful, and not talking about how awesome it was. In this story it was real, and then I think it's weird that the kid is talking about it like it was an action movie. I know that this is a movie, where the main point is to make it a movie that the whole family can watch. I understand it well on the business part, because a movie that the whole family can watch is a movie that gets more tickets sold. They really need to make as much money as possible, when they have so expensive and amazing special effects. Not to speak of the costs of great actors, make up and great cameras. <br/><br/>This is a hard movie to make, and how great it is impressive, there are many great movie makers behind the movie. Joss Whedon have done an amazing job directing this big movie. And Zak Penn did a great job writing the story for this movie, and also did Joss Whedon who's also the screenplay writer for this movie. The movie is an amazing mind- blowing breath-taking experience. I have never seen any superhero movie as amazing in special-effects. The movie has a great cast, with funny lines and you really get afraid if they will die in the fight. Because you like the characters so much, and thanks to the earlier movies you have begun to know them. Robert Downey Jr. is funny as in the earlier Iron man movies. And he plays his character confident, funny, wise and brave. Mark Ruffalo makes the Bruce Banner character a nice and smart person. When he's the Hulk, he is not nice, he is dangerous and wild. Chris Evans plays the Captain America character wise, brave and nice. Chris Hemsworth plays the Thor character confident, god-like, wise and nice. Tom Hiddleston plays his character evil, mad, wise and mighty. He is theatrical actor, who also according to an interview was inspired by Shakespeare's Richard the Third, when he was creating the Loki character with Joss Whedon. The movie is great movie, with good acting. Still I wonder how this movie would be, if it wasn't made to also fit for kids. Movies like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and Watchmen, is great and not very child friendly. <br/><br/>Again The Avengers is still great and I really enjoyed it. It's probably one of the best superhero movies ever made!"

And I was not disappointed. In fact, I was amazed!<br/><br/>The threat to earth is genuine and the action spectacular. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the fact that it combines serious action with sharp humor seemingly without effort. And it is endearing to see very human flaws in the heroes you've come to love. I felt it was a well-paced movie, where every hero got to shine in their own way. Annnnnd I think Coby Smulders should definitely feature more in movies like this one: honey, that outfit was...ehm well tailored. ;)<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this one yet: run (don't walk damnit) to the nearest theatre for an amazingly entertaining 2,5h ride, that'll still leave you yearning for more!"

"TOMNEL","6","4","14","16 July 2012"," It's sort of entertaining, but dramatically uninteresting and shallow.
","These Marvel comics obviously have a lot of fans, and apparently whatever it was that fans (and many non-fans) were looking for in a Marvel film was fulfilled here, explaining the huge internet buzz, the vast amounts of money this has made, and it's current spot in the top 50 films of all time on the Internet Movie Database. This movie does have expensive looking action, and some comedic bits with lots of superheroes, but what it's missing is...pretty much everything else. The plot is uninteresting and quite honestly stupid, and nothing really is driving this story along. At times, to me, it grew boring, because there was nothing to get excited about besides action, big stars and comedy.<br/><br/>After Norse god Loki steals the powerful potential super weapon ""Tesseract"" from the peace keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. agency, and mind controls a few people, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) puts together a team of superheroes known as the Avengers, made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and eventually Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Loki is in cahoots with a group of aliens called the Chitauri, and plans to help them take over Earth. The Avengers must stop fighting with each other in order to protect the Earth...can they do it, or will the Earth be destroyed? (Take a guess).<br/><br/>Director Joss Wheddon, known for his work on television series, does a fine job with the direction when it comes to action. The big action scenes are appropriately frenetic, and they look big and shiny. I appreciated that the action scenes were spaced apart from each other also, as to not overkill the action like the Transformers films. The fighting scenes between the Avengers was a bit overkill however. Half the movie is them disagreeing with each other, or Tony Stark being snarky with everyone. These scenes don't really have anything to them either. They aren't exciting. They are meant to be funny, but oftentimes comes off as more infantile in the humor department than anything else. They further the plot along, only in that the plot cannot proceed until these guys stop fighting. These scenes are supposed to work as character development, but it's almost unbelievable how stupid these guys are, and how unwilling they are to put their differences aside.<br/><br/>The middle of the movie takes place on a ship, with the Avengers angry at each other, and this whole section of the movie just meanders. You could say that this part of the movie gives us the character conflicts and whatnot, which it does, but the Avengers' dislike of each other could have been introduced in something more important to the plot, instead of practically stopping the plot to have these guys get angry at each other. And that's really the movie's biggest problem is the plot. There's never really a feeling of dread, or that something bad could happen, and it's hard to care about anything that's happening. That's not to say watching Tony Stark bantering isn't amusing, or watching Bruce Banner go insane as the Hulk isn't interesting, but nothing ever truly feels at stake. When the film decides to kill off a character to add some level of emotion, and serve as a reason for these heroes to stop their childishness, it doesn't work on an emotional level. It comes off as a cheap way to further along the plot. <br/><br/>The Avengers has some good elements to it. It's got a lot of charisma in the cast, and each character is given enough screen time I suppose. The action scenes are satisfying mostly, and some of the comedy isn't bad (while some does come off as a bit corny and pandering to the audience). The problem is the plot, where the villains never really come off as menacing, despite possessing a super weapon, and a main villain is Loki who is about as threatening as a teddy bear. There's nothing to the film, and nothing to really love about it, unless you are a big fan of these actors, the comics, or explosions. There's very little below the surface of the film, and without a good plot to move this along, we've essentially got one long Avengers origin story. Apparently many have fallen in love with this though, so if you like your movies big, dumb and full of buff dudes, you'll probably like this one quite a bit.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 140 mins. PG-13 for action violence."

"jboothmillard","9","4","14","5 May 2012"," Avengers Assemble
","The Marvel comic book based films have made millions at the box office, and everybody must have been thrilled with a number of the best superheroes of the series being put together in the same film, and presuming you have seen the previous films with them it has been building up to this. Basically Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the Tesseract has been found and activated, opening a gateway transporting the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from Asgard to Earth. He steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsg√•rd), and this forces Fury to reactivate the Avengers Initiative, recruiting some of the world's most powerful and special heroes, starting with Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She goes to find Bruce Banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) who is hiding somewhere in India for his scientific knowledge of the Tesseract - no mention of ""The Other Guy"", while Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who also has technological knowledge - and his powerful mechanical suit, and Fury also brings Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) up to date with the situation, and he is still trying to get used to the modern world. While Loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the Chitauri, led by The Other (Alexis Denisof), and they came to an agreement that if they got the Tesseract they would help him take over the Earth. Suited up, Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany where Loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube, showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him, he surrenders though when they fight and catch him. In this process though the villain's half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives, also transported from Asgard, and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way, and this turns into a fight between him, Iron Man and Captain America, but it eventually stops. Loki is placed into a cell, designed to hold The Hulk inside if Banner turns, and now with Thor recruited as well the Avengers argue about how to handle the alien dictator, and there is the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plan to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Fury explains that he heard about what happened in Mexico, when Thor was previously on Earth, and that the attack makes Earth an easy target, and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack, and as the argument continues Loki's mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship, the Helicarrier. Captain America and Iron Man try to start the engines again, while Thor tries fight against Banner who has become The Hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside, and fighting with Barton, Romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal. In the struggle Loki kills Agent Coulson and escapes the ship, Banner as Hulk and Thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground, and Fury uses the death of Coulson to encourage the Avengers left to come together, work as a team and save the world. They know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities, and using Dr. Selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the Chitauri to invade and attack Manhattan, and it is up to Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor and The Hulk to save the day. In the end, after Dr. Selvig is revived, so much explosive fighting, and a prevented missile blowing up in space, Loki is taken back with the Tesseract by Thor to Asgard, the Avengers go their separate ways, until a new threat to the world emerges, and the final scene sees The Other meeting his master, who turns and reveals himself to be Thanos. Also starring Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Paul Bettany as Jarvis, Sudden Death's Powers Boothe as World Security Council, Jenny Agutter as World Security Council, Harry Dean Stanton as Security Guard, Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Hulk and a cameo by Stan Lee. The cast are all fantastic, Downey Jr. with all the quips, Evans as the sensible fighter, Ruffalo as the man trying to control his temper, Hemsworth as the arrogant warrior, Johansson as the confident female, and Jackson as the intelligent controller. It should be noted that the title was changed in Britain from The Avengers because there would be confusion with the Honor Blackman/Dianna Rigg TV series, and also there were small complaints about Spider-Man and Wolverine absent, but it doesn't matter. Anyway, the story and scripting are very well made, and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks, invading creatures, and constant explosions, this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years, a must see action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!"
"Munin75","7","4","14","25 April 2012"," Entertaining. Should not disappoint the masses.
","The Avengers is exactly what I expected. It is action packed, it understandably doesn't have much time for character development (although we do see more of Hawkeye and Black Widow than in previous Marvel installments), and the relentless action is accompanied by some fairly good jokes to ease the tension here and there - especially by Tony Stark and, surprisingly, the Hulk (they actually managed to throw in at least two genuinely funny moments around Hulk's utter brutality).<br/><br/>The lack of character development, especially for Thor (who does seem somewhat out of place in this film) but also Bruce Banner, is probably what hurts The Avengers the most. I didn't actually need any character development since I've seen all previous Marvel films at least twice, but it nonetheless does stand as a drawback - it feels wrong even though I was expecting it considering the number of characters already established. I can hardly imagine anyone who hasn't seen the previous films enjoying The Avengers because of that.<br/><br/>I usually don't care that much for relentless CGI action films, but some sequences in The Avengers were so blatantly incredible that I had to enjoy them. Notably, a sequence during the huge battle sees the camera pan from one Avenger kicking butt to the other - that was really well done and exciting. Loki was once again a brilliant villain and the perfect choice for the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good action ride bringing our favorite superheros together. The movie doesn't try to be pretentious and goes straight to business - which is what it should do."
"rjennica","1","7","31","12 May 2015"," Avengers a 'no no'
","Folks...In case you're interested in the new ""Avengers"" movie, don't waste your time or money. Unlike the first installment, this has nothing but special effects with a disjointed storyline. There are explosions in which most caught in the blast radius would get killed, but leaves nothing but scratches and little or no blood. It's almost stupid, with lines that are supposed to be funny, but are just 'fill-ins' for lack of meaningful dialog. However, the kids in the audience laughed a lot, which made me realize how out of place I was and need to grow up. There will be no next time if there is yet another sequel. Yuck. How disappointing."
"tony_aka30","5","5","20","7 May 2012"," Umm...people, movies are not rated solely on action, CGI and funny dialogue.
","If movies were given great ratings based only on action packed sequences, state of the art CGI and humoristic lines, then The Avengers would surely be one of the best movies ever made. However, a great movie is instead judged by it's coherent story, character development, good acting and the parallel between the movie and our real world situation. These are just to name a few and The Avengers clearly lacks all of these.<br/><br/>Even though the opening sequence was well done and was promising for the rest of the movie, I found myself anxiously sitting in my chair waiting for the end of the film. The repetitive action sequences and the predictable turn of events really made this movie a 2 ¬Ω hour snooze-fest.<br/><br/>Why this movie has a 8.8 rating as of May 7th is really beyond me. This movie deserves at most a 7/10 but only if you feel generous. Without getting into to much details, The Avengers' structure, plot and setting is very similar to Transformers: the Dark of the Moon but instead of having the Autobots you have Marvel superheroes and instead of having Megatron and company you have Loki and his crew. Everyone hated that movie, it currently has a 6.3 rating, so why the heck is The Avengers so well rated?! It's sad to see that such brainless movies are making a ton of cash and are in the interest of nowaday moviegoers and big movie companies. Hopefully come end of July, Christopher Nolan will enlighten moviegoers with his soon to be epic/legendary masterpiece The Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>Avengers disassemble, and let the Fire Rise!"
"d-christianson-1","7","4","15","14 May 2012"," Good, but not that good.
","I have to say I was skeptical from the start. Combining superheroes in one movie never works. Typically they result in cornball clich√©'s, bad acting, and plot holes you can drive a truck through. I'm pleased that Avengers has solid humor, acting was only a little uneven and there were but a few ""what...??"" moments. (e.g. we have a futuristic ship, but no one notices the arrow-bomb, or bad guys on board? Since when can the hulk be tamed?) <br/><br/>But like other reviewers have said, the bar wasn't raised. There's nothing new in this movie. I felt mostly detached from all the characters, I felt nothing when whats-his-face died. He had so little screen time, there was no emotional connection. I think I felt most connected to Banner, there was at least some character development, and a reluctance to do what he was asked.<br/><br/>Like all super hero movies, there's big fights, indestructible warriors, evil villains and lots of things going boom. Besides combining all these superheroes in a decent movie nothing really stood out as 'exceptional'. My biggest complaint is they all seem indestructible. When Thor is hurling towards the ground, was anyone worried he wouldn't get out, or if he did crash that he wouldn't survive? No. The entire movie is that way. There is no true suspense, no truly tense moments. You know how it will end before the movie starts.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Batman develops a solid story and while Batman is set in a fictitious realm, it seems more believable. I did like The Avengers, and look forward to seeing it again, but I don't feel it is deserving of such a high ranking on IMDb. I have higher hopes for The Dark Night Rises and Prometheus."

","Blockbuster actions scenes and CGI, but held back by a video game script. Accurate to the comic books or not, the premise was insufficient for a project with such potential, but on the bright side, this is what playing video games on playstation 10 will look like most likely, and probably with a story line as equal to the one from Avengers, hopefully better though. The movies of the individual heroes were far and away better than the avengers. It just wasn't put together well. Keep making Iron Man's and Incredible hulks, preferably with Edward Norton, and scrap Thor and Captain America. Their boring and too fictitious in comparison to the others. At least Iron Man and Hulk are based in Science. Thor is fantasy, magical realm, children's level type stuff, and Captain America is flat out boring."

","Solid movie across the board. I enjoyed it immensely while in the theater. But looking back two months later it was one of those movies that I could live without having to see again and I scarcely remember any of the fine details which make a movie truly stand out and be an all time great.<br/><br/>It was a very good film and they really nailed the Hulk this time, especially. Robert Downey, Jr. is still an excellent Iron Man and despite the disappointment of Iron Man 2 in comparison to the first one(which is my all time favorite Marvel movie), it was still very good.<br/><br/>I don't believe the Avengers fully lived up to its massive hype but still a good, entertaining and action-packed movie that most comic book and superhero fans should enjoy."
"TheSquiss","5","3","10","17 June 2012"," At last we have a Hulk that convinces.
","I dragged my heels when it came to Avengers Assemble. Did I really want to see yet another comic book adaptation that will be rehashed in ten years for viewers with goldfish memories (The Amazing Spider-man being a case in point)? Apparently I did.<br/><br/>I've never been a great reader of graphic novels though I dipped into the odd Batman and Flash Gordon book while still building camps in hedges but in recent years my forays into pictorial literature have been less frequent and more specific; the favoured and most notable examples being Joe Sacco's Palestine and, a particular high point for me, J. M. DeMatteis' The Compleat Moonshadow.<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>Avengers Assemble concerned me; with so many disappointing and, occasionally, disastrous adaptations out there (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, both of the Hulk adaptations to date¬Ö) what hope was there for a film that threw together a smorgasbord of superheroes all vying for top billing, one of which hasn't been tested on the public with a big screen outing of her own? With so many egos and so little time it would be a task and a half for the scriptwriter, Joss Whedon, to adequately divvy out the lines.<br/><br/>I needn't have concerned myself with such trivialities. Whedon, who also directs, does an admirable job of bouncing the dialogue between characters without swaying too heavily in one direction. There isn't a clear star in this grand ensemble piece although that success leads to a new issue in that none are able to engage us with a fully fleshed-out story of their own. It doesn't matter with the likes of Robert Downey Jnr's Iron Man, who has had two hugely successful outings, but is frustrating in the case of Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow.<br/><br/>There's no need to go into detail on the plot; it's a superhero flick so naturally something or someone (Loki, Thor's adopted brother in this instance), threatens the existence of mankind and the superheroes fly into action to save the day. It's formulaic but a lot of fun, if not particularly original or inspiring. It's difficult to surprise cinema-goers nowadays and plots are recycled, embellished and reimagined more often than conceived, but that needn't be a major issue in a genre film on this scale when the viewer isn't demanding any more than to be entertained.<br/><br/>The cast is superb and, in the case of the principals, either recognizable as stars in their own right or courtesy of the roles they are reprising here. Mostly they do as you'd expect and deserve neither great plaudits nor condemnation; it's not that kind of film. However, beyond the obvious star-billed cast, there are some who delight absolutely. Tom Hiddleston (Wallander, The Deep Blue Sea), as Loki, is effortlessly compelling and avoids melodrama in his wickedness that so many villains lean towards, while Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Town) is an actor who's been around for a few years and co-starred in a number of excellent, if not huge, films. As Clint Barton he again lends solid support and proves to be a most watchable and compelling actor. It's just a pity that he's given little opportunity to develop his alter ego, Hawkeye, and one can only hope the inevitable sequel will rectify that.<br/><br/>The unexpected quality comes in the form of the Hulk. With two major Hollywood adaptations to date, the kindest comment one can make is that their stars, Eric Bana and Edward Norton, were both put to shame by the dated Bill Bixby performance. In Avengers Assemble, though, Mark Ruffalo truly shines as the tortured, reluctant recruit, Bruce Banner. The CG big green lump is created more convincingly, though still not flawlessly, here than in previous attempts but it's as Banner that Ruffalo proves himself. For once we have a portrayal of Banner that lays his soul bare for us all to see the demons running around inside it. And, at last, I'm actually looking forward to the solo outing they must surely give Ruffalo's Hulk. Let's just hope it's third time lucky.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss.

"sreer","9","3","10","30 May 2012"," Exceeded my expectation by not murdering a group legendary comics heroes
","To the furthest expectation I didn't give this movie anything above the transformer series ,thought from the trailers it will be all boom boom etc. I did have an idea that there will be a great Iron Man comedian in the nice armor suit though, but I give it all up for Joss Whedon and his writer friends for creating an extraordinary mix of superhero gang movie. The movie frankly did have a slow start but from the point where we see Tony Stark and Thor in ""Shakespeare in the park"" scene the movie hits of with a non stop action mixed with a very above average hilariousness. Every super hero even Capt.Nick gets a personal intro in the movie each of them better than the other . By the way should mention the Hulk of this movie separately, even though this was his first notable appearance as a super hero or in an action role and that too with other guys who are extremely or slightly experienced in action movies , Mark Ruffalo did stand out from most of the them. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. were fabulous and incredibly entertaining as usual .Chris Hemsworth proves he is better along with his buddies than alone like in his own Thor movie. Tom Hiddleston steels every scene he is in and makes his mark as a great actor. Jeremy Renner , as of for him i really feel like they did make him wait in line to the last with the least important role if there is any in the six of The Avengers. You can really pull that out from the movie. But his Hawk-eye is a brilliant display equally to others.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a great success in my eyes and its worth the while to wait for a sequel. Apart from all hulk is funny in this movie something you don't see everyday. A scene particularly I don't want to say which includes Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo on the start tower alone deserves all the credits the movie does."
"The_Movie_Cat","7","3","10","13 May 2012"," ""... he's adopted.""
","Perhaps one of the most fun elements of the IMDb is seeing newly released films achieve high entries on the Top 250 chart, before wider recognition gradually sees them slip down. At date of writing Avengers Assemble is just outside the top 30 of all-time greatest movies, yet still sits comfortably above supposedly inferior efforts like Rashomon, Taxi Driver, M, Modern Times and Citizen Kane. <br/><br/>I can only assume that it will eventually slip into a more realistic level, though it's been four years since the release of The Dark Knight and that's still in the top ten. That's not to say that this movie or Nolan's Batman sequel aren't good films, but they probably aren't GREAT films, and the lightweight and ultimately draining Avengers picture isn't really able to sit there with the classic artistic works of cinema's entire history.<br/><br/>This is not to be snobbish about the IMDb's Top 250... well, much. Although populist, and seemingly never tiring of Freeman-Roberts (again, a good film, and worthy of top forty perhaps, but all time No.1?) it does generally have a rewarding regard of the classics. Rashomon's struggle to break the top 50 even on a good day remains puzzling, but no more so than this somewhat hollow popcorn-fest being so feted.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that after so much build up - including five movies leading into this one - it can't possibly pay off all the pre- expectations. And then there's Joss Whedon's two-joke schtick, all predictable instant reverses (including the title quote) and largely uninspired deconstruction. Nowadays every film is so relentlessly post- modern that it doesn't come as a surprise, but then every film these days is also 3D, so that doesn't come as much of a surprise either.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's an okay movie... the jokes entertain the masses, Johansson looks stunning, and even though Downey Jr.'s schtick in the Tony Stark role already looks tired just three movies in, Mark Ruffalo does well as the new Bruce Banner. Chris Evans, used to stealing weak superhero movies with the Fantastic Four, here finds most of his character pieces on the cutting room floor, though Chris Hemsworth manages to salvage something as Thor. As the most commercially successful superhero movie of all time, its chances of repeating that sentence with the word ""superhero"" removed also look pretty high. But an all time classic of the medium? No, not quite."

Killing agent Phil and his good bye speech was so cheap, so predictable, it's one big fake. And not so smart agent Hill also wasn't fun at all. OK, Mr. Downey was perfect and Hulk's beating s*it out of Loki was just marvelous, but I hoped more from this movie- not another we are so patriotic and boring superheroes movie. Oh and making it 3D- what for? 'Cause every movie from ""Avatar"" must be 3D now? Even when there really not so many 3D scenes. as I said it's not bad, but I think, it's only for Marvel's fans."

You have to suspend any logic or common sense to be entertained. If you can, this movie will keep you occupied for over 2 hours. Don't be tempted to make sense out of the story because it leads to questions that invite logic and common sense. The comics can get away with so much because in that world, it comes across as that is what happens in that world. Trying to transfer comics to the screen becomes challenging because trying to bring a super hero to reality is not easy. So we settle for the next best thing which is to make it entertaining. The director pulls that off quite well. In the end, you want to ask your self if you got your monies or tickets worth. The answer is yes. This is not a movie that invites you to come back and see it again. There are no memorable scenes which is its only flaw all things considered.

Not sure why anyone would come here and read some reviews about it, i mean let us face it, you already made your decisions to go and see it, you just want to make sure !! <br/><br/>a hugely marketed movie like this will always attract people to go and see it, it is very hard to ignore all the big fuss and all those giant billboards and adds of it everywhere !! <br/><br/>I went in with huge expectations, and it had to be said that the movie did not let me down,however, i believe it is way too overrated and over hyped ! the movie starts out very slowly, and for the first hour or so, i felt some boredom creeping in, or was it my exuberant mood and impatience for the action to starts ? there was just too much stretch of boring speech and slow scenes of the gathering of the Avengers in the first hour or so.<br/><br/>I was expecting a roller coaster of action / adventure scenes from start to finish and i guess i was slammed in the face by the slow built up in the beginning. my two younger daughters "" 5 and 6 "" certainly got bored and fidgety, which added to my frustration.<br/><br/>Having said that, the movie is a success in what its trying to do, which is gathering all those super heroes together in one film, it was entertaining and enjoyable over the whole run. I just thought that the plot was nothing special, just your average cartoonish plot of an evil villain who wants to rule the world, the serious dialog involving the main plot was boring and empty with no interest in it, however, when the funny scenes and dialog jump in, its really enjoyable and pure fun.<br/><br/>Each of the characters had an almost equal screen time, although, the roles seems uneven with the highest importance going to Iron man, and a lot of time went into trying to explore the Black Widow and Hawkeye relationship but failing in adding any strong background about those two characters, did not feel or care much about them.<br/><br/>the Hulk was also sort of put on the side, not clear what his involvement was into the team, supposedly he knows much about the Gama radiation, but i was puzzled with him, at times he was completely out of control and not distinguishing between the heroes and Villains, and other times, he was completely submissive to his fellow super heroes.<br/><br/>It was clear that iron man was running the show, maybe the leader some how, which i liked since he is among my favorites, his quarrels with Captain America were fun and there seemed liked a power struggle between the two !!<br/><br/>Thor was another character put on the side, did not have a big impact other than his brother being the villain !! Sameul L Jackson's character Nick Fury was the most annoying as the leader of the Avengers, his speeches and his overall role were useless and annoying, very frustrating and if i were a super hero, i wouldn't join a team that he leads. just an empty character.<br/><br/>certain parts of the plot were lame and silly, like when a certain character in the movie was killed, and his death was the ultimate reason for the Avengers to finally join together was a bit too corny.<br/><br/>Now the good parts !! because once the action starts, it really is brilliant !! some very impressive visuals and solid action scenes with the involvement of the Avengers, especially the final fight in the end, it was superb, although not entirely original "" some similarities to the last Transformers movie "", still very enjoyable and the kids certainly were impressed and glued to the big screen with excitement.<br/><br/>So in Summary, the Avengers is not the best movie ever made, and not in anyway a masterpiece, however, it is entertaining and is original as the first film with multiple superheroes in it. the first half gets a 6.5 out of 10, but then the 2nd half of the movie gets a solid 9 !! my 8 year old son says its a 10 !! :)<br/><br/>Moebardi.blogspot.com"
"mad_mandonna","7","3","10","4 May 2012"," A great summer film. Is it more than that, sorry Joss, no it's not.
","The Avengers is not as good as The Dark Knight, I'm just going to say that from the off, the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it, but it doesn't have the deep characters or visual spectacle. Joss Whedon's script keeps the film going, and lets be honest, this film could have been a train wreck. What makes The Avengers tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another. This is where the film really takes flight, when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together, it gives the film weight and suspense especially with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Joss Whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out script.<br/><br/>The Dialogue is what keeps it above board, visuals have never been Joss Whedon's strong suit, but I did notice a wink to his first feature film Serenity in zoom shots in the action sequences (see Serenity's finale as the ship falls from the sky). The film doesn't look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other Marvel films seem to support, but it didn't really have a choice following suit from its predecessors. But lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies, they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too much like a cartoon for my personal taste. Other Superhero film don't seem to have this ""sheen"", making them more visually pleasing to me - the Nolan and Burton Batman's spring to mind as well as the Marvel Xmen films.<br/><br/>The film works equally as well in 2D as it does in 3D, the ""third"" dimension is not needed here, the visual storytelling (though nothing groundbreaking) stands on its own two feet, making the 3D gimmick unnecessary. <br/><br/>Its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film, thats enjoyable from beginning to end. But enjoyment isn't all I mark it on, was the story original, well no not at all, it was an accumulation of its heroes solo films. Were the visuals good, yes, but they weren't anything you haven't seen in other similar films. The Avengers is fun and Joss's ingenious and humorous dialogue will make you come back for another sitting, but by and large this isn't a anything more than a summer popcorn film, not that it tries to be more either. But what do I know I gave Salt a 9."

","Definitely a GOOD movie, but not great. I kind of expected more of it. But still great fun for the whole family. Action packed, lots of laughter and truly good jokes, good characters, BUT no plot. I've read lots of reviews talking about being great, but to me a great movies demands a great plot, and thats missing. Also, a few things could have been better executed, like the fight between Thor and Iron man and how hulk enters the final battle. Three mains drawbacks that took some credibility away: 1- Iron man can almost kick Thor's ass on a fight, but is trashed by an airship engine???? So the engine can cause more damage tham Thor's hammer??? 2- SHIELD super mega hiper battleship gets boarded and almost destroyed by a couple of terrorists on a helicopter??? If they cant handle 10 guys (from earth), how do they expect the viewer to believe they are earths last defense against aliens??? 3- Thor falls from the sky on a glass cube and is afraid to die? after all we have seen him doing?? ... Anyway. Still recommend because its great entertainment."

","Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades - and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something - for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next, Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!<br/><br/>I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, co-worker's wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation! <br/><br/>But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" for Democrat next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" for Republicans after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic debris that was released into the air! <br/><br/>The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time! <br/><br/>The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck! <br/><br/>For those of you who have never taken a film class in college before: A GOOD FILM HAS AN INTERESTING STORY AND ACTORS THAT INTERACT WELL WITH EACH OTHER! It really is not too hard to imagine! You could even write it on the back of a matchbook cover!"

Sorry for the Marvel lovers, but this movie sucks, from beginning to end. I bought the ticket taking as reference the 8.7 average the IMDb meter published. Completely disappointing. From now on I'll take more care when trusting that meter, or actually is not IMDb problem, but it's the perfect example of how humans can be dumb enough to love such an insult to the story telling job. Or is a movie made just for the Marvel geeks?? But really, I think its just business. For those who seek profound stories, this is not the one, at all. You'll regret for sure if you watch the movie. A considerable huge amount of the film is war, explosions, sound-effects. In not a complete enemy of cinema effects when they are used for good, like Avatar, but, this time is empty from bottom to top. I guess it's just the way of making business and earn a lot of money. It's ironic, after watching the movie (part of it) I started to believe that humans were made to be ruled and submitted, even when we deny it. And loving this movie is the example."

","No, I don't think The Avengers is entirely horrible: in fact, it's a perfectly decent escapist type movie, but don't expect to walk away from the theatre with a new found love for life or a fresh perspective that any real movie will deliver. <br/><br/>The Avengers is the current water-cooler movie, for good reason: it's easy to talk about. ""The CGI!"" ""The action!"" ""The comedy!"". It's easy, and might as well have a laugh track it's so instructive. From start to finish, the plot carries the same formula - INYOURFACEACTION, comic relief, INYOURFACEACTION, comic relief. Repeat until done. The jokes were painfully predictive and obvious; I felt like cattle being herded along the movie, all too aware of the cheap tricks used to get the audience laughing. At a budget of over 200 million, it felt cheap and without substance.<br/><br/>I also think it's insulting this movie carries such a high IMDb rating. I suppose most don't realize they're cattle."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","4","16","27 April 2012"," Amazing, and I will break down why
","When the Tesseract suddenly activates itself, it briefly opens a portal. A small one, but nonetheless it allows Loki(who uses his illusions well) to pass through... and he now has a sceptre that allows him to take over people by touch. He escapes with the aforementioned seemingly limitless source of energy, and with the threat of it being used to allow an invasion of Earth by the alien force the Chitari, what can Fury do other than... Assemble Avengers. This is an excellent piece, that lives up to the hype. It will satisfy comic readers and more casual viewers of this franchise alike. A lot of people will be exclaiming that, so I will try to back it up instead of just fawning over this(and believe me, I could go 1000 words just doing that). It follows up on all... no, *all*... of the threads set up in the five films that came before(and yes, it will really help to have watched all of them before this... then again, if you have any interest in this, you probably already have). Nothing is abandoned or ignored. The sheer planning that went into this... and this is still full of fantastic surprises. And for all the development(all of that in this is highly credible, by the way) of characters, powers and conflicts(and this takes the ball and runs with it, and adds the interpersonal relationships of these people who have not shared a screen before now, who are rather different people) that precedes this, there is a solid amount of it in this, as well. All six(and no, you can't tell that two of them, one of them especially, haven't gotten much screen time before this) members of the faction are treated to an astonishing introduction(actually, that goes for Nick and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, both very cool, as well), a strong heroic act that only they could have accomplished, *and*... a situation of immense peril(not to mention that they(and we) are treated to one continuous tracking shot that showcases all of them taking names using their talent, one by one, once they've grown into a team, working together... no, they don't start out like that, and yes, there is indeed infighting early on, and yes, we get every one-on-one that anyone wants, and it is glorious... the trailer is literally just the preview). All of them have something to do(and they are recruited gradually, no one overshadowing anyone else... and somehow, this gets all the aspects that make them work individually, in their own movies, somehow, without getting tonal schizophrenia), some reason to be in this, and the threat(Hiddleston is friggin' intimidating) is grand enough that we need all of them, and for them to band together. Tony has to prove that he is selfless, that he doesn't just fix his own mistakes(and he brings his mainstay of taking what can barely even be called calculated risks, that come out to putting a severe dent in the enemies). Steve has to adjust to a world and time completely foreign to him, and bring them all into one, effective unit(and he is the great leader that is required, one that you yourself would follow, and, indeed, a Super Soldier(a title he earns)). Thor(who brings godlike might, and a Shakespearian sibling rivalry with the bad guy) and Natasha(who is the real brains of the operation, and can manipulate the foe... they use one of her qualities well, that being her apparently complete detachment from emotion leading to an uncertainty of what she does feel and what not) are dealing with a lot of guilt, on account of it being an Asgardian causing trouble for the planet and her... dark past as a spy who'd take on missions for or against anyone, respectively. Clint(who brings his specialized arrows and extreme accuracy to good use) has his own to make amends for(you'll see...). Bruce(who comes with the sheer destructive weight of his alter ego) is brought on for his expertise on the subject of Gamma radiation(he can help find the vital cube), and... I don't need to spell out what he feels bad about, do I? He does seem to have gotten the Hulk under control... or has he? This builds up the transformation, and he remains a danger. He's the only one to have another person attached to it than played it last, and while I had no problem with Norton(who I love in other stuff... in that, he didn't do all he could with it, though), this part is Ruffalo's. There is this very terrifying aspect to him, he could metamorphose and cause significant damage and pain... and he plays it like you'd expect him to be, very non-confrontational and anxious, yet smart and confident in his field. All of them risk their lives and limb for the good of mankind, saving countless people. There are not many supporting roles(Phil Coulson does return, and he is enjoyable, with a fandom of Cap; there's also a female agent named Hill, who kicks ass... in fact, every woman in this is hot, independent and not objectified... kudos for that, along with the rest, Whedon), with focus placed where it should be, on the ensemble cast. Is it necessary for me to devote space to let you know that the acting is spot-on? You've already seen Chris, Robert and Liam do incredible, and they do so here, too. Everyone does. The writing is phenomenal. I am struggling to find one line of dialog(with Iron Man-like wit and banter) that isn't quotable, sharp and well-delivered. The action is plentiful, has distinct stages to it(none of that unaimed, mindless crap), culminating in a truly massive climax, and somehow never running out of steam or exhausting the audience. This keeps to a pitch perfect pace, and at nearly two and a half hours, there is nothing tedious or rushed. The FX? Breathtaking. 3D? Used right(only little distinctly moves towards/points at you). I recommend this to everyone who is considering it. 10/10"

Lets get something clear, just because two characters argue, does not mean an ""extra dimension"" was added to them. Robert Downey Junior does a good job but there is little else here in terms of acting. Apart from this, the movie just follows a PAINFULLY formulaic story line. Team of superheroes get together to fight a grand evil and must put their differences aside for the greater good, which they eventually do. And of course, Captain America struts onto the scene and begins shouting orders, somehow he rips this authority from thin air amongst a God, an egotistic super genius millionaire and the bloody Hulk! Overall cheesy, completely devoid of any novelties and shamelessly formulaic. the 3 stars are for the slight entertainment I got from the film at times."

Thor and his gods which belong somewhere in lord of the ring or something. Hulk who exists due to some chemical reactions and interactions or gamma rays. Each character has a different theme and environment. Bringing them together isn't right. The acting of most of the actors was normal, actually at times it felt they were in a play not a movie. the story is abit silly or i should say typical. It felt like this was a Walt Disney movie and ironically enough it turned out to be a Walt Disney movie, But on the other hand ....the special effects were amazing and there were some funny scenes.

"fionagreen1","6","3","11","11 May 2012"," The Avengers Dissassembled
","By now it's probably all been said before, so I'm really just adding weight to the views on both sides of the nerd-gasm that was The Avengers.<br/><br/>Entertainment is the name of the game here, and Whedon doesn't hold back for a minute, throwing brawling superheroes, invading aliens, and wide-scale destruction at the screen throughout its running time.<br/><br/>Some of the character interplay, particularly between Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Bruce Banner (Hulk) are a joy to watch, with the former's acerbic put-downs (Thor is dubbed 'Point Break', and Captain America is renamed 'Rock of Ages') injecting fun into what could have otherwise been a joyless jaunt between explosions.<br/><br/>The acting is credible overall, with Mark Ruffalo perfectly characterising Bruce Banner as the embodiment of all that the Hulk is not (awkward, reserved, quiet), Robert Downey Jnr channelling Stark's usual suave arrogance, and Tom Hiddleson's Loki permeating charm and menace in equal measure (Banner comments ""you can smell crazy on him"" at one point).<br/><br/>These are all positives I'd been expecting from the man who wowed me with Firefly and Serenity, and my wife with Buffy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are quite a few problems as well, even for a comic book fan such as myself.<br/><br/>Firstly, there's some seriously lumpen exposition, particularly the juvenile intro scene where the alien 'plan to invade' is bullet-pointed for the audience, in case we can't follow the basic premise. I fully expected a white board and felt markers to be used at any second. The end-credit scene is in a similar vein, and is equally cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>A pet-hate of mine (and my wife's) is a lack of logic, and The Avengers excels in this area, with 1. The base explosion near the intro, completely unexplained, just to be accepted, 2. Loki brainwashing/controlling his 'minions' by tapping their hearts (rather than their heads, where their 'minds' are (doh!)) with his staff, and 3. Why there are numerous scenes in which the invading aliens don't open fire at the clearly exposed cops, civilians and heroes they are flying over (are they saving ammo?).<br/><br/>Another point to consider is the absence of the National Guard. Were they off on holiday that day? <br/><br/>By some margin, though, the greatest gripe I have with The Avengers, is the lack of genuine threat that Loki and his army poses to, not just the Avengers themselves, but to any modern army.<br/><br/>While Loki is more than capable of taking care of Captain America (then again, who isn't?), he is quite clearly no match for Hulk, Thor or Iron Man, who each take turns in highlighting this fact. In my experience of superheroes, it's paramount to play the 'heroes' as the underdogs, who must face and overcome a challenge that, at first, seems beyond them. This is what makes for exciting (and unpredictable) entertainment.<br/><br/>In The Avengers, there's no point at which we're under any illusion that Loki and his horde will fail, nor is there any need for concern over our heroes, since they are the overwhelming favourites to rise triumphant.<br/><br/>All that said, I didn't feel short-changed when I left the cinema, and this is coming from someone who generally avoids Hollowood movies. Maybe some of the more abrasive critics of the movie are right - some of us are just nerdy and want to see characters with incredible powers knock the crap out of each other.<br/><br/>Although I can understand where a rating of 8.8 has come from (over-enthusiastic fan-boys fresh from the cinema, typing up their reviews BEFORE changing their trousers), I can't add to it. The Avengers isn't Pan's Labyrinth, or Amelie, and in this context, it can't reach top spot or anywhere near it. If you're giving a movie with this numerous faults a full score, you're clearly in need of watching some genuinely well-crafted movies.<br/><br/>It's not clever, but it is BIG!"

","Back in mid-00s when Marvel announced their intentions for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we quite honestly didn't believe they could pull it off. Five big budget blockbuster movies before a grande finale. Before that we had had trouble getting even two sequels, and even then they normally hadn't been all that great, with especially the third movie usually sucking something fierce.<br/><br/>But they did it. Somehow they went and did it. And yeah, you could argue that they had the advantage of being allowed to switch characters and subjects around freely and that the only ""actual"" sequel, Iron Man 2, was easily the weakest of the bunch, but still. This was a revolutionary movie, something we had never seen before. A phenomenon that changed film making.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's not only a great idea, it's also one of the best superhero films ever made, one of the best action popcorn films as well, and one of my personal favourites. And it's actually easy to see why. You've already established all of your characters, you've built them up and given them clear identities. You also have an amazing ensemble cast of actors, most of them having risen to the highest echelons of Hollywood. You have Joss ""God of Nerds"" Whedon directing and writing. You've already created a need and want for this kind of movie, so you don't have to water it down. It can be an honest and direct superhero film, with quick wit, blazing action and phenomenal, state of the art special effects. No need to sell it to the big audiences by cramming it needlessly full of everything else. You can keep it pure.<br/><br/>And it works so well. It's a fast-paced movie, with every scene full of excitement, jokes and entertainment, but Whedon knows what he's doing. There's pacing, there are lulls in between the action, allowing you to re-acquaintance yourself with these characters and their individual story lines, all of which meet and intertwine in this colossus of a movie.<br/><br/>The Avengers is pure entertainment. It's only smart in a quick-witted street punk manner, so it's certainly not going to win over the worst of the high brow community, but what it has in spades is charm, entertainment value and pure, high-tuned, perfected action. Amazing movie."

Combined with the tough and skilled agents of SHIELD, all these heroes would join forces to defend Earth against threats that couldn't otherwise be faced.<br/><br/>From the start, Marvel's Avengers jumps right into the universe it set up in all previous films, and it wastes no time in jumping into the action.

But even when there's no fighting, the movie remains effortlessly entertaining, thanks to its endearing combination of thrills, humor, and personality.<br/><br/>The story could be described as the same thing Seven Samurai was: the simple tale of heroes defending a place. In this film, the heroes are a mis-matched family, where some characters connect and others butt heads. The volatile concoction of personalities is what makes the team so special; each character is given a chance to shine, and together they form a uniquely dysfunctional dynamic that makes their dialogue sharp, their drama tense, and their teamwork compelling. It even goes so far as pumping newfound color and life into characters that existed in previous films, but never had a chance to shine until now (particularly Loki, whose devilish mischief steals the show often; Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Agent Coulson stand out much better in this film as well).<br/><br/>The film looks spectacular, with quality photography and editing. There are a lot of unusual camera angles in this movie, and I think it looks awesome. Other shots are crafted in very dynamic ways that not only show off the action, but the characters in evoking ways. Acting is a joy to watch from the whole cast; Robert Downey Jr is as enjoyable as ever as Tony Stark, while Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans provide decently commanding performances. Mark Ruffalo is probably the most pleasant surprise from the cast, who provides a balanced and compelling portrayal of Bruce Banner. Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg are all fun to watch, and Tom Hiddleston nails it as a bad guy we love to hate. Writing is quite sharp and precise, for great effect. This production uses great-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. Alan Silvestri's music score is appropriately heroic and catchy.<br/><br/>Avengers comes close to being the end-all-be-all superhero film: one epic experience that brings together multiple heroes for one grand fight, in a manner that feels so naturally entertaining and harmonic.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"

","Probably the most solidly structured movie I've ever seen. What I admire about The Avengers is that it doesn't go in guns blazing from the start, it doesn't open with the Avengers themselves but with Nick Fury and Maria Hill, who are there right at the beginning of what is eventually one of the best superhero movies ever, charged with explosive action, mind blowing spectacle and big laughs. When the world is threatened by Loki and his army of alien Chitauri, the Avengers Initiative is activated and a team of the most remarkable beings come together to save the world from obliteration. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye team up in one of the best movie finales to hit our screens, New York is a playground for jaw dropping action, stunning camera shots and immersive 3D, Joss Whedon's ability to balance out this enormous cast is unlike any other, and with whip smart writing and a powerhouse story this is the ultimate Marvel adventure. Would I watch this again? A dozen times and more, this is a perfect choice for a movie night, a family night in, and the cast are better than ever playing these superheroes we've come to love over the past few years, and watching Hawkeye dive off an exploding rooftop backwards firing his arrow brings me the nerdiest of nerd tears."

","We can all rest easy. They pulled it off! Marvel's The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble, as it's known in the UK and other markets) is everything we've been hoping for an exciting superhero team-up film packed with memorable moments.<br/><br/>I've been waiting for this movie since I first read an Avengers comic book when I was 8-years old, and of course, that sort of feeling is shared by so many people, across multiple generations, given The Avengers' 49-year-old history. That's a huge burden to put on the shoulders of writer/director. But if anyone could make it work, it would be the director, whose geek creed (and gift for strong characterization) has been long established via the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, and his time writing for Marvel Comics' Astonishing X-Men.<br/><br/>ERIC GOLDMAN from IGN"
"evan-wingenbach","7","2","6","22 March 2015"," An ensnarement of Action
","The Avengers ‚Äì an Ensnarement of Action by Evan Wingenbach Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" has received loads of appraisal for its glorious battles and epic action. It's a movie that's easy to market and easy to make money but nothing really special. Filled with mindless battle sequences, that certainly gives the awe experience, but nothing more. A classic case of a big budget meant to have big hype and big profit.<br/><br/>The conflict in the story is quickly established in the opening scene when the tesseract a cube of pure power unleashes a portal and out comes Loki the banished demigod half-brother of Thor. Loki steals the tesseract planning to use its power to open a portal unleashing an alien army on earth. This gives the movie the breathtakingly simple plot, stop Loki or the world will end. The rest of the movie involves 5 super heroes (Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and Black Widow) plus another that spends most of the movie brainwashed on Loki's side (Hawkeye). These super heroes come together throughout the movie slinging backhanded remarks at each other making them joss Whedon's ultimate dysfunctional Family. Especially between Captain America and Tony Stark there is strong tension, but of course in the end the all put their differences aside and use their different but still the same skills together to save humanity. What a predictable ""story book"" finish.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that the movie really has no suspense. Never throughout the movie is there a doubt in your mind that the avengers will succeed. They are given a basic but serious conflict and they just blow right through it with little to no complications. A giant alien snake comes out of the portal to wreak havoc; no problem the hulk will kill it with a single punch. The government is going to Nuke the populated city to try and cut their losses to only New York, hey don't worry iron man will just fly the nuke into the portal and use it on the aliens, but instead of just throwing the missile in the portal I'll fly all the way in with it that way it's a bit more dramatic (insert eye roll here).<br/><br/>The whole movie leading up to the end they are building up that Loki is more powerful than he seems and that it's going to take a miracle to defeat him. This attempt at suspense would maybe work if it wasn't just one big lie. This would be suspense dies in seconds during one of the most anticlimactic villain fights of all time (rivaling the death of Smaug in the Hobbit). The Hulk approaches Loki and you start to feel hey this is it the big Loki fight then in a blink of an eye this thought is killed while the Hulk flings Loki around like an overcooked noodle completely demolishing him and leaving him unable to move and for all intends and purposes defeated. Apparently it was that easy¬Ö Overall the movie has no real plot. It's a simple plot that a 10 year old could've written. There is no real suspense just consistently reassured fact that the avengers kick-ass. The creators of this film basically just made up for what they lacked in actual movie plot with breathtaking action to keep you excited and entertained and to make you not realize that there really isn't much there. If you want to sit back, not put much thought in and just enjoy some crazy action and some try hard comedy this is the movie for you. Final verdict, 6 out of 10 stars."

","Not just a great superhero film, not just a great superheroes film, but also somehow a great Joss Whedon film. Funny goes with dark and dramatic, modern arm in arm with classic storytelling methods and tropes. <br/><br/>Comprehensible special effects and great use of visual space although aspect ratio is a compromise largely due to 3D and staying true to actor's heights (Also w Hulks) so it's not cinematographically outstanding. There's definitely been a discussion about this by the creative and camera departments but overall it still felt satisfying to watch and they pull of the comic- book magic/sci-fi realism well.<br/><br/>But the most astonishing thing you'll feel watching this film is that it works. Somehow all the ingredients work even if they don't seem to at first, which is the story of Avengers.

","Having enjoyed Thor and also the Iron Man films, I felt this combination should be mind blowing. I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, if you haven't seen Thor, then don't watch this film. You won't follow the set up. Its this which holds the film together and explains much. <br/><br/>The film starts with SHIELD'S discovery of something called the Tesseract. The Tesseract contains some kind of intense energy and SHIELD employs Dr Eric Selvig to try and understand its energy. Hot on the heels of Selvig's investigations is Loki of Asgard, a super villain and brother of Thor with breathtaking ambition. Loki comes in, uses the Tesseract to enslave both Selvig and Hawkeye and gets both on his side. Cue Nick Fury who has to get together the other members of the Avengers group. These include Natasha Romanov, Dr Bruce Banner, Captain America Steve Rogers and Iron Man Tony Stark. It also includes Thor who comes along in hot pursuit of Loki to try and bring him back to Asgard and face justice.<br/><br/>Cue lots of thrilling set pieces. There is Stark's extraordinary tower, based on his clean energy ideas, Thor and Loki's humorous verbal sparring parodied by Tony Stark and Tony Stark and Steve Rogers' verbal sparring. All play nicely off against each other. There is Natasha's moment with Loki, the team coming together on board SHIELD's ship and finally the incredible attack by the Chitari on New York, led by Loki. <br/><br/>As is usual with these dazzling things, much of the plot flies out of the window amidst the extraordinary visuals. Tom Hiddleston's Loki has a nicely subtle play out and seems to be more than comfortable in his role. Chris Hemsworth wears his Thor well. Robert Downey Jnr is as wonderfully wisecracking as ever, Chris Evans gives his elder statesman Captain America a well rounded character as totally different from his jack-the-lad role as one of the Fantastic Four, Scartlett Johansson plays Romanov with coolness and Mark Ruffalo adds a sharper performance to Bruce Banner than I've seen in a long time. Jeremy Renner is a bit too quiet for Hawkeye. Combined that with Nick Fury and the other members of SHIELD and you have experience which rises out of what could be a very overwhelming movie experience."
"Lejink","8","2","6","15 November 2014"," They can be heroes
","I'm really more of a DC guy and watched this movie well out of synch with other related Marvel films and TV series I've watched previously but even as some of the finer points of the narrative went over my head somewhat, nevertheless this epic team-up of four (plus two) major super-heroes was an absolute blast. <br/><br/>The two and a half hour viewing time absolutely flew by making this one of the best blockbusters I've seen from the comic universe. The longer playing time allows plenty of room for character development as well as initial face-offs between Iron Man and Captain America and later Hulk and Thor to whet the appetite for the all-action SFX fest finale, when the heroes, plus Black Widow and Hawkeye, finally get their act together to repel the Chitauri alien invasion plotted by Loki. <br/><br/>All the main characters get more or less equal on-screen exposure apart possibly from Hulk but his delayed appearance is of course in line with the surprise element his transformation engenders and is very much worth the wait in any case. There's room for humour too, unsurprisingly in the main from cynical Tony Stark / Iron Man and some sight gags too, like the Hulk's slightly overdone fist-pump with Thor and also his later take-down of Loki after a suitably grandiose speech by the latter. <br/><br/>As the most successful individual performer in the franchise, it's not a huge shock to see Iron Man save the day this time but fans of the individual heroes will all be satisfied with how their favourites are treated I'm sure. Besides the heroes, Tom Hiddlestone makes for a convincingly asinine Loki, Samuel J Jackson gets to jut and chomp a lot as Nick Fury and the likable Clark Greig impresses as Fury's straight-arrow right-hand man Coulson. The effects are literally out-of-this-world as New York is laid-waste by the invading Chitauri and their massive caterpillar-type spaceship and individual ""Silver Surfer""-type jet-ski flying machines. Sure you have to suspend a lot of disbelief as the super six take on and defeat an army of it would appear thousands but it is the comics after all.<br/><br/>It seems to me Marvel is well ahead of DC in the movie stakes certainly if this all-action mega-hit is anything to go by. I look forward to its inevitable follow-up."

Which is something That has never be done i think. At least i never saw anything like that. The actors are really good in my opinion. My initial concerns were about how the movie would live up to this enormous hype it had built up. <br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, it exceeded my expectations in a good way. The story and dialog was created with full blown Hollywood style treatment, but enjoyable and sometimes very funny. The character development was also strong, something that most directors cannot handle due to the fact that making 7 superheroes individually stand out is pretty difficult. But hey, Joss Whedon did it, so I give huge credit and respect for it. Anyways, long words short, in my opinion this was a good movie that lived up to its hype."

","S.H.I.E.L.D. recruits a team of super heroes in order to take down Loki before he brings his army to earth to conquer it. First of all, although there are many (MANY) wrongs with the film, the beginning is good. There is enough humor, action, interest and so on. However, after S.H.I.E.L.D. gets Loki, the interest disappears into thin air, and the only thing that it's left is the continuous action scenes. And there are in fact too much action scenes. At the moment you think that there are mover, more enemies appear and the Avengers have to fight them all by themselves. The plot is getting quite confusing too, as things have to get in progress in order for the final battle to happen. So, 5 out of 10, because it seemed that the film would be a nice action movie with many of the well known heroes coming together, but the final result is very disappointing."

The ending was magnificent especially when the curtains closed on this ""stunning"" film and everyone started clapping in awe of the ""awesomeness"" that is packed into this ""phenomenal"" creation.

"xiao21","4","2","6","19 April 2014"," Highly overrated
","The Avengers might be a good follow up to five essentially unrelated movies that ties all the characters together, and it might have great action but it suffers at the hands of Joss Whedon, who should never be allowed near movies again.<br/><br/>The writing is corny and melodramatic. The villain has a cookie-cutter motivation (I want to get the MacGuffin so I can take over the world because I'm better) which seems to be the case in these films. Loki was entirely forgettable as a villain. The scenes between Black Widow and Hawkeye, and Phil Coulson and Nick Fury had cringeworthy dialog and delivery. One thing I noticed which I've never noticed before in a movie was that the lighting in all the indoor sections was really bad. It made everything look like it was from 2004.<br/><br/>Nobody acted well in this movie, but the three worst offenders were Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L Jackson, and Mark Ruffalo. All three are good actors/actresses, but Scarlett was completely wooden as Black Widow, Jackson was corny as hell as Fury, and Ruffalo reeked of a high schooler trying to remember his lines for the school play. All three of them have put in excellent performances before, especially Ruffalo in Zodiac, but here they all **** the bed. Robert Downey Jr. also put in his most obnoxious Tony Stark performance yet, mostly due to the horrible, unfunny one-liners he was given. That kind of sums up The Avengers: one-liners. Everyone, even the God of Thunder himself, mostly just spews one-liners at each other. Every character is Tony Stark. Even Captain America.<br/><br/>There were good things though: The fact that most of the conflict involved the Avengers and their in-fighting was a great idea. The action was really well done, especially the helicarrier scene in which everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong.<br/><br/>The Avengers had some good action and isn't that enough? Well, not it's not. Not when your movie is two and a half hours, an hour and a half of which being dialog. There are better movies in this series, like both Captain America Movies, the first Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk. If people like this movie, that's fine. I'm fairly picky so I'm probably being too hard on it. But to me, this movie is highly overrated much like the franchise in general."

However, the movie progresses very slowly, which is a bit frustrating for a movie packed with superstars and a runtime of two hours and 23 minutes. Although I appreciate the director's work in taking enough time to present the unique and complex personality of every character in the story. The cast also does a great job with the characters, and each of the superheroes gets their own chance to shine throughout the story, although you can see the director's unique passion towards the Iron Man and Hulk characters -- Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay and directed the film.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is long, but great!

The movie begins where Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Thor (2011), Iron Man 2 (2010) and the original movie, and The Incredible Hulk (2008) led us to, an assembly of 'Marvel"", a spectacle unlike any super-hero movie, or movie period has before. Loki, Thor's adopted brother, has come to earth via S.H.I.E.L.D tampering with a magic cube known as the Tesseract, which he in-turn steals from the agency along with converting Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) to the dark side with a magic spear he has brought with him. Nick Fury (Samuel L.

The 3D presentation is excellent, and really stands out during the climax, which I have to commend Joss Whedon and those responsible for setting it during the day, helping the 3D stand out.

","In the decade it's taken to bring everything together, we've continually been promised that the Avengers would be the superhero movie to change all superhero movies and it's a damn good thing, because I really hate superhero movies. Three things made this film standout and shine over the many, many superhero films that have been released. The most obvious thing is the huge, superstar, cast. Not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together, but to get them to work together, without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible. Second, even though the film involves superheroes and outer space, it seems somewhat realistic to us. These heroes have families, personalities, feelings, people get hurt, and some people even die, letting us see the human side of these characters. Finally, the Direction of Joss Whedon brings it all together. Whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things, at first it seems strange, but ultimately we come to love it. He is such an underrated Director, who brings so much to everything he's a part of, and it's great to see him get to do a huge project like this. The Avengers was special, not only because it took a decade to make, but because if you saw all the individual movies first, like I did, you feel a connection to these guys, it's almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together. The individual films really built up the excitement and helped the Avengers to become a billion dollar earner at the box office. From the performances to the special effects this was once exciting, terrific movie, and may be as close to perfect as a superhero movie will ever get."

","The Avengers definitely had the house riding on it. Marvel set up the film for success, releasing solo pictures of each character in the group with varying degrees of quality from pretty good (Iron Man) to terrible (Iron Man 2). Fortunately, the rest of those prequels were in the good to above average range, laying out a huge amount of hype for the granddaddy to outshine them all.<br/><br/>On that level, the Avengers definitely does not disappoint. It is a leading candidate for the best Marvel movie thus far (the other two being X2 and X-Men: First Class), showcased by an excellent script and easy chemistry between the ensemble cast. It would probably be expected to think that Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is in a league by himself here but he is actually outshined by Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleson (Bruce Banner/Hulk and Loki, respectively).<br/><br/>Ruffalo is spot on as Bruce Banner, bringing an easygoing nature to a role that was played with much more brooding by both Eric Bana and Edward Norton. The laid back-ness offers the yin to Hulk's destructive yang, adding needed context to the misunderstood hero's backstory.<br/><br/>Hiddleson continues to impress as the troubled Loki, thirsty to drink vengeance against his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and willing to enslave Thor's beloved Earth to do so. Most movie adaptations of Marvel villains are pretty simple affairs, but Hiddleson wills viewers to fully understand the depth of his hatred and propensity for chaos.<br/><br/>Chris Evans is fine as Captain America, although the fact that he plays the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four (another Marvel franchise) bothers me greatly. I'm sure there are other actors who can carry Cap's shield, so to speak. Samuel Jackson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson reprise their roles as Nick Fury, Hawkeye, and Black Widow to round out the crew and add another layer of bad ass-ness to the film.<br/><br/>The plot here is standard comic book fare: Loki has teamed with a group of alien baddies to steal the power of some sort of cosmic cube that Fury is hanging onto, and the Avengers need to stop him before the world goes to poop. It's not important to explain the story as much as it is to note that Joss Whedon is proving he is a master of the spectacular. Avengers is the type of summer movie the season is made for and fully worthy of the box office receipts it tallied."

","I believe that The Avengers was the most riskiest project ever. Marvel took 4 years to bring The Avengers to the Big Screen. It is not an easy job to make a movie with such iconic characters. Joss Whedon did a perfect job with these characters. Loki is my second favorite super villain of all time, next to Joker Of Course. After The Avengers I'm looking forward to all the Marvel Phase 2 movies. They are doing a great job not to mention Iron Man 3, It was a disaster. It is so much fun to watch these characters interact and Hulk steals this show like taking a candy from a baby. The dialogues were perfect and Yes The Avengers is Awesometacular!"

","This movie was good all the way through. When I first saw the trailers for Thor and Captain America, I didn't think the actors looked like they fit the parts. This movie has the advantage of coming out after we've already had time to see the individual movies, learn the origin stories, and get used to the actors and costumes. I still didn't think Chris Evans was a good choice, but by this point, I can look past it. It had to be really hard to find a way to make a character as unremarkable as Loki into a villain worthy of being the main antagonist, but I ended up really enjoying Hiddleston's performance. He might be one of those performers that I like watching in anything he does. The movie was long enough to feel appropriately epic, but never dragging. The visuals were all great, especially the technology. This movie, The Amazing Spiderman, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes all have science labs that look like they were designed by the same team, with lots of blue holograms and transparent screens. I hope everyone who worked on this one can all get it together for at least one more Avengers movie, because this one was really fun."

True, they may save the Earth, but I bet the property damages in doing so run into the billions. Any insurance guy watching this would have five simultaneous cardiac arrests, so if you fall into that category best to stay home and plan some more obnoxious ads for daytime.

Thor) utterly straight-laced persona. The clash of personalities and their different methods of dealing with the opposition just add to the fun, and Samuel L Jackson has his best role in ages as the eyepatched hard-as-nails leader who puts them together. There is also another member played by Scarlet Johansson called the Black Widow, but I apologise for saying that her part felt like tokenism to pacify all you feminists out there. Sorry, girls.

","I was fully expecting to not like this movie because I haven't thought much of Iron Man or Captain America movies, but the story behind this film was better than I expected. Also, you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie, especially Thor. Loki, Thor's evil brother, comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and it's up to the superheros to stop him. The Black Widow and Hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out. So basically, the heroes are chasing Loki around until the invasion when there is a huge battle at the end. The battle was cool with cool computer effects. This is when the Hulk gets to play his big part. But the main heroes in the film were Thor and Ironman, and Captain America gets to make a few decisions too.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: OK action flick, but you need to know about the previous superhero movies to get this one."
"tapio_hietamaki","8","2","6","1 March 2013"," A fun but forgettable match-up of superheroes
","The Avengers is a huge project considering the number of films leading up to it. Marvel's superhero flicks have been centered around a sexy cast and a fast-paced plot rather than emotional or intellectual depth, comparing poorly to Nolan's Batman films. The Avengers ends up being stronger than its predecessors in that it doubles the amount of fun with its superb character roster and has wittier dialogue, but falls short of a superhero masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film plays with the dynamics of the characters and the actors and uses humorous twists and Joss Whedon's trademark ""cut to"" technique to great effect. The first half of the film (after the pointless prologue) is a joy to watch -- it reminds me of the fun I had with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film. After that there is a lengthy war scene against generic alien invaders, during which the film doesn't lose focus from its character chemistry but starts to drag a little.<br/><br/>The plot is rubbish thinly disguised as philosophy (Loki's speech about human subordination). As the film is mostly constructed on visual and verbal gags, I feel it doesn't hold up on a second viewing -- after all, a joke is funny only on the first telling."
"tyler-cammalleri","10","2","6","25 November 2012"," The Good and the Bad
","The Avengers, is a movie that appeals to the senses. No not touch or taste, but with so many special effects, great sounds quality, and so many different scene set ups it makes you feel like you're actually there in the movie fighting alongside with The Avengers. Hey, you might even give yourself a super hero name to make you feel like one of the crew. Avenger's style is much different than many other super hero movies that there has been in the past. Marvel has struck gold with the concept that they have brought forth to the millions of fans of their superhero army. Every child had that one super hero that they wanted to be as a kid while they were growing up. Yeah Marvel has given each one of these heroes their fame separately, but that way is a thing of the past. What's better to hit two birds with one stone you might ask? How about ten birds with one stone? That's what The Avengers creators did when they brought together all of your child hood heroes into one movie. Just the idea is pure genius. Yeah a single character may appeal to wide audience but having multiple characters with millions of followers that would want to see their movie all together equals big money. So that's why the concept of this movie as a whole is a win for the Marvel Company. The way that all of the characters in this film were brought together was a great way to bring the viewer up to date. Even if the viewer didn't watch one Marvel movie or pick up a comic book before this could comprehend what was going on. Marvel introduced one character at a time so that the viewer would not get all jumbled up and they would also show where the character has been of that time, not just by plucking them from thin air. <br/><br/>Now on to the bad of the movie. It was very hard to find the bad in this movie but there were a few things that could be pointed out. The fact that Marvel decided to only go with a select few of their characters and not bring all of them into this movie could have been heart breaking for all of those Batman fans out there or even the little kid with his Spiderman underwear, but except for those few and very small details The Avengers is a must see."

","You're larger than life. You have abilities beyond that of most human beings on the planet. Then the world finds itself in peril and to save it, you'll need to join a group of people just as unique as you if not more so. What do you do?<br/><br/>S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is overseeing a top secret project designed to study an energy source from another world known as the tesseract. The experiment soon goes awry and the tesseract appears to explode. In actuality, it has opened a portal allowing the malevolent being known as Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) to emerge. It's almost immediately clear that S.H.I.E.L.D. is outmatched and what's worse, the supervisor of the tesseract project Dr. Erik Selvig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and experienced covert agent nicknamed Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner) became mindless drones under Loki's (Hiddleston's) command. Once the facility is destroyed and the invaders have moved on, Fury (Jackson) calls Agent Natasha Romanoff also known as the Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) to recruit one member of The Avengers. The Avengers Initiative was abandoned some time before the events depicted in this film, but is reactivated for the sake of mankind and for lack of a better alternative. Romanoff (Johansson) is next seen in India resorting to subterfuge to gain audience with Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo). Banner (Ruffalo) has gone into hiding to escape opportunists in the American government, to remain calm, to spare the world and those around him any damage he might inflict as The Hulk. Next to be approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. is Iron Man, Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr. in the character's third major film). The last member left to recruit is Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans), more commonly known as Captain America. When they're finally brought together, Banner and Stark are tasked with tracing the energy source and, in so doing, locating the enemy. When that's accomplished, they meet yet another traveler from worlds beyond, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), Loki's brother.<br/><br/>Now, I was not really a fan of Captain America: The First Avenger, nor was I altogether pleased after seeing Thor. As for Bruce Banner's larger half, perhaps it's impossible to make a film about the incredible hulk that I wouldn't like. First there was the Ang Lee/ Eric Bana film, then the Edward Norton film, both of which I enjoyed. Still, I did like Ruffalo. Also, Thor, Captain America, and the Black Widow made individual contributions to enrich the story. Hiddleston may not be as physically imposing as Chris Hemsworth, but as an egomaniacal extraterrestrial, he is truly terrifying. I can't comment on whether the 3-D effects added anything, as I saw it in 2-D, but regardless, The Avengers was incredible. The one thing I might say was lacking was Iron Man's best friend James Rhodes wearing an armored flight suit of his own and going by the name War Machine. We caught a glimpse of that suit in action in Iron Man 2 but it was nowhere to be seen here and I thought the film was worse off for it. Still, very exciting, highly entertaining, and one great ride. See it."
"sexy_iana_13","10","2","6","19 November 2012"," The Avengers
","A+ For The Avengers I must say from the film ""The Avengers"" I believe it is one of the best action hero movies ever made. I expected it to be a great movie for the simple fact that they had the Hulk , Thor , and several other big name heroes in it. But this movie really blew me away with how they constructed it. The way they brought all the characters together in the storyline , and had them all be able to connect and shows that each knew of each other already to me was amazing. The film also brought a lot of action and one on one fights. Which I believe everyone who is a fan of these films loved because the question is always asked who the best superhero is. But besides the fighting each other there were a lot of action in New York that just blows your mind, the nonstop adrenaline, anticipating what will happen next just have you on the edge of your seat, biting your finger nails. I believe the actors/actresses did an amazing job on portraying these characters. They really brought them to life and interconnect them. I personally never saw Thor the movie, but he brought it in this movie to where I didn't need to go watch that movie first. Thor and Hoki had a moment where it explains what they are and who they are. I like how they brought that out it really makes the film that much better. And also I like how when they go to recruit it shows a little about every person but not too much these characters were played at their best. Costumes and props where amazing, from iron man's new suits, to captain America actually still wearing his new suite in the current life. And Thors hammer that you believed was real from the sound effects. The Avengers brought there A game with this film. Creating a reflection, flying ship that looks invisible. The new technology they brought to this movie I would have never thought of. One last thing I liked how they showed the avengers departing and going back to their daily lives, but also leaves you to think maybe there will be another movie. Guess we will just have to wait and see for ourselves. But if so it also leaves you wondering just what will the second film be about since that just swept everything I've imagined it to be"
"johnwaidhofer","Null","2","6","9 November 2012"," 2012 Action Movie Blockbuster
","Amazing, revolutionary and exuberantly humorous are just 3 statements that describe this action packed but surprisingly complex plotted blockbuster movie. This film brings together the characters from the marvel comic book series ""the Avengers"" and gives you the action and effects of a big time movie but still gives you a comic book feel. When this movie came out I was swamped with work and did not have enough time for a movie. I worked hard and finally got a small window on a Friday night to see a single film. Luckily for me my friends were planning a fun night that included seeing ""the Avengers."" When they invited me I felt extremely lucky that this coincidently corresponded with my free time. When we got there I knew it was going to be a fantastic movie. Even though ""the Avengers"" had been out for weeks the movie theater was packed. Me and my friends got front row seats and experienced the full gripping action this movie had to offer. <br/><br/>This is definitely a movie to see with friends because of the humor. As people would expect (if they have seen the previous movies) Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) tells the most jokes. Many of these jokes are based off of rivalries such as the one that develops between Captain America and Tony Stark during the course of the movie. Captain America feels order is needed in the Avengers and that there should be a more established chain of commands. This conflicts directly with Tony Stark's spontaneous and freedom loving attitude. The clash results in humorous jiving comments from both heroes. There was also overall humor between all the character s making the movie wonderfully diverse.<br/><br/>Like all super hero movies there was an abundance of action. The difference that made this movie stand out however is the twisting storyline. In the beginning, you discover that Thor's brother, Loki, has received an ancient power from an alien race that is after the Tesseract, a cube of unlimited power that is in the United States possession. The strange otherworldly powers these creatures have and their forms give Marvel studios a chance to put their graphic arts to the test. Also producers had to use imagination and skill to fashion the battle scenes throughout the movie. Marvel made these scenes so that they feel like you are reading a moving comic book. The action scenes throughout the movie never disappoint.<br/><br/>While the action and humor of this film are good many people have complained that the beginning drags on a bit. Many super hero movies get right to the action while this one links all the Avengers stories. Before you see this movie I suggest to see the other origin Avenger hero movies. This will make the beginning more interesting. <br/><br/>Lastly, the deep plot is like the icing on top of the cake. This movie brings the attitudes of all the characters together and shows how they fit together. The main part of the story is about the characters finding out how they work together. You can even sympathize for the villain, Loki, who is always in his brothers shadow.<br/><br/>In the end, this is the best action movie I have ever seen. Even the second, third and fourth time I watched ""the Avengers"" I found some joke, underlying plot or important turning point that I hadn't seen. This multi-layered plot is the foundation of great movies. On the other hand many action movies have amazing structures or great affects and battles. It is very rare that you find one with both foundation and and a structure together in one move but one without the other is useless. ""The Avengers"" is a sturdy building that will survive a long time in the neighborhood of movies."

I saw this at the cinema (not in 3D) and I really enjoyed it. The way I put the trailer clips together into a story in went completely a different way which I was glad of. I enjoyed how they did it and how they brought them together and how they disagree and then find out they need each other. There are a few twists in this that I really wasn't expecting. The dialogue in this movie absolutely awesome and so funny, more jokes and hilarious quips than I expected which were really good. I'm glad it wasn't really bad and it was the complete opposite as there are no origin stories and it's just The Avengers. Even people who haven't seen the rest of the MCU I think will enjoy it as there isn't much depth and a lot is explained like why the Hulk is why he is and how they found Cap alive; so with very slight back stories and awesome plot I will get this DVD and everyone else needs to too!

","Yes, Stan Lee does have a short 'cameo' role in The Avengers. I re-watched the first 10 or so minutes after I had seen the whole movie, doing so helps put the whole story in perspective. <br/><br/>The USA, NASA, and the World Council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time, it allows a portal to a different part of the universe. When it gets a mind of its own in the lab, the mythical god Loki appears with a giant burst of energy, and right away we see he is up to no good. If he can position the energy cube outside, pointed to the sky, his legions will be able to enter and take over the Earth. <br/><br/>The main star, in a movie filled with stars, is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man. We also have Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Loki's brother, Scarlett Johansson (my favorite) as Natasha Romanoff and Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is good and sinister as Loki.<br/><br/>We eventually find out, after Tony Stark figures it out, that Loki's approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others, divide and conquer. Humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliens.<br/><br/>Of course there is lots of action, much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier. Then the final action is in Manhattan, with quite a bit of destruction. In the end it is Stark as Iron Man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead, steering it through the upper opening of the portal, destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle going.<br/><br/>Other key characters were Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, pretty Cobie Smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsg√•rd as the scientist Selvig, Samuel L. Jackson as facility head Nick Fury, and Gwyneth Paltrow back as Stark's girl Friday, Pepper Potts .<br/><br/>Overall a fine action comic book movie."

","This film can only be rated in contrast with other superhero movies and, as such, it's above average. The only way it can be described is a Marvel extravaganza. When one gladiator doesn't excite the crowd anymore, you bring out the whole ludus!<br/><br/>But of course, what many people forget about comic book superheroes is that they came from, well, comic books. They have stories that people have thought out long before there was any idea of making a movie. Not the best literature can provide, but something like character development and a plot. So if you bring all these stories together, you'd better be careful how you do it.<br/><br/>I am glad to say that The Avengers did not botch this. The story was reasonable. The fighting scenes were epic, even if totally unrealistic, the special effects grandiose, but not overly so. The motivational speeches and ridiculous pomposity down to a minimum and there were even some funny jokes in. All in all, I had fun watching the film."
"Pilsung89","8","2","6","23 June 2012"," This is how you make a superhero movie
","The Avengers is one of the better movies I have seen come out in a while. It had good characters, good directing, great action scenes, and a good story.<br/><br/>Never before have I seen Hollywood produce several movies, all intending to hype and lead up to a team-up movie. That's what happened here. The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man were all clearly made with this intention of eventually making a grand collaboration movie that featured the stars of each movie. This was a very risky move, but I do believe it paid off.<br/><br/>The story mainly follows the events that bring the Avengers together. Thor's brother, Loki, has come to Earth to claim a very object for an alien race and let them take over Earth in exchange for him becoming the new ruler. Of course, the previously mentioned superheroes come together one at a time in a bid to prevent this from ultimately happening.<br/><br/>Somewhat clich√© story, but the chemistry between the characters and the action is where it's at. Not only to all of the main stars do well in their roles, but they do a very good job interacting with each in ways that fit their personality. Tony Stark and Captain America clash over their conflicting virtues and lifestyles, everyone feels a bit wary of the Hulk because of how his powers work, and so on.<br/><br/>And the action scenes are downright incredible. This is a shining example of how one creates epic battles surrounding superheroes. The action scenes are grand, awesome, brutal, and entertaining as hell to watch. They are chaotic but you are always able to see clearly what is going on. Many action moves that create such massive battles just make cluttered messes that make it hard to see what is going on. Here, all the characters can be distinguished and they fight using their abilities to their advantages.<br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone. If you're a person that is not really into the comic book movies or the superhero flicks, this won't change your mind. It is a comic book adaptation and does not attempt to hide that fact, with the characters all wearing their colorful uniforms and such. Plus the story, while good, is rather clich√© and typical of a superhero style plot. <br/><br/>But if you are a fan of superhero films, action films, or comic book movies, this is an absolute must to watch. You will not be disappointed."

","While the Dark Knight with Christian Bale is possibly the best superhero movie of the 21st century, this first installment of the group of Marvel heroes known as the Avengers is a decent addition to the canon. Unlike other groups of superheros, such as the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, several of the Avengers were previously superheros in their own right in previous incarnations. The oldest is Captain America, who first appeared in the 1940's and fought against the Axis Powers during World War II. Both Iron Man and the Wasp appeared previously in Marvel's ""Tales to Astonish"" in 1962, and Thor appeared first in Marvel's ""Journey into Mystery"" also in 1962. The Hulk like Captain America appeared previously in his own comic book in 1962. Like the original comic book published in 1963, this film of the Avengers has them battling Thor's adopted and wayward brother, Loki, who are part of a race of beings called the Asgardians.<br/><br/>The film begins with American scientists working on a strange cube-shaped artifact, the Tesseract, which seems to have come from another dimension. We later learn it was discovered in the ocean. Nick Fury, a kind of CIA-agent superhero in the Marvel Universe (played by Samuel Jackson), heads the operation in a secluded compound which would give the Pentagon a run for its money. The Tesseract appears to have powers beyond the comprehension of the mere mortals who can't stop working on the darn thing. Of course that doesn't stop them from playing with something out of their league. Sort of the SF equivalent of the Rings from the ""Lord of the Rings"". <br/><br/>However, instead of taming the cube, the scientists inadvertently open a kind of portal to another dimension, the realm of Asgard, the world where Thor hails from. And out pops Loki, replete with a grin which would make Medusa turn to stone. The grin alone let's us know from the get-go the baddie of the story. He also wields a magical spear/sword thingie which either turns you to mush or makes you one of his zombie-minions. Like a boot squashing insects, Loki makes mince meat out of the operatives and their security, hypnotizes a few, not the least of which turns out to be the Green Arrow, grabs the Tesseract and then melts down their entire complex. All within less time then it takes to order and receive a cup of coffee at your local coffee shop.<br/><br/>Nick Fury engages the Avenger Initiative to bring the members together. Gradually, each of the superheros who will make up the Avengers appears, each engaged in some sort of situation which defines their character and their abilities. I thought that each of their situations were enough to let us know who they were and what kind of powers they have without dwelling on it too much. Eventually, Iron Man, Captain America, the Black Widow, and the Hulk are summoned to S.H.I.E.L.D., their headquarters a kind of flying aircraft carrier. <br/><br/>Their plan is to capture Loki and find the Tesseract. Natasha, a.k.a. the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and Captain America (Chris Evans) accomplish the first goal relatively easily when Loki infiltrates a party of the upper-crust in Stuttgart, Germany. At first he gets a whole crowd of Germans on their knees until Captain America stops the show. While on their way back, Thor comes flying out of the sky from Asgard and grabs Loki from out from under Iron Man. At first Thor and Loki have their deep discussion, avoiding such topics as the weather. Then Iron Man comes back on the scene, and he begins battling with Thor, contending he should stay out of their dilemma. Captain America interrupts their fight, and eventually Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D. which appears to be where Loki wants to be, and Thor accompanies them.<br/><br/>For me, this is where the fun really begins. When the members come together with their prisoner, they appear at odds with one another. The Iron Man, out of costume, begins a kind of rhetorical one-up-man-ship with Captain America. And the heroes begin taking different sides. Dr David Banner (aka the Incredible Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo when he isn't green) sides with Iron Man while Captain America and Thor appear to be at odds with everyone, although Nick Fury tries desperately to keep everything civil. We begin to learn this is part of Loki's plan, even though he is held captive. And yet he seems strangely complacent as if everything is working to his plan. From there, everything literally begins to unravel...<br/><br/>A great very entertaining installment in the Marvel Universe of 21st century films. All the cast members are terrific, but the best and most interesting lines, not to mention the most memorable moments, are between David Banner (the Hulk) and Iron Man. Captain America is just how you expect him, righteous in the morality department but rather one-dimensional in the rhetorical department. The only shortcoming I thought was the character of Nick Fury, who seemed like he needed a few more off-color lines, like Jackson's previous character in ""Pulp Fiction"". He seemed just a little too straightforward. The ending is foreshadowed somewhat in the middle but it all works. Definitely a must for Marvel fans."

","the movie we've all been waiting for. the movie we never thought we would. no doubt I'm talking about the avengers. it stars Robert Downey Jr. as iron man, Chris Evans as captain America, Chris hemsworth as Thor, mark ruffalo as hulk and now the highest box office actor ever Samuel l Jackson as nick fury. the story is about Thor's half brother Loki who is trying of course to take over the world. the story is flaud but then counter on it well because they talk more about the stories of the superheros and the things they must overcome. so its a smart way to counter on such a small story. the characters in the film are developed well. they take there time with the movie, which is why its two and a half hours long. at times it drags out but counters with highly entertaining action and special effects. Robert Downey Jr carries the film well and Samuel l Jackson being the veteran in the movie both give solid performances and care deeply about there characters. mark ruffalo gives us a hulk worth cheering for because of the lacking performances from Eric bana and Edward Norton. worth seeing no doubt currently out in theaters. see it."
"LoveYourMovies","8","2","6","26 May 2012"," The Avengers Entertainment Value Is Top Dollar
","Tremendous hype surrounding a movie can be a very good thing. Usually it guarantees some big box office numbers for at least the opening weekend. But this is not always the case. The downside to so much hype around a movie is that many people tend to make up their minds before even setting foot in the theater. When this happens it takes a very well made movie to up peoples expectations. <br/><br/>Three weeks ago one of the most hyped movies, if not the most hyped movie, of the year opened with The Avengers. Opening weekend in the US (it opened throughout the world the week before) broke every opening weekend recored, taking in $207 million. It would go on to make another $100 million in it's second weekend and cruise to $1 billion world wide in no time at all. This for all purposes, is a movie that lived up to the hype and more.<br/><br/>I chose to let the hype die down before viewing the movie for review purposes, so as not to get caught up in everything BUT the movie. Yesterday was the day to view The Avengers and try not to get caught up in the Avenger storm.<br/><br/>Based on the comic book which is a compilation of several different comic book characters, The Avengers is a secret team of superheroes put together should the world be on the brink of disaster. There wouldn't be much of a movie if the world didn't come to the brink of disaster when Thor's brother Loki comes to earth to obtain the most precious source of energy in the world known as the tesseract. When Loki controls the mind of some of S.H.I.E.L.D.s personnel to help with his sinister plot, director Nick Fury initiates the avengers program. After some difficult persuading the avengers do in fact come together. The movie climaxes with an epic battle throughout New York City.<br/><br/>With the possibility of this movie being an epic failure, director Joss Whedon was very fortunate to have actors from each of their respective characters films, with the exception of The Hulk who had two different Bruce Banner's but was superbly cast with Mark Ruffalo. The talent and good acting by each person in their roles helped tremendously with the success of this film. With Robert Downey Jr. all but leading the cast as Iron Man/Tony Stark in a role he has really come to own, each one was exactly who was needed for their roles. The introduction of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye was a great choice. He is on the rise in popularity and a fine actor in his own right.<br/><br/>The story is not one that is complex and difficult to follow. It is almost the quintessential superhero story line that has every twist and close call we have come to know and love with these types of movies. Don't look for a surprise ending but also don't expect to be bored with a plot line that is too simple. The purpose of this movie is the effects and action and just seeing a lot of favorite superheroes together at once and Joss Whedon executes that perfectly.<br/><br/>It is a fun exciting 2 1/2 hours and money well spent (for the 2D we did not see the 3D). It's everything everyone wants in a summer blockbuster movie. It is not hard to see why it is pulling in the money it is. It is just another case of giving the movie going audience what they want and making it well. <br/><br/>There is still the possibility that all the records that The Avengers has set could be short lived come the end of July when Christopher Nolan unleashes his final installment in the Dark Knight series. That aside, The Avengers, up to this point, is not only the best summer blockbuster but the best movie SO FAR this year."
"amitjusc","9","2","6","23 May 2012"," Smarter than the rest, better than the best
","Let me preface by saying that I am no fan of superhero movies, whether they be from DC or Marvel. I find that their biggest failing is that they have long action sequences that become dull because you simply cannot identify very deeply with the characters involved. This is usually a result of poor character development and hackneyed dialog. The abysmal Transformers movies and Star Wars prequels come instantly to mind (my wife and I almost fell asleep during the opening scene of Revenge of the Sith during the long, boring space battle). Fighting and action need context to have an impact on the more discerning viewer. The 13-year old version of me probably would have enjoyed the aforementioned movies, at least a little bit, but 34-year old me would rather scrape sandpaper over my eyeballs than be subjected to a pointless visual assault.<br/><br/>Now with the Avengers coming out, my wife and I decided that we should probably check it out for 2 reasons: Joss Whedon and Robert Downey Jr. When it comes to the superhero genre, Batman Begins and the first Iron Man sit at the top of our lists. Iron Man was funny, engaging and completely owned by Downey's personality. It was great fun and left the viewer with lasting thoughts and imagery. So with this being a Joss/Downey production for the most part (if you don't love at least some of Whedon's work, then you are not on my Christmas Card list), we were excited.<br/><br/>We watched all of the prequels, hating Iron Man 2 and the Edward Norton Hulk movie, but loving Captain America and Thor. J. Michael Straczinsky wrote the story for Thor, and it showed with it's depth and scale. We are huge Babylon 5 fans, so we simply had to see it. If you have yet to see The Avengers, the only absolutely necessary prequel is Thor. You really must see it for critical story elements to truly appreciate The Avengers. The rest of the prequels you can afford to miss, but Iron Man and Captain America are both great and it would help to some extent to see them before the Avengers. After seeing all of the prequels, we were ready to jump into the Avengers last night in 3D IMAX on a 72 foot screen (not that fake IMAX Experience crap on a 25 foot screen). And we had a grand ole time.<br/><br/>The movie pretty much starts where Thor left off, story-wise, and quickly advances the plot. Whedon ably does this while developing the myriad characters within. By the time the obligatory massive action sequences occur, you are ""all in"" and right there with these heroes. I would much rather see story than action, personally, but the balance was well handled and kept the user engaged at all levels throughout. Humor and drama were well balanced as well, with every character bringing some humor, but Downey stealing the show as he was destined to do. We were never bored and the 2 and half hours flew by. My wife is a big Neil Gaiman fan and she felt the the actor who played Loki did a near perfect job in both Thor and The Avengers. <br/><br/>Whedon is the new ""King of the World""<br/><br/>9/10 - almost perfect"
"Mr_Piggles","6","2","6","23 May 2012"," Very fun, but overall - just more 'fluff'
","So i finally got to see this earlier today after weeks of hearing about how great it is and how its breaking box office records... blah blah blah. I watched the trailer (several times) and thought it looked like 'fun', then it opened and people were saying how much of a 'great film' it actually is - so my interest started to grow from 'will watch it at some point' to 'i need to see what the fuss is about' - and thats what i did this morning.<br/><br/>All the characters work out great, especially the sparring relationship between Thor and The Hulk, as well the bickering between Captain America and Iron Man.<br/><br/>Direction wise... meh... by the numbers with a budget this big and the resources available with that sort of money. However it's the films script that really shines. So tightly written there's no throw-away dialogue.<br/><br/>I think what people have gotten so excited about is the 'eye candy' over anything else and this film is beautiful to look at - but looks fade very quickly and this will soon be added to the pile of CGI heavy films that look kinda dated and hammy compared to the 'next big thing' Overall. Nice to look and a great script, but lacks the weight and enduring impact it should have. I understand Iron Man 3 comes out next year and that will no doubt eclipse the memory of this. Like i said in the title. It's just more 'fluff'.<br/><br/>6/10"

This has to be one of the best comic book based movie i have Ever seen the main villain is no Heath Ledger-Joker but Loki does work as the main Antagonist I think maybe there Should have been other well known Marvl villains in the movie. All the Characters work well Robert Doweny Jr and Samuel L Jackson were At there best. A first the team can't get along this is just what Loki wants he lets himself get captured to sabotage the group anyone who knows anything about Loki knows no mortal prison can hold him. Thor start off a odds with the rest of the Avengers because he wants Loki to face justice in Asgard Loki wants to start a war against Earth using a power cube. The battle at the end was amazing there are so many action scenes this is what superhero action movies are all about its not dark and edgy it's a fun ride.

"The_creator2010","10","2","6","21 May 2012"," The Avengers finally assemble on the orders of Nick Fury!
","There was no secret of the highly populated cast in the lead up to the Avengers, taking into account the hype since the release of Iron Man in 2008. The success of Iron man was followed by a sequel in 2010. Fans of the Super Hero franchise where greeted with the release of two more comic book movies, Thor and Captain America. The question was, could the Avengers succeed as a whole? <br/><br/>Nick Fury (Jackson) recruits Iron Man (Downey Jr), Thor (Hemsworth), and Captain America (Evans) as well as newcomer Mark Ruffalo as the HULK! The super group also consists of two newbies to the big screen, Black Widow is played Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (The next Bourne?) <br/><br/>The world is under threat following the arrival of Loki, a citizen of Asgard, another Universe (Thor 2011). <br/><br/>Loki is the brother of Thor, although both would agree the distance between them is not exaggerated. It is Loki's attack on S.H.I.E.L.D that leads to a crucial decision by Nick Fury, leader of the affiliation. The desperate attempt involves regrouping something stronger than Loki and his army of Cohorts, The Avengers! The movie has a nice feel to it with a brilliant intro of what's to come. Those who have not seen previous movies won't suffer too much but it does consist of some flashbacks regarding Captain America.<br/><br/>The storyline is put together smartly and manages to keep the balance in relation to the numerous egos on board. As Loki is the one at large it feels the story is based off of Thor but does well in blending all characters. As always, Robert Downey shows class as the arrogant, yet hilarious Tony Stark and the ever so cheesy Captain America (Evans). Fans will enjoy the rivalry between both Captain America and Iron man, as personalities quickly collide before they realize the moral of the story is team-work.<br/><br/>The return of Loki was a great choice as he made for a terrific bad-guy in Thor and the collision between family is still fun to watch. Although Loki seemed a handful in the release of Thor in 2010, Nick Fury and the Avengers get caught completely off guard with Loki and his mind boggling army! The introduction of a third Bruce Banner is, unfortunately frustrating for some. But when the Hulk is transformed, nobody notices. Yes, a third. Mark Ruffalo plays the man with the temper. Following Eric Bana and Edward Norton (My favorite by the way), Mark Ruffalo as Dr Banner had a challenge on his hands. Is there information on why Edward Norton was not included instead? I believe if he was, performance on the bases of acting would have been better than Mark Ruffalo. But just like I said, in relation to the Avengers, fans just want to see the Hulk tear people, buildings and valuable things apart! and that is just what he does! My favorite was Bruce Banner...when he was green.<br/><br/>My knowledge in Marvel limits, but I wonder what fans made of Hawk-eye and Black Widow? Both characters, like the rest were highly entertaining. Jeremy Renner is leading an exciting future and Scarlett Johansson...well, just do what you do best!... Not forgetting Samuel Jackson, even though he has been forgettable in the past. He gives fans an enjoyable performance, curse free. Mr Jackson just needs to choose his movies carefully in my opinion. He has been in some woeful movies lately.<br/><br/>The action and CGI makes the Avengers what it is. In comparison to Captain America (Which I despised) and even the previous CGI Hulk, this blows them out of the water. You noticed I excluded Both the Iron Man and Thor movies, the Avengers is still early release and is yet to be decided, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The Avengers is up there with the greatest super hero movies ever made. Audience from generations will enjoy the Avengers. Whether you are unfortunate to see this movie in 3D or stay classy with 2D, one must see immediately! The Exciting question for the future is, What is next to come? Well we know Iron Man 3 and a Thor sequel is in writing. Unfortunately Captain America also, and possibly a new Bruce Banner? who knows. In relation to an Avengers Sequel? now that's getting carried away!<br/><br/>Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/"

"NPThirteen","10","2","6","21 May 2012"," Marvel Avengers Assemble (12A)
","In 2008, we were treated to a post-credits scene at the end of Iron Man, featuring Samuel L. Jackson making his first appearance as S.H.I.E.L.D. leader, Nick Fury. This small, minute long clip confirmed one thing; an Avengers movie was happening. So here we are. Four years, five films and one name change later, we have Avengers Assemble. So: was it worth the wait? In short; yes. Now, you'd think that in a film with so many big stars that some of them would end up being sent to the sidelines, but every single character gets their moment to shine. The only person that does feel a little underused is Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, but given his role in the story, it's understandable, and he still makes an impact. He could certainly give Katniss Everdeen a run for her money. The Hulk hasn't really had much luck when it comes to the big screen, currently on his third actor in just under ten years, but Joss Whedon and Mark Ruffalo have managed to bring the Hulk to the big screen in possibly the best way possible, and it's mostly all down to Ruffalo's damn good acting. He's the first actor to portray both Banner AND the ""Other Guy"" in the same film, and that's a major benefit to have the Hulk actually look like his human counterpart this time, whereas the versions from Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and Louis Leterrier's 2008 The Incredible Hulk were both just a big, green CGI mess. Alas, there are some downsides to every film, and Avengers Assemble is no exception. The opening pre-credits scene does feel a little unsure, and the middle act drags a little bit. It was entertaining, but I did find myself wondering how long they were going to spend on the Helicarrier before something interesting happened. Finally, I arrive at the 3D. It wasn't particularly that impressive if I'm honest. I stopped noticing it after about twenty minutes (though that probably proves just how good the film was) apart from in a select few scenes, and even then, the screen is too jumbled. Every time you blink, your eyes need to re-adjust to the image, and it becomes blurry. I'd say that, if you have the extra money, go for 3D, but if you opt for a 2D viewing, you won't miss much, and you'll save some money! Apart from the minor niggles, a pretty much perfect film. *****"

","Well if there were any short-comings offered by this movie, the superb cast and their excellent performances hid them. Additionally, I am certain there were massive egos to contend with, but the director (Joss Whedon) did a superb job keeping that aspect in tow. I can't say this movie was well worth the astronomical cost per person, nor the wasted time watching TV commercials ‚Äì but it had more value-for-the-buck than some of the other tripe I sat through in the past.The storyline was fast paced; the CGIs did not outperform the actors/actresses, and the pontifications were eclipsed by things blowing up and all those awful bad guys getting their butts kicked. I gladly spent the big bucks to see it in the theater and will purchase a DVD copy (that way I can watch it a few more times without breaking the bank). This was an excellent swan-song for, 'The Avengers'. On that note¬Öwould I suggest a sequel? No way! Why spoil a good thing? Let these stars/characters exit on a positive note, as American - wait not just American - BUT World heroes, instead of a bunch of drum-banging narcissists, supporting some whimsical divisive Hollyweird agenda, that only they can afford to care about. Sorry ‚Äì that is such a sour note to end with. Good job or Bravo-Zulu one and all."

"fighter2","7","2","6","19 May 2012"," Action Satisfaction
","Overall, this film delivers and this compliment comes from a Marvel fan. Though each individual hero remains true to character from their singular franchise, the film is nearly a live action cartoon. There is a humanism that live action brings to screen that animation lacks; It's called emotion, and Marvel's ""Avengers"" noticeably void of it. <br/><br/>Regardless of that critique, no one goes for these types of films for ultra realism, but more so for the production value. Great action choreography, Johanssen is terribly hot in black leather, plenty of explosions and the Hulk does what he does best: ""SMASH"". The idea of some of my favorite hero's banding together, overcoming inter personal differences during a time of dire need and ultimately saving the day left me satisfied. This one is a must see and I recommend paying the extra to watch it in 3D. BTW, don't forget to hang around until the FULL EXTENT of the credits have passed. There are two additional scenes, one of which gives clues to a sequel and if you're a Marvel Fan, you'll be giddy as a school girl with a bag of lolly pops when you see it."
"naraidong","10","2","6","18 May 2012"," Chemical mixture of triumph
","Putting the quote of Dr. Benner in an ironic manner, this movie simply stands out as this year's mega-hit with the perfect chemical mixture of high ordered success, not chaos. I was not into the whole comics business my entire life, but I always enjoyed Marvel characters coming alive on screen. But how could I have imagined that the admirable characters who were all awesome on their own, could have even more impact all gathered together? <br/><br/>To be honest, no matter how much i want to whine about the very predictable storyline that could potentially be the only flaw in this movie, I gotta say, even the storyline is one of the element that makes this movie glorious. I mean, come on, this is comics!! It would actually be foolish to expect a complicated storyline. If the plot was too complex with twists and all, then we can't focus on characters. Marvel was smart in that they kept the plot simple and sweet for this grand movie with so many great characters - heroes defeat the bad guys. No mind games.<br/><br/>Now then, our heroes... My gosh!! the untamed and invincible Hulk with surprisingly advanced brain, proud first avenger Captain America with super strength and mighty shield, the one and only sassy genius/mechanics master Iron man, mighty Thor The God and Guardian of Earth, handyman Hawkeye the archer, and the sneaky spies Black Widow and Nick Fury... So we got all combinations - handiness, brain, super strength, persuasive skills, oh and a finishing touch of invincibility. When put together, they obtain the perfect equation for the dream team. I think the thrill and the excitement comes from this perfect combination - filling in the lacking 2% from each character.<br/><br/>And of course, the coming together of these characters and the exceptional chemistry of the team has to come from superb acting that contributes to creating genuine and believable characters that may even delude audience into thinking they are for real. Especially for Mark Ruffalo, I gotta apologize to Ed Norton, he did a better and marvellous job of portraying the complete opposite of Hulk state - a quiet and introverted genius whom you could never guess to be the most wild and hot tempered monster. And Robert, Robert, Robert... He is simply a darling as always, smooth talking and adding the perfect comic relief at the right moments - but never losing his cool as Iron Man when he's on duty. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie would be a legend to comics fans!!! Loved loved loved it!!"

","They have prepared us for this movie for years. The characters have been in their own movies and now the Marvel Comics gang all fight evil as a team. (Well, sort of.) If you have been hiding under the ""marketing hype rock,"" I will fill you in. After Loki (Thor's little brother) pops in for an earthly visit, Nick Fury, the director of an international peace keeping agency, rounds up Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. Their object, of course, is to save the world from Loki's very nasty army.<br/><br/>And that is what happens. This movie is just what you'd expect, and you get 142 minutes of escapist fun. As this film approached opening day, I was concerned that it would not live up to its hype and that there might be too many characters to follow. I realized about five minutes into it that this was not the case. This film has a good script, good (but not great) special effects and an all-star cast that managed to work together very well. There are funny one liners, lots of action and great direction from Joss Whedon.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is a standout as Ironman, and Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. While Chris Evans is back as Captain America, he seemed much more understated than he did in his debut move. Maybe he was tired from being frozen for all those years. I felt the same about Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner (The Hulk.) Tom Hiddleston gets lots of extra creepy points as the demented Loki, and Scarlett Johansson will amaze you as Natasha Romanoff (aka Black Widow).<br/><br/>And let's not forget Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury (I want his coat) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the sexy Pepper Potts.<br/><br/>We all know Stan Lee has a cameo in every ""Marvel Movie."" In this one look for him when he appears during a ""news"" segment, ranting about superheroes.

"Marvelouis","10","2","6","17 May 2012"," The most ambitious comic book film of all time, and that ambition paid off... THE BEST EVER!
","Avengers was the most ambitious comic book film of all time, and that ambition paid off. It's NOW the best comic book film of all time bar none. No one involved in this production seemed to take anything for granted. Everyone (actors, FX people, writers, director, etc.) all brought their A-game. It truly is the gem they had promised and truly is a worthy holder of the crown.<br/><br/>Joss managed to reintroduce characters that we all love, make them seem fresh, make them seem new, and then having them all together without weighting any particular character more than the other. He's the master! My favorite critic quote that points this out: ""The result is a kitchen sink movie that doesn't feel confused or messy. It's a genuinely thrilling spectacle with just the right amount of depth, laughs, humanity and maybe a few more explosions for good measure."" I can't wait to see this over and over and over again."
"n-sullivan788","10","2","6","17 May 2012"," Awesome!!!!!
","Brilliant film! This film has good action and quite a few laughs. Joss Whedon is a master of films. A must watch. I love the way they brought all the characters together. Awesome movie. It's great how they placed all the connections in the other movies that led to this movie! Tony stark is hilarious. Black widow is fit(and a great hero). Bruce banner is an absolute hero. Thor is a legend. Captain America is a great guy, if it wasn't for him it probably wouldn't of worked! And You've gotta love hawk eye. It's funny how they all seem to be unbreakable(such as walking out of a crashed plane with no injuries). look forward to the sequel! Typical marvel to have the bit after the credits. But it was essential."

","This was always going to be better than most summer blockbusters. Because it has continued from established successful films of the Iron Man series using Robert Downey Jr and although the Thor movie wasn't as good ( it had a lot to live up to) it was good enough and Tom Hiddleston'es Loki was an attractive feature for his exceptional performance.<br/><br/>The saying is too many cooks spoil the cooking or such like or putting to many eggs in one basket which is the risk in this film as it is full of superheros about 8 has a film ever been loaded with so many? Inevtitably the film cannot go into detailed back story of each character. But the director does try to balance giving each character some previous life which explains leading to their current union.<br/><br/>The reason why there has to be so many heroes all together is that Loki has a sinister plan and being a god it is more sinister than usual requiring the combined forces of many heroes to stand any chance of defeating him.<br/><br/>What's the film actually like? Its the best adventure movie this year. As expected the CGI and special effects are top of the range, but thats doesn't stop Transformers from sucking. Its a proper director that makes a he difference. Joss Whedon directs this and has an amazing track record. What made his 'Buffy' memorable on television was the emphasis on writing and character. Its a clich√© but the fact that he's British and not an American only interested in budget and what special effects can do may be the major factor.<br/><br/>Whedon's writing and demanding that actors do actually act instead of being cardboard cutouts makes this movie better than any action adventure movie who will see this year. He includes the psychological factors that the team have very different personalities one of them exploding into green when a bit upset- Mark Ruffalo's Hulk which is the best performance since the 1970's television series. Hulk, Thor and Tony Stark are the one's who don't know what rules are and get things done their way. Why should a god listen to puny earthling laws? Tony Stark wouldn't be Stark if he didn't do things his own way.<br/><br/>Captain America and the other names which people would be less familiar with unless they are Marvel fans follow protocols and command structures. Necessary for Captain American defending the American Way.<br/><br/>The film is a success in every department technical, acting, writing and directing. See it now."
"sketchgirl91","9","2","6","16 May 2012"," Review of reviews
","This isn't a 9/10 review to talk about how glorious and amazing this movie was. It's not to go off on a shpiel about how much I loved the Avengers and how I've seen it 3+ times already. I came on IMDb to see how the reviews were going and was frustrated by all the negative reviews I sought out to see what insults and injuries people could inflict upon this film because their ""higher standard of cinematic experiences"" has made them ""immune"" to ""idiotic, tasteless"" movies like the Marvel movies. <br/><br/>First off, the thing I keep reading that is making me rage is reviewers comparing the movie to movies that have made the top 100 movies of all time. You cannot compare a comic-based action movie with the Shawshank Redemption, Shindler's List or the Godfather. They're just not in the same ballpark. If you want a serious movie with moving characters, deep plot lines and your precious scenery, why're you going to movies like Avengers, Thor and Iron Man?<br/><br/>Granted, The Dark Knight was also based on comic books and they actually are very moving and serious, but that's just the direction Christopher Nolan decided to take with the DC comic. It's predecessors however, were just as corny, flashy and lame as you claim Marvel to be. Not every superhero film has to be cheesy, and clich√©, but they all can't be dark and depressing like the Dark Knight either. Most of the comics put our favorite heroes and villains in a humorous light and I'm glad Avengers made me laugh more than I thought it would. I didn't want to be traumatized the whole movie like I was with Dark Knight (good traumatized, mind you).<br/><br/>Secondly, I've been seeing the movie being compared to movies that everyone else thought were fantastic, ones that I and others I know thought were absolute garbage (i.e. X-Men: Origins, the Spider-Man trilogy, etc.) Don't be biased in your review. Don't talk down to everyone else who loved it by saying that another movie was better (and that, again, many and more regard as a waste of time), degrading your own review since people will now see what bad taste you have, therefore leading others to believe you're no one but a bitter, cynical grouch who cannot be cinematically pleased no matter what.<br/><br/>Thirdly, seeing a movie solely based on it's reviews is just brainless. If you hate action movies, or romantic comedies, but saw that a new release got great reviews... why would you go see what you're very likely to dislike? Especially since you're biased in your opinion of the subject matter in the first place. Save your ""grudge against all mankind"" for movies you actually care to waste your time on.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm sorry a lot of bad reviewers see those of us who loved Avengers as ""low I.Q., stupid, brainwashed idiots"". I'm sorry we don't always crave movies with nothing BUT plot, in depth characters, history and challenging puzzles to exercise our brains. Though admittedly, there ARE a lot of people out there that are like sheep with the Marvel movies that go to be entertained like an infant with keys being shaken in front of their faces. Don't speak about Marvel-lovers as a whole like that. Some of us are capable of loving all kinds of genres and movie types. Some even watched it for the sentimental value of being reminded of our childhoods; the fact that our comic book characters have been brought to life alone was enough to make us happy. I adore my cultural movies, but at one point, I just really wanted to see a bunch of robots fighting when I saw Transformers 3. I was tired of twisted, hard to follow plot. Just...wanted to see some robot brutality for a change.<br/><br/>What makes me appreciate the Marvel movies all the more is the fact that Stan Lee is directly involved, like he always is with the movies based on his comic books. The fact that the Marvel movies get his stamp of approval makes me confident that the movie has lived up to the creator's expectations and that if he believes it portrays the worlds he has created accurately enough for his fans, then that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>As a closing statement, Tom Hiddleston literally is a god. His performance was spectacular, phenomenal, stellar; he cut a breathtaking figure on the silver screen and I was drawn into his character the second he was birthed through the Tesseract at the beginning of the film."

","Ahhhhhhhhh! I watched it yesterday and yeah so late cause of my exams but what a great choice it turned out to watch the movie after all.... Speaking of 3D effect their's no doubt its one of the best after likes of Avatar and Tintin... Now talking about the storyline well it isn't something special just same old story but the execution makes it a different experience. Mark Ruffalo as HULK was incredible and no need to say about Iron Man (the coolest superhero of all). I liked the verbal fight between Iron Man and Capt.America.... Agent Hawk and Black Widow were good and Thor and capt.America were also good . But for me as i told before Hulk and Iron man were best. To put end to this review one line from the movie, Capt America to(Iron man): What are you without your Suit? Iron Man: A Genius ,a Billionaire ,a Playboy and -----.

","I feel this is going to be the summer of adult children because after seeing this movie I felt like a kid all over again, great story line great characters, excellent actors....if they could only get this right in scary movies. I read a review recently that said Samuel L Jackson's character wasn't good enough, I am not sure what they were looking for but he fit the bill for me, honestly this is a movie you and your kids will enjoy and you might want to see it 2-3 time just because it is butt kick-in' AWESOME!!!!!!!<br/><br/>All of the characters were great, but I definitely recommend you watch THOR first before going to see Avengers, because then the story line really engulfs you, has you on the edge of your seat the entire time, only other hero I was looking for was, the gatekeeper from Thor, one hell of a character in that one so he really would have brought the business in Avengers, but that just makes you want an even better movie next time."

","Avengers is what happens when people who are best in their class, unite . The wittyness of Robert Downy and the shear and raw strength of Hulk keeps you asking for more . Other heroes such as Hawk and Capt'n America could have been better but still they slip in at the right spot . Even if you haven't watched any of the previous movies containing these characters , the movie provides enuf mateial to chew for them . Even it makes you go home and watch these movies once (atleast Iron man for sure) .Its only in the big screen that you are able to see the actual might of the tech. , this movie is made with . Skip the torrents and watch it on the larger curtain . You'll never regret it that's for sure. All in all a must watch . Could have been better if was made in IMAX format rather than 3D bcuz it has those large screen scenes that look fantabulous in IMAX . Hoping to see the larger Avenger group in forthcoming sequels (if they overcome the copyright issue with Sony) ."
"newkidontheblock","8","2","6","15 May 2012"," The Avengers Lives Up to the Hype
","***This may include spoilers***<br/><br/>Let's make something clear: there's nothing wrong with special effects. Not every movie can, or should, be as low key as My Dinner with Andre. Sometimes, big explosions are necessary to advance the plot. The problem is that blockbusters tend to be high on special effects but low on story. The Avengers, though, found a way to balance both beautifully into a fun and engaging film <br/><br/>I'm not an expert on the Marvel universe, so I went into this film with only rudimentary knowledge of the heroes involved. I can't vouch for the accuracy of their portrayals by their actors. I still found myself interested in them and their stories. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson reprise their respective roles and played them perfectly, while Mark Ruffalo appeared as the third man to pay the Incredible Hulk in a decade and probably the best of the three. All six played their parts appropriately well, though Downey stole the show with his larger than life portrayal of Tony Stark that may define his already impressive career as an actor. <br/><br/>Every good superhero movie has to have a good antagonist and The Avengers delivers with the manipulative, quick witted, cocky, yet insecure, Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. The tension between him and his adoptive brother Thor, made for a fascinating and sometimes heart breaking sub plot in the middle of a rock 'em, sock 'em action movie like this one. Loki's inferiority complex and obsession with power was a perfect contrast for Thor's maturity and desire for peace, not only in the world, but with his brother.<br/><br/>The Avengers did have a bit of a predictable story, but it worked in this instance. Sometimes that predictability is comforting and helps one immerse him/herself in the universe of the film. You find yourself actively rooting for the heroes and scowling whenever the villain appears on the screen. That stark contrast between good and evil can inspire groans, but if executed properly can reach an innocent, juvenile side of us that doesn't need complex anti-heroes or thought provoking character studies. Sometimes we just want to see good triumph over evil against extremely unlikely odds. This movie does just that. Don't be surprised if you catch yourself walking out of the theater feeling like a 10 year old kid wanting nothing more than to be your favorite of the six heroes. <br/><br/>While this isn't a modern day classic like the Dark Knight, it's a solid superhero film that lives up to its immense hype.<br/><br/>Oh, and when you go, don't forget to stick around after all the credits are finished. You're in for a surprise."
"Tikay777","9","2","6","15 May 2012"," What I liked about Avengers
","I was waiting for the Avengers ever since I heard that they would make a movie with this theme and scenario. Having watched all the previous films with the superheroes that supposedly would form the first Avengers team (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk) I have to admit that I was very anxious as some of them didn't quite leave up to my expectations. Although to be honest my expectations sometimes can be quite high.<br/><br/>The movie didn't disappoint me at all. The lines and the acting of everyone involved I think were ranging from very good to exceptional. The movie doesn't bore you with the background of its characters since you are supposed to be already aware of their past. And the combat scenes I think that they had the right amount of humor and action to make them a fan's wet dream.<br/><br/>Therefore I highly recommend to everyone, fan or no fan to watch it.<br/><br/>And now all we have to wait is Prometheus and Dark Knight Rises :)"
"martinrobertson300482","9","2","6","14 May 2012"," Hulk ..... Smashhh!
","As someone who had kind off lost faith in where this ""Marvel superhero"" series was going, I've got to admit to being pleasantly surprised by ""The Avengers."" I Suppose I shouldn't be. All the other movies (especially the lame ""Captain America"") main purpose was to lead up too this. So off course this was always going to be the biggest event, and most well organised flick.<br/><br/>Movie sees Iron man, Captain America, Thor and the Hulk thrown together too battle the bad guy from ""Thor,"" who's managed to get his hands on the weapon from ""Captain America."" Right? ..... It is a bit hard to follow at first if your not a die-hard fan off the previous movies. But once it gets going, every character is served well, and the action is imaginative and non-stop.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" is also pretty damn funny. Robert Downey Jnr is his usual wise cracking self. But unlike in the ""Iron man"" movies, the humour is perfectly balanced with the action. Thor and Captain America don't seem as lame as they were in their own movies, and my personal favourite Hulk, is still the greatest, and is played almost better than in previous versions here by Mark Ruffalo.<br/><br/>The Only minor problem I have with the movie is that everyone seems just as indestructible as each other. I mean, isn't Hulk suppose to be the only ""unstoppable"" force? Seems even Scarlett Johansson as the powerless Black Widow is unstoppable. Still, I'd go as far as saying ""The Avengers"" is maybe even the best Superhero movie ever. Its refreshing too see as many characters as this thrown together successfully. Its so much better than the sum off its parts. Totally entertaining and Awesome!"
"jadepietro","8","2","6","12 May 2012"," The Real Super Pac
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Like those silly late-night infomercials found on cable television stations nationwide, with their cut-rate deals and instant add-ons used to entice any viewer to immediately buy into their product while supplies last, we unassuming consumers are there as gullible pawns bombarded by all the hype and promotion for the first of many summer blockbusters, namely Marvel's The Avengers, a movie that safeguards its Marvel franchise by adding, not one, not two, but six popular superheroes into the mix of action, fantasy, and adventure. The question remains: Is it worthy of your time and hard-earned cash, or just another disappointing come-on?<br/><br/>Well, without any warranty or guarantee, I can safely state that The Avengers exacts its vengeance upon all those other lackluster dim-witted comic book archetypes that sullied the name of its genre in the past, with dreck that was recently foisted on the movie-going public, in films like The Green Lantern, Watchmen, and Captain America. Well...WHAMM! BAM! KAPOW!... <br/><br/>This highly entertaining film knocks it out of the park, with one fell swoop of its mighty hammer, American shield, and its major muscle action. This pic uses its well defined pecs again, to right that injustice, thanks to the superpowers of its director / director, Joss Whedon and Industrial Light & Magic. The film is all action sequences strung together to elicit enough excitement for the fan-boys and teenage crowd and still amuse the older set.<br/><br/>A team of super humans, mutants, and even a demi-god have been assembled to save the Earth from destruction, a simple but overused formula that sets the stage for explosions, chases, and super effects. S.H.I.E.L.D. ( Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division, with an emphasis on the E and not much evidence of the L word ), run by Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ), who wears an eye-patch and a scowl so you know he's a serious threat, enlists the aid of Ironman ( Robert Downey ) Captain America ( Chris Evans ), and the mighty Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ). Also joining the crew for this outing are Mark Ruffalo as the introspective Bruce Banner aka The Hulk, a welcome addition, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, with his never-ending illogical supply of arrows, and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, a kick-butt in-your-face heroine, as they fight against the evil Loki ( Tom Hiddleston ), ready to unleash his lethal ball of gamma rays or, more precisely, his blue energy cube known as Tesseract, the McGuffin of the story. That's all you really need to know. There's not much depth of character, dramatic readings, or intricate plot in this type of movie genre. Let's face it, it's all about the action set pieces, the clever one-liners, and the CGI that you've come to see. And there's plenty of that!<br/><br/>Fortunately, this group of ""freaks"" take their loner status personally and Whedon wisely deals with their individual ""uniqueness"" in clever ways, having some of the superheroes relishing their powers while others question their calling. These personalities have nothing in common, except for wielding their power and zingers at random. Yet they are forced to unite, for the good of mankind, and become a team in this Super Bowl of Mayhem.<br/><br/>The production values are top-notch and the use of 3-D is quite effectively done with its subtle use of foreground, middle, and background perspectives. Kudos to cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and the fine art direction by James Chinlund. The film is also enhanced by Alan Silvestri's musical score that never overpowers its imagery and impressive use of sound editing that layers the lively action on screen.<br/><br/>The actors bring much humor and grace to their characters and their quirks, especially strong are Johansson as the red-haired leather-clad dynamo and Ruffalo, who underplays his role as the conflicted green menace to maximum effect, although I still have a problem with The Hulk's expandable pants malfunction. ( There is one unexpected comic scene during the climactic battle that may become a classic cinematic moment. ) Downey's urban egotistical playboy hero and Evan's clean-cut and slightly dopey Captain make good contrasting foils in their approach to problem-solving. In his underwritten role as Thor, Hemsworth is not given much complexity this time around. Perhaps, most importantly, the villain of the story is played by Hiddleston, who has perfected a smarmy sneer of a smile, reminiscent of Ledger's Riddler without the jungle red lipstick and whiteface make-up. He makes a terrific villain, which needs to be the case if a film like this is to succeed.<br/><br/>And succeed it does. While it is true that too much of the film is the typical crash and burn found in action films nowadays, and much of the clash and combat sequences are of the titanic variety and go on for far too long, Marvel's The Avengers is one of the better examples of comic book fantasy films that not only engages but completely satisfies its movie-going audiences with its excellent visual effects and thrills. As a film, Marvel's The Avengers is an efficient marvel of filmmaking that lives up to its own hype. KAPOW! GRADE: B<br/><br/>NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com"
"ayoreinf","8","2","6","13 May 2012"," Real good fun movie, the way fun movie should be
","The Avengers is a fun movie, fun to watch with no feeling of shame for liking it. The plot itself might not be a masterpiece, but the characters are all very well written, some even better than in the movies that originally presented them, and good actors can do wonders with well written characters. The special effects are as good as we recently came to expect them and the pace is just perfect for the film, which is much to say for an action film that lasts more than two hours. I especially liked the performance of Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, and Tom Hiddleston is also very impressive as the very evil Loki, but almost every one on screen does a good professional job, which has a lot to do with the way the roles were written. - I know I said it already, I simply think it deserves repeating. And just one last remark on whoever complains that the plot doesn't make any sense. If you accept super heroes, the rest comes with the territory, it's not less likely than any other comic based film I've seen. The only problem begins when the characters come out too ""cartoonish"" the acting doesn't have much to cling to, and the whole thing falls apart. It doesn't happen here."

All of the actors delivered a great performance especially Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. Their perceptions of their characters were great and you couldn't ask for much more.<br/><br/>The story itself had so many moments that just kept you in anticipation to see what happens next and this included with the comical moments just made you want more.<br/><br/>The only downsides to this film were that some of the characters didn't feel as used as others such as Hawkeye and Black Widow but this is only a minor issue. The other problem is that the film had to end! I seriously could have kept watching if it went on much longer, it was just that good.<br/><br/>This will most certainly be one of the best films this year alongside The Dark Knight Rises and Prometheus.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film an 8.4 due to its excellent delivery of the story and the acting was spot on.

","Avengers had one of the longest marketing technique used in the movie industry.Its marketing started way back in 2008 with the release of Iron-Man.After 4 years and 5 movies later, that movie is finally released.The Avengers fulfills all the expectations that were raised in this 4 year duration.All the main actors have returned (except Edward Norton ,replaced by Mark Ruffalo for The Hulk) ,and the story is fun ,witty and action packed.<br/><br/>The biggest drawbacks most star-studded movies encounter is giving the comparatively more famous actor the biggest chunk of role.Thankfully this was not the deal for Avengers.All the main heroes (IronMan,Captain America ,Thor & Hulk) got equally big as well as important part in the story.The secondary actors (Nick Fury & Black Widow) were not brushed off ,and even with all the superheroes getting the good parts ,these 2 still had major roles.The only character felt unused and a bit expendable was Hawkeye. This speaks volumes of how the story has been handled.Juggling 6-7 heroes and giving each ample screen time is no easy task.<br/><br/>In the acting department ,Robert Downey stole the show as he usually does.He was born to play IronMan.In every scene he appears he is in total style and gives IronMan his soul. Both Chris Evans(Captain America) & Chris Hemsworth (Thor) were not bad.Both did equal justice to their roles.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) delivered yet another excellent villainous role ,similar to the one he did in Thor.Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) had a surprisingly longer and major role and she too gives her best.Jeremy Renner (HawkEye) was too rigid ,this may be due to his role not being fully fledged.Samuel J(Nick Fury) was good. But the true show stealer was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk.The Hulk will indeed be EVERYONE's favourite character once they have seen Avengers.Every scene & action scene by Hulk is just Pure Awesomeness.<br/><br/>Story as i previously said is truly noteworthy because of the huge juggling acting of giving each Hero their own connection with the movie.But in terms of story telling ,it falters just a bit.The story makes way for the action and takes the backseat.While the first half concentrates on the story ,the second is completely action based.<br/><br/>Action scenes are superb.The numerous fight scenes,hero vs hero,hero vs hoardes ,heroes vs the villain ,ALL are properly choreographed and exciting.<br/><br/>Direction was great.The way Joss Whedon managed to direct this movie with these many superheroes and mixing them and giving one solid movie is truly remarkable.On the downside the first half was riddled with pacing issues.Some dragging scenes in the first half drained the excitement after some great fights.But once the Hulk appears ,the movie just blasts off to high levels of awesomeness never to go down again.The real Avengers movie starts with The Hulk and ends with him too. The dialogues were witty and funny ,and Robert Downey's style of delivery & Hulk's grunts of words steal many scenes away.<br/><br/>Overall Avengers is a colourful,funny,action packed movie that delivers its promise of a United Super Heroes movie.The movie might not be legendary ,but The Hulk & Robert Downey will not be forgotten.

","wow 8,8 is truly sky high for a an action flick. But it deserves it..<br/><br/>Have seen this movie twice...and it gets better the second time around because you can really enjoy the action.<br/><br/>The best thing of this movie is the way they are able to put such a high degree of a comic book feel to it. It's almost perfect. <br/><br/>A major weakness to the movie is the 3D effects and watching it in Imax is a major waste of money. The movie was turned into Imax and added 3d effects to get extra cash...but it's truly disappointing.So be warned...cant avoid 3d, but the Imax version should be avoided. Save the money.<br/><br/>To the characters Hawkeye doesn't come out so great. Lack of arrows...not a problem in the comics, but on screen it felt quite sad. Also the fight scenes(h2h) with a bow is kinda forced and not so greatly choreographed. (maybe an idea to get Yuen Woo Ping next time to choreograph some nice fighting moves for him)<br/><br/>Cant complain about black Widow and Scarlet Johansson. She is always a treat to watch...but like Hawkeye she doesn't have any superpowers. The feeling i have is...during the fight scenes...does she have any chance at all? To me it feels like toddlers fighting along with Marines in a real war. No chance at all.<br/><br/>I still don't like Thor. He is always a favorite in the comics...but on screen he is just not so impressive. <br/><br/>But most of the characters are great. Iron man and RDjr are great as usual. iron man is much much better on screen than in the comics. Always felt he was kinda boring on paper...but RDjr has build such a character around him. Incredible....truly masterful how he has able to interpret this character and build him up. And the humor he has instilled in iron-man and the other movies are i think a great influence in this movie too.<br/><br/>Probably the best character here is the Hulk. Sure Ruffalo doesn't disappoint as banner. But lets face it...who cares. Its about the HULK. And this time he has been portrayed perfectly. There are two hulk characters...the brilliant scientist and mindless monster version. This version has been on big and small screens most of the time and is getting really boring and we have seen all the different stories of this. Than banner is important. In avengers we see the second version...Hulk the super hero. And i love this version. matter of fact...to me Hulk had some of the best scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>Captain America to me has the most depth. Remember the standalone captain America movie is about the beginning of Cap's story. In this movie we see how he struggles adjusting to the new world and age. It's just a small bit...but it's so interesting. Evans does a great job. So stiff and to good to be true. But thats Cap America. Hope they will make a new movie. Frankly the Cap America story is getting better the older it gets, because the differences are getting bigger and bigger. He is part of the 1940s generation. Part of the one in a life time generation that made a country great and set the stage for US dominance. When he wakes up...it's a different USA. We might even say...a USA thats in its decline as a world power. <br/><br/>Anyway it's a great movie and I think deserves its high marks. Give him a 9 out of 10....3d is weak and Imax a waste of money."

It feels almost wrong to see Iron Man argue with Captain America, each capturing the essence of who they are supposed to be, in the flesh. How wonderful it is.<br/><br/>Once you get past the awesome visual reality that is the Avengers, assembled, it's a delightful pleasure that the director or the screenwriters implemented several ""laugh out loud"" moments that were seamlessly woven into the flow of this movie. The Hulk, in particular, provides at least a couple of comic moments that had everyone in the theater roaring. <br/><br/>It's not that we don't take this stuff seriously - we really do. It's great entertainment, and the box office results prove this. Yet, lest we forget, there is a bit of ridiculousness in this mish mash of a giant green monster, a man in red and blue tights, a modern-day bow and arrow archer, and so forth - and why confine entertainment to being one-dimensional spectacle and visual effects when you can select and choose from a true arsenal of gifts."

","This was quite literally a perfect movie. It combined humor, action, great acting, great orchestra, amazing VFX, and... Robert Downey Jr. <br/><br/>10/10 without a doubt<br/><br/>I think that the best character in the movie was hulk (although my favorite was iron man). He really tied the movie together. Hulks personality shined during the end fight. It showed that he wasn't always angry and could hold the great place in History he deserves.<br/><br/>The most fascinating hero IMO is haulkeye. I really think that we should see maybe a ""training session"" in avengers 2 where he shows off his talents. <br/><br/>All in all avengers is a fantastic movie.

","I'm glad to see the response to Marvel's The Avengers (Damn that Uma Thurman movie for making me have to print the full title) has been VERY VERY positive. If there was ever a case for expectations being unreasonable then this was it. Also, we always get some anal fans that are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Either Avengers stayed very close to its root origins or people are judging it as the fine film it turned out to be. It's both to be honest and it seems most enjoyed it as much as I did. Anyone worried that Joss Whedon would make something this epic look like TV work needs worry no more. Visually it is a sight to behold and as epic as it deserves to be. I don't remember when I enjoyed a film THIS much and I really loved a lot of 2011's offerings. This movie just hits the highest level possible for me. It works on all of its own terms, there's no weighted enjoyment or cinematic slumming involved in enjoying it. It really IS a smart action film and the cast really delivered as expected. With this exceptional cast involved, how could it not? Whedon knew who his aces were and how to play them. Downey and Jackson are CLASSIC. That's not to say every major character didn't shine at one point it's just that when the beats mattered, the big guns when front and center. I also LOVED what Whedon did with Loki and how much of a home run Tom Hiddleston hit. Avengers truly a remarkable movie treat and I'm glad to see that the majority of film fans agree with me. The movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. Best of all, you leave the theater smiling and completely wanting more."

","First off, the Hulk in ""The Incredible Hulk"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/) was animated more realistic and was more aesthetically pleasing. Second, I heard somebody in the movie theater say ""Thor looks like he came out of re-hab"" Ouch. You have to agree; after watching the movie ""Thor"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/), he lost a lot of muscle; looking more like a guy in a movie suit, acting like Thor, and looking less like a god of thunder. Actor, Chris Hemsworth must have been juggling the filming of ""The Avengers"" with ""The Cabin In The Woods"", effectively eating away at the hard work put into building his physique. Let's hope Chris Hemsworth gets a free pass to rebuild his ""Thor"" muscles; and please don't forget the legs, as a life action rendition of super hero lore, is definitely enhanced by them; it is realistic fantasy, after all; may as well go for gold. Same goes for Captain America, who is just too skinny to be believable.<br/><br/>Can it be better? Of course. Would I watch this movie again? Yes, already watched it three times. Would I recommend this movie to those unfamiliar with the comic book? Yes. Just don't think about anything but being entertained for 2.5 hours."

","When i went to see this movie i believed the hype and was very anxious to see it. I was well prepared, i had seen all the relevant Marvel movies leading to this Avengers initiative. After seeing this movie i left the cinema that cold rainy night feeling overwhelmly satisfied. Rarely you find a gem of a film in life and this has to be one of them. Marvel's best live action movie since X-Men 2. I was gripped to my seat and didn't even notice the 2 hours slip by. I didn't even stay for the end credits where i'm told a small clip is played which will certainly mean a sequel. I didn't stay for the end credits because i spontaneously rushed to see this film alone for the first time in my life. Don't laugh!!! I only regret that i couldn't share this extravaganza with someone other then the strangers with me in the cinema.<br/><br/>Great storyline, great special effects, great action, some comedy and soul. This film has it all and it's for everyone. Just don't see how they can make the sequel better than this but will be interested to see what else Stan Lee has got under his sleeves. 10/10"
"The_Film_Cricket","6","2","6","8 May 2012"," Marvel Avenged!
","As I settled in for Marvel's The Avengers (to cite its full title) my mind began to drift back a few years, all the way back to another Marvel action team, The X-Men. I complained then that the problem of multiple superheroes on the screen at the same time is a problem of crowd control. How do you give equal screen time to a handful of characters with special abilities and have them be more than just cardboard characters with colorful powers? The X-Men series never straightened out this problem, but with Marvel's The Avengers, this is not an issue.<br/><br/>It was a smart plan for Marvel Studios to build the characters one at a time, giving each superhero their own movie in an effort to introduce them in preparation for their assembly here. As a lead-in we got Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), and last summer's Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger - next up is Nick Fury. With that, by the time we get to Marvel's The Avengers most of the heavy lifting in the introduction department is already done for us. That frees up the plot to get past the introductions and get on with the action, although the movie does open with the required scenes in which the team members have to be brought into the fold one by one.<br/><br/>The Avengers are more interesting to me than The X-Men because they come from different places. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is Norse God from another galaxy; Captain America (Chris Evans) is a genetically-altered Army strongman from the 1940's; Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is a green muscle mass hiding out in India under the passive alter ego of Bruce Banner; and Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), is the billionaire metallurgist whose headquarters overlook the Chrysler Building in New York. Plus there's an archer called Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and a token female, Russian-born woman named Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who, I think, is good with martial arts. For whatever reason, these last two didn't get a movie of their own, but stay tuned.<br/><br/>The Avengers, like The X-Men, are also led by a secretive bald-headed authority figure with a handicap. He is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who runs a shadow organization called S.H.I.E.L.D., whose function is to stop super villains from . . . well, doing super-villainy I suppose. The task here is to get back an object called the Tesseract, an object that ‚Äì if I understood it correctly ‚Äì acts as a power source to open a portal to another galaxy. That's bad news for our planet because it means that the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's adopted half-brother, can make his way into our realm and rule the world with his powerful super-army. It also means that he can use it to take control of the minds of certain S.H.I.E.L.D personnel. Loki's first stop to announce his intentions to rule the world: Germany. Maybe he hasn't heard, but that's probably not a wise place to start.<br/><br/>The Avenger's personalities are known to us, but what is refreshing is that they are not known to one another. In this movie, many are meeting each other for the first time and no one knows who can be trusted. That's especially true with a tense relationship between Iron Man and Thor. Since he has fallen out of the heavens just like the evil Loki, can he be trusted? Another issue of tension comes with the addition of Bruce Banner. Everyone knows that he has a serious anger management problem and the movie deals nicely with everyone's apprehension that Hulk's destructive nature could be a potential problem.<br/><br/>The most engaging character in the film, for me, is Bruce Banner, played this time by Mark Ruffalo, who manages to pull off the best performance out of the past three actors who have occupied the role. Ruffalo plays Banner as a mild-mannered soul who is very aware that he has to keep his mood in check. He does something interesting; he quiets his voice to a calm, mellow, deliberate tone that lets you know that he is aware of the destructive power of what he calls ""The Other Guy."" I liked his rendition of Bruce Banner although I think the screenwriter missed a perfect opportunity to show Bruce living a feng shui lifestyle with meditations and aroma therapy candles in an effort to keep his mood in check (maybe with the mantra ""Keep calm and carry on.""). That might have been perfect.<br/><br/>I liked the character touches in Marvel's The Avengers. I liked the dialogue, which is written at a smart, snappy level by writer-director Joss Whedon. He has a way with dialogue that makes even the most mundane of action scenes come alive. He is the man behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Firefly"", Toy Story and a brilliant horror-comedy The Cabin in the Woods, still in theaters.<br/><br/>I just wish that he could have avoided the trash and bash of the third act. He's a smart writer but the movie goes into the same exact scenario of tearing up the streets and trashing buildings that we've seen a million times. It would have been see the same inventive brilliance as the last act of The Cabin in the Woods and created something that would really take the movie into the realm of something special. His Avengers is best in smaller perfect moments and little flashes of smart dialogue. When you stand back and look at the plot as a whole, you see that it really doesn't add up to much more than just a bunch of superheroes trying to keep a meany from taking over the world. His movie, as it stands, exists somewhere between the ho-hum of The X-Men and the brilliant extravaganza of The Dark Knight. It isn't a perfect film, but I enjoyed it probably more than I expected."
"Shrdlu123","10","2","6","8 May 2012"," :""Oh. So that's what it does.""
","I am in awe. Marvel and Paramount's slow, but purposeful, journey over the last few summers has paid off as I could never imagine. It worked, folks. It worked. The film is not necessarily a thought-provoking Acadey Award winning film, but is is entertainment of the highest order, with some wonderfully funny moments and, believe it or not, strong character development for the entire Cast.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon deserves the vast amount of credit. He reminds me of a young Steven Spielberg, around the time of Jaws and Close Encounter: young, successful, enjoying his work, and completely ignored by his elderly, and jealous, peers.<br/><br/>I suspect, and hope, the sequel will delve a little deeper into drama and the psyche of each character. This film is a great example of how to properly start an ongoing, and compelling, film series."
"MajorFilmFan","10","2","6","8 May 2012"," An absolutely BREATHTAKING experience. Nothing sort of entirely remarkable
","I am a relatively new convert to the world of Marvel. I did not grow up reading comic books, or knowing ANYTNIG about these iconic characters. My experience with Marvel began in 2008, when I first saw ""Iron Man"" in theaters, and fell in love with it. I was blown away by the level of storytelling and ESPECIALLY by Robert Downey Jr.'s phenomenal performance as Tony Stark. That movie shaped my idea of what storytelling and what movies could be. I kind of put that movie in the back of my mind for two years, but, when Iron Man 2 released in 2010, I TRULY began my love of Superhero movies. Over the next two years, I immersed myself in the Marvel universe. I have been blown away by Iron Man 2, Thor, AND Captain America: The First Avenger. All of those movies have been fantastic as stand alone movies. But, Joss Wheadon, the man who gave us the TV adaptation of ""Buffy The Vanpire Slayer"", ""Firefly"", and it's follow-up ""Sernity"", SOMEHOW finds a way to bring all these standalone characters and the elements of the past movies in the Marvel Universe and combines them perfectly together to make something wholly original, intelligent, and extremely breathtaking.<br/><br/>After Loki (Tom Hiddelston) comes to Earth from the otherworldly kingdom of Asguard and decides that these new people, and this new planet, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the leader of a government agency called S.H.I.E.L.D., is forced to bring together the world's most powerful superheros, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Dr. Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) together in order to combat his menace. Along with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Natasah Romanov/Black Widow (Scarlett Johannsen) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jermey Renner), the heroes must battle Loki's ""Army"".<br/><br/>What makes this movie GREAT is the fact that the Avengers don't get along well, at ALL, when they first meet. Captain America and Iron Man take an immediate dislike to one another, and no one seems to like Thor, as he disagrees with Cap. and Iron Man on just about everything. These confrontations make for some of the FUNNIEST scenes in the movie. THis is a deeper, more philosophical and mature Super hero movie, while STILL being an entertaining, fun, popcorn movie, while STILL being the BEST Superrhero movie OF ALL TIME. This is more than JUST an action/adventure/popcorn movie. This is every sense of the term, a MASTERPIECE of filmmaking. I would say that this movie is worth seeing if you've seen ANY of the other Marbel films, or even if you've never seen the movies, Wheadon does a damn good job filling in all the blanks of the past movies perfectly for those who haven't seen them. Either way, SEE THIS MOVIE, see it in 3D, if possible."
"shiroi_hikari","9","2","6","7 May 2012"," You need to see this film.
","So I just got back from seeing Marvel's The Avengers. <br/><br/>Excuse me while I reattach my face to my skull.<br/><br/>I'll admit that when I first heard that they were going to put all of these big egos in one big movie, I was expecting a cinematic disaster of epic proportions-- something as awful as the Transformers ""films"". Something that was nothing more than Badasses on Parade. So initially, I was completely uninterested. Then I heard Joss Whedon was involved. I said to myself, ""Well, it'll at least be decent,"" and decided to go see it. Boy, am I ever glad I did. It is Badasses on Parade, but it goes far, far beyond that.<br/><br/>Let me get it out of the way right now: I don't know a damned thing about comic books. Luckily, familiarity with the original comics is not necessary. You can get by with just seeing the ""prequel"" films. I saw (and enjoyed) Iron Man and Thor, snored my way through The Incredible Hulk and skipped Captain America: The First Avenger. I did not have any trouble following what was going on in Avengers. So if you need some setup, Iron Man and Thor are the only ones that you really need to see. The other two are pretty much optional.<br/><br/>I didn't give a crap about Hulk or Cap when I went into this movie, and I walked out actually liking both of them. I thought Edward Norton's absence would leave a gaping hole. I thought wrong. Mark Ruffalo does a fine job. Also, Chris Evans is charming as hell, charming enough that I was totally sold on Cap about halfway through the film. In fact, I like him so much that I may just go back and watch Captain America after all.<br/><br/>Let's talk more about actors. Specifically, let's talk about Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki, God of Mischief in this film and in Thor. He is one of my favorite things about this movie (and was most definitely my favorite thing about Thor). I was really worried when I learned that he was going to be the main villain. I was having visions of him growing a really big mustache so he could stand around and twirl it while laughing maniacally and tying Natalie Portman to some railroad tracks. Thankfully, that is not the case at all. Both the script and Hiddleston's acting make Loki one of the best movie villains I have ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot of movie villains. He's so good that I was almost rooting for him! Okay, maybe it's partly because I also find Tom Hiddleston strangely attractive. His devilish grin chills me to the bone and gets my heart racing all at the same time. (None of you need to inform me that I'm a weirdo; I'm fully aware of it.) <br/><br/>Now let's talk about action. I am not exaggerating when I say that this is one of the best damn action movies I have ever seen. Speaking strictly about ass-kicking fight sequences and city-smashing spectacle, this is right up there with movies like The Matrix and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Every hero (and villain) gets their due; they all get to show off their strong points. Therefore, they all shine. The action is well-choreographed and nicely shot-- no Shaky-Cam to be found here (thank God!). Furthermore, we care about the action because we like and care about the people involved. Filmmakers take note: this is how you make an action film.<br/><br/>Another thing that's great about this movie is the script. Not only did Joss Whedon direct, he also penned the screenplay. Anyone who's familiar with his work knows he's the master of witty dialogue and has excellent comedic timing, and he's in top form here. In other words, this movie is funny. Really funny. There's plenty of the razor-sharp wit we've come to expect from Tony Stark (played to perfection by Robert Downey Jr.), but there's also physical comedy delivered by...well, I'll try not to spoil it for you. You'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>Let's talk some more about the script. The film clocks in at around 2 ¬Ω hours, but you won't feel it at all (unless you drank too much soda). There's a place for everything and everything is in its place; there's nothing extraneous and there's nothing missing. It establishes the group dynamic and establishes the plot, and then everything pays off in a big, big way. The plot is nothing revolutionary, but it's perfectly serviceable, and it's really the characters who should be the main focus here in the first place.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum it up: This movie delivers on just about every level. If you just want to munch some popcorn and watch some awesome action, then this movie will not disappoint you. (Seriously, I can't say enough good things about the action sequences.) If you want a good laugh, forget the ""comedy"" films and just watch this. If you like hot guys in tight costumes, there are plenty of them here. If you want to see acting that ranges from good to excellent, here it is. If you want characters you can feel something for, well, it has that too. Sounds too good to be true, right? I'm probably among the most skeptical moviegoers in these United States, but this movie made a believer out of me.<br/><br/>I've been trying to find a fault in The Avengers, but there are none that present themselves upon first viewing. I guess I'll just have to watch it a couple more times. Well, darn. <br/><br/>Sarcasm aside, if I had the 10 extra bucks, I'd go see it again right this minute."

Big kudos to director Joss Whedon (screenplay), Zak Penn (script), and the other scribes for writing such an intelligent movie.<br/><br/>This film is MUCH more than bad guy wants to beat the good guys and rule the world. The movie expertly weaves together plot elements of recent Marvel movies ""Thor"", ""Captain America"", and ""Iron Man 2"". I enjoyed how each of the Avengers had scenes that enhanced their characterizations. I appreciated how the tesseract/Cosmic Cube figured into different people's motivations for securing it, so as to do evil or do good. (And not everyone agrees about which is which).<br/><br/>The dialogue in ""The Avengers"" is excellent. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) are especially good at delivering their lines.<br/><br/>And what's a superhero movie without punches and explosions? The fight sequences are great and the special effects are fantastic! Congrats to the several hundred artists who made cities, landscapes, alien hordes, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier look so realistic.<br/><br/>I will be seeing ""The Avengers"" again at a theater soon, and I'm already looking forward to Marvel Studios making ""Avengers 2"". You don't have to be a genius like Tony Stark to know THAT'S going to happen!"
"liggins14","10","2","6","7 May 2012"," A gift to comic and action fans alike
","One word: Excellent. I've collected comic books on and off for many years, including The Avengers. This movie nailed the feel of the best of them. The characters were great and true to form...Stark as the arrogant genius; Cap as the straight-laced leader; Thor as the mythical demigod; Banner as the tortured scientist with a beast inside him; Black Widow as the super spy martial artist with a dark past; and Hawkeye as the super marksman. The great thing about this film is how different they are and how they play off each other, but come together for the common good to defeat Loki and save the world. Loki, by the way, was outstanding as the merciless villain. I love the way that the movie felt like a sequel to each of the Marvel films that came before it. No ensemble superhero movie has been done better...X-Men 1 and 2 were great, but essentially centered on Wolverine as he interacted with the team. This one centers on no less than 6 characters, and they all get pretty equal billing. This is a must see and gift to comic and action fans alike."
"toqtaqiya2","9","2","6","7 May 2012"," The Avengers turned out to be a predictable summer flick.
","The Avengers became a big success at the box office but, in reality, it's not that great. It's a fine film, with a lot of action. In the end, however, it's a passable Hollywood product. The plot is something that only a comic book reader will enjoy or fully understand, and it's there only to show several different and iconic superheroes working together. The actors do a fine job but, for me, there were no standout performances. Perhaps the only one who stood out was Chris Evans as Captain America because he was righteous, old-fashioned, and he wasn't sarcastic. And this brings me to the script by Joss Whedon, which is quite poor. I guess it wasn't easy to write a good screenplay in which each superhero has to seem relevant. This is the biggest reason why the script fails to surprise. For example, Robert Downey Jr. is his usual self as Iron Man but there's nothing that stands out in his performance. He had a lot more to work with in Iron Man (2008), and there was plenty more drama there too. The script is rather predictable, and the characters don't come off well because they have nothing important to say. The main villain Loki is also a letdown. I like Tom Hiddleston but his character has little to do except walk, talk and look menacing. Add to this a horde of enemies about whom we know almost nothing and we have one rather boring second half of the film. The heroes fight the enemies like they're shooting cans at target practice. They employ their skills, and it's all quite dull because there are too many weak and faceless enemies. The final battle reminded me a lot of Transformers (2007). Joss Whedon does a good job as director, but The Avengers is still a by the numbers action summer blockbuster. Yes, the special effects are impressive in places. Other than that there's nothing here to get excited about. Films like Iron Man (2008), Thor (2011) and The Incredible Hulk (2008) had more to like than this film. The addition of silly and predictable humor only makes the film seem more forgettable. The Avengers entertains during most of its running time but there's nothing here to take to heart."
"cheriantk9","9","2","6","7 May 2012"," Iron Man Hype
","The avengers was a undeniably a movie that was more than what we had ever hoped for. The characters and the way all of them came together from their previous solo moves was exceptional. However, as far as the cast goes, I feel that some of them dominated over the others, perhaps because of the success of their solo manifestations. For those of u who have had a previous knowledge about the avengers plot, would know that CAPTAIN America was their all-in-all leader. However, he never got the recognition or position that he deserved. Like i said earlier, this should be because of the fact that out the entire lot, Iron man was the biggest hit Hollywood had got. But this undeniably changed the entire outlook of the Avengers team. Although towards the end of the movie, he gave some orders to the rest of his team, it still does not entirely prove the leadership of captain America. The Hulk who smashed his way into the Hollywood scene with a second comeback film also shared the lime light with his hilarious ""uncontrollable self"", and his total disregard to anyone, or anything that stood in his way of doing business."

","For four years, Marvel fans all over the world has been anticipating for one of the biggest superhero mash-ups in motion picture history. We have been promised this movie for so long, that now one of the biggest motion picture phenomenons has finally hit theaters. Big superhero names such as Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America has finally recruited together, and they're off to save the world, once again, in an unstoppable group. Wow, this is easily the best movie of the year so far. I can talk for hours and hours about how excellent this movie is. First of all, director/co-writer Joss Whedon is probably one of the best storytellers to know how to make a movie and its characters realistic and relevant. Take Joss Whedon's previous film, ""The Cabin in the Woods"", for example, which does a perfect job of making the story look realistic, and the characters look totally relevant. That's the movie-making magic that Joss Whedon adds in ""The Avengers"". Filled with comical gags, this movie also feels like a 2-hour action comedy film. The jokes are timed precisely, and the humor is downright believable. Robert Downey, Jr. is still wonderful for his performance as Tony Stark, a.k.a Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as ""Thor"", Mark Ruffalo delivers one of the best portrayals of Bruce Banner, a.k.a The Hulk ever seen on screen, and Chris Evan delivers a more better performance as Captain America. We also have a supporting cast that reprises their roles from previous Marvel movies such as Scarlett Johansson (drop-dead gorgeous) as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. It's such a wonderful treat to watch all these Marvel characters that we all know and love, and place them all into one movie. The 3-D only works a few times, but the breathtaking action scenes are just downright breathtaking, exhilarating, exciting and mostly entertaining. The action scenes are probably some of the best action scenes ever put to film. You'll be on the edge of your seat, wanting for more! The comedy is just hilariously relevant, the action is downright entertaining, and the characters are written in such a realistic way. I sat in the movie theater, with the 3-D glasses, and the entire auditorium was fully packed with tons of super fans. Everyone was laughing, applauding, and cheering during the entire 2-hour, 22-minute movie. I can easily see why! This is a non-stop exciting cinematic phenomenon that perfectly knows how to do one thing, and one thing only: give the fans what they want! ""The Avengers"" is a hilarious, exciting, breathtaking, and non-stop fun motion picture that deserves the attention given from fans all over the world. This is also one of the best movies of the year! ""The Avengers"", in my review, ""an astonishing and breathtaking motion picture, an excellent extravaganza of cinematic proportions""."

","I really loved the avengers it was the best marvel movie that I've seen in years and I've seen a lot of them and it was funny now usually superhero movies aren't as funny as other movies they are usually very dramatic and normally one of the main characters in the movie die. Well this movie has a little bit of both it's very funny and a main character did indeed die, now I won't give away who dies but will say that it won't be a surprise when you see it. The movie had great action scenes their was a great fight between iron man and Thor, and captain America and an absolutely awesome fight scene with Thor facing off with the hulk they tore up shield fighting each other I mean you will go crazy when you see it. Loki was also very evil his intentions are to take over the world and you want him to lose so bad and he does in the end but you will definitely see and admire the evil in him and you will not be disappointed at all particularly with the scene where the black widow is talking to Loki while he is in the cell inside shield the evilness in his voice will scare you to your core he also does a good job controlling his alien army who are the ultimate adversaries for the avengers and the ultimate threat to the entire planet. But anyway the movie was great the heroes each played their part iron man/ Tony stark was a great leader and made the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the film captain America also had great leadership qualities and has adjusted to the new world he is in quite well and Thor helps with his lightning power and strength without which the avengers never would have survived he knew who the aliens were and that he had to stop his brother Loki at all costs the hulk was great too and did a lot of hulk smashing and smashed a few of the alien ships which was very helpful indeed. All and all the cast was perfect and Joss Whedon crafted an amazing film that will be enjoyed by geeks everywhere for years to come."

","Finally, after 5 years of waiting the Avengers have finally assembled! That means no more teasing from that bold, black guy with an eye patch and having to wait through the end credits but more importantly we get see Earths mightiest heroes join forces for the first time. Should you and your friends assemble to the cinema to see it? The plot is simple and straightforward which involves Loki, the God of mischief entering Earth through a portal using the tesseract which is a glowing cube of doom, along with Loki's glowing staff of doom he possesses the minds of Clint Barton and Dr Erik Selvis. In response to this takeover Nick Fury decides to reinstate the avengers initiative to recruit Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and my favourite of the bunch Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) who we are all reintroduced to before the team finally mobilizes. Everyone is present and correct accept for Spiderman, Aunt May was ill at the time you see. The Story is as silly as it sounds with the villain's diabolical plan but director Joss Whedon managers to pull it off with the story's memorable and iconic characters rubbing shoulders. The Avengers is also about the clash of egos which must be overcome if they want to succeed against Loki. Whedon is self aware of how silly a team of colourful superheroes coming from vastly different backgrounds' coming together really is with these characters mocking and taunting ways each other in playful and witty ways being the highlight of the movie offering some hilarious moments such as Tony's confrontation with Thor and Steve Rogers having to adjust to modern day tech no babble. As good as the script writing is there are moments where the dialogue feels over the top such as the Chitauri's conversations with Loki. There are also moments which are needed to be taken more seriously that weren't and mixed both tragedy and comedy. What really makes the Avengers great was the banter which ensued by putting these characters together. Banner and Stark get along well because of their intellect however Stark is put off by Rogers who he thinks as ""a lab experiment"" Watching these personalities collide is almost like watching a reality T.V show. This makes the ark the characters go through more prevailing as they gradually come to accept the responsibility of being a team and finding common ground with their vendetta against Loki. This brings us to our villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who I thought would be a generic villain took me by surprise. I was expecting an over the top clich√©d performance just like the loud and lacklustre Red Skull from ""Captain America"" but I was wrong Loki has versatility and depth being the God of mischief he has a sense of humour to go along with his slimy and crafty attitude. His motivation maybe mad but he gets it across with such conviction making this the best on screen villain since Heath Ledgers Joker from ""The Dark Knight"". The action scenes are brilliantly shot and handled the final action scene is just the right length however there is little suspense with our heroes being immune to every knock, explosion and everything else that is thrown at them however the spectacle is amazing to behold the action and the special effects also have substance behind them giving it more significance thanks to the brilliant ensemble cast of likable personalities. Who doesn't like the fact of the ego manic Tony Stark taking on a massive metal space worm? Michael Bay will probably be in a huff that Joss Whedon can destroy New York better then Chicago. The camera work is also very creative with a scene panning across everyone bickering but as they bicker the camera shows Loki's staff activating behind them. I don't know how Marvel has done it but ""The Avengers"" lives up to the hype. It redefines the fun and frantic comic book movie which proves you don't have to have a superhero movie be dark and brooding for it to be well received critically. It definitely is a breath of fresh air for a summer blockbuster to have substance behind its crazy style. The Avengers maybe silly and predictable but silly and predictable can be good sometimes thanks to its likable characters and entertaining story to create a thrilling experience. 8/10 Memorable moments It's hard to pick just one so I will pick one for each of my favourite Avengers Captain America-Taking control and leading the team in the final battle despite being dressed up like a blueberry Thor- Face off with Iron man in the woods Iron Man-Confronting Loki in Stark tower The Hulk-Giving Loki the old fashioned comic book Thwack and Thwomp."

","This is a basic comic book film handled with style and finesse in the hands of Joss Whedon. I've always been a fan of his, and I'm glad to see he finally got his chance to shine on. The premise of the film is Loki, brother of Thor, steals the Tesseract, from last summer's ""Captain America"" and uses it to unleash his own army upon the world, and claim it as his Kingdom. However, this is the weakest point in the film. In reaction to these events, Nick Fury calls upon his most wonderful of agents, and assembles them, somewhat, to deal with this. Here is where Joss Whedon shines. He is a man who knows characters, and has a skill for witty and well-placed dialog, but also of great vision. He understands the ego of all those involved, and plays them off of one another, including a fantastic scene of Iron Man and Thor going toe to toe for the sole sake of their arrogance. Captain America stands as the voice of reason, but his naivety is blatant; his was a simpler time. Black Widow stands in the background as a seminal character, but obviously one unused to the limelight. Hulk, played perfectly by Mark Ruffalo, is the humble doctor, always subdued for the sake of safety. These are people who are used to having the spotlight their own, and so they must learn to play well with others, but it isn't until the death of Phil Coulson do they realize the necessity to their alliance, which Joss Whedon displays masterfully in a continuous shot of the group fighting Loki's army in Manhattan. This is not a compelling film, but it respects its characters and uses their own energy to drive the plot in a fun and controlled manner. It's a spectacle to see, and the dawn of the Superhero Epic.<br/><br/>TL;DR It's ""Seven Samurai"" with superheroes. Go watch it."
"DJRMewzique","8","2","6","6 May 2012"," Far from perfect, but the perfect start to a blockbuster summer.
","Guaranteed to be one of the biggest films of the year, is ""The Avengers"" going to be one of the best? Well, no, probably not. But with the biggest opening weekend in North American history, I am sure no one cares.<br/><br/>After years of Marvel entries, introducing us to the upgraded versions of the likes of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and (in an unfortunate turn) the Hulk, it was all culminating to this: The Avengers...where all these guys come together, along with Nick Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye (who?).<br/><br/>With such a long wait, was the anticipation worth it? Well, sure...I think so! Not being a huge comic geek, I thought the film was thoroughly entertaining. It was fast-paced, action-packed and the writing was good, punchy and terribly funny. To be honest, there could not have been a better choice of film to officially kick-off the 2012 mindless blockbuster season! But is the film itself perfect? No. Far from it. There are lulls in the action that could have been slightly edited. There are jumps in the story that may not be noticed by a fan of the comics that are in the know but leave non-fans scratching their heads a little. And most importantly, there are scenes where the special effects are (ack!) off, and the use of CGI is really noticeable. Really noticeable In a film like ""The Avengers,"" and their $220 million budget, the effects should be absolutely flawless, and the end result here is far from the truth.<br/><br/>And the Hulk being 100% CGI is only part of the problem.<br/><br/>With a film of this calibre, the one thing that should be absolutely perfect is the special effects.<br/><br/>So yes, Robert Downey Jr. does as good a job as ever, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans are just as expected (although we were robbed of at least one shirtless scene each), Jackson is slightly less intimidating than Fury actually should be, Scarlett Johansson is pretty, Jeremy Renner was alright as whoever Hawkeye is while Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly great as Dr. Banner. Really noteworthy? HIMYM's Cobie Smulders and the return of Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson.<br/><br/>And yes, Joss Whedon was certainly the man to helm this film, and there is no doubt that I will be first in line for the two eventual sequels.<br/><br/>But no, the film is not perfect. If I had a word of advice for the next instalment: the CGI should be flawless and if you're going to release it in 3D, make the 3D pop, or don't bother doing it at all.<br/><br/>But, again, yes, overall, ""The Avengers"" kick starts the summer in grand style. But there is no doubt that I am still looking more forward to ""Prometheus"" and ""Dark Knight Rises,"" both of which, I have a feeling, will be much higher quality films. But neither will be nearly this much fun."
"tombstone81","10","2","6","6 May 2012"," Finally, a movie to unseat The Dark Knight!!
","This movie rocked on so many levels it is hard to know where to begin. From story, to cinematography, to perfect use of CGI, to humour, to music, to stuff blowin' up real good... Avengers proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Hollywood has NOT forgotten how to make an entertaining movie. <br/><br/>As a lifelong Hulk fan, I was blown away by Ruffalo's depiction of Bruce Banner and his big green friend was entirely awesome! Although Hulk/Banner was clearly my favourite, not a single character in this movie felt wasted, underused or overdone. They meshed seamlessly for the tasks at hand after being well introduced to Marvel newcomers over the first 50 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Absolutely MUST SEE cinema, on the big screen. Movies like this were why we invented popcorn and IMAX. Not only is it the best superhero movie of all time...it is one of the greatest movies of any genre ever made."
"synevy","9","2","6","6 May 2012"," It's all about Gamma radiation baby!
","The Avengers was a delight to watch. Almost two and a half hours of comic-like action with Nick Fury managing to assemble Earth's super humans and fight against Thor's little brother who found his way back from the void. Loki is angry and desperate for some attention. He almost got me to kneel! Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is arrogantly gorgeous and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is the retro patriotic avenger, while there's an intense love/hate relationship between them that really keeps you wondering ""what the hell is going on with these two?"". Since i've started like this, it doesn't look hard to pair them heroes up.<br/><br/>Naturally, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) come next. This combination brings up the special human skills of the characters. They are the martial arts, tactics and weapons specialists and keep more of a supporting role in the film, ""filling up -well enough- the parts where there's no cgi action"".<br/><br/>I must say that Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/HULK) was my favorite, because i could not imagine how ""these anger management issues"" could ever be tamed. Bruce Banner's zen attitude made the whole Hulk transformation even more exciting and controversial. On the other hand, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Such a verbal relief to begin with, cause he's just THOR the deity and, oh, isn't he a challenge for The Hulk! He's practically one of the few out-of-this-realm entities who can get slightly close to his powerful energy.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Thor's misunderstood and troubled brother, who NEEDS to get his revenge by any means necessary with the help of his evil army. You'll admit it yourself that he does try hard¬Ö without always counting the consequences. He'd be perfect for a psychiatric study! S.H.I.E.L.D's agents are rounding up the human coordination team, with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) being the head of this operation and the only character one's probably gotten used to see in the post-credit scenes of the 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and 'Captain America' films, as well as agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). You'll also get the chance to see Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill), also known as 'Robin' in How I Met Your Mother TV series, making her Hollywood outbreak.<br/><br/>This film consists of a cluster of actors, all getting their respectable time to shine as heroes in Stan Lee's comic masterpiece.<br/><br/>So, here's the thing. If you've never seen any of Marvel's movies, make sure you do before you move on to The Avengers. It'll be easier to understand each character, their background, motives and nemeses. Make sure to wait for the credits to end.<br/><br/>If you have seen all/most of them (or have read the comics), there's no doubt you won't like this one. The action is overwhelming, there's no need to focus too much on performances and DON'T forget to wait for the credits to end."

He is a great story teller and there was no dull moments at all. Loved the humor in it and all characters bounced off each other extremely well. They were all equal parts instead of having a main character and the others as supporting.<br/><br/>Will definitely be buying another ticket to see it next weekend again.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalos Hulk was the best I have seen.

"geodrake-71-627198","8","2","6","6 May 2012"," Left me breathless with excitement.
","Joss Whedon finally gets an enormous budget to play with as he co-writes and directs this slab of super powered fun. Highly watchable from the first scene to the inevitable 'Easter Egg', Whedon made the crucial decision to please the fans. At no point during the mammoth 142 minutes play time does it feel unnecessarily dragged out. Robert Downey Jr. again excels as Tony Stark/Iron Man, however the other cast members deserve a lot of credit for not letting his performance overshadow theirs. Mark Ruffalo is near perfect as Bruce Banner/The (Incredible) Hulk, taking the role from Ed Norton who played the less than jolly green giant in his last big screen outing. As a friend said, 'At last they got Hulk right'. Indeed! The Hulk provides two moments of pure comedy, without insulting his mythos, a hurdle lots of comic hero adaptations fail to clear. CGI is used to enhance rather than substitute for plot, something other blockbusters should take note of. People unfamiliar with the Marvel characters could be confused as to who's who and why. But I'm sure after a little bit they'll be able to sit back and enjoy. There is a glaring continuity error though. In some scenes, the arc reactor in Stark's chest can clearly be seen glowing beneath his T-shirt, as it should be because if it wasn't glowing he'd be dead. Then in other scenes whilst Stark's in 'civvies' no arc reactor can be seen. In a film of this magnitude and budget this seems quite negligent. 'Avengers Assemble' will be the movie to beat of 2012 in terms of sheer entertainment. We saw it in I-Max which, unlike normal 3D is worth paying for. If you love Super Heroes, you'll love this movie."
"Zarah_Bachchan","8","2","6","6 May 2012"," Entertaining as hell
","I generally am not particularly eager to see movies with all that hype around them. It often means little more than clever marketing. The Avengers proved me wrong. What is good about this film is that it takes all your mind and all your guts during 2.30h. Clever, full of action, suspense, and humour.<br/><br/>The special effects were just incredibly effective. The way the story develops, from the 'what do we do?' question to Nick Fury, with the title then appearing to the hidden genuine end of the movie. The action does stop only for the viewer to appreciate the characters' mindset (actors did a good job), and understand what's coming next. I liked the space given to the female characters (mostly Black Widow) to actually portray rich, smart, and strong individuals. Neither over-sexualised (of course, it's comic inspired so the body is there, but there is no direct reliance on her appearance per se to win), neither victimised. I actually liked the fact that it is Black Widow who closes the passage. Few mistakes for me: Not enough importance was given to Thor. Captain America did look a little bit overwhelmed by his team mates. That great weapon Phil talked about before using it against Loki did not do anything at all, I expected him to be wounded. The 'glass cage' falling with Thor didn't do it for me, when you can take the full strength of Iron Man, you can take a fall (he's a God, too).<br/><br/>Of course, I loved the 'credits ending scene', even if half the crowd missed it. it! 8/10"
"EmmaDinkins","10","2","6","6 May 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Avengers take control.
","The Avengers is the story of some of Marvel's well known super heroes that band together in a joint effort to save the world. We know from Men in Black that the world is always in need of saving, so I will take a term from that film and say that this is 'the best, of the best, of the best'! This film has some first rate, spectacular, out of this world and any other term that I can think of to convey how good the special effects, the performances, the casting, the direction and everything else in it is. I did see it in 3-D which was totally worth the added premium. If I were wearing a hat I'd give Joss Whedon (director, writer) a hats off for delivering this action packed extravaganza. The story has very clever dialog in that, the characters are able to convey exactly what the audience needs to know without it seeming as though we are auditing a Super Hero 101 lecture. Although this is what I will call a compilation sequel, it was fresh and original and could have easily stood on its own had we not been given all of the prior introduction movies. Not that I'm complaining about any of them Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was successfully arrogant and enduring at the same time. His and Hulk Bruce Banner's (Mark Ruffalo) intellectual bonding was intriguing enough that I'm hoping for an Iron Man featuring Hulk follow up film. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) sibling rivalry could render countless sequels and was front and center in this story, but I will expect to see Heimdall (Idris Elba) in any subsequent stories or no deal. My only issue with the set up films is that there was only the small side story featuring Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in Iron Man. I kept hearing James Brown in my head singing 'This Is a Man's World', but from where I sat it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a hulk, I mean a girl. Natasha Romanoff held her own in this boys fight club and riding on the success of this film could easily carry a Black Widow film. I know, I know historically the female super hero lead doesn't fare well at the box office, but I blame the vehicle not the passenger. Ever since the Incredibles I have these smiling moments when the bad guys start monologuing, Hulk has the best response to it I've seen to this day. I give this film a hulking green light."

Oh and it gets even better, there is a man with an eyepatch, a guy with a bow and arrow, and a flying fortress.<br/><br/>Well with all that put together it still is one of the best superhero films I have seen. When I found out that Joss Whedon, the man who made Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was set to direct, I knew the film was in good hands. It was unbelievable how he managed to regulate this ensemble cast, I felt like nobody was cut short of screen time. The plot was actually pretty solid, the characters had weight and the action didn't sacrifice much of the plot.<br/><br/>There is one thing I am very glad the film didn't do: put in Ant-Man or Wasp, then it would have been too ridiculous."

","I am unsure if words could describe how enthusiastic I was about this movie - I do not go to the cinema for many reasons, but for this, I went twice. The cast are more than super heroes, they are astoundingly brilliant at portraying the fear, anxiety, arrogance, and sheer audacity of these Marvel Cartoon heroes - the plot is steady throughout and the reveals are amazing - I won't even try to describe the SFX because they cannot properly be adequately descriptive enough - SEE IT! The sure helmsman, Joss Whedon has exploded into a place so many of us Whedonites have known about for so long - we lost Buffy, Angel, Spike etc., We lost Captain Mal and Jayne, but now Joss has finally given the world what we all know he's capable of - an explosion of action/adventure that never fails to amaze, engage and to take the breath away - add that to the most fantastic one liners, sharp dialogue, character focus and the asset that is Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark/Iron Man and you've got a complete set of everything. Chris Hemsworth brings such surety as Thor, his presence is god like in many ways whilst Tom Hiddleston plays the most charismatic bad guy in years. Add in the fantastic Hawkeye, portrayed brilliantly by Jeremy Renner - Chris Evans as Captain America and Scarlett Johanson as Black Widow - finished off with an awe inspiring performance from Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and you pretty much have the most incredible spectacle in cinema history. I am a huge fan of the individual movies, but this just smashed the lot. The size is beyond words and let us not forget what Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg bring to the cast. Fantastic, brilliant, amazing - watch out for the great battles between Thor and Hulk, Iron Man and Hulk and how well they fit into the film.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson is rumoured to have a Nick Fury movie coming soon - I can hardly wait - I hope Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johanson get their own movies too. Fabulous way to start the Avengers story. Joss Whedon needs to be heralded for his work and television bosses should sit up and see what they miss when a genuinely amazing talent goes to cinema."

","The Avengers plot is very simple. So there is no need for me to describe the details because it's easy to follow. Bad guy wants to conqueror the world and it's up to the superheroes' to stop him, but firs they have to get along in order to beat the bad guy. See it's that simple.<br/><br/>After many years of development and anticipation, I'm happy to say that The Avengers is one of my favorite films of the year. In fact this is one of the greatest comic book films I have ever seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Like most Marvel films that had been made, it's safe to say that the plot was well made. Although there are cheesy moments here and there, it works fine. Almost every character will deliver one line that will make people laugh, primary Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark delivers the best lines. Speaking of which, there are some moments of laughter's when some characters do some funny acts. <br/><br/>The Avengers delivers some of the best and spectacular action scenes that I seen in a while. The last act of the film is noting but pure good action, and that is how action genres should be. Audiences will wow. Several times in the final act, the audiences applauded during the action. That tells you how much people are going to like it. <br/><br/>From the entire Marvel superheroes that we got to love over the last couple of years, Tony Stark and the Hulk were the best. Tony Stark personality is still the same as in the first two Iron Man films. No one can't play Tony Stark as good as Robert Downey Jr. On the other hand, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk was a perfect candidate. I'll be honest with you, when I first heard that Edward Norton was not going to return as Bruce Banner/Hulk, I was deeply disappointed. I was worried that Mark Ruffalo wasn't going to pull it off, but after watching his performance, he proved me wrong. Not only was he able to pull it off, but this is the Hulk that I was waiting for. Sure Edward Norton was good, Mark Ruffalo was great.<br/><br/>The Avengers is not perfect though. Since it was converted in 3D, instead of shooting it, it's not surprising that several scenes will blurry here and there. Sometimes the special effects were blurry because of the conversion. For your own sake, don't see it in 3D. <br/><br/>Overall, fans are going to be extremely happy with this film. Regular moviegoers will be entertained. Let me tell you this, after the film was over the audience applauded the film. That shows how much the audience loved it. This is a dream come true for me and comic book fans out there. The Avengers is mighty spectacular."

At over 2 hours and 20 minutes, it is wholly captivating, perfectly balancing character development, team development (which is critical for this movie) and eye-popping 3D action. This is no small feat, bringing together the six ""heroes."". Even the minor characters are brought to the forefront (Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, for example), enriching their characters and making their action sequences just as cool and dynamic.<br/><br/>And surprisingly, it is the best Hulk movie. There are two scenes featuring the Hulk that will have you laughing so hard you'll be in tears. You'd think Iron Man would have the coolest action sequences, but when the Hulk inflicts carnage on the enemies, you don't want it to stop. <br/><br/>This is Josh Whedon's breakout movie.

There are 2 (not one, but 2) extra scenes at the end. the second you don't see until after the credits roll. The best part of the movie, In my opinion, is the part where all of the avengers, and his brother, stare down the tip of Hawkeye's arrow at Loki. These people definitely know what there doing. Hats off to joss Whedon for pulling of the movie of the year.... no. The movie of the century. Thats right folks, You heard it here first. this is the movie of the century. Now each of the Marvel movies leading up to this, ""Thor"" , ""Captian America"" , ""Iron Man"" Etc, All deserve their respect, but this movie brings them all together to a fine point and tops them all. it may look like a match-up of Marvel VS. Halo, but it is definitely in a league of its own."
"epluribusunum2010","10","2","6","5 May 2012"," The hype was understatement.
","This one goes way beyond simply being the final? chapter in a themed series.The individual Marvel movies have been OK (Hulk) to good (Iron Man 1) but The Avengers is an order of magnitude better than the best of them.<br/><br/>This film is good enough to appeal to the general public, but for comic / action fans, its is a an exquisite symphony; much more than the sum of its parts. You will find sublime pathos mixed with humor, and it works.<br/><br/>I believe it will become a genre defining work, as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are. It will simultaneously make you want to fight evil, serve your country and believe that redemption is still possible for those ready to lay it on the line, and become heroes."
"krsna_raniga","10","2","6","5 May 2012"," Brilliant...Breathtaking...MARVELous!
","I had been waiting for this movie for a long, long time. I had big expectations from this movie. And, needless to say, it completely blew me away! The movie takes off from the beginning, with high-octane but smart action, with a couple of breathers, and doesn't let go until the very, very end. I was astounded by the quality of the film itself. I knew that I couldn't expect much from this movie in terms of story or character, but this movie had more story and character than most movies out in many many years. The acting was superb. Of course, Robert Downey Jr. delivered, and then some. But it was because of the superb acting of every actor that made them all relevant. Joss Whedon made sure every character had a significance to the story and film. And they most certainly did. I never expected much from Hawkeye, as he had barely been introduced in the Marvel Universe. But towards the end, I was cheering him on. And Scarlett Johansson's character of Black Widow had much more to it in this film than in Iron Man 2. Really, in that movie they put her in to look attractive. But in this, she had legitimate fears and doubts, and she was no longer the emotionless, fully manipulative character she was in Iron Man 2. She had a heart in the movie. Now, in terms of the Hulk, the most tricky of them, they absolutely nailed it. Ruffalo is by far the best Hulk. Great acting by him, and the Hulk, dear God marvelous! He steals the show from Iron Man at the end. Speaking of Iron Man, Tony Stark is as funny as ever, and he brilliantly shows that in the beginning he had no interest in the Avengers initiative as he had been previously rejected, but by the end, he was as much part of the team as everyone else was. They were inseparable by the end. And contrary to popular belief, Stark was not the center of the film. Whedon made sure of that. I began to care more for Cap's character as well, whom I had never been too intrigued by in his movie. And as for Thor, we can see how distressed he is by Loki leaving home, and his alienation, and that Thor cares, but that he is also willing to fulfill his duty to Asgard and all the other realms. Every single character is relevant and important, a la Joss Whedon's incredible film-making and writing skills, and the brilliance of the actors portraying them. The only gripe I could possible have is that the humor occasionally, and just occasionally, felt random, and out of place. But this is really not that big of a problem. This movie has it all: a heart, a brain, a soul, and BADASS action and awesome in its purest and most enjoyable form. I compel everyone and anyone to watch this smart, and beyond awesome film, as it is way, way better than most of the garbage that is being released nowadays. I will be seeing this again, oh yes I will. The Avengers is a masterpiece."

"MikePA1012","9","2","6","5 May 2012"," Avengers Assemble!!!
","The Avengers is the long-awaited Marvel superhero film since it was announced after the credits in the first Iron Man film. The previous installments leading to the grand beast that is The Avengers were Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, and Thor. The heroes are, in case you don't already know, are Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and they're all brought together as a team by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. They're mission is, basically, to stop Thor's evil brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleson), from taking over the world. <br/><br/>I really, really liked The Avengers. I didn't seem to love and adore it like many other people do, but I thought it was incredibly well made, very funny, thrilling as hell, beautifully written, and a lot of fun. What really makes The Avengers work so well is the characters. Director Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Serenity) did a great job establishing the characters and balancing them and their interactions without it becoming too convoluted. It was a little messy in the first 30 minutes or so getting them all together, but that's perfectly understandable because you have 6 or 7 major characters and it's not an easy job giving each of them a brief introduction then bringing them together. Joss Whedon accomplished it as good as it could have been, so he gets points for that. That is to say, what carries you through the messy first 30 minutes is the script. It's so cleverly written by Joss Whedon and Zak Penn that you don't even care about it constantly going from place-to-place and character-to-character because (1) you'll be laughing your way through it and (2) it's nice to see these beloved characters on the big screen, whether the substance is good or not. Once the heroes are together as a team, it gets much better. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is great, as always, as Iron Man, always saying wise remarks, making fun of the heroes (at first), and trying to make Bruce Banner angry. Mark Ruffalo does a good job as Banner/Hulk, bringing something new and fresh to the character that you didn't see in The Incredible Hulk or Hulk (2003). I also have to praise Tom Hiddleson as Loki. He's great. He delivers a dark and menacing performance that's almost as good as what Heath Ledger delivered as the Joker in The Dark Knight. What can I really say? Everyone here does a great job. <br/><br/>It's really the script and characters that carry the movie, and I can't praise Joss Whedon enough for smoothly pacing this story with these complex characters so well. Whedon just makes them work so well together, even when they hate each other at first. The big 45-minute long action finale is thrilling. It's visually exciting, the action is phenomenally awesome, and each character has their moment of badassery, as well as their big shining moment. The Hulk steals the show several times, especially when he cleans the floor with Loki, literally. This isn't mindless Michael Bay action. It's nicely shot and choreographed and there's substance. The heroes work together and form a bond, and its just great. <br/><br/>The Avengers isn't perfect, but overall it's as entertaining as it needs to be. The only problems I can think of is a flawed, but watchable, first half-hour and a couple moments that fall flat. Go in expecting rich and colorful characters, clever dialogue, large spectacle, and fun action, and make sure you thank Joss Whedon on your way out. Oh, and a sequel."
"bluesman-20","10","2","6","5 May 2012"," Avengers assemble
","The Avengers is a fan's dream come true. Five years fives films and the most incredible build up in film history leading to this the most ambition filled film ever. It could've fallen flat on it's face. But the film makers who made it clearly love the heroes involved and wanted to show it in terms of story and character development. Joss Whedon takes his time in letting the film unwind and he let's action show up when it's needed. The Action stunts and CGI all take a backseat to the story and acting which is great. Whedon lets the characters speak for themselves and let's the story develop at it's own pace. Which is important because all of that leads to the incredible action packed climax. The interaction between the heroes shows them bonding and feeling each other out as well as rising to the menace which leads to the formation of the Avengers. The story ties up dangling plot lines from the other Marvel films and comes up with a plot that demands the Avengers. S.H.I.E.L.D is experimenting with the tesseract a cube of awesome power when Loki Thor's half brother enters our world and after a battle with Nick Fury and his forces Loki takes the tesseract and leaves taking with him some converts. His plan is to use the Tesseract to open a gateway to let a hostile alien force invade Earth and once Earth is taken down he will step in and Rule it. Nick Fury quickly puts the Avengers plan into action and calls forth Captain America,Iron Man,The Black Widow,Thor, And The Hulk to help find Loki and to battle whatever Evil he is about to unleash. Some bumpy moments happen along the way until they finally form as a team with Hawkeye lending a hand. If You're a comic book fan this is a supreme moment of triumph for you. If you're not then this film will be another one in a long line of action films based on a comic book that's worth seeing."
"muazzimsaleem","10","2","6","5 May 2012"," A Comic Book Triumph! The Avengers - *SPOILERS ALERT*
","First, I need to say a big thankyou to Disney and Marvel Studios. SO PUMPED UP RIGHT NOW How can I even start explaining about the film, it was indeed as the title suggests ""A Comic Book Triumph"". As i eagerly waited for the movie with high expectations, it gave me even more. Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects especially the ""3D"" are literally mind blowing and the action scenes are both hard hitting and beautifully choreographed. The actors' performances in ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are simply AWESOME and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear. <br/><br/>They balanced everything masterfully... Good as it gets! WOW... If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly.<br/><br/>I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion... Nothing short of Amazing!!Some of my favorite movie quotes were like when Stark says to Bruce "".... I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster."" and Bruce is all like ""Thanks"". Loved how to whole cinema laughed at it. Also at this one when Tony said and i quote ""Guys, I'm bringing the party to you!"" and Natasha is all like ""i don't see why that's the party""THE BEST ONE when Tony wakes up as HULK roared and Tony was all like ""What happened...Tell me none of you guys have kissed me"" and later ""I wanna eat a shawarma.. I don't know what it is but there's a Shawarma joint and i wanna try it""But again, there are so many moments like these and just not explainable.. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT to experience it yourself. <br/><br/>as it is FILLED with humor and action till the end.... That's why i recommend everyone to go and watch it AGAIN and AGAIN! THAT's ALL"
"projitmookerjee","10","2","6","5 May 2012"," How to make an Avengers Movie?
","What should you do when you have been a self proclaimed fan, who has decided that he would make a movie and bring all the superheroes from that universe under one arc? Step 1: Go to the studio bosses and convince them of the idea.<br/><br/>Step 2: Talk to other directors and ask them to incorporate certain elements from the Big Picture, that would help bring the final story in play. (Introduction of Nick Fury in Iron Man, continue in Iron Man 2 and Captain America, Black Widow in Iron Man 2, Hawkeye in Thor)<br/><br/>Step 3: Convince a superhero to play a guest role in another Superhero Movie. (Iron Man offering his consulting services in The Incredible Hulk)<br/><br/>Step 4: Now that all the superheroes have been linked under the mouthful acronym S.H.I.E.L.D.S, you have the right background to bring the Avenger Initiative to the foreground.<br/><br/>Step 5: Go ahead and flesh out the story. But make sure, you play to the strengths of the each character. (Iron Man is sarcastic and arrogant with tongue in cheek one liners. So he should get the best lines. Captain America is the leader, so when the time comes he should bring the superheroes together and lead them to the final battle. Thor is the Norse God and the only one who can bring Loki to Justice. Hulk is remorseful of his past deeds, yet he is still angry, indestructible as the green giant, and can practically smash anything. So his actions should speak louder than any words. Nick Fury is the leader of the avenger initiative and he should do all that is necessary to motivate the super heroes. Black Widow is the spy and her strengths also include close quarter hand to hand combat. Hawkeye is the expert marksman and practically shoot down anything with the arrows.) Now that you know that the characters and their strengths, you should ensure they get on with each others like a house on fire. Throw in friendly banter, ego clashes, battle of brawns and brains in good measure. Then when all hell breaks loose, bump off a character to motivate the super heroes to band together. Then go all out in the climatic battle sequence with action, extravagance and general dose of humor.<br/><br/>Step 6: Now add a crackling screenplay to go with that goldmine story and you are almost ready.<br/><br/>Step 7: Take it back to the Studio Bosses and convince them of the plot. If need be, use a flashy power point. It usually works for all corporate presentations and makes everybody happy.<br/><br/>Step 8: Now that the studio has green lit the project, sign up the Actors who will make up the Marquee lineup and you are good to go.<br/><br/>Step 9: If you have the faith, then go ahead and direct it. Bring in a good cinematographer and you are good to go. But don't forget to add a crackling soundtrack to match the mayhem on the screen.<br/><br/>Now for the outcome. Brilliant action, impressive 3D effects, superb character play and some genuine laugh out loud moments make The Avengers one hell of a comic book adaptation. It sets the bar pretty high for other super heroes. As is the case generally, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk pale in comparison to Batman, Spiderman, Superman individually in terms of popularity and box office pull. But when you put them all together in one frame for all to see, they sure bring in a lot of fireworks. It would do justice to them if you could catch the individual stories of all the super heroes before you go to watch the BIG ONE, but even if you don't, there is a whole lot of essence in this story alone to keep you going. This movie has already won big reviews from the critics and fans are raving about it on the FB, with loads of stuff dedicated to that special HULK and LOKI's interaction. In the end, the big question that crosses all is has Joss Whedon succeeded in his plans. The answer is yes. He has changed the comic book to movie adaptation world and taken it to a whole new level. The bar is set pretty high for Spiderman and Batman, who follow up this year with their own series. So for the time being let us enjoy the ride of the Avengers."

"brianastrac","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," Fantastic Movie. Go see it!!!!!!!
","As I reflect on my experience tonight watching the Avengers, one word comes to mind: Awesome. The movie was simply awesome. The action scenes were the best I've seen in any recent movie, and the comedy was excellent. It seems that super-hero movies these days have become parodies of themselves. And for that reason the movies are even better. The audience and the actors are all in on the jokes together, and for that the audience feels delighted and laughs. To make the greatness of this movie more relatable, here is a list of things that are equal to the movie in excellence: 1. Donald Trump's commitment in a losing battle to prove Obama African 2. Obama's actually being American 3. Women's sports 4. Bashing Women's sports 5. Powerful shower-heads 6. shower-head 7. The lifespan of the Nintendo 64 8. The triple-chinned woman working at Burger King who wears a ""Grumpy"" shirt to let the customers know she is grumpy. The woman is, in fact, grumpy. You know what you're getting yourself into. 9. That dude's facial hair in the Hunger Games 10. Having your cake and eating it, too. And then going to brag to your friends about the cake that you got to eat but they didn't get to eat. And then they tell you that all of those carbs and sugar will go to your hips and butt. But you don't believe them. And you don't really care. Because that cake was excellent. <br/><br/>I hope you could relate to at least one of these excellent things to see just how great this movie really is. It's like a mix between Fergie and Jesus. Not only will you enjoy this movie, but The Avengers will also solve many issues: 1. Relationship problems 2. Erectile dysfunction Those are actually all the problems this movie will solve. In conclusion, this movie was awesome. And, spoiler alert, Scarlett Johansson is gorgeous in this film. <br/><br/>Much love, James Harden.<br/><br/>P.S Selena Gomez, if you are reading this, cool."
"simplemandudee","9","2","6","4 May 2012"," Everything I hoped for.
","Just came back from watching it... my oh my this movie is incredible. Joss Whedon really put together a masterpiece. Perfect combination of action and comedy and even heartfelt moments. This movie right here is years of build up. Years of anticipation. And after 5 movies, it's finally here. And it is perfect. <br/><br/>I'm not going to say much, I will just list the main characters as reference for the fans of each. <br/><br/>Bruce Banner/Hulk: Hulk stole the show. From the minute he appeared till the end he had me at the edge of my seat. The amount of awesome cannot be explained.. Stark was right. Loki's army wasn't anything compared to The Hulk. He definitely deserves more that what he's gotten with the movie ""The Incredible Hulk."" Some sort of reboot perhaps? <br/><br/>Iron Man: Typical Stark that everyone loves. The life of the party. Witty, snarky, smart, hilarious. But he was also motivated. So motivated in fact, that he risked his life at one point of the movie. Class. <br/><br/>Captain America: They really succeeded in meshing Rogers in. He once again shows his fighting spirit and leadership skills. And that shield! Might as well be considered a superhero with that shield in his hands. Rogers knew that he was overshadowed by the raw power from some of the Avengers, but he didn't care. He just did his job, to protect society. You'll never find a better guy than this. <br/><br/>Thor: The other powerhouse besides Hulk. For some reason I thought Thor would be somewhat irrelevant, and I don't know why. I was wrong. Thor showed compassion on many occasions. His motive was simple, yet moving. He really brushed aside the fact that he is a God amongst men (for the most part) and genuinely wanted to be a part of the Avengers. <br/><br/>Widow & Hawkeye: Most people brushed aside these two as irrelevant. These two are human beings and nothing more. I guess that's what makes them so special. Two human beings, Widow with her world class fighting skills and Hawkeye with his master archery, take on an entire alien race to save humanity. They'll do anything in their power to help. That in its own is something to respect. <br/><br/>Loki: The sneaky, cunning Loki. Equipped with the tesseract and a smile that will make you tremble in fear, he is the Avengers main enemy. Tom Hiddleston plays him flawlessly. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was amazing. I honestly want to spend another $11 to see it again. A genuine contender for best superhero movie, ever. For those of you who haven't seen it, see it now. You will not regret it."
"champjohnson29","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," Joss Whedon is a Genius!
","I promise I am not exaggerating when I say that The Avengers is probably the best Superhero/Action film ever made. From start to finish it's amazing. I'm sure everyone knows that besides the Dark Knight, every other comic book film adaption has always has it's flaws. Each movies ""not being quite there yet"" but believe me when I say this movie is the epidomy of what a Superhero film is supposed to be. Joss Whedon and Zak Penn are definitely knowledgeable in writing a solid script. the plot, of course, is your typical action film...a sinister bad guy wants to take over the world and the Hero must rise to the occasion and protect Earth and mankind before it's too late. With these type of movies I don't believe that there needs to be a complex, over the top plot so if you're expecting something like The Matrix or Inception, you came to the wrong movie. <br/><br/>First of all, every actor embodies their character with such an ease that they were all a joy to watch on screen. Robert and both Chris's are definitely Iron Man, Thor and Captain America without a shadow of a doubt, but I was really impressed with Scarlett Johannsen and Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Black Widow and Hulk. The last two Hulk movies were okay but Ruffalo definitely gave the Hulk more depth as a character (Hulk stole the screen every time he was on camera). I was sad when people booed him after finding out he would be playing the Hulk but I think his performance left everyone in the movie happy. But Black Widow....her cameo and fight scene in Iron Man 2 definitely made me say ""This girl is bad ass"" but I got a chance to see more of an emotional side of this deadly assassin. Even though she is lethal, there were moments where her eyes would water in the midst of a situation and you're like ""Damn i love this girl"" because you feel connected. But I must say Tom Hiddleston played an awesome villain, I may get shot for saying this but I thought his performance was right up there with Ralph Fiennes in his portrayal of Voldemort in the Harry Potter Saga. Also, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye was very impressive and a shocker. Some people didn't think his character needed to be in this film but Renner definitely proved them very wrong.<br/><br/>An inhibition I have with a lot of action films is two things; either theirs a lot of action but no story/character development or their a lot of story and character development but not a lot of action. This movie has both..Thank you Mr. Whedon. Every action scene is superb and memorable in it's own way, unique way. It seems like a lot of directors like to rush the editing and the story and even the action scenes when there is a lot to cover but Whedon definitely took his time and made sure the audience was in the moment with each of the character. By the way I love a good standoff moment, and the part in the end where all six heroes are standing in a circle back to back and the camera is panning around them......totally epic!!!! <br/><br/>The special effects were also amazing and seemed almost real. I know a lot of thought has to go into planning very intricate fight scenes when the it involves six to nine heroes fighting dozens of soldiers or an alien army of hundreds but every shot, every action, every move was definitely well thought out. I really wonder how long it took them to film that final battle. It was probably the best I've ever seen in my life, even though Im only twenty three.<br/><br/>I think the best part of this entire movie was that it was laugh out loud funny from start to finish. Joss Whedon definitely has a sense of humor and of course each actor brings their character to life and it makes you relate to them as they spit out sarcastic, dry, arrogant humor to each other. It was fun to watch because it was like seeing a family bicker during Thanksgiving dinner. Seeing all six heroes together in one room, arguing non stop over differences was great on screen chemistry. I think when directors make an action movie with a team they fail to show the connection between them. What makes them a team? Why do they stick together but I loved the group dynamic. It was like a struggle of egos in the beginning which was definitely realistic. <br/><br/>In my own opinion, this movie is flawless. Anybody who finds something wrong with it is probably just uptight or a DC Universe fan and are scared that The new Batman film won't gross half as much as the Avengers will. I tell everyone that the best way to enjoy a movie, is to go in with no expectations and take it for what it is. I played the Avengers game on Sega Genesis with my brothers when I was little but I had no extensive knowledge of anything remotely connected to the Avengers but this film has made me a big fan. Thank you Joss Whedon for setting the bar higher than high and letting these other Hollywood directors know that they better step their game up or find a job at their local McDonald's. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon, Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansen, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson and the rest of the cast. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing the world why I chose to go to Film school. I left the theater overjoyed......and I'm an X-Men fan. hahaha!"
"kdnor2011","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," It really Impressed Me.
","If you had asked me a few months ago if I was exited for the Avengers, I would have said, ""A little bit."" But then the trailer made my jaw drop when I saw the giant snake decepticon from Transformers 3 crash through that building while chasing Iron Man. So I joined the many who got hyped for this film, in fact like many others I had an Avengers marathon leading up to it. And I can say that this is the best Avenger's movie we've gotten so far. It has everything I liked from the other five, while taking out some of the stuff I didn't.<br/><br/>Let's just get a few problems I had out of the way. Like the other five, there are points where it does feel slow and gets a little boring, but they are few and far in between. At times it focused too much on one member and not enough on the others. Some of the effects were clearly CGI, and it might be a little too long. I know it's only about an hour and eleven minutes, but it did feel a little longer.<br/><br/>Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie. The action scenes are great, especially the final battle. So much stuff gets destroyed. There was one shot that reminded me of that action scene in TinTin. Where they have one continuous shot go to all the members of the Avengers fighting. It doesn't last as long, but it was still cool. Most of the time the special effects were good. And I really liked the characters. Iron Man was hilarious, which is the way I think he should be, Robert Downey Jr. is great. Thor was a little more serious this time, and it actually worked, I don't know how, but it did. Black Widow was hot, Hawkeye was cool, and I actually really liked The Hulk, he had the absolute funniest scene in the movie. The acting all around is good, and I actually thought Loki was a great villain. In Thor he was OK, but I always knew Thor could beat him. In this, he actually gets pretty far, and it made me wonder how the Avengers would defeat him. And that is a big strength for this movie, there's actually quite a bit of suspense.<br/><br/>I didn't think I would say this, but the Avengers is my favorite movie of the year so far. There are a few flaws, but overall I was very impressed with this movie. See it."
"fletcherjesse21","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," Delivers On Every Level...Michael Bay take note
","With five previous Marvel movies building up to this, it has a lot to live up to. And boy does it deliver on every level. This movie is the definition of a popcorn blockbuster. The last time I had this much fun watching a marvel movie was Iron Man. But Iron man can now step back and crawl under the shadow of the awesome Avengers.<br/><br/>I'll Start off by saying that almost all of the credit should go to Joss Whedon for his superb talent in writing and directing an all-star ensemble like this. His previous movie Serenity showed that he has a niche for cleverly directing an ensemble, and The Avengers only concretes his skill. Every super hero and spy in this movie gets their screen time.<br/><br/>As most would come to expect Robert delivers the most witty lines and laughs as Iron Man, but for me, Mark Ruffalo and his angry counterpart stole the show. As Bruce Banner, he has charm and a lot of heart. As the Hulk, he had the the whole theater clapping and laughing, and wanting more. Finally, we have a great Hulk. The rest of the cast and characters get their dues as you would expect and deliver a ton of fun. Michael Bay, take note from the new king of the blockbuster. The Avengers lives up to the hype, wait, it blows the hype out of the water. It's That good. I just want more Avengers please!<br/><br/>Oh, and stay for the credits. But only fans of the comics will get it, and cry tears of joy."

","""So awesome."" Those were the first two words that came to mind as I scoured my brain in an effort to find a fitting description of what I had just witnessed. Why be loquacious, when two such honestly efficient words will do? Come on, what else do you want me to say? The Avengers hits the ground in overdrive, downs a six-pack of energy drinks, and rarely takes a breath during the course of its purely entertaining 142 minute runtime.<br/><br/>Burdened with a glorious purpose, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes his presence known quickly. He comes to earth to rule and leaves Nick Fury (Samuel L. ""Snakes on a Plane"" Jackson) and his awesome eyepatch with no choice but to revisit the failed Avengers Initiative. The film recognizes that there are a lot of male egos that need clashing and thus wastes no time in delivering exactly what the audience wants to see ‚Äì 2+ hours of superhero bliss.<br/><br/>As intense and exhilarating as the climactic 40+ minute battle against Loki and his minions is, the hero vs. hero, alpha male vs. alpha male build up is even better. Captain America vs. Thor. Iron Man vs. Thor. Thor vs. Hulk. Hawkeye vs. Black Widow. Come on now. I think I even saw a kitchen sink in there battling it out. Director Joss Whedon clearly thought through the scenarios that fans would want and he flawlessly delivers them with style. A little panache, if you will. Executing the individual battles in a way that does justice to the characters is not an easy task, but the special effects and 7.1 Surround Sound are crafted to perfection.<br/><br/>If you've seen the individual Avenger movies then you know exactly what to expect from the characters. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) cracks wise with his sarcastic humor, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) cracks heads with his magic hammer, Captain America (Chris Evans) cracks nary a smile with his old-school, no-nonsense patriotism, and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), well, he just smashes.<br/><br/>Add Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the former Russian assassin, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), a master with the bow and arrow, to the mix and that is a whole lot of superheroes demanding a limited amount of screen time. The good news is Whedon handles this potential problem seamlessly, giving everybody ample time to do their thing and play their part. The biggest surprise, both literally and figuratively, has to be The Hulk. Not only is this the most ""realistic"" version of the beloved green rage monster that's been delivered to the big screen, but he simply steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>The Avengers is the kind of roller coaster thrill ride of a movie that takes me back to the magic I felt as a kid every time I walked into the theater and sat down to watch a much-anticipated Summer blockbuster. It's a refreshing blend of humor and action that lets you check out of your reality for a couple of hours and check into an exciting world where good triumphs evil and it does so in marvelously inventive ways.<br/><br/>If you can't enjoy The Avengers then I fear you simply can't enjoy life. Shoot me an email and we'll see if we can't introduce some joy into your world."
"tyreeewebster","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," Retrospective Reviews- Avengers Assemble (2012)
","If you loved all of Marvel's other movies, then you'll WORSHIP this!<br/><br/>I will conduct this review into 3 sections, CHARACTERS, STORY and VERDICT as opposed to my usual PROS and CONS of my earlier reviews.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: <br/><br/>ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. as TONY STARK/IRON MAN: The best way to start this review is to start it with the character that brought them all together. Industrial Billionaire Tony Stark made his first epic film appearance in 2008's 'IRON MAN' directed by Jon Favreu and then appeared again in 'IRON MAN 2' in 2010. His character is pretty much the same as he was in his previous films, so there won't be much to say. He's very exaggerated in this one and is much more comical and sarcastic than an arrogant, self obsessed businessman in his solo movies, but also shows an emotion that we've never seen before from the character, and that is anger, he expresses it extremely well, but the scene where he exposes it, in all good conscience, can NOT be explained here as you MUST see the film to understand. His portrayal as the character when he's in a conflict with any of the other team mates is played exceptionally well and is put into some great scenes, especially with Captain America. There's nothing more to say except that he's played with wit, seriousness and greatness by the perfectly cast Robert Downey, Jr.! <br/><br/>CHRIS EVANS as STEVE ROGERS/CAPTAIN America: Evan's portrayal of the patriotic soldier is played very different to his portrayal in his solo movie because it's played more serious and emotional, as he is out of his 1940's lifestyle, so we can truly understand his sadness and what he's going through. Instead of him being the overly confident soldier we saw in 'CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER', he is more of a reluctant leader that knows he needs to do the things he needs to do in order to save his Country and his planet, as it's his priority. His role as a team leader is shown to full effect as he gives orders, takes orders and kicks ass! It's actually very difficult to talk about the character in a fully detailed way as we've only seen the character once. But, if I could say anything, it's that Chris Evans was perfectly cast in the role and I'm looking forward to his character being developed further.<br/><br/>MARK RUFFALO as BRUCE BANNER/HULK: In the span of almost as decade, we've gone through 3 different Bruce Banners. But I can proudly say that Mark Ruffalo is perfect for the role, he may not be the most sophisticated or eccentric one of any of the Banners', but damn it, he's committed! He didn't talk very loud throughout the whole thing, and I think that's good because this is a man that has to stay calm and quiet to bottle up his rage, so he stays quiet in order to co-operate with the other team members nicely, but that doesn't stop him. In other words, don't get him angry, you wouldn't like him when he's angry.<br/><br/>CHRIS HEMSWORTH as THOR: The fourth and final ""major"" Marvel character to talk about, as I'll talk about Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury and Loki in smaller detail as this isn't really their movie. Thor is once again played with such power and force that he absolutely disappears into the character. Unlike his portrayal in his 2011 solo movie (which was also released next to 'CAPTAIN America', Thor is played out as less of an idiot and more as a powerful God who is extremely passionate about stopping his brother Loki, whom he cares about so much even though he has done so many terrible things. Just like how I spoke about the previous 2 characters, it is way too early to talk about Thor in intense detail. But all I can say, is that you're going to love the HELL out of Chris Hemsworth's performance, he was funny, cool and completely awesome! <br/><br/>SAMUAL L. JACKSON, JEREMY RENNER, SCARLETT JOHANSSON and TOM HIDDLESTON all give great performances that all match the mood of the film, whether it's a serious moment or a comedic moment, actually the comedy is a key part of the film, as it's everywhere! The 2 main comical parts are from villainous Loki and the awesome Hulk! <br/><br/>STORY: The story is very solid and enjoyable, it doesn't mess around and gets straight to the point. It also has a very good opening scene that I am not going to spoil. The action in the film is played out very well and fits in with the characters and the story. Basically, Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers a super-group known as The Avengers to stop Thor's brother Loki from enslaving the human race. The story does sound quite clich√©, but it's Marvel and mustn't be taken seriously, that's 'THE DARK KNIGHT RISES' job. The basic story isn't much of an exciting thing, as it's in every superhero film ever made, but it doesn't matter because the explosive action sequences and Stan Lee make it all up! VERDICT: Nothing major except that this is truly an experience and must be seen by EVERYONE! <br/><br/>Written and Directed by: Joss Whedon <br/><br/>Based on 'THE AVENGERS' created by: Stan Lee and Jack Kirby<br/><br/>Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson"
"diac228","8","2","6","4 May 2012"," Cinematic comic book joyride
","We waited a long time for this movie. An extremely long time. After years of waiting (Have I emphasized the waiting part yet?), years of hits (Iron Man, Thor), misses (The Incredible Hulk) and disappointments (Iron Man 2) we get the long-awaited reunion of all of the (accessible to Disney) Marvel heroes that eventually form the league of heroes known as the Avengers. This film is blockbuster fanfare at its finest, as this will please the newbie new-school Marvel fans as well as your hardcore old-schoolers.<br/><br/>The Avengers' plot is very straightforward, very simple. Loki (you know him from Thor) has arrived in the United States and steals this ultra-powerful sphere to attempt to take over the entire planet. Your classic comic book tale. Nick Fury attempts to unite several of the well-known superheroes that had remained under the watch of SHIELD over the years in order to bring Loki to intergalactic justice. It's a good ol' good vs. evil plot that paces like a comic book in terms of withholding the juicy content until the final act.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work is the superb script that is full of one-liners, full of complex interactions between our heroes that all come from very different backgrounds, and contains more than enough room to allow for action and mayhem to conquer the screen. Joss Whedon's style can clearly be heard through the dialogue, and his rabid cult following (which is the strongest in media aside from Tarantino) will devour every moment of it.<br/><br/>What also makes this movie work is the phenomenal amount of action that you'll see from the beginning to the end. Plenty of fights, plenty of carnage, plenty of heroes working together, and best of all they make up for the recent Marvel movies that had been sorely lacking in material. Every hero has their moment to shine, from the fan favorite Iron Man to even the weaker Hawkeye. And Hulk gets to smash, a lot, and boy does he deliver in ways you wouldn't expect. An added bonus is that our heroes despite having flaws and limitations are definitely likable enough for you to root for them‚Äîeven the Hulk, who had been extremely poorly characterized over the yea-decades in media. You have the great acting ensemble to thank for that.<br/><br/>But....<br/><br/>The Avengers is a great movie, don't get me wrong, it will be worth your pennies. But, you can tell they were quite limited.<br/><br/>Part of the appeal of The Avengers comic books were the cameo surprises and supervillians as well as the heroes. Instead, we have a villain that already was featured in a prior movie as well as nameless faceless boring baddies. And no cameos. One can only imagine if Disney actually pushed for the ability to bring in the Marvel characters already owned by other movie companies. Then, the potential will explode and reach levels of awesomeness that we see only in the comic books.<br/><br/>And for those of you that tell me movie companies working together is not possible, I bring Exhibit A: Who Framed Roger Rabbit---A Disney movie.<br/><br/>If we ever were to see The Avengers reach its full potential, we need to see Hollywood work together and be willing to bend a few rules. Until then, we get this: a great fun movie (and potentially great franchise) marred by its limited resources."
"arginnon","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," Is The Avengers really that good? It is.
","I knew this movie was going to be good, but I thought 96% on RottenTomatoes and 8.9 on IMDb was a little too much for a movie like this. Oh boy how wrong I was. This film was not good, it was EPIC! With all caps and an exclamation mark.<br/><br/>We have all our favorite heroes in a single movie, played by some great actors, driven by over the top special effects and co-ordinated by a skillful director, who also rocks with the dialogs. I think it took a great deal of pre-production and in-production work by Joss Wheedon to make these unique characters work well in a single film and he did a terrific job in keeping together all these amazing actors.<br/><br/>There was no dull moment in this film. It was very well paced, wonderfully done and greatly enjoyed. The first half consisted of getting all the heroes together, introducing the plot and the characters, but it was done with such finesse, that I didn't even realize how long this part took. The film was very entertaining throughout, with hilarious comic reliefs, exciting action and wonderful score by Alan Silvestri.<br/><br/>I loved when all of the Avengers were together and just talked, because the awesome script really showed their character and why they're not really good as a team. But they finally got on with each other and the final battle commenced - the most epic final battle after, of course, Lord of the Rings. There's a shot in this scene, which just blew my mind. It was a single shot, with no cuts at all, showing all the characters fighting the alien hordes and it was just fantastic.<br/><br/>I first felt sad, when I heard Edward Norton won't be reprising his role as Bruce Banner, but as soon as Mark Ruffalo appeared on screen, I thought: ""Way better than Ed Norton."" They made a great choice in casting him, he was much more convincing and less greedy. Norton may be angry with himself, but he won't turn green anymore.<br/><br/>What Joss Wheedon did really well is that he deepened all the supporting characters we've seen in the other films. We learned a lot about Black Widow, about Hawkeye and even about Agent Coulson. The writer is really great with all the different characters, because it feels like we're watching people who could very well exist, not just superhero cardboard cut-outs. Most films like this - ahem Superman ahem - only have that.<br/><br/>I can honestly say I loved The Avengers, I don't care if it's too mainstream. The superhero movies are my favorite sub-genre! I recommend it to all, watch it, love it, enjoy it. I can't wait for more."
"WilderMovieReviews","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," Wow!
","First of all I will not be referring to this film by the crap UK name of Avengers Assembled. The film is The Avengers and that all it needs to be called.<br/><br/>This is biggest and most anticipated film from the last few years. It is a sequel to the Marvel films Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America (2011) and The Incredible Hulk (2008). But is it possible to make one film starring them all? Would it work with all of them in lead roles? The film brings together Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) & The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) along with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). They join forces against Thor's Brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who has unleashed an alien race upon the Earth so he can conquer it.<br/><br/>As many of you will know by now, I am a huge action movie and comic adaption fan, so this film exactly what I was looking for. I kept away from many reviews and possible spoilers. However I had to see the trailers. After seeing them and being blown away I got a little worried for the film. Many trailers use so much of the action and plot that they show most of the good parts of the film. I really hoped that this wouldn't happen with this one. I wanted this film to be good.<br/><br/>After the first 5 minutes I was worried. The film started out well but there was a really really bad camera cut/edit. For a film fan it stood out and slapped me in the face. I started to worry that it was a sign of things to come. However my fears were soon dispelled as the film sucked me in with outstanding direction, visuals and 3D effects like I have never seen before. The way the film was prepared starting out with Iron Man in 2008 and then tying in all the following films together are a big lead up to this one. A huge gamble but it really paid off. The outstanding cast work so well together. With all these larger than life characters already having their own individual stories told, all what was left was to bring them together. But first they start out against each other. Their individual egos explode as they battle each other with explosive devastation. Soon they all share a common goal and start to band together. Then the film really lets to. Up until this point it was amazing. When they finally start working together that's when an amazing movie exceeds all expectations and takes the superhero genre to a level never before seen. This is also the point then the 3D effects take on a whole new level. Prior to this they were used for depth and clarity of the film very well, but now it bring you in to the film and doesn't let go. The greatest effect is an alien ship appearing from over your head. It actually startled me as it appeared above my head before it was on the screen. Never before outside of a theme park has a 3D film managed this.<br/><br/>Fortunately it didn't just meet my expectations, it exceeded them more than I ever thought possible. I really can't find the right words to convey how good this film really is. It has moments where you laugh so hard you cry, amazingly the best of these involve The Hulk! There are moments where you find yourself holding your breath at the sheer scope of what you are seeing. The action raises the bar for the genre to maybe unattainable heights. This film is so very good.<br/><br/>I usually rate films on a scale of 1-10 but 10 feels inadequate for this. So for this one I am using 1-100. This film scores a 99. Only losing out on 100 due to the single bad edit at the start of the film. Joss Whedon has managed the impossible with this film and pulled of a film no one expected to be so good. For this reason and for the first time my stand out performance is the director Joss Whedon, for creating a perfect superhero movie.<br/><br/>You have to see this on the biggest screen you can find and in 3D"
"dharabhiabhi","8","2","6","3 May 2012"," One of the smartest, wittiest, grandest summer blockbuster you will see for a long time !
","Before I saw avengers I was expecting to see a action heavy film with little or no script. And now that i have seen it I can say that i was very surprised by the dialogues and the script. The script was witty, smart and well written. The main plot was of course simple, that of a man( in this case a God) wanting to take over the world, but apart from that clich√© plot point the script was very good. It was more character based than plot based. The movie gave enough individual time to the heroes(other than hawkeye) in terms of screen time. The point of the film was a team assembling and that team dynamic was brilliantly written and acted. The heroes fought, they disagreed, they had different opinions to things, they had different reasons to go to war, but at the end despite their differences they came together. This team dynamic was brilliantly handled by Joss Whedon. The script was funny at times as well, Joss whedon knew that the avengers wasn't supposed to be a dark knight, it wasn't supposed to be realistic and gritty and scattered with various themes, so instead of making a mindless michael bay film he added his own unique touches which gave the movie and the characters depth while also preserving the summer blockbuster flavour. Each character played a specific part in this team, captain America played the loyal/bound by duty super soldier who turns out to be a brilliant tactician as well. Iron man provided the team with flying abilities and brilliant weaponry, thor had personal reasons to fight this battle, while HULK well he was an unstoppable monster! <br/><br/>The scope of this film is huge, unlike any other super hero film. The opposition that these heroes faced could not be dealt by one hero alone and hence the stakes in this movie are much higher and the heroes know that. Some realistic themes were also introduced like whether SHIELD should make nuclear weapons to protect itself from the other worldly armies, these themes were quite relevant in today's times. There were quite a few smart writing choices that whedon made that i cant talk about without giving spoilers. The acting as expected was brilliant. Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Mark Rufallo, Scarlett Johanson,Chris hemsworth and Jeremy renner were all brilliant at their roles. The black widow got more screen time then i expected but that was welcome. The action I thought was very large scale, although i think and i know many might disagree with me, but the action could have been more grander in some parts. All in all this movie was everything it was supposed to be. It balanced the script,the dialogues,the characters and the action very well. Don't compare this to the dark knight cause this is not supposed to be gritty and intense, just be happy that the movie gives to you more than you expected it to. I don't know how Marvel is going to top this but lets just hope they do."
"fraf-trowbridge","10","2","6","3 May 2012"," Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!
","I've been watching Joss Whedon's work since Buffy The Vampire Slayer was first released and my god he just gets better and better.<br/><br/>Not only did he write a fabulous script for The Avengers but he directed the hell out of it too - it was brilliant, perfect comedy elements mixed in with eye-popping action.<br/><br/>Some people complained in reviews of the movie saying that there were too many strong personalities in the lead and one character seemed to shine above the others but that's just not true - they all shine in their own way! Robert Downey Jr with his exquisite technical lingo, Mark Ruffalo with his anger management, Chris Hemsworth with his Australian godliness, Jeremy Renner with his gorgeous lips, Scarlett Johansson with her bendiness, Tom Hiddleston with his best of British bad boy attitude, Chris Evans with his pure of heart and last but by no means least Samuel L Jackson who in my eyes is just awesome (whatever he is doing)!"

","You don't need me to tell you it's the culmination of a five-year plan that began with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury taking Tony Stark aside at the end of the first ""Iron Man"" to tip him off as to the ""Avengers Initative."" There is a bigger picture, he told him -- and here it is: The be-all but not (they're hoping) the end-all of the current craze for CGI-enhanced super heroics. Interspersing flip one-liners with a host of larger-than-life characters and the usual flurry of fight-and-flight scenes, the film is never less than amusing. Still, it's never more than amusing either. Marvel Studios has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the DC / Warner Bros Batman films. The lightness is fun but it doesn't offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic. And let's face it, there's more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted World War II hero, Captain America (Chris Evans), an inventor-industrialist, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the pagan lightning god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a scientist with anger- management issues, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) against the Norse god of mischief, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a legion of marauding aliens. In 3-D.<br/><br/>Meet the boss of 'The Avengers' Chris Hemsworth is 'Thor' Chatting with the 'Iron Man 2' cast Still, Whedon (who shares a screenplay credit with Zak Penn) is a very sharp operator. He knows which buttons to press and where there's room for a little diversion. The improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movie's most rewarding asset. Imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room! The movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand-offs. Not surprisingly, Robert Downey Jr.'s flip, cynical Stark (Iron Man) gets a good measure of the movie's best lines, bouncing off Steve Rogers' (Captain America) boy scout idealism and Thor's guileless sledgehammer style (sometimes literally). Whedon also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in ""Iron Man 2.""great action, 3d is the best up till now. Robert Downey Jr is hilarious n is the glue that holds the movie together. hulk come in last but is the best in the movie."
"SciencefromScratch","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," Marvel's broken souls save the day
","First off, let me spell out that yes, I am a Marvel fan, but I fall more into... category X. I've read maybe 10 Avengers books ever (most of which were the Ultimates) so I went into this less a 'fanboy' and more someone who loves movies, and has like many been wildly intrigued by this new attempt at cinematic world building that truly HASN'T been done before, not a franchise, a whole WORLD, that never has to be rebooted because once established, the stories that can be told within this, let's face it, wildly profitable world are near limitless in variations past typical sequels. Something happened at the end of Iron Man, at the time it seemed to many like a really fun aside, but many took it as a promise. A promise to fans and film-goers alike that marvel was greasing the wheels for something really special, and come hell or high water, they were going to find a way to make the impossible happen.<br/><br/>Well, earlier tonight, I witnessed the impossible.<br/><br/>I could go through and list my favorite scenes, but you don't really need to hear that from me. You need to see this for yourself. This isn't a film to be experienced secondhand and be spoiled inside and out. This is an experience. Like all new things there are some birthing pains, namely tying four film histories together and unifying them into one cohesive plot within the first 20 minutes is a task I don't envy anybody, and considering how much screen time is required to solidify these characters as individuals, and then a team, there's not much room for the villains. Not Loki mind you, I think minute for minute he may get more screen time than anybody (And that's NOT a bad thing) but his army are little more than alien stormtroopers, and just as effective, but you know what, it wasn't their movie. This was a movie about men and women who are their own worst enemies more often than not, fragments that come together to form a whole. That's what this whole adventure is really about, coming together... assembling, if you will. I can say with no shortage of giddy enthusiasm that everyone succeeded. The filmmakers succeeded in bringing us these stories, we succeeded in supporting them, and together, we got one cool f****** movie out of it, and after this weekend alone and the contracts already secured for all the players, the surefire promise of more to come."
"thedarksteps","10","2","6","4 May 2012"," I usually hate superhero movies
","I was highly dubious going into the theater for this movie, almost walked out before it started. I work at a movie theater and therefore didn't spend any money on it, so leaving before it started would not have had any negative effect on my bank account. The only reason I stayed, I was already there and I don't go in to work for another 14 hours.<br/><br/>As stated in the subject, not a superhero movie fan, not even a comic book fan, not since my 20's. That being said, I knew very little about the characters and thus had no preconceived notions about how they should be represented... except for Hulk. While I didn't like the Edward Norton version or the post 9/11 watered down violent first movie, I did actually like how he actually looks like the actor portraying him. The other two movies, Hulk was almost a separate entity, completely losing facial notoriety of his weaker self. Plus, he actually has human facial expressions instead of just gritted teeth and growling.<br/><br/>As I said before, not a comic book fan, went in knowing very little if anything at all of Black Widow or Hawkeye. Honestly, I thought Hawkeye was a DC character, but I guess I was wrong. Never really liked Cappy or Thor and didn't like Iron Man until RD,J. started playing him. So basically, I went in with little knowledge of the modern characters and only really was looking forward to one out of six.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, this movie was the best thing I've seen in years. I've always been more of a Transformers fan and I thought those movies were epic, visually as well as story and acting power. I never dreamed I would rank the Avengers above my beloved Transformers, but here I am doing just that. Some people state the movie was too long, agree to disagree. Movies like this should always be a minimum of 2 hours, this movie could stand to have been a tad longer. Which I'm sure it will be when it comes to bluray. I'm sure some of the hardcore comic book or superhero nerds will find exception to this review and the movie itself, someone is always disappointed. I'm just glad I was not one of them... although if I had been, I got in for free and had little ventured but 2 hours and 15 minutes I would never get back.<br/><br/>In about 9 hours I'm going to wake up and take my kids to see it, looking forward to the 2 hours and 15 minutes running time, because once the movie gets going, it just about takes a brick wall or the Hulk's six-pack to stop it. If you're a hardcore superhero nerd you will see it, if you are not a hardcore superhero fan and like fun unrealistic action movies, this one is for you.<br/><br/>Hope there's a sequel."

","It is the first movie I m writing a review for. The movie compelled me to write.The world is in danger. Loki, Thor's brother thretens to destroy earth. He has amassed a legion to annihilate earth. It seems, the destruction is imminent and unavoidable. It is in these times that Nick Fury of Shield decides to bring to gether an amazing team of superheroes who are not used to working as a team, don't like taking orders from a mere mortal and above all like to work on their own terms, especially Stark and Hulk.. It is this attitude of their's that probably sets them apart from the rest of the superheroes. What follows is awesomeness at its best.<br/><br/>Its not just another action-adventure flick. Its epic. Its action, adventure, comedy, wittiness all combined into one. Its a complete package. It doesn't really matter whether you are into superhero stuff, doesn't matter what age group you belong too, you are going to enjoy it anyhow. Hulk and Iron Man are the pillars of the movie. Mark Ruffalo has done an amazing job, especially when he turns into ""the other guy"". The HULK is the cynosure of the movie. Never seen Hulk like this. He is bigger, better, stronger and angrier..that's the best part. He is here to do what he does best..""smash"".. Robert Downey aka Tony Stark, our genius, billionaire, philanthropist, playboy, with his arrogance and ""don't give a damn attitude"" would definitely win your heart. Thor, the God of thunder played by Chris Hemsworth is back on earth to kick some Loki ass. Tom Hiddleston or Loki who is bent on destroying earth is quite convincing as the evil guy. Captain America seemed to lack conviction. Probably its because I am not a Captain America fan. Agent Bart aka Hawk Eye & Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow, though mere mortals with no superhuman ability, play an important part in saving the blue planet from annihilation. I was surprised to see Cobie Smulders of HIMYM fame. I thought she was doing a cameo, but to my astonishment she had a major role to play.<br/><br/>Its a must watch movie and everybody should at least watch it once, I m planning on watching it again.."

"LloydBayer","8","2","6","3 May 2012"," Marvel has the upperhand.
","Thanks to names like Michael Bay and most recently, Peter Berg, movies that had all the makings of a motion picture event went from ridiculous to ludicrous in the short time it took a movie patron to feel the phantom pinch of money lost forever; But not if Joss Whedon has anything to say about it. And say he does! In what has to be the best super-hero action movie spectacle in a long, long time, Whedon gives you value and oomph, two sides of a coin if you will, for every buck you have put aside to watch this movie.<br/><br/>In epic form, both visually and cinematically, Whedon's screenplay begins where ""Iron Man 2"", ""Thor"" and ""Captain America :The First Avenger"" ends. A common thread running through these movies is Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D and proprietor of a task force, albeit super-human, put together to protect a sustainable energy source called the Tesseract from falling into the wrong hands. But it does and those hands belong to Loki, Thor's conniving adopted brother who arrives unannounced and steals the Tesseract. Following this prologue, Fury assembles the Avengers. From New York to Calcutta, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and The Hulk converge on a mission to prevent Loki from exerting his devious plans. However, before our heroes can say ""lock and load"", they have to first learn a painful lesson about he values of humility and unity.<br/><br/>There are innumerable ways that make this movie a cinematic event for 2012. As the screenwriter and director, Whedon's first nuance is in hoisting this movie way above the hype it created ever since trailers piqued global interest last year. Up until now, we knew something big was brewing within the confines of the Marvel universe. Yet as we have seen before, very few film makers have succeeded in simultaneously pleasing Marvel fanboys as well as action movie fans. Again, this is where Whedon cuts a niche for himself in satisfying die-hard comic book fans alongside a generic cinema audience clueless about the two worlds that exist between Marvel and DC. From a cinematic standpoint, Whedon also goes as far as busting the myth that quantity is better than quality. With a plethora of Hollywood A-listers suited up in peculiar costumes (I dare say), the narration ensures that each of their characters add an equal and important input to the story. What I like about this is Whedon's method of giving each superhero 15 minutes of egotistical fame and then letting them pummel each other before receiving another round of motherless beatings from Loki and his unsightly army. During all this, the story is structured as such that none of our heroes actually gain dominance over the others. Yes, viewers will eventually find an individual preference but Whedon has cleverly taken the reliance on a main protagonist out of the equation. Personally though, I enjoyed every moment Bruce Banner turned into ""the other guy"". Then there is the icing on the cake ‚Äï Whedon's well written dialogue, void of clich√©s but rife with wit. Speaking of wit, this has to be the first superhero action movie induced with so much humor, that at times it is possible to miss a joke here and there. As such, Whedon's slight of hand is the perfectly timed moments when you are made to laugh right in the middle of an intense battle scene. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Without doubt, character portrayals are just spot on with all actors in top form. As expected, Robert Downey, Jr. brings his usual flamboyance as the billionaire philanthropist Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man. Chris Evans is even better in his second outing as Captain America and is convincing as a 1940s hero grappling with current times. Again, Witty sarcasm between these two characters are well written and well placed. Other standouts are Mark Ruffalo as the timid Bruce Banner with a furious green giant lurking within, Scarlett Johansson as the sensuous and butt-kicking SHIELD agent and Jeremy Renner as the skilled archer, Hawkeye. Watch out for this guy, an up and coming one-man action movie hero rumored to take big names in some long running movie franchises. Centrally positioned as the antagonist, Tom Hiddleston's Loki brings along a malignant delusion to rule earth, whose only non-human deterrent is Chris Hemsworth's fellow Norse god, Thor. As polar opposites, both characters benefit from immersive depth by Hiddleston and Hemsworth, each having upped the notch since their previous team up in ""Thor"".<br/><br/>Centrally themed, most superhero movies are about saving the world from annihilation. With that premise done to death, Whedon's forte is in rolling out the plausibility that society's menace cannot be brought down with the will of just one strong individual. Clearly embedded is the message that it takes unity and a lot of heart to put up a worthy defense against any and all forms of evil. Before the end of summer, a lone hero lurking in the dark will try to prove otherwise. For now, it suffices to say that Whedon has raised the bar and in the process gives Marvel a shiny new upgrade. For now."
"raychmurf","10","2","6","3 May 2012"," Review of The Avengers
","OK, so I've been sat here for ages trying to write a review of the avengers that actually does the movie justice. Its so hard to say how amazing/brilliant/out of this world the movie actually was, as no words I can think of express how I thought about this film. There was not 1 point in the movie that I drifted off into la-la land my thoughts were more like 'i don't want this film to end'. I was a little uncertain of how all these mega movie stars were all going to fit into 1 movie, well a massive well done to Joss Whedon, if you don't get goosebumps every time one superhero meets another then you clearly have something wrong with you. Like I'm not even joking, go to the doctors or something. The effort that was put into that to make sure it was pulled off was, well, phenomenal. This was my biggest concern about the movie and I for one was not left disappointed. The back story of all the characters were impeccably placed, Whedon took the time needed to re-introduce you to each character which I guess for people who live under rocks it's perfect for, however I wasn't bored watching this, it needed to be in the movie to remind you of each hero's struggle and why they are the way they are. It made you fight with yourself to try and think who you loved the most (Thor).<br/><br/>For me this is the best movie I have seen in a long time and is the best marvel movie I have seen (yes I'm saying it, agree or not), it has heaps of action, it has so much humor it will leave you belly laughing for ages, enough to miss what other characters are saying. No characters are overshadowed, the fight scenes are superb and Captain America still has all his charm and cheese. For me The Hulk stole the show, I was at comic con when the announcements for the avengers were made, Mark Ruffalo got so much stick and still has until this day, well to all you people that thought he couldn't pull it off and thought he was going to 'ruin' the movie, eat your own words, you will come out of this film knowing that him being in it has made it something extra special."

","A for Avengers and A for Amazing. You may think this is an another one of those Action movies , Yes it is, And one of the best, And that's not it! As it turns out the movie got more hits for its humor rather than its Action-Adventure combination. Yes, A movie with a heart ! Fantastic work by the director and the writer for a concept as good as this. Every character is introduced with a background, So it works out for the people who haven't watched the other superhero movies! A great job done by the writer who also gives a real emotional touch to the movie with hilarious dialog's which are also worth a round of applause ! Excellent job done by the Acting team too, Hats off to Robert Downey and the Animator of hulk , Take a bow!! The real surprise package was Cobie Smulders who pulled of her role beautifully too! Overall I'm really proud I did not miss out on a movie like this , A fun-frolic experience through out! 10/10 Cheers!"
"BMiguel","10","2","6","2 May 2012"," Nothing short of perfection!
","Firstly if i could rate this higher i most certainly would. I went in the cinema expecting a good movie and unlike the rest of the marvel movies which were done superbly, I thought the director (Joss Whedon) would not keep up to the benchmark the rest of the movies have set. In fact he has raised that benchmark so high that the movie was absolutely stunning. All heroes had a very special role and that was shown clearly and efficiently. As usual you would not expect much humour in a film of this genre, but the Avengers have certainly made that one of their most prized attributes.<br/><br/>The hulk impressed me the most, having watched the previous hulk movies, I did not think Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) would get me interested but the Hulk made the movie humorous and exciting for the audience, showing colossal amounts of power and rage. The Black Widow definitely showed that she is more than just a ""pretty face"" showing her skills and amazing figure, working together with Hawkeye who has made a genuinely interesting entrance. As presumed Iron man does not fail to impress with his down to earth personality and high tech equipment which play a very important role in keeping the avengers intact.<br/><br/>Moreover Thor makes a outstanding entrance showing himself trying to keep his brother Loki under control who on the other hand is an exquisite villain. Furthermore Captain America shows himself and his shield worthy of being in the squad. Nick Fury does play a dominant and influential role, his character is explained in more detail as he shows authority over the avengers.<br/><br/>*The only downside to watching this movie would be the 3D. I found that a movie of this standard must be watched glasses free to experience pure brilliance.<br/><br/>*The movie has exceeded expectation, amazing screen play by all characters, terrific script, excellent story, breathtaking effects.<br/><br/>The Avengers was truly ""Marvel""ous!"
"tanja-kaaria","9","2","6","2 May 2012"," Really entertaining superhero movie
","No twists or difficult to follow plots, this movie was easy watching from start to very end. Obviously the idea is used million times before (evil declares war on world, heroes try to stop them, evil seems to be winning, government decides to nuke the evil and sacrifice the heroes at the same time, but in the end the heroes save the day) BUT I don't think movies like this ever go old. I am a 32 years old woman and felt like making a cape out of my sheets and go play superheroes after I saw this movie. It was really funny at parts (the whole theatre was laughing) and the action bits weren't overly long which usually make me go ""yawn""!. All in all, this movie is the best one I have seen in a long time, and I am usually very critical about movies. Also, I think I am in love with Robert Downie Jr now."
"bakor24-1","9","2","6","2 May 2012"," Entertaining, Inspiring Heroics and Technology
","There is something to think about when we think that we have had movies where the characters were already presented to us. We walk in to the movie having knowledge of them, their personality, history etc. This makes for a great time saved in engaging the audience, and the impact is genius. The opportunity to make a good movie was not squandered. <br/><br/>The Avengers is nothing less than the apex of mythology's evolution. The movie does not waste a moment exposing the audience to intense scenes from the beginning. The story is gripping, the enemy (Loki) chillingly relatable to in his human immaturity, and the heroes are a beautiful diversity of awesome. Real humans are fighting next to the superheroes ; effectively elevating Black Widow and Hawkeye to the rank of what Ancient Civilizations would call Gods. <br/><br/>The Hulk is played perfectly and delivered intensely. He was my favorite character, though Captain America was pretty much like Jesus, less the miracles, plus the super abilities. He's the strategist, savior, gallant gentleman hero that's really an inspiring for the rest of the team and even for the audience. There are plenty of moments of comic relief, suspense, petty power hungry jealous Gods are crushed by humans. <br/><br/>Most impressive was how suddenness was perfectly conveyed on screen. Where movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon accomplished impressive feets with wires on actors to make them look like they're flying/jumping, tricks were employed to make everything look as real as possible. At one point, Black Widow jump kicks a man with both feet landing on his chest and she fell on her back the same way you would if you tried in real life. When the Hulk punches Thor through the wall, the timing of the impact's shockwave is perfect and it looks freakishly real. It's a small detail that makes all the difference, the extra juice that makes the B grade an A. <br/><br/>Of course, the scenes of destruction were beyond impressive, creative and awesome. I hadn't been so astounded in a very long time. Not since Die Hard 4! <br/><br/>I also loved all the technology they used. Their daring vision is an inspiration for what we would like to atteign, if only in the display technology used by Stark and Banner! <br/><br/>The movie was inspiring; I want to be a hero in my everyday way of being. Not that I am going to go and build an Iron Man suit (though I'd die for one), but the chivalry, nobility, and honor in being helpful, considerate, and empathic is very appealing. <br/><br/>I don't want Director Fury's words of despair to be real for our world. ""We need heroes¬Ö but ah, its an ancient notion"". <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, go watch the movie, be inspired, be entertained and maybe we - the new generation ‚Äì can become the avengers of earth and her inhabitants, for all the brutal treatment she has undergone under our auspices before."
"teo-sun","10","2","6","2 May 2012"," A Masterpiece for every comics fan in the world...
","First thing first: ""The Avengers"" is a masterpiece. Period. It's not easy to put together the most famous Marvel superheroes (apart from Spidey, of course!)in a single movie with a good plot, very good characters development (good & evil), and make a great movie like this one. The story develops around the ""Avengers"" project, an idea by Nick Fury (director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the superhero-billionaire Tony Stark alias Iron Man. A group of Super-persons at service of mankind (something like the X-Men..). The villain here is Loki, returned from the end of the other great movie from Marvel Studios ""Thor"", eager to take control of the earth using the powers of the Tesseract, the same powerful alien artifact seen in ""Captain America"". There is a connection with other Marvel movies, in fact to really appreciate the movie you should see the other two movies at least, but it's not a priority of course. The result is a movie full of wonderful action sequences, smart dialogs, excellent character development and an open finale for another, possible, great adventure (don't worry, no spoilers here, just wait the end of the first part of the credits at the end of the movie..). A pleasant surprise, a wonderful movie for every comic fan around the world, and for the ones that hates this kind of movie: just see this film and you'll be amazed. Trust me. 10/10 Teo from Italy"

","Avengers Assemble, a Marvel Studio film, directed by Joss Whedon. Comic fans most anticipated film of the year. The film slowly began gathering momentum since, The Incredible Hulk staring Edward Norton was released, back in 2008. Slowly over the course of years the other films followed, given the none comic book fan a look into some of the characters in the Avenger Team, before they became part of the Avengers. (In order of release date) Hulk, Iron Man, Capitan America; these films were a pre sequel to Avengers Assemble. The character development in this films comes from their interaction together and them becoming a team. The film follows the 6 superhuman characters known as Iron Man (Tony Stark), Captain America (Steve Rogers, The Hulk (Bruce Banner), Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff ), Thor and Hawkeye (Clint Barton );lead by the master of deception and secrets Nick Fury. On a journey of self discovery, and finding out what part or purpose they really have in been an Avenger. These hero's are tasked with the burden of saving the world from alien annihilation and from the wicked grasp Loki, Thor half brother. The film seemed to stick to the original Avengers comics faithfully drawing the necessary and integral parts from the comic and inserting them on the big screen, for example the Helicarrier (floating S.H.I.EL.D aircraft) . Like many action films of today CGI and special effects have become a household commodity It would have been easier to leave this comic book nugget out, but through the use of realistic CGI and special effects, Whedon was able to incorporate this in a none shoddy way. Although the film heavily relied on special effects and green screen, everything was appropriately placed. The all star cast, which had many in a pessimistic mood, pulled through, the actors gelled well which made their on screen chemistry believable, as a result they were able to bring to life and capture the mind-set of the character they were playing. All the characters were given their chance to shine with such precision, lost in many films of these calibre and actors. Yes the film had many clich√©d lines, but the actors pulled them off without subjecting the audience through painful cheese moments. Does the film give you your money's worth, narrative, action, good special effects, and yet stays faithful to the comic? To answer that question you need to watch it yourself. But as far as superhero films go, this is one of the better ones in terms of entertainment, and realism many people expect to see in an action/ fantasy film."
"guy-372","8","2","6","1 May 2012"," 7.6 For Non-Comic Book Fanatics
","7.6 For Non-Comic Book Fanatics. Although there are plenty of fantastical elements in this movie, this movie is an enjoyment. Although everyone who enjoys this movie will need to be willing to accept the fantastical elements of the characters and main plot points, this movie is successful because it is logical and reasonable beyond those openly accepted fantastical characters. The action is exciting, imaginative and well shown. But the greatest strength of the movie was the development of the characters. We didn't need to know the comic book facts about the characters to understand what was happening. Moreover, the characters had personality: they were reasonably complex and interacted with enough pressure against each other to understand them as more than just ""cardboard"" comic book cut-outs. The highlight was the humoristic quips between the heroes. I recommend that you see this in the cinema in the 3-D version, as the 3-D is done well and not the over-the-top 3-D of yester-years. But see this with another person who enjoys fantastical stories."
"ken-1164","10","2","6","1 May 2012"," Assembles all the right parts
","A movie some four years in the making, from the post-credit teaser of 2008's excellent Iron Man and 2010 sequel, through last year's equally impressive though very different Thor and Captain America movies. The weight of expectation is often a tough one to bear, with the question being could the bringing together of these stories and characters hope to equal the sum of the parts? As a long time comic book fan I would have to say the answer is a resounding ""yes"". In fairness I did have good reason to hope - Joss Whedon is a long time Marvel comics writer, and his speciality is ensemble characters. As with the highly successful Buffy and Angel franchises he has a talent for gel'ing an aparrently incongruous group - exploring the conflicts between the characters with humour to bring them together. Even the relatively underdeveloped characters - Mark Ruffalo as the new Banner / Hulk, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, and Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow are fleshed out and given fair screen time, each essential to the plot in their own way. Nick Fury and his team of Shield agents also play their part, while Tom Hiddleston's return as the arrogant demi-god Loki provides ample threat, with the feeling of something darker lurking in the wings - make sure you wait for the inevitable post-credit teaser for a clue as to what. True, the movie does rely heavily on super-powered set pieces, from the clashes of egos (and fists, hammers, shields and repulsors) within the group to the incredible city-wrecking finale, but what else would you expect or hope from in a movie like this? From the action-packed set-pieces and great one-liners through to the human interactions Avengers Assembles all of the parts and proves the whole to be greater than the sum."

","This was far from a bad film but it also wasn't quite a great film. It has spectacular CGI, is funny and each of the characters are well developed (especially The Hulk). There's even a sad emotional moment at one point. Scar Jo is actually quite cool and Loki is a bad guy who you can both sympathise and despise at the same time. I can't actually say anything is particularly bad except maybe The Hawk, I've nothing against the actor but his skills with the arrow seemed a bit out of place with the others. He was like Legolas without the blonde wig. Speaking of blonde's, you could tell the film was done by Joss Whedon as the dialogue was interspersed with quick one liners and the banter between the team was funny (the best bit though was probably when no words were used at all between Hulk and Thor). It must have been difficult to mesh all the characters together and give each of the stars enough screen time to keep them happy. Overall, it's not as good as the Dark Knight but its not meant to be as dark and serious as that, the Dark Knight is a cartoon/comic book character pretending to be a proper film star, the Avengers has film stars pretending to be cartoon/comic book characters and it never takes itself too seriously so is fun to watch."

","So I went to the cinema intended to see The Avengers. I was kinda worried about what would I see. I was waiting and in the meantime I was thinking in every possible way that the movie would suck. I was wrong The movie has great lines with a lot of humor (Stark talking with Loki which was awesome and funny or when Hulk smashed Loki around after a small chat) a lot of action which is delivered throughout the movie under certain circumstances and not randomly which would ruin it. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark was my favorite character in this movie. Just funny , awesome. I also found the character development pretty good. Tony Stark is a lot of different since the last movie as well as other characters and the story line was not cheesy or a bit lame like most of the action movies. It had a solid story line not entirely based on action but on the dialog itself.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a must see for the fans of Marvel and a great action movie for all the rest. And bottom line... The lines of tony stark were priceless. Do not forget to see it on 3D"

Plot is very predictable and the lack of mystery makes it even worse.<br/><br/>For those people who have watched similar team effort crisis control by a bunch of supers as in JL there is always an extra expectation, should understand that in Avengers, except for Thor and Loki, the others are only highly skilled or enhanced human beings. <br/><br/>Having said all this I still have given an 8 because it is still a Marvel.

The plot of the movie revolves very much around fantasy with aspects of sci-fi which works well to ensure the hero's really are up against a challenge. There were areas which could have been better explained with regard to the villainous characters and where the portal came from. However, with a running time of 144 minutes you can certainly understand why it wasn't. <br/><br/>The movie is rated 12A as it should be with no real violent scenes or swearing and a lot more humorous that initially expected.

","¬®Maybe your army will come, maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you! Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it!¬®<br/><br/>Along with many others, The Avengers was one of my most anticipated films of 2012, and I can honestly say that it didn't disappoint me one bit. It was even better than what I had anticipated and every single person in the theater seemed to have had the time of their lives. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments where everyone just cheered and the movie never ceased to entertain. The Avengers is one of the best superhero movies ever made, and I would say only The Dark Knight surpasses it, although comparing these two movies isn't fair because this film is much lighter and self aware of its premise. The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon (who also wrote the screenplay) is masterfully put together, meshing the incredible special effects and action scenes with the beloved characters and perfect cast. Everyone is really great in this film and it entertains from the very beginning. This is what a popcorn summer movie should be. I was worried so much hype for this film could've ruined the film for me, but I was wrong. All the hype only built the momentum for this great action comedy superhero flick. Ever since the first Iron Man came out these films (Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk) have been a sort of teaser trailer for this big movie. Those films helped build the characters and build the momentum for what we truly wanted to see: The Avengers. I assume this is how kids actually felt during the early 50's when they were expecting for the next Marvel comic book issue to come out. This film definitely captured that essence and magic thanks to such a magnificent team of cast and crew. <br/><br/>The movie opens with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) attacking the SHIELD agency directed by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in order to retrieve the cube which would enable him to open a portal to another universe and send an army to destroy earth. Loki is successful and manages to steal the cube and force Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) to join him by taking away their free will. In order to stop Loki, Nick Fury decides it's time to assemble the team of superheroes which he has kept a close eye on for several years. He sends Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to get Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to call on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). Fury decides it's time to get Captain America (Chris Evans) back into the action, and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) comes all the way from Asgard to try to stop his villainous brother from destroying Earth. These superheroes are assembled together, but aren't ready to work as a team. They have some issues at first and have to learn to work together if they want to stop the evil Loki.<br/><br/>The premise is pretty simple, but what really makes the film work is the interaction between all these great characters. This film could have relied so heavily on the special effects that it would've lost the magic of the great characters created by Stan Lee, but fortunately it decides to focus more on them. The tension they face working together is what really makes the movie work. There are plenty of funny moments as we have these superheroes fighting and mouthing each other. Robert Downey Jr. has showed us he can play the part to perfection, but every actor in this film really had great scenes. One of my greatest fears was that so many actors would not have enough screen time, but somehow everyone manages to be in this film for quite a while. Even minor characters such as Black Widow and Hawkeye get great exposure. Another thing I feared before The Avengers was that I thought Loki was one of the weakest villains of all the Marvel movies, but he is really great and dark in this film. He proved to be a great rival. But without a doubt, the best thing and most surprising for me was Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk, he really owned the movie and he had the best and funniest scenes in the entire film. Pairing him with Downey Jr. was really the best thing the producers could have done. Hulk is perhaps the best character in this film and the one I was least expecting to enjoy. Everyone in the theater was truly satisfied with the film and especially with the Incredible Hulk. He was amazing and so was the movie for that matter. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

"thomschurer","8","2","6","30 April 2012"," An amazing experience
","Joss Whedon really delivered with this movie. There was more action and comedy than you can wish for wrapped in a superhero-movie. After 5 movies the superheroes from Marvel finally assemble in this two-and-a-half-hour-long-roller-coaster of fun. All the actors do an amazing job in bringing their characters alive. Especially Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner does a great job. Robert Downey Junior has become his character by now, Tom Hiddleston has grown as Loki and the rest of the superheroes give solid performances. Only Scarlett Johansson could improve in the comedy department, but it is partly the fault of the writers for giving her unfunny jokes. Johansson makes up for it in the action part, though. If you are a fan of superhero-movies and probably even if you aren't, The Avengers is a recommendation for you."

","In the last few Marvel movies ( Iron Man 1 and 2, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor) was an after-credits scene which referred to this coming movie The Avengers. Small scenes which were just enough to wetten the appetite for the planned movie. Well the movie has arrived here in Europe. Story is simple enough. Loki, adopted brother of Thor has his eyes set on conquering the world and subjugating it's people. ( Freedom is overrated according to Loki) In the first scene he manages to steal something from the very secret S.H.I.E.L.D facility. That's when Nick Fury assembles his dream-team. The earnest Captain America, the one and only Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man, Thor himself, Dr Banner ( the Hulk, played by a wonderful, wonderful Mark Ruffalo who's just right for the role) Natasha Romanov and after a short trip to the dark side Hawkeye. Of course there's friction between these strong characters, but in the end they work pretty good together. The Avengers is everything I dreamed of and more. It's big on action, no doubt about it. It looks plain awesome. It's never boring. The chemistry between the actors is obvious and at times the movie is very funny. ( the way the Hulk fights Loki had me almost wetting my pants) It's serious when it needs to be..and when I left the movietheatre I had a big smile on my face. That doesn't happen to me that often. I think this movie is best enjoyed if you've seen at least some of the movies that preceded it most notably Iron Man and Thor. Very highly recommended!"
"sunny_sawhney","9","2","6","30 April 2012"," Spectacle of the year so far !
","The Avengers is a film like no other.Never have so many super heroes appeared on screen together.Often it is the case where a film suffers because of a huge star cast.But director Joss Whedeon has definitely done his homework and given each super hero a decent amount of screen time and build up ! The action scenes are flawlessly executed and are easy on the eyes unlike some recent action flicks these days.There are a few scenes in the movie that are insanely funny mostly involving Tony Stark and The Hulk.The story is nothing new,but the fact that it is carried out in such a linear and smooth fashion , makes it an amazing watch.Loki aka Thor's brother returns as the villain and does a good job at being bad.Nick Fury is decent.Scarlett Johansson looks sexy in Black playing the character of The Black Widow,only this time she has more screen time than what she got in Iron Man 2.Jeremy Renner is impressive as Hawkeye after his last hit MI : Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think Avengers is the best action movie this year so far with mind blowing special effects and enough scenes to make you get out of you seat and applaud or maybe blow a whistle or two.It would be interesting to see if GI Joe Retaliation matches up to this when it releases in late June."

","This film is now part of those rare breed of films that entertain whole audiences. How often do you watch a film which makes everyone in the movie hall laugh together? For an action movie, the Avengers is definitely more. A great ensemble of actors - Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was definitely a revelation, the best of the three we have already seen. Robert Downey Jr. as usual in his element - what would the Avengers be without him? And Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great is the realistic portrayal of a comic book series. The relationships built in the film between these superheroes were well thought out and show us the 'peopleness' in the characters and gives this movie a very personal touch. <br/><br/>Watch this movie for the action packed entertainment it provides. A movie for all ages - this work of cinema will be talked about for decades and will put Marvel in the big league of Film production. DO NOT MISS THIS!"

","Before the film had even came out in cinema's, I knew I would like it, but when I saw it. Even I was just intrigued and astounded at literally how good this film actually was. From the beginning of the movie, you are pulled straight into the story and the action and it continuous throughout the movie. The comedy sections pull in really well, as they are not constant and most of the time you do not expect the comedy to occur.<br/><br/>Each character within the movie brings something to the entire thing, I felt for each character, pulled into their whole situation. I can easily say that this is probably the best or one of the best movies I have ever seen throughout my entire life. The action was perfect, the dialogue was compelling and original, to be honest all in all the movie was just extraordinary.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great story, action, comedy and the occasional drama.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie to see, you will be amazed at just how good this movie is, I know I sure was."
"lukalele","10","2","6","29 April 2012"," Joss does it again
","I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon since Buffy days, love Firefly and Serenity, so when I heard he was directing an Avengers movie I started to have faith that it would be done right. Once again Joss didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the obvious opportunity for ridiculously good action sequences that an Avengers movie can have, and this film has a lot, it was important that whoever directed this captured the different personalities that make up the team, and the way they clash. Joss has always been good at writing for his characters, which is why here he's pretty much perfectly grabbed each hero's personality. The dialogue between them is great and believable and being the fan he has been of The Avengers since the 60s, he has a good idea of their background and what drives and motivates each of them. There's some great exchanges between them as they work out their differences and when we reach the climax and they finally come together and work as a team... what a treat.<br/><br/>The actors that have portrayed their characters in past films are now set, you can't see anyone else playing the characters they play. They're all fantastic, work brilliantly as an ensemble and the new addition - Mark Ruffalo as Banner/Hulk is a great choice, bringing that air of a man who's come to terms with his plight and learned to be calm and relaxed, but with the temper just brimming below the surface. This is the best film featuring Hulk to date, and because Hulk this time was based on Ruffalo's movements and not entirely CGI, it's the most realistic Hulk we've received to date as well.<br/><br/>I'd also like to mention here that Joss is great at writing humour into his stories and this film isn't short of some truly laugh-out-loud moments. Anyone who's a fan of his work in the past will recognise his brand of humour in this film.<br/><br/>To sum up, anyone who's a fan of superhero movies will love this, it has everything you could've hoped for in an Avengers movie. It's great to see some of our beloved comic book heroes given their dues in some great movies lately, such as Nolan's Batman films and X-Men First Class and this film is up there with the best. I'll be looking forward to the sequel, especially after the sequence during the credits.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"raulgzayas","9","2","6","29 April 2012"," The sum of all parts= The Avengers rock!
","Luck was on our side to all Marvel's Universe fans in Mexico since The Avengers premiered this Friday 04/27 just one week previous to the US release. Yes, the movie is great, Yes the acting is really good, Double yes on special effects, especially the ones related to the great battle in the city. Now what would I personally did not grant a perfect review of this most anticipated reunion of this eclectic group of superheroes?<br/><br/>Because I do personally believe it took the movie too long to separate the individual characters into the actual group. Of course this is a personal opinion and even it might be possible this is exactly how the screenplay was actually written, but nevertheless... If the Hunger Games has any potential contender of putting a fight on this still baby-year in movies, The Avengers is the one movie that has what it takes to give a good one.<br/><br/>What can you expect from this movie... Tons of action? Of course Some light background on each of the main players? Sure thing Humor? Not as much as you could have and certainly, the biggest laugh in the theater came from a scene of the least expected character... trust me on this one!<br/><br/>So all in all, this is a GREAT movie to watch... the 2+ hours just fly by and I exited the theater satisfied with Director Joss Whedon job. I almost agreed with another review stating that all main characters did have at least one big scene during the film, yet part of the missing point of my rating is that, in my mind, Iron Man/Tony Stark appearance during the film was somehow larger than the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>I am not a connoisseur of the actual comic, but it would dare to guess that the majority of the hard core fans of this history will be pleased.<br/><br/>Of course this is not Oscar material, but hey, this type of movies (Harry Potter, Batman, Superman, etc) is the reason we go to the movies... to escape reality for some time and and root for the good guys.<br/><br/>And these assembly of actors portraying these superheroes did a wonderful job.<br/><br/>Oh... and maybe last, but definitely not least, Samuel L Jackson on his role of Director Nick Fury is great and you can definitely tell there are more than a couple of SLJ's personal touches on his performance that become the cherry on this exquisite and enjoyable cake known as The Avengers."
"Spjatin4","9","2","6","28 April 2012"," Awesome Movie.... nice blend of all the solos
","Amazing movie, It lives up to its hype.. Josh Whedon has done an amazing job of blending from all the solo movies and giving us the perfect taste which stands for me as the one of the best movies of 2012. He ensured that he has a role for each of the character, rather than focusing of few main characters only. Personally liked the character of iron man and Hulk. The best part is keeping humor hand to hand with the action scene, which ensures perfect entertainment for the viewer. Special effects were breathtaking and execution was seamless. Apart of the storyline up, all the actors lived up to the expectation. Must watch at-least of 2-3 times..."
"bumblebee1001","9","2","6","28 April 2012"," Simply fantastic!
","This really is a great superhero film, outclassing all of the previous films except Ironman I. This is a superb ensemble piece where all the characters shine. I have to say that Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner was a stroke of genius - as portrayed by Ruffalo, Banner is mild, humorous, hurt and self effacing. The Hulk here gets his best outing yet as a flaw in the previous two movies was that the Hulk was more likable than Banner and you spent the whole time waiting for him to change. This is not the case in the Avengers where Bruce Banner is just as entertaining and Ruffalo portrays him as hurt but not dull or sullen (as happened in the other movies). He manages to hold his own even with RDJ on screen (no mean feat!). In the film the best of the scenes involve Hulk and Ironman but everyone plays vital roles and no one is superfluous. Although, Tony Stark really does steal every scene and he finally gets to show just what Ironman can do. Ironman gets his best action outing to date! If only Ironman II could have been even a tad like this. The script is witty, coherent and just fun. Pepper Potts returns to continue the awesome romance with Ironman which really fits in perfectly with the film."
"Thomas-Giffin","9","2","6","27 April 2012"," So good!
","I suppose the question on your lips is 'Any Good?'<br/><br/>The short answer is 'yes'.<br/><br/>The longer answer is 'F**k me silly, that film was awesome!'<br/><br/>The even longer answer is:<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has created a witty, entertaining superhero that more than capably juggles different characters and threads all together into an unsubtle, but solid film.<br/><br/>It helps if you've seen the previous Marvel Studio films in the franchise before seeing this. I had personally seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor although I had not seen The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton and I had a good idea of the principal characters and what was going on. There is the barest bones of back-story for each of the heroes but the majority of exposition is around the character of Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Mark Ruffalo somehow steals the show as the Hulk, utterly removing the previously uninspiring film adaptations. He is amazing, in every way. Bruce Banner gets some quality lines and Mark Ruffalo delivers in pretty much every way, it is a lot more of a subtle performance than most of his fellow actors, who are much more brazen, brash and forward.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr once again delivers as Iron Man, a character that is as rich and as interesting two films down the line as he ever was. He gets the best lines and even though it takes a little bit of time to introduce Iron Man compared to some of the other characters, he sticks in the mind and has his own standouts moments alongside the rest of the Avengers.<br/><br/>Captain America (Chris Evans) is also on top form as Captain America, a character I was initially concerned would not fit well into the dynamic of the group but his character fits really nicely.<br/><br/>As a personal favourite, it is always nice to see Loki on the screen. His 'little brother' syndrome makes his a fascinating villain in Thor and Tom Hiddleston absolutely proves he is brilliant as this twisted, powerful trickster. In Loki, once again, Marvel Studios provide a villain that is as well fleshed out and as interesting as the heroes. <br/><br/>I've already mentioned Josh Whedon's outlandish ability to fuse together so many characters into a film well. When all the Avengers have assembled, each character and their traits clash in a....realistic way, the selfless with the arrogant etc etc. Whilst the film does try extremely hard to have as many Avenger on Avengers fights as possible and they are thrilling, seeing them work together as a team is frankly fantastic. Again, several stunning shots pan seamlessly from one character to the next, cutting through the large amounts of chaotic action to deliver what you wanted to see, superheroes beating on things.<br/><br/>Another key Whedon-ish (tm) is the humour. It is a pretty funny film too boot.<br/><br/>Its $220 million budget went a long way too. Apart from the actors and the not inconsiderable sums of money they would have been paid, the CGI is almost faultless. It is awesome, and always seems to make the events feel like a comic book. Again, the standout being a very realistic, physical Hulk. The best incarnation yet, for sure. <br/><br/>It's not without fault:<br/><br/>The plot is nonsense. <br/><br/>The script is sometimes clunky and awkward.<br/><br/>It is a long film (although doesn't really feel like it)<br/><br/>However, these are mere grains of sand on a beach of AWESOMNESS.<br/><br/>Watch this film!<br/><br/>9/10 easy."
"harshdgenius","9","2","6","27 April 2012"," Box Office Avenged!!!! A complete treat..a must watch!!Go Go Go Avengers!!!
","The very beginning of the movie is capable enough to build your interest and keeps you watching. The movies has many relative terms from other movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and people who haven't seen ""Captain America:The First Avenger"" or ""Thor""or ""The Incredible Hulk""or ""Ironman"" might have to scratch their heads at times...but that will not matter a lot because the movie will keep you laughing and will keep you in the moment, never letting you get bored. The movie is intense at many times, thrilling a sometimes too..but the action and comedy is amazing. Especially the scene where Loki is beaten up by Hulk like a washer-man's clothes will keep you laughing even after Hulk is finished up with his beating. Every time you start thinking that you are getting bored, and start sliding on your seat, something will happen in the movie and you will straighten up on your seat, waiting for more. The movie will keep on building a plot for action throughout its length and will blast your head with thrilling action scenes in the end. The performance by every actor is respectable. The dignity of each character is maintained. None of the superheroes is portrayed miser than others. Even Hawkeye and Black Widow gain audience's respect in the end. In short, the movie is a must watch and for the fans of any of The Avengers or the superheroes who are a part of it will commit a sin if they do not watch this movie."

"lalitdevraj","9","2","6","27 April 2012"," The Avengers is worth it!
","Where to begin?! The Avengers is where multiple superheroes come together to go against one force. From a fan's point of view, the movie hit the spot especially considering that there were references to events which occurred in comic books which were not previously filmed. From my point of view, a non-fanatic yet sucked into the hype,I had the inclination to watch those movies, which I hadn't watched yet, with the superheroes in the Avengers and trust me it was worth it! Apart from the fact that a viewer would not know a particular superhero's past, there is a minute back story which is worth noting from the previous movies so as to feel at ease with the continuation of the story which is seen in The Avengers.<br/><br/>Casting was appropriate as most were from the previous films but even roles such as the one which Cobie Smulders (some of you may know her as Robin from ""How I Met Your Mother"") played, though small, were significant. Screenplay cannot be argued and the fact that this movie had a USP of 3D motion picture, the effect changed the experience.<br/><br/>Action is dominant in this film but with numerous combinations of enemies, as not all fights are against 'the bad guy' in particular, it is exciting as well as interesting with the question of not only who is going to win, but how? Comedy, interestingly, was present, I feel mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. but others were important factors.<br/><br/>This movie was not very dialogue-heavy but more straight to the point. Script-wise, the dialogues were indeed effective as well as pulsating for the the viewer.<br/><br/>With an approx 2hr 30min running time, there are hardly any parts which one would find unnecessary and although it may appear as a one-time-watch there are particular scenes which really make you look for them on Youtube and such.<br/><br/>With bursts of excitement at random intervals and sometimes loads of adrenaline in more than just a couple of scenes, The Avengers took me by surprise, and I hope it does the same to you.<br/><br/>P.S. I saw the ranking being extremely high, an 8.9 on IMDb, before viewing it and now I can see why it was so high."
"lee-helen-paterson","9","2","6","26 April 2012"," Just Dive in
","It's clear from the start that Whedon want's to honour the opportunity to show us what superheroes can do. We get to enjoy a classic comparison of ""real people"" in a world of ""super people""... the beats are perfect... I found myself feeling hugely impressed at the skill set and technology of the shield operatives, then completely sorry for them when they are thrust into the world of the Avengers. The Avengers themselves were pitched at a power level far greater than set up in the preceding movies, but they were only the better for it. The speed of the impacts, the level of catastrophic damage that they leave in their wake... all perfect. The only missed opportunity I felt was for Captain America... still too much of the poster boy soldier, and not enough of the Captain, except when he is dealing with shield agents, or policemen... and I still wanted the Captain to move more like Bronski did in the Hulk. Thor is definitely a God in this, and the Hulk is definitely a poorly guided atomic bomb. Iron Man and Banner's intelligence was a blast to watch, and the swagger of Stark is nicely offset by moments of fear for the limitations of his tech. <br/><br/>I gripped my seat, with the peril, and I laughed out loudly (along with the entire audience) at the moments... you will know when you do too... I should have stayed in my seat for another viewing..."
"rehan-prins","4","4","17","30 June 2012"," Good if you don't mind a bad story/plot
","I saw the Avengers with no real knowledge of the comic book series or any of the characters beforehand. However it took me only 10 minutes of reading IMDb reviews to realise that the waters are clearly divided between Avengers fans and Dark Knight fans. For me I was disappointed after seeing The Avengers however I can largely attribute that to my backgrounds in reading, understanding and writing about complex ideas, something Christopher Nolan's films have drawn out of me. With that said though, the Avengers is a different kind of comic book film. If you're looking for a fun, action based movie for kids then the Avengers is for you. However if you have desires for films with grand ideas, deep characters and complex plots as well as the Batman factor, then the Dark Knight Rises is definitely for you. One thing is certain though, you cannot compare both films against each other. Joss Whedon uses the core elements of the comic series that brought out a very Michael Bay representation while Chrisopher Nolan transforms the comic book ideas into grander social commentaries on moral and philosophical issues while still giving the Dark Knight the attention it deserves. I found the Avengers to be a typical clich√® heroes win, predictable, static film something which really takes the sting out of a film for me. I sat through the film realising that the Avengers would come through and win by the way the film was constructed. With the Dark Knight, no one could have predicted the Jokers complex schemes involving Harvey Dent and the way that Batman still beat the joker yet lost the most in the end. That is in my opinion where the Avengers falls short. It's use of poorly developed characters such as Loki, predictable story line and plot, overuse of CG and clich√©'s give it his rating. Sorry Avengers fans it might be hard to understand but trust me, people who write bad reviews for the Avengers criticizing plot and story are well read and any movie needs a good and dynamic plot regardless of the genre."

","The Avengers has been the trend for the past few days. Everybody had only good things to say about the movie, and so I decided to watch it. Well, it was not that good, not for me at least.<br/><br/>The film is a visual extravaganza, competing on the number of villains and visual graphics scene by scene. If that is what you want from a movie, then don't read the rest, just go and watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>But what the movie really lacks is a good solid storyline. It is as if the director wanted the movie to feature this much of characters and they should all get the same amount of screen time, let it be at the expense of the story! That is the main issue with the movie.<br/><br/>Upto the interval, the movie just drags on, the usual stuff with the villain trying to steal an energy source and the superhero team assembling to get it back. There is another interesting thing here. The villain actually tries to manipulate the team and let them fight each other, and this goes on and on and on in the first half. Really, absolutely boring with clich√©s all over. No creativity of any sort.<br/><br/>In a superhero movie, one thing we expect is the introduction of the superheroes. Well, introduction???? There was no such thing, they just walked on to the scene saying, ""Hi, there"". No thrill, no excitement , no sheer blood rushing through the veins scene.<br/><br/>And some people were there for no reason at all. I do not know what Black Widow and Captain America did. They just felt like minnows compared to the Hulk and Thor and co.<br/><br/>The cast was good anyway. Well they are not doing their roles for the first time, are they? so no credit there to the Avengers Team. Jeremie Renner, Scarlet Johansson and Robert Downey Jr were superb.<br/><br/>After the interval, the movie gains some pace and it is all action. This is where the movie becomes watchable. Actually I liked the second half of the movie. Action does not need story or dialogues, does it? May be that is why. And last but not the least, is that guy Loki really a villain or a joker?? Is that what a villain is? never terrifying, not even for a 2-year-old. and in the end """"""Spoiler alert"""""""""""" Hulk thrashes him and says ""puny god"". some villain, ha???!!!I am a big fan of superhero movies. In my opinion the best superhero movie released recently was X-Men First Class. Compared to that this is absolute crap, I would say. These guys made a movie which is to be their masterpiece, to which they put their money and effort limitlessly and it came out disfigured like this?, wow!!!!!"

There is no real explanation of the relationship between Thor and his brother nor is there any real tension. In the end, i was left not caring whether the good guys won or lost.

","I heard somewhere this was the first great Marvel flick, or this was the one to watch first, or something like that. Overall, it was entertaining but nothing special. The characters and story are pretty cliched. Some powerful object (a tesseract) falls into the hands of a malicious superhero (Loki, well played by Tom Hiddleston) and a crew comes together to try to get it back from him before he can pass it to the evil aliens who want to destroy Earth. They try to liven things up by creating some character and conflicts and the like, but for the most part it is a snooze. Downey's Iron Man is ironic and witty, Thor turns out to be the estranged brother of Loki, yeah yeah. These kinds of flicks are plug and play, get some star actors and plug them in, and so long as they look the part, things work out. It is fun to watch them flying around midtown Manhattan and smashing things up. The effects are the real stars.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that like our ancestors from previous centuries, the modern world wants to have its myths and its heroes - I guess old habits tend to stick around. But these myths mean very little and serve mostly to keep people's eyes glued to a screen."

","The Avengers is the definition of a perfect superhero film as it ticks all the boxes when it comes to humor, action, drama and even emotion. Not only did Joss Whedon understand how to tell any interesting superhero story, but he added weight to it by giving each of the main characters a reason to be there. The plot might seen simple at first, but in reality gives you more than what you asked for. The interactions between the characters are amazing and is the reason why I love these big superhero team films. Loki is one of the best comic book movie villains as he not only gets under the Avengers' skin, but also is able to tear them apart, which leads to internal and external conflicts. Robert Downey Jr is the far the star of the movie as he maintains Iron Man's personality through out the film at a consistent level. If you're looking for a really fun and exciting blockbuster, The Avengers might just be that film."

","I've noticed that most of these super-heroes battling super-villain films get very high viewer scores on IMDB--8.0 or above. Clearly, many people love this kind of movie. I don't. My thoughts:
I saw this on a plane several years ago. I've seen several others in the genre. In this film--they all seem to be like this--the heroes are battling to save the world. Sometimes, they battle to save the galaxy, or even the universe. In this film, the plot setup is so ridiculous, I can't take any of it even halfway seriously. But the genre fans are pleased, because it delivers the one supreme thing they care most about: beings with super-powers fighting each other. Much of this very over-long movie consists of characters battling, flying around, running around, more fighting, etc., etc. My reaction: giant yawn! What a bore! See, before these kinds of movies--say, before Star Wars, as a point of reference--most movies were not focused on battle scenes, explosions, fate of worlds, etc. They were about characters and human (not alien, etc.) beings. Action scenes, even in action films, did not take up most of the screen time. Now there have been so many of these films, they all seem alike. It's way beyond saturation. So, if you are entertained by lots of fighting using special effects, you may well like this. Otherwise, don't waste your time."

Cap in this is completely unlike how he was in First Avenger and his old-fashioned ways, even though it's not a bad thing, really took me out of the film at times.<br/><br/>But now that we've had his sequels and his excellent inclusion in Infinity War, I'm so glad that the Russo Brothers made him a better character in those. In this he wasn't really compelling. He was just kind of there to tell people that ""I'm the good guy here""<br/><br/>But nevertheless, this paved the way for the MCU to keep expanding and to really connect to these characters even more with the sequels and spin-offs.

The dialogue is pretty good i like the dialogue between Bruce banner and Agent romanoff in the beginning it was pretty tense and i think is one of the best scenes in the movie.
The Avengers having arguing with each other is really good especially the one where Loki was in prison and the reason the dialogue is so good is because these characters are very different from each other and them arguing is very interesting cause you get see their opinion on different subjects and their motives and morals and that's really good when it comes to character one thing that justice league never managed to succeed on.<br/><br/>The villain is eh.
Loki is much better than any other villain in the marvel cinematic universe and he was pretty fun to watch on screen.<br/><br/>I have nothing really big to say when it comes to the action scenes they where fine i like how the Avengers teamed up when they fought loki.<br/><br/>Good movie.

All of the characters are well-developed and share equal importance to the action-packed story. It's this key focus on character that really sets the film apart. The story itself is pretty generic, but it's the way in which the characters interact throughout the film that give it a personality. All of the cast are great, the score by Alan Silvestri is epic, and the script is full of witty dialogue that elevates the entertaining action sequences. The film isn't perfect, however, due to the 'over-theatrical' (but well performed) villain, the dissonance between the audience and the army of CGI aliens, and the rushed conclusion. 8/10"

The visual effects and action sequences of the last fourty minutes were sensational and thrilling, yet the long part before it was boring and useless.

","There's a sense of infancy and an accompanying intimacy, despite the large scale ending, because 'Avengers Assemble (2012)' is, for all intents and purposes, so retrospectively small and yet actually so big. It represents a keen, unprecedented challenge for writer/director Joss Whedon and it was a 'surprise' success to the delight of many a fan and studio-head across the globe. The fact it pulls off a six character crossover, without a clear protagonist I'll add, is impressive, and slightly concerning. It's also consistently entertaining and fast-paced, packing in all the action and spectacle you'd expect along with the quick character moments that make it stand out. There's the occasionally hammy line or ever so slightly cheesy moment, actually evocative of Whedon's style, that's only more amplified by the distance afforded by time and the fact that this flick wasn't what the MCU now is nor was it what the MCU then was, as it represented a shift in the 'universe' that was then shifted again rather quickly. These inconsistencies, of tone and character both past and prophetic future, aren't major issues and are often marked by moments of clairvoyant clarity or otherwise pitch perfection pertaining to comic-book character personas and, as such, the relatively plotless piece is still a delight to behold. It's smashy-bashy finale is also especially well-realised, though showing its age now, and feels like a tangible sequence rather than a series of green-screen sets connected by digital extensions. It isn't the best Marvel film, but it represented a big leap for the studio, and the genre as a whole, and is an enjoyable ride throughout. 8/10"

"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","7 October 2017"," A success yes, but not really on a groundbreaking level
","Here we have ""The Avengers"", the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but that's also subjective.<br/><br/>This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course, fitting the box office success, it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes, it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn't a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain, Loki may have been the primary antagonist here, but there is a lot more conflict in here, most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It's a long way to that. And when it's finally done, Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the ""other end of the universe"" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here, but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.<br/><br/>So yeah, overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast, but as the film is so long, every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me, these would be Jackson, Renner and ScarJo of course, even if I must admit that SLJ's character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It's a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It's of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish, but it's still a success and not just in quality, but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless, if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb, it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it, especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch, not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes."

","It has all come to this. Can a movie starring several grandiose superheroes be good, not only to comic book fans but to the entire world? And they got one of the greatest filmmakers for nerds ever: Joss Whedon. It is very clear in this movie that it is Whedonesque, especially in it's dialogue and jokes.<br/><br/>It all comes down to how the team gets together, and the chemistry among the team is immaculate. Everybody on the team work well together no matter what pairing it is: Hulk and Iron Man, Black Widow and Cap, Thor and Hulk, Cap and Iron Man. Notice that one name is missing here and that is Hawkeye. He was basically a zombie follower of Loki for half the film. Hawkeye in the final act is better but even Jeremy Renner knew that he wanted a better storyline. Still though, the entire team of Avengers had incredible chemistry.<br/><br/>The villain, Loki, was a great choice for the Avengers to take on. He is a formidable villain, as a trickster god with an alien army. Sure, aliens were a bunch of alien clones but they did prove to be a good matchup against the Avengers.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the final battle. It takes place in New York, which is great because that is one of the benefits Marvel has over DC, they take place it cities that we actually live in. Sure, it is fictional but they still went by several places that people have actually been to. It was amazing to see the team fight, either in tandem or by themselves, for 20ish action packed minutes. <br/><br/>That doesn't mean I don't have complaints about the film. As I mentioned before, it bothered me how Hawkeye was used, although he did get a chance in the end to make his mark. Cap's costume looked for like a onesie and not something you would expect a war hero and super soldier to wear. The army might have been CGI at the end so it was just mindless action and one-liners, but when it is done this well, you can't really complain.<br/><br/>This is a pioneering and spectacular film in it's right. It took something that nobody thought could work, a blockbuster film starring at least 4 larger than life characters that have only had their own movie and made a great movie.<br/><br/>+ Cast chemistry + Whedon writing and directing + Loki + Third Act Battle - Really small things (use of Hawkeye for some of the movie, Cap's suit, CGI army)<br/><br/>Final Score: 9.5/10"

","I'm not a traditional comic turned into movie watcher. I do have a tendency to watch those films that seem to catch my attention in the trailers, are recommended by friends, like the Avengers, or have high ratings. Not being a super-hero comic film devotee, for a super-hero movie to work for me has to be basically entertaining, engaging and fun. And, if possible to have a good combination of at least a few of the following elements: > Good script. > Great action scenes. > Fantastic production. > Good actors. > Good acting. > Great sense of humor. > A great music score. This movie ticked off a good deal of this boxes, and that happened mostly in the final hour of the film. <br/><br/>THE GOOD. <br/><br/>> The production of the Avengers is top notch. Great settings, suits, spaceship design, and alien images. > The last half of the movie is what I expect from a super-hero action movie to be and it has a great tempo, awesome action scenes, spectacular fights and alien creatures, and is full-on fun and engaging. > Jackson, Hiddlestone and Evans are good in their performances, but I personally liked the freshness and natural acting of Paltrow and Gregg in their very secondary supporting roles. I love seeing kick-ass female characters, and Johannson seems really fit for that sort of roles, and she nails her character in that super-tight suit. > Some of the dialogues and scenes were witty. <br/><br/>THE BAD. <br/><br/>> Painful tempo and too long. I felt bored to the core during the first half of the movie, which goes for over an hour, with boring pretentious dialogues not much happening, and scenes that don't add anything to the film. I stopped the DVD frequently because I was struggling to keep my attention focused. > Hemsworth was a pain to watch when he had to deliver his lines no matter how hot, and Downey Jr always plays the same role no matter his character, something I find very annoying. > Thor had a quite heavy Australian accent but his brother in the film Loki had a very British accent, although, of course, they are from planet whatever. Shouldn't they have had at least a neutral unified accent? > The film is set in a sort of near future, with flying ships and very developed technology, but we see the Police and some of the characters using simple shotguns; this incongruity rests credibility to the settings of the film.<br/><br/>THE LOL. <br/><br/>The only thing I found hilarious in the film is Ruffalo's transformation into Hulk and some of the scenes related to the Hulk. Seeing the Hulk with Ruffalo's face was like seeing Hulk with Micky Mouse's face. Ruffalo has very sweet facial features, seems to be a very sweet guy, and usually plays tranquil man roles. This was a fluffy huggable Hulk. I was really LOL. The dialogue between him and the old man when he falls into a warehouse are hilarious, but that was intended. <br/><br/>OVERALL. <br/><br/>If you are fan of Super-hero comic books and films, you are going to enjoy and love this film no matter what I say; that's great and totally respectable. If you are a lover of good films, no matter the subject, this film is entertaining overall, has a great second half, but you will struggle to get there without feeling uninterested due to the unfocused direction, the poor dialogues and the extra-long unnecessary footage.If you overcome the first half, congratulations, you have made it to the Avengers' red carpet of action galore."

"The_big_mick","7","3","12","13 May 2012"," Definitely Entertaining, But Nowhere Near as Good as IMDb is Making it Out To Be
","Its quite laughable that people are saying this is better than Dark Knight, because in reality its nowhere near as good. That's not to say the movie isn't entertaining, because it is. Its just not the epic IMDb's other reviewers would have you believe. The movie has its share of problems.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>I thought Hulk was finally done right in movies, and Mark Ruffalo, I thought, did an excellent job as Bruce Banner. The Thanos spoiler at the end makes me extremely pumped to see the sequel. Tom Hiddleston was a very good Loki. Everyone fit their role quite well (with one exception). The action scenes were stellar in terms of CGI and choreography.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>1. There was really zero point to Scarlett Johansson aside from providing the male fans with some T&A. They tried to introduce this dynamic between her and Hawkeye, but it ended up going absolutely nowhere. <br/><br/>2.Joss Whedon in the comics tends to write very campy dialogue. As a result, this movie came off as more of a comedy than anything. I can deal with comedy and some of it in this movie was very well done (I loved Loki and Thor's conversation on the cliff, then Iron Man tackles Thor, and Loki speaks to the empty spot and says ""You were saying?"" That was excellent). However, almost every damn word out of Tony Stark's mouth was a joke or one liner. He was basically comedy relief. I know that Tony Stark is like that in the comics, but he can be very serious as well. Tony was serious for about 2 minutes after Coulson died and then went right back to the jokes. I think Whedon placed way too much an emphasis on comedy. <br/><br/>3. As a result of this comedy, there was almost no character development. I see other reviews mentioning this incredible emotion and depth. They are deceiving you-there was none of either. No one grew or changed. Its a classic good vs evil story where good eventually triumphs, with no underlying messages or tones. That's all the movie really needed to be, but others are giving the movie traits that it doesn't have. <br/><br/>4. I really hated that they kept calling the Cosmic Cube the Tesserack or however its spelled. Its the Cosmic Cube-very simple, no need to change it. Why did they? I haven't a clue, but it was dumb.<br/><br/>5. General plot problem #1: in Lord of the Rings, when the Uruk-hai killed Boromir, from then on you took the enemy seriously. They'd just killed one of the greatest warriors in Middle Earth, the greatest in Gondor, and broken the Fellowship. Hence, in the Two Towers, when an army of them marched on Helms Deep, you really wanted to see what happened because Man was defending against an army of credible foes. In the Avengers, it really takes away from the movie when the giant army Loki has been talking about and building up to finally shows up and are promptly decimated like they were gnats at a bug zapper. They were literally there to get slaughtered with ease and provide a big CGI fight scene. As a result, there was no emotional investment in the final fight because the big enemies were a joke. <br/><br/>6. General plot problem #2: In Thor, Thor beat Loki by himself pretty much. Now comes the Avengers and they're fighting the evil Loki again. Why exactly do we want to see this? Loki lost to Thor in the movie last year-good has triumphed over evil, the story has concluded. Now we're getting it rehashed but one side has 5 more members. When we've already seen the main villain lose to one of the heroes before, it takes a lot away from the movie. What's the point of doing it again? <br/><br/>7. General plot problem #3: the plot itself was very routine, yet they somehow managed to garble it with twists that went nowhere. Loki deliberately got himself caught to occupy the Avengers while Hawkeye under mind control stole some stuff Loki needed. Then they introduced the whole idea that Banner might be subconsciously under Loki's control, which amounted to nothing. Then Hawkeye has to bust Loki out of the SHIELD Helicarrier, when Loki has been shown to have the ability to teleport at will through solid matter. Then there's the whole sub plot of a free energy Stark Tower which becomes the focal point for the final battle while Loki opens up a portal to bring his army in using the free energy, yet they already established that the Cosmic Cube provides unlimited power itself, in which case this also amounts to nothing. SHIELD is found out to be planning to use the Cube to make WMDs and its a big secret that the Avengers are shocked at, yet Fury makes one mention of the Avengers Initiative plan and the WMDs are promptly forgotten. Coulson's death was really a plot device so Fury could smear some blood on his Captain America collector cards stashed in his locker and give the Avengers a kick start to go fight. Then there's the whole thing about going out for shwarma that was really pointless and contributed nothing. Hawkeye and Black Widow also went nowhere as previously mentioned.<br/><br/>Overall, the 8.7 rating this movie has makes it EXTREMELY overrated. I suspect its people just being dazzled by CGI and seeing childhood comic heroes come to life on the big screen that makes them ignore the problems the movie has. They didn't let George Lucas get away with Star Wars Episodes 1-3, and yet this is generally the same thing. I wonder why.<br/><br/>This movie is really a 6/10 but I'm feeling generous and gave it 7. Its fun to watch and I was entertained, but it really doesn't deserve the high rating it has."
"e5312","7","3","12","26 April 2012"," A great merge of many great movies
","As many, I have been waiting for this film since ages. As I was quite fond of all the previous Avenger movies, I obviously had great expectations, some were fulfilled and some were not. The movie started quite thrilling. Bringing in the Chitauri was brilliant, I kinda wish they would have got a bigger part in the story than just being the bad-ass alien army to defeat. But of course, as the film had so many things to expand it would have been a little bit too much. And that was quite the bad point in the movie, even though I was expecting it to happen. With so many main characters and with all their background stories, there was not enough time to unfold everything that was behind the story. By that I mean, some of the characters were not even near as complex as in the previous movies. For example, I think Thor turned out to be pretty one-sided in this film. I really liked the movie Thor and while it was obvious that most characters were not going to be in this one, I still missed Hopkins, Portman and Dennings, mostly because the character of Thor was more like the angry prince like in the beginning of the movie Thor, rather than the wise king he had became in the end of it. Another problem the amount of characters brought up was that the movie was a bit too fast. Unlike the calmer nature of the original films, in this one there was always something happening, mostly fight scenes. I love fight scenes and usually enjoy them to the most, but only with a fine balance of them and calmer moments. Of course in short terms, it was very amazing and exciting, but when it came to the death scene of Coulson, as Fury sat next to him in silence had I only realized how tired one can get of seeing almost nothing but battles for an entire movie. Yet, as I've said before, with so many characters making this film calmer would have been simply impossible. The acting otherwise was really nice, the crew seemed to do their best during the whole film. Smulders was a pleasant surprise, she was truly marvelous in the role of Agent Hill. Ruffalo was just as well a good exchange of Norton, he made the character of Bruce Banner very likable. The scores also did catch up to the spirit of the film pretty well, the music kept you in the mood during the whole time. As for the amazing sides of the film, the visuals were utterly cutting-edge. 3D effects were not that outstanding though, guess it still does not really worth the headache. For a sequel (as I hope one will happen in the near future), I just hope that they will have more space and time to expand the characters' personalities a bit more precisely. As for the first film to merge all these stories, I don't think they could have done any better. Maybe not the best directing nor the best superhero movie of all time, but for sure is a fun film to watch with many great moments and good acting. A must-see for all Marvel fans."
"justinburke457","1","6","32","19 April 2015"," Bland forgettable garbage
","This film is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. The movie is so bland and predictable and none of the characters are interesting or memorable the dialog in the movie is laughably bad. The movies universe doesn't have any consistency to it what so ever like how agent coulson dies and ends up appearing in captain America 2 and the universe doesn't have any consequences to it what so ever and it isn't even fun or enjoyable it is just bland and dull. It is one of the few movies I was so board and disinterested at that I fell asleep while watching it that is a rarity for me since I love film so much and I usually get sucked into movies that just shows how bland and forgettable this film is. The film is so predictable I knew even before It actually started what was gonna happen. I just hate how much people loved this movie I don't get it what is to like in this movie I hate big budget summer blockbusters that have no originality and this is the perfect example of that. While I wouldn't say it is the worst movie of all time it is just the fact that it is so bland and forgettable makes me hate it more than hilariously bad movies like the room or samurai cop. In conclusion this film is a buy the numbers action blockbuster that fails on so many levels it fails to be enjoyable funny and fails to have impressive effects and fails at the most basic fundamentals of film it doesn't have good characters and a good story"
"bertler-1","4","6","32","4 April 2013"," highly overrated...
","Uninspired high gloss kiddie comic adaption with acceptable visual effects and a screenplay that fits on one sheet of toilet paper...<br/><br/>It is almost incredible how this Movie could be so highly rated. Must be indebted by the target group which exists from nerd comic-fans and teenagers without an clue what makes a good movie...<br/><br/>The characters are flat and as a result none of the (normaly good) actors is capable of convincing.<br/><br/>What's left is the typical action-loaded special effects spectacle.

"abedelkader","4","5","25","14 May 2012"," The Animated version is much better
","I cant believe that this film got more than 6/10 rating , to even see 8.8/10 is utterly ridiculous. The story line is just cut and paste scenes . The villain is weak.<br/><br/>OK now pause a minute , add all of the above to a bunch of funny clips that we all watch in the extras in the DVD version, but instead these clips are placed in the middle of intense (action/in the mood to fight) battle scenes, that will completely drop your focus, I mean just when you are starting to like the film and get into the mood and into the story you get interrupted by some stupid (I guess funny) clip that we could have avoided.<br/><br/>Other than that, if you watched transformers you are not missing anything, just some blow ups that you loose count of at the end of the film."
"aryayush","6","5","25","29 April 2012"," Epic finale makes it worth watching, but disappointing overall.
","There are many movies that are hotly anticipated and there's a huge buzz on Twitter for months before they are released. Usually, I go to watch them with some trepidation‚Äîlike in the case of 'Inception'‚Äîbecause I don't expect them to live up to the hype. That wasn't the case with 'The Avengers'. I went in fully expecting to love the movie. I didn't, for the most part.<br/><br/>THE PLOT<br/><br/>There's perhaps no better way to describe my disappointment with it than to say that even though the whole movie revolved around an object called the Tasseract, by the time it was done, I had no idea what it was. It's surprising how a movie with so many characters and so little time for character and plot development still managed to squander the minutes.<br/><br/>Any book or movie has a basic plot, which has only a handful of major variations, and you go in expecting to see a particular writer's take on that basic premise. You expect them to build on it and give it an elaborate new shape.<br/><br/>In 'The Avengers', however, the basic plot is all you get‚Äîa team of heroes are initially uncooperative with each other, they fail against the villain, regroup and then beat him in a final showdown. What little attempts 'The Avengers' makes to dress that plot are so utterly reliant on other movies that have come before that to someone who hasn't seen them, it makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>'The Avengers' assumes that you have watched the Iron Man movies, 'Thor', 'Captain America' and 'The Incredible Hulk' before you set foot in the theater and does not feel the need to explain so many of the incomprehensible things that happen on the screen. A lot of people disagree with me on this point but I think it is nonsensical to expect me to watch five movies before I sit down to watch one. It's the responsibility of the scriptwriter to make sure that the movie stands on its own.<br/><br/>THE HEROES<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo in the role of Bruce Banner was fantastic in this movie and I think the funniest character overall. Tony Stark had the best punchlines but Banner's humor was more nuanced, in my opinion. But he did not get nearly as much screen time as he deserved. I'd like to see that guy get a Hulk movie of his own.<br/><br/>Captain America, on the other hand, who was damn near useless in a war that involved hordes of flying drones, was a constant presence in the movie. The utter Americanness of Captain America makes me very indifferent towards the character and I thought the movie would've been better without him.<br/><br/>Same goes for the Black Widow, who had little to do during the final battle. Hawkeye's storyline in the movie made no sense either, and Samuel Jackson just did not work as Nick Fury. He wasn't aggressive enough for the part.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Iron Man, but he was a shadow of what he was in his own movies. He's supposed to be the funniest of the bunch but I could not really appreciate the punchline-heavy dialog he spouted. I think he's more genuinely funny in the Iron Man movies and, in fact, I'd love to see Jov Favreau direct 'The Avengers 2'. Still, after the Hulk, Iron Man was pretty much the only Avenger who had a significant role to play in the proceedings.<br/><br/>THE VILLAIN<br/><br/>As for the villain, Loki, the less said the better. He was an embarrassingly underpowered villain and didn't seem imposing for a second. Take away the drones, which themselves weren't very threatening, and he's almost impotent. He got blasted with a gun-like thing from a man in a suit, for crying out loud. Watching the final battle, it was clear that Iron Man could have taken on him alone‚Äîsix superheroes was beyond overkill to counter this guy.<br/><br/>MISCELLANEOUS COMPLAINTS<br/><br/>I also took issue with the fact that ordinary humans had no role to play in this movie. There are only two scenes in which they even have a speaking part and they're both used for comic effect (and one of them is also used to try to justify Captain America's presence in this movie) and are inconsequential. It makes you feel detached from the movie; the action might be happening on Mars, for all anyone cares.<br/><br/>The people who liked the movie, which is nearly everyone who saw it, are saying that the action was awesome and that's all anyone really wanted from this movie. Maybe you did, but that doesn't work for me. While the action at the end is of an epic scale that is rarely matched even in Hollywood, the dialog and plot are far more essential for me.<br/><br/>THE ACTION<br/><br/>I'll say this about the action though: it was involving. In plenty of movies, epic battle scenes are filmed in such a way that you feel like you are watching the action from the outside. It's a jumbled mess of explosions and flying debris. In 'The Avengers', despite its six heroes and an army of flying drones, you could see the individual participants and feel like you were in the middle of the action. It was very satisfying, particularly in 3D.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>When you watch truly horrible movies, you exit the theater hoping that they never make a sequel (or at least resolving that you won't watch it if it were to be made), but that's not the case here. The potential for a great movie is clearly there, and I am glad that there will be a sequel to this movie‚ÄîI just hope someone does a better job of making it. A story is about more than just its climax."
"ppriestley","3","4","19","30 June 2012"," Extremely Overrated, just your average action movie.
","Went to see this with low expectations and it was just as bad as I thought it would be, very overrated.<br/><br/>All the lead up films are average, Incredible Hulk was OK and Captain America and Thor are poor films but the two Iron Man films are pretty good but not brilliant.<br/><br/>There's so many story lines they could have done to make this film brilliant but the storyline reminds me a lot of Transformers 3 except this has a bunch of superheroes instead of robots, the same old storyline of the bad guys want to take over planet earth and the big problem with this film is we never really care about any of the characters, there's no emotion in this film whatsoever. This is a major spoiler don't read this part if you don't want to; Agent Coulson who is in the lead up films, dies and they try to make it emotional but none of the superheroes really care except maybe Iron Man but he's not that upset about it.<br/><br/>As for the acting performances they're all poor, the only actor who can come out of this film with any credit is Robert Downey Jnr who is the reason I'm giving it a three out of ten, he is the stand out performance in this star studded cast, he is very good as Tony Stark/Iron Man and is the only good thing about the film. As for the rest of the cast they are all poor performances which is surprising because it such a good cast; Scarlett Johannson is bad as Black Widow and as for Jeremy Renner, he doesn't get much screen time as Hawkeye, there's a little bit of a story between these two characters but they never expand on it. Chris Evans gives a wooden performance as Captain America, for me doesn't make a good Captain America. And Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk is a slight improvement on Edward Norton but not brilliant.<br/><br/>Then there's the villain Loki played by Tom Hiddleston who is so cheesy and predictable it is unreal and there's nothing threatening about him at all and with some saying the best villain ever, must be joking, he's a joke.<br/><br/>So to conclude, I don't know how this has got a 8.6 rating so don't believe how all the hype and fan boys, it is on a par with Transformers 3 which is not a good thing, just non-stop action for no particular reason, to sum up a very poor 3/10 when they could have done it so much better."

"mehmetpscevik","6","2","7","19 April 2015"," A mediocre film
","Well having seen this film a couple of years ago I now realise I am late to review it, but better late than never. This film received a lot of huge attention pre-release and for good reason, you had many big superheroes in this film: Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America etc. You knew a lot of comic book nerds or action film favouring individuals would watch this. Well it's not that good, in fact it's (as I said in the title) MEDIOCRE. First of all we are seeing the same villain again who we previously saw in Thor, Loki, who inexplicably returns for another Marvel film. Seriously though, there are plenty of other villains and yet they go with the same one we've probably seen.<br/><br/>Anyway, the Avengers surprisingly (sarcasm) triumph over Loki by defeating him. This is very predictable, six superheroes against one villain, by those odds it's obvious who will win. I mean they barely struggled, in fact the struggle primarily came from within the team where they were fighting or having petty arguments with each other. At parts though, the film was funny, the action scenes were impressive and the characters had good chemistry/dialogue with each other. But, in my opinion there were no struggle with the heroes outmatching the enemy; it was all too easy and you knew they would eventually overcome them. They won very easily which is unsurprising with six heroes if truth be told. Anyway, the enemies were generic Alien robots that malfunctioned by one manoeuvre, they were so easily outfought by the avengers. There were an overabundance of explosions and shooting which left me feeling irritated. Overall a generic, action film. Generic enemies, fights, explosions; too predictable. I'm surprised how much money this film made and the ratings it got. This is a film where you can only watch it once and be overjoyed, a second time will be too boring and the third is unbearable to watch."

"vasmuth88","5","2","7","25 January 2015"," Review from a normal viewer
","I am neither a marvel fan nor hater. I even like some of their worse films like the spiderman series but I also disliked popular ones like thor. I like their movies more when they take themselves to serious. When I first watched the avengers it was on an airplane so beautiful rendered CGI and effects weren't influencing me through the small screen so it was mostly watching the story for me and I really think its marvels worst. Loki taking over the earth, Shield corporations, super heroes on pms emotions and obscure aliens. Even worse were superfluous characters like the black widow. It was just a huge mess of sci fi and super hero clich√©s. So why do I give it a 5? A mediochre rating? Because it had good acting, some funny scenes and when watched on a huge screen is pretty. It makes little sense but it entertains. I would say for people who cant stand unlogical stories this would propably rate much lower (My sister hated it e.g.) and for marvel fans its just nice fanservice."
"uncreativeperson7","5","2","7","11 January 2015"," Your standard popcorn flick - nothing more, nothing less
","I like Marvel, I really do, and there is a lot done well with this movie. However, once fans get over the fact that ""OH MY GOSH ALL OF THE HEROES ARE TOGETHER AND THERE'S LOKI AND 'HULK SMASH' IT'S SO COOL AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH,"" you begin to see a lot of underlying problems beneath the standard eye-candy of action movies.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to admire how they built this film (and the entire Cinematic Universe). Giving each hero their own stand-alone film really establishes them as tangible parts of this world, regardless of how extraordinary they may be. It was a long term investment that is just incredible to look back on. If only it didn't culminate on such an average note.<br/><br/>Essentially, the premise is that Loki (from ""Thor"") has come back from the dead and has magically transported himself to Earth using the tesseract - that cube-thing from ""Captain America"" that can open inter-dimensional space-portals...somehow. Loki plans on stealing the tesseract (somehow knowing exactly what it is, where it is, and how to control it) in order to send a generic alien army to Earth to destroy it...for some reason. Honestly, I've seen it several times and I'm still confused as to his motivation. Is it because Thor likes Natalie Portman? Whatever.<br/><br/>In order to stop Loki, Nick Fury brings the Avengers together. Here we have a few more problems. Firstly, the Avengers are supposed to be practically every single Marvel hero ever printed. I totally understand that that would be impossible, but out of the few that are included, why on earth do we have Black Widow and Hawkeye? They have no powers; they're not superheroes. We're already getting so few Avengers; why not make them all super-powered? That's not to say that either sharpshooter is bad, but that they're just disappointing in comparison.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody develops at all as character. I know that there are a lot of heroes to showcase, and honestly I'm astounded at how evenly the screen time is divided between them. However, without any development, there's nothing to connect to. Sure they developed in their own movies, but this is a whole new film, and as such it needs some character too. Basically, the characters just go from ""Okay, I don't really like these other guys for some reason"" to ""Team Avengers!!"" It's so generic, and it doesn't feel satisfying as a result.<br/><br/>After the heroes get together, Loki gets himself captured...for some reason. He then busts out, launches the alien invasion, and the Avengers go to stop him. Hulk magically learns to control his powers...somehow, and they save the day.<br/><br/>So overall, there's really no character development, and the villain lacks any motivation. Some effects don't even look finished; Hulk is still looks really fake, and some shots are terribly obvious greenscreen (notably when Thor and Hulk are fighting on an alien spaceship).<br/><br/>It's basically your average action flick: explosions, fights, destroyed cars, etc. Other than the fact that Marvel brought these heroes together, there's nothing spectacular about the film, and it's become overrated thanks to the love of fans. Nothing terrible, but nothing extraordinary either."
"gerben7","Null","2","7","5 October 2014"," So many mistakes....
","So many mistakes in one movie.The biggest ones: In the middle of the alien attack, Hulk rushed through a top floor of a building and people there are still working!!! Is it normal to keep on working in a high building if the city is under siege of a bunch of aliens?When there is a far view of the beam on the city, you see ships still not moving away from it.They are not fleeing the scene. The aliens that attack the earth, have not even powerful weaponry, only small firearms,or ships with a very small blast radius. There are no huge blows.If I was to invade earth I would bring serious firepower.The army of Thanos, has not. I did not see the US air force, anywhere!!You would say that they would scramble all jets to fight the aliens.The army and navy (with cruise missiles to knock of any target that comes out of the beam) are not in sight either.<br/><br/>Where are all other superheroes when earth is under siege?<br/><br/>It makes no sense to make a event with this impact (the earth is at stake) if you are not able to get all heroes in one movie.I know there are different franchises, so I would suggest that something else would be at stake, the live of a superheroes or a small republic.<br/><br/>Now this has become a movie with huge gaps, all heroes survive miraculously and Coulson relives in a series after he died.<br/><br/>It is poor."

","Whedon has done an excellent job directing this movie. Getting such popular superheros together in one movie, and giving them all equal screen time is a difficult task, and Whedon has perfected it. Highlight of the movie was fight between hulk and Thor. I was little disappointed when I heard that Edward Norton won't be playing role of hulk, but after seeing Ruffalo's performance I was quite surprised. Hulk and Iron man have great roles in this movie. There is absolutely no flaw in the movie. All the actors (Robert, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark, Scarlett, Samuel, Jeremy, etc) have done a fabulous job. This is a movie not to be missed. The last I really enjoyed watching superhero movie was Spiderman 1 (Toby Maguire). This movie completely blew me away. I went to watch this movie during the premier on Thursday night, and it was completely worth standing in big line at 12am in the night. Overall a fantastic movie. Do not miss it!"
"Emilykay91","10","2","7","20 October 2013"," Long, but great.
","The Avengers is a great action movie people of all ages would enjoy, especially geeks and fans of comics. Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and others are all in it! The movie is action-packed, with amazing special effects, but with the traditional storyline one would expect from similar films. However, it is not the storyline that defines this movie, but the rich interactions of all these superhero characters as they try to work together to save the world.<br/><br/>The Avengers is entertaining, with many funny moments, one-liners, unexpected events, and even long fights between the superheroes themselves. However, the movie progresses very slowly, which is a bit frustrating for a movie packed with superstars and a run time of two hours and 23 minutes. Although I appreciate the director's work in taking enough time to present the unique and complex personality of every character in the story. The cast also does a great job with the characters, and each of the superheroes gets their own chance to shine throughout the story, although you can see the director's unique passion towards the Iron Man and Hulk characters -- Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay and directed the film.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is long, but great! And if you like Marvel's superheroes, this is definitely THE movie for you!"

","Nick Fury brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.<br/><br/>Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun."

","This movie smashed my expectations! I thought it was going to be another action explosion movie with no plot. But I was mistaken. Joss did a great job with this movie. I'll break it down. ACTING: On a scale of bad, good, or great | The acting was great for this genre. Scarlett Johannsson did a good job as tough girl agent Natasha Romanoff. Jeremy Renner did a good job also as machine level accuracy tough guy Clint Barton. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as billionaire philanthropist Tony Stark. There's still a lot more! Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston both do a great job as gods Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston). Mark Ruffalo also does a great job as super genius/big green rage monster Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk. Chris Evans does a good job as tough, sort-of-super-human-old-guy-but-not- really Steve Rogers/Captain America. Samuel L. Jackson does a great job as smart but tough tactical expert Nick Fury. And finally, Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job as developmental woman/girlfriend of Tony Stark Pepper Potts. All of the other acting was good as well. SPECIAL EFFECTS: Great! All of the special effects combined in the first 45 minutes are better than 10 Syfy movie's special effects. Especially the end sequence. Whoa! I have to hold my horses. OK. The special and visual effects throughout the whole movie were great, and are as good if not better than other Marvel movies, especially the 90's ones. The earlier fights within the air plane carrier plane thing with The Hulk and The Black Widow and Thor and all that stuff and jets and falling through the sky is all great. I also has great special effects in the end battle sequence in Manhattan, New York. DIALOGUE: The dialogue was also great. It was serious, smart, and humorous throughout the movie at just the right times. One of my favorite quotes was from Tony Stark, ""Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails."" This really was a comedy at times. It kept the movie more pleasant than it would have been without it. STORY: The story was overall original, I thought, and I think they probably shouldn't make another one. But that is just my opinion. I give this movie a 9/10 overall because it is funny, realistic special effects-wise, and had great acting. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Action, Sci-Fi, or Fantasy."

I like that 2/3 are the same actors. Hawkeye is new to the group and Hulk¬Ö Well, the Hulk has been played now by 3 different actors¬Ö Bruce Banner went from tall and built to a little shorter and lankier to short and Hispanic looking¬Ö Hmmm¬Ö Well regardless of who Bruce Banner is played by, one thing stays the same¬Ö You don't get the Hulk angry. As for the Black Widow at least when she appears in Iron Man 2, they kept the same actress. I will admit that I never have been a fan of Scarlett Johansson as an actress or as one to read about in the tabloids¬Ö However, she kicks some major as in this movie and the chemistry that she has with our hott Jeremy Renner is very appealing. Yes, I know they don't actually have a sexual or physical anything on screen but their friendship shows promise¬Ö There is a heat without it actually being sexual or physical. I like the way they care for each other. I must also add that I love that Samuel L. Jackson is the ""ring leader"". He is the same smartass that he usually plays.<br/><br/>This movie has a straight plot and lots of action. There is no time (that I noticed) that it goes off track like some movies do. I like that everyone plays their character correctly. Captain America is a straight talking guy. He gives direction without hesitation as a great leader should¬Ö Especially for this group. Iron Man aka Tony Stark is his witty, sarcastic, smart self. I can honestly say that if Robert Downey Jr. were to discontinue the part of Iron Man¬Ö I would NOT go and see any of the movies.

I like that everyone can shoot at each other with the sarcastic remarks.<br/><br/>If you have the chance to get the movie on DVD or Bluray, then do so.

This film is the cinematic peak of 2012. So much time, effort, spoilers, Comic-Con appearances and millions of other components have been put into this picture. It is a Marvel fan boy's nirvana, an action fan's expectation fulfiller and only a foetus could dislike the whole of this film. Expertly written and beautifully acted out, complete with the best special effects EVER makes Avengers Assemble not just a film to watch once or twice. It's a film to watch until your disc player explodes. Every single character gets their chance to shine and they play out well. And although Hawkeye and Black Widow (Renner and Johansson) haven't had their own films (Hawkeye had a brief cameo in Thor; Black Widow had a more obvious involvement in Iron Man 2), they are just as great as Captain America and Iron Man. Avengers Assemble- you'd be a fool to miss it. OVERALL: One of the best films of the millennium. Watch the Hulk vs. Loki scene for the best takeout ever."

","I have been a comic fan since the mid 90's. After a gap of almost 15 years a recently picked up my old hobby. Much has changed since I last read Spider-man, Wolverine and The Punisher. I never have been a fan of Fantastic Four or The Avengers. And after this movie, I won't change my mind about it.<br/><br/>Not that The Avengers is a bad film, it's really not. But it's not all that the hype pretends it is. Whedon makes a very enjoyable popcorn-movie that's true to it's comic book roots. You get a lot of bang for your buck: 6 superheroes in a 2+ hour movie. Whedon keeps all his movies light and with humor. I finally see what he intended with Alien Resurrection. Although I still think it would not have worked. Alien doesn't lend itself for humor. But this material does. And Whedon does it well. The story isn't too complicated. I'm glad all these movies use elements from the golden or silver age of the original comics. The story is a old-school kinda story. Not complicated and with little back story (because all of them had an individual one. Some even two!).<br/><br/>The effects are well done, although I think on a TV screen (even by today's standards), it's just too chaotic to really follow. I had the same feeling with the horrendous Transformer-films. Although the action in this film isn't half as confusing as those three turds.<br/><br/>All and all: it's a nice blockbuster with steady performances, good action and an old fashioned, humorous story. I could write half a page about it being a little too patriotic and militaristic, but hey, I'm European. I really don't get all the fascination with guns and jets and stuff."

Robert Downey Jr as Stark was the best part of the film, he made it 100% more watchable as soon as he appeared on set. a couple of one liners added a few laughs but overall I'm glad it was a free movie on Foxtel and I didn't waste my cash on a movie ticket. The villain was OK though he did remind me of Grimma Wormtongue from Lord of the Rings (who was a much better bad guy). Thor...well sorry he and captain America just weren't very good actors in this movie; you just didn't endear to their characters. The hulk guy was OK, he played a good Dr David Banner."

It will not do a lot of good for viewers who expect quality in acting, serious plot and dramatic ending w/ special after-effect.

The movie does not deserve 7 stars nor does it fall into a 6 category since its making suggests or dictates achievement of visual/cinematographic effects of some level, all of which clearly worth of some praise, IMO."

","In fact, there is no need to comment on this film and everything done is perfect. It should be congratulated that film's director and writer. The film came up to my expectations totally. Cast of the film consists of my favorite actor and actress whose name are Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson. A negative thing about film, the beginning of the film is a bit boring, because scenes in the film take place in a ship I guess which made me a bit bored. But the scenes which was taking place in city is very fantastic and realistic which made me very excited.<br/><br/>After watching it, immediately I examine avengers om IMDb in terms of its budget, gross and vote. I saw that its gross is approaching one million dollars and also its rate is 8.7 and absolutely it deserves that.<br/><br/>The another thing which impresses me is unbelievable scenes. They are really really perfect and still have a bearing upon this film. Also the extra-terrestrials who are coming other planet is very realistic.<br/><br/>Especially, character of hulk is very funny and attractive. To sum up,but for beginning of the film, rest of the film is very great and thanks director and cast for presenting such a fantastic film."
"ksj870","10","2","7","24 May 2012"," A Masterpiece of Superhero Cinema
","Perhaps the highest praise I can offer The Avengers is that it is exactly like a classic comic book story come to life. The epic scope, the hopelessly outnumbered team of heroes fighting for our lives, the diabolical villains, and action, action, and more action¬Öit's all here in one incredible live-action package. Is The Avengers the best superhero film ever made? Maybe not, but considering the grand scale and everything that had to come together just to avoid a bomb, it's hard not to dismiss the few minor weaknesses and simply applaud what does work, which is after all nearly everything.<br/><br/>True, The Avengers is a very long movie, and if you haven't seen the other Marvel superhero films (especially Thor and Captain America), it may take you a while to figure out exactly what's going on. But this isn't rocket science, it's a comic book come to life, and it won't take even a complete newcomer long to get up to speed.<br/><br/>Director and screenwriter Joss Whedon has to get a lot of the credit for making the film such a success. Whedon clearly knows and loves the characters he's working with, and he wisely takes his time exploring each hero's personality. Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) , Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) could have easily just been heartless blockbusters, but Whedon instills each of them with personal style and spirit. The banter between the various heroes as they slowly‚Äîand painfully‚Äîlearn to work together is nearly as exciting as the inevitable showdown between the forces of good and evil.<br/><br/>Nearly, that is. The climax is one of the grandest spectacles of mayhem ever filmed, far surpassing the similar final battles that have been the apex of the various Transformer movies. As in the comics, the Avengers are brought together by the machinations of Loki, Thor's evil brother, once again played to brilliant perfection by Tom Hiddleston. But this time Loki has an army of extraterrestrials backing him up, and it is suggested that there are other forces involved that may be even more wicked than Loki himself.<br/><br/>Throw in Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, head of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D. organization, and you have everything a long-time Avengers aficionado could have hoped for. Incredibly thrilling, very well-acted and directed, with a witty script and heroes you can really believe in, at least for a couple of hours¬ÖThe Avengers is an instant action classic."

But when it does the effects are so off the scale as to mesmerise.<br/><br/>It's funny in parts. Ruffalo as The Hulk has all the comedy gasp out loud adventure moments but Thomas Downie Junior continues to build a body of light comedy work that's slowly making him ""best in class"". Scarlett Johansonn has an admirable ass but adds little other than that. Cobie Smulders is hot. And so is Gweyneth Paltrow.<br/><br/>The CGI and SFX as the ""Aliens"" invade New York in the final reel are the best I have ever seen. By a long way. The destruction of Manhattan is actually quite scary reminding us, as it does, of 9/11.<br/><br/>Cinematography by Seamus McGarvey, surely one of Edinburgh's great film exports (despite being an Ulsterman) is a career high of many highs.<br/><br/>Without the back stories this would have been little short of perfection. With them it's too long so gets a seven out of ten."
"ctomvelu1","7","2","7","18 May 2012"," Loud fun
","Big, bombastic comic book movie about a bunch of Marvel Comics characters teaming up to defeat alien invaders. Four of the original Avengers are joined by two other Marvel heroes, Hawkeye (Renner) and Black Widow (Johanssen). For the most part, all are properly costumed (unlike X-MEN) and fit their roles admirably. Hulk continues to stand out like a sore thumb as he remains strictly a CGI creation, but mercifully we see little of him until well into the second half. The actor playing the hunted, tortured Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) easily turns in the film's strongest performance.The two additions to the original roster, the Widow and Hawkeye,are without superpowers, but are just as effective when push comes to shove. Director Whedon of SERENITY fame paces the film extremely well, so that we're not overdosed with video game-like CGI until the big finale. There's plenty of character development for a two-hour comic book movie. There's also plenty of humor, and the punchlines come and go faster than Thor (Hemsworth) can twirl his hammer. The film also boasts a villain worthy of the gang: Thor's half-brother Loki (Hiddleston). That actor has by far the silliest lines to deliver, mainly to do with he conquest of Earth and the subjugation of the human race, yet manages to make them sound convincing enough. He also knows when to play it for laughs courtesy of Whedon's sharp direction. While Downey as Iron Man may be out-acted by Ruffalo, his character is the glue that binds, even though Capt. America (Evans) is the Avengers' leader. Without Downey's quirky Tony Stark, there would be no AVENGERS movie. Sam Jackson makes his third film appearance as Nick Fury, agent of SHIELD, although I'm not clear on why he was dressed for a MATRIX movie. AVENGERS is worth a look, even if you're not a comic book fan. You can always skip the big battle at the end, which is straight out of a video game. Funny thing: Whedon reveals the villain who will appear in the sequel, following the credits. This villain makes Loki look like a circus clown."

And then, for sentiment, they add a gratuitous scene (which is real sad) when a minor character dies to give context to it all. It was dashed together, crammed together, and bashed up all together. I am glad I went to see it but I was a bit bewildered and my butt hurt. I was overwhelmed and underwhelmed. I think that is really all I have to say but this site wants me to write much more and I think I have said enough. I don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing it especially if you are a fan, but this is really how me and my friends felt.

Yes there's stunts and action but lets be honest Scarlett Johansen looks like she's working out what to buy with her fee throughout the entire thing, the 3-D effects were awful bar the flying arrow at the end and Samuel L Jackson is there to merely spout expositionary dialogue more at home in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.

","First of all, I never give anything a 10 because that means perfection and giving the movie a 9 also leaves some kind of room for improvement for any potential future Avengers movies. With that in mind, I may even give this a 9.5.<br/><br/>After movies such as Spiderman being a disappointment and having the newest Batman series to compare to The Avengers, I wasn't sure what to expect. Also, taking into consideration that the latest Marvel movies such as the X-men Origin movies and individual Avengers (Ironman 1 and 2, Thor, Hulk) seeming to have fairly good ratings, or at least good movies to me, I was almost curious if this was going to be a disappointment after a streak of good movies. At the same time, I usually walk into movies with low expectations so if it is a let down, I'm not as let down as other people are. However, with this movie, I couldn't help but to have a higher expectation seeing previous Marvel movies.<br/><br/>So, being really excited for this movie, during and after the movie I was thrilled with it. It blew my mind and I seriously felt like a kid in awe and they did so well taking childhood characters and making it possible to be watched by any age.<br/><br/>For the tough critics, if you are not a fan of comic book superheros or just not a fan of any of the Marvel/DC movies, I would recommend this film if I was to try to change your mind. I know some who were let down by Thor and/or Captain America, and a couple people who were slightly disappointed by Iron-Man, then I believe The Avengers movie will fully redeem those disappointments for you.<br/><br/>If you also haven't seen any of the individual Avengers movies (Thor, Ironman 1 & 2, Captain America, Hulk), it's not an absolute much to watch, I do believe it sure does help though. So, if you're going to see any movie this year, this will be a great one to watch!"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","2","7","8 May 2012"," I didn't want it to end!
","The first of the two most highly anticipated superhero films of the summer is here, and it doesn't disappoint. The Avengers more than makes up for the last few disappointing summer movie seasons we've had. I don't think I've had this much fun at a movie since Pixar's Up. This two and a half hour movie never fails to excite.<br/><br/>The plot is standard superhero movie fare. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's evil step brother, breaks out of prison with the aid of a race of super evil aliens. Loki proceeds to steal a super weapon from the realm of Asgard (Thor's universe) and threatens the world. Nick Fury, in a routine performance by Samuel L. Jackson, must assemble a team of superheroes to combat Loki: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, replacing Ed Norton), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Loki unleashes his evil army on New York city and the Avengers must do what they always do- kick butt.<br/><br/>Marvel was truly clever to give these characters their own individual franchises before making an Avengers movie, and not just in a financial sense. Since we all know these characters already, the movie doesn't suffer from ""too many characters syndrome,"" unlike another Marvel franchise about a superhero team (Marvel fans know what I mean). Each character's story continues in The Avengers and it feels perfectly natural. <br/><br/>It is the chemistry of this cast that really makes this film work. Personalities clash until the gravity of the situation sits in and they start to cooperate. Predictably, by the end of the film they are all friends, but why complain? It's all in good fun.<br/><br/>Given that these are really second tier superheroes in the Marvel Comics gallery, (sorry Avengers fans, but Spider-Man and X-Men are higher up in the hierarchy), I am amazed that they were adapted to film so well. All of these Avengers movies pulled off their protagonists VERY well, but they have slightly weak antagonists, and this movie is no exception. Loki is a decent character and Hiddleston is a decent enough actor, but he just doesn't have the dramatic weight to match the power of the Avengers.<br/><br/>A review wouldn't be complete without some description of the action. As expected, it's fantastic from a technical standpoint, but it's extra fun because you care about the characters so much (maybe that's just me). I personally could have used more Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk moments- I felt he was really overshadowed by the other teammates. Ruffalo was at a disadvantage because he was taking over for Edward Norton. But the Incredible Hulk scenes are GREAT- easily my favorite action moments.<br/><br/>I must say this is probably my favorite Marvel superhero movie because it's just so fun. It doesn't need to get bogged down in character moments- it is just a shameless roller coaster ride. So go see the Avengers. It is the first action flick of what looks like to be a very promising summer for action movies. And be sure to stick around until the very end of the credits!"
"MovieFanatic88","9","2","7","8 May 2012"," Almost flawless
","First I would like to say that I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. I was not sure how they would successfully pull all the characters together but they certainly found a way. The graphics were top notch and the action scenes (which were every 5 minutes) were well put together. The movie accommodated the perfect mix of action, humor, and drama. My only complaint came at the end of the movie during the epic battle finale. While the heroes were awesome to watch in action, I expected to see some US air force involved. While the movie is not meant to be realistic, it just would have made more since to me if they incorporated a little more military involvement because I feel like a country with CPT America would still attempt to defend its greatest city from alien invaders with more than just a few national guard guys... (like ""Transformers"" did in their films). Overall that was just something that could have been added, the movie was outstanding and still made the top of my list for 2012, cant wait to see the next one."
"racinggreg2011","10","2","7","8 May 2012"," ""Avengers"" the greatest superhero movie EVER!
","This is the most bad ass movie i have ever seen. Each hero gets enough time to be developed and the you will be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. One of the things that helped this movie was all the main heroes were in their own movies so they could be given back story. This was a good idea cause doing back story for all of them in one movie would have been impossible. It has a bunch of memorable scenes that make you love the characters even more. The final fight scene is definitely the best part were they finally are together to make their stand against the enemy. It does have some minor flaws but this movie definitely makes up for all the flaws. Some people thought this movie would be bad because of too many heroes in the same movie, but if anything this proves you can make a movie with all these different heroes and be awesome. If they make a Justice League movie after this they need to get Joss Whedon to make it cause he definitely knew what he was doing and i believe he's the only one that knows how to make movies like this so awesome."

","What a great action packed movie of Marvel's finest. It took me some time to finally get a chance to watch it and it is just phenomenal. What can I say about this movie. The acting was good, the story was OK, the special effects were nonetheless impressive and the Heroes' costumes were great. I agree with a friend of mine on this and that is The Avengers is Marvel's own Expendables. The All- Star team that everyone roots for. I also liked the ever comedic lines of Tony Stark as portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., he is quite the character. There were some other comedic spots of the movie that kind of fit and I just couldn't stop laughing even the audience was laughing with me. However there were some disappointments for me. Number One, Hulk wasn't played by Ed Norton, instead we got Mark Ruffalo. In my opinion, he just felt out of place. I mean, Evans, Downey, and Hemsworth are top-notch A-Listers and then you got Ruffalo who just doesn't fit in with them and Number Two, I was expecting Red Skull over Loki. (That's just me.) Loki was a good formidable villain for the Avengers but I think Red Skull would have made the movie even more kick ass. Overall, this gets a 9 out of 10."
"johnschulz66","10","2","7","8 May 2012"," The Incredible Hulk 2: Hulk Smashes Again!
","I'm a comic book nerd. I grew up on Spiderman, X-Men, and anything and everything Stan Lee and Jack Kirby helped produce. I had seen every tie-in movie, in theaters, as soon as I had a chance. I remember watching Iron Man and everyone had told me to stay after the credits because there was a huge surprise waiting for me at the end. So began the most painful 4 years of my life.<br/><br/>In the 1960's, comic books were fun excursions into a world where magic, science, and wonder all coexisted. It was a world where it would be perfectly normal if a giant dragon, a man with the abilities of a spider, and a god straight out of Norse mythology all got into a fight to the death. I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me so I'm just going to go ahead and get to my point. The Avengers is the greatest superhero movie of all time.<br/><br/>""But what about The Dark Knight?"" you may ask. The Dark Knight was a fantastic film in it's own regard, but that sense of wonder and mystery was replaced by realism and fear. Which is OK because you don't go to a batman movie expecting him to fight against a large supernatural force. But for me, the wonder and fantasy is what really defines a superhero story, whether it's a comic or a movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Avengers were assembled perfectly. This is truly a benchmark in the movie industry; successfully combining the universes of four different movies into one; creating the grandest spectacle i have ever seen on screen. If you haven't yet, I recommend seeing all the tie-in movies before seeing The Avengers, if not for the sake that they are all great movies by themselves then for the fact that The Avengers will be a lot more enjoyable if you are already familiar with the characters.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job of taking each of these characters, already having such strong personalities, and making them interact with each other. For me, the beauty of this movie wasn't the action scenes, it was the interactions between the characters. Whedon really understands these heroes.<br/><br/>And speaking of action scenes, let's talk about how AWESOME the action scenes were. I was afraid that the trailer had already shown all the great moments in the film but, thankfully, I was wrong. I was really wrong. There is a plethora of fights in this movie, both between the heroes and the villains, and between the heroes themselves. And every hero gets their moments in the limelight. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, who I was worried might bog down the fights, were just as much of a part of the team as Thor and Iron Man were. But, let's be honest here, this is the Hulk's movie. Hulk had disappointed me in most of his previous movie outings, but not this time. Joss Whedon finally got the character right. You can see the fear behind Banner's eyes, the sense of hopelessness in his voice. He really is cursed, but must learn to use his curse for the greater good. And when he finally does change into the Hulk, Hulk smashes. Hulk smashes a lot.<br/><br/>The Avengers can't be passed over as a marketing scheme. It deserves every cent that it reeled in from it's opening weekend. This isn't just a great superhero movie, it's one of the greatest movies I have had the pleasure of seeing."
"doopey12","9","2","7","8 May 2012"," Great collection of superheroes
","I had my skepticism when going to this movie. Would it be incredibly corny? Who it live up to all the hype? Who we just wish it was Iron Man 3? But I was shocked at the masterful film Joss Whedon put together. He had a great balance of all the stars and big personalities. He left me wanting more from the relationship of black widow and hawkeye.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying this is a perfect film but it definitely surpasses the previous attempts of team of superheroes, i.e. X-men and the Fantastic Four. Some characters left me wanting more... yes I'm talking about you Mark Ruffalo. I felt like I was watching another one of his lame romantic comedies every time he was on the screen. Don't get me started on the Mark Ruffalo's stuff face on the hulk. Give me the big green monster from the Incredible Hulk and I would be closer to a 10 than a 9 for this movie.<br/><br/>All things considered, this movie went by in a flash with all the brilliant action sequences and the great script writing. I can't wait for the next avengers film. It should be incredible if Joss Whedon is involved. Marvel/Disney don't let that man go because you have no chance unless you can get Chris Nolan to do Spiderman for you because we all know that is going to be a let down."
"cattjones","10","2","7","7 May 2012"," 3D Extravaganza
","It has been a long time that I had to wait in line to buy a ticket and then wait in line again to get a good seat. The Avengers was well worth the wait. Director Joss Whedon definitely got it right with this film. Although the film was nearly two and a half hours long it did not feel like it because the momentum of the story flowed so well. As you can tell by the trailer, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to take over the earth and is met by a cast of superheroes assembled by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). All of the main characters were true to form. Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was exactly like you would expect him to be; arrogant, smart and playful. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) follows his so called brother Loki to earth and the tension between them has not changed from the last time that these two hit the big screen. The Hulk / Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) somehow manages to somewhat tame his beast and join the party. Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has the daunting task of trying to catch up with time while forming a relationship with his new found comrades. I found him to be the most endearing of the heroes because he had so much catching up to do since he was thawed out. The two heroes that did not have their own introduction prior to this film were Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), although I think that a prequel could possibly work because I think that there is definitely some history there. I have to say that I was not expecting this film to have the level of comedy that it did. I think that the whole audience was caught a little off guard (myself included). Everything about this film was excellent; the acting, the special effects, the character development, the script¬Ö¬Ö I could go on and on. I am almost certain that this is not the last time that we see The Avengers. I smell the beginning of many more sequels in the future and I will once again stand in that long line to go and see them. This is not the time to be frugal. Dig in your pockets and go and see this film at the IMAX in 3D. I am giving this film a glaring green light."
"a-little-squeek","7","2","7","6 May 2012"," Action Fans Rejoice.....
","Yeah...it is an action packed flick from beginning to end. The interweaving of all the Marvel characters was done in a coherent way and I truly feel as though I got my money's worth out of it. Samuel L. Jackson is an amazing actor and if you think about all the roles he's executed so well, it boggles the mind. This is not to diminish the performances of all the other names who appear in this film. Robert Downey, by far, has the best lines and his delivery is always spot on. The CGI effects are great, flawless and awesome. Plot, screenplay and performances...grade B. I was a big fan of Marvel as a kid and the whole package stays true to the printed genre. Mark Ruffalo was a good pick for the latest Hulk incarnation. Gweneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson turn in fine performances and look hhhhotttt!............ <br/><br/>I know that it's just a movie, one must suspend reality and have buy-in, and I don't want to be hypercritical but.....1) I would expect that Hulk & Thor would be uninjured in their battles and even Ironman has his suit to protect him...but the other three characters, after all, are really just HUMAN, right? Though enhanced human in some way, shape or form, they just aren't in the same class of ""super"" hero as the previously mentioned three. In fact, they aren't ""super"" at all. I would think that each of them, in succession, would have been squashed by something thrown at them by one of the warriors from another planet. 2) The ""suiting-up"" process for Ironman is starting to become a little silly and I didn't like the shape change of the power plant in the middle of his chest from a circle to a triangle. 3) The Hulk goes from a mindless...well...HULK, to a character who then helps ""the team""...pick pick pick......<br/><br/>After you see it I'm sure you'll agree that this movie is definitely NOT an 8.8 as movies go...but the ratings system at this venue has ALWAYS been flawed. If you don't read too much into it, it's pretty solid entertainment especially if you're an action fan, Marvel fan, or a fan of any of the actors involved and worth seeing on the big screen ....especially because the sound systems seem to have been upgraded in recent times...........but I wouldn't pay more than matin√©e price.<br/><br/>P.S.....there is an additional ""snippet"" of movie inserted into the credit roll so don't exit too quickly......<br/><br/>The only thing that really ticked me off was the $7. price tag for a MEDIUM popcorn !?....get real, people........... . <br/><br/>I rate it 7"
"loganmarada","7","2","7","6 May 2012"," The Avengers achieves its goal, but could it have been better?
","Walking into The Avengers I was expecting a total ""popcorn"" film with great visuals, explosions, and awesome fighting. I got that, but I also got a pretty good story, great comical dialogue, and a great mix of badass-ery and fun. I think their aim with this film was to have the awesome explosions, as well as the funny script make this movie enjoyable for the whole family. With this aim, I think they pulled it off flawlessly, the fighting sequences had you ready to stand up and applaud, and the lines were legitimately funny, and there wasn't a corny superhero line throughout the whole thing! Thank the lord. Now, to answer my question above, could it have been better? My answer is yes. I think the movie was a bit too predictable in ways, like how in every moment of trouble somebody comes out of nowhere and saves the day. I mean of course they can't have anything too extreme, but it was a bit campy in the sense of how Iron Man would fly out of nowhere and swoop somebody up seconds before the get destroyed. Also, the biggest problem I had was with Loki. Loki was a decent choice for the villain, but The Avengers had absolutely no trouble with him. Not at all. I mean, he is a GOD and they beat the crap out of him each moment before he got done talking. I almost felt like there really wasn't any struggle in this film, other than the city getting demolished, but in the end I was excited and had a great time watching it. I give The Avengers a 7 out of 10."
"ferguson-6","8","2","7","5 May 2012"," Assemble
","Greetings again from the darkness. The concern coming in was that this would be like an All-Star game, which as any sports fan will tell you, is typically a massive letdown. Assembling so many super heroes and colorful characters into one movie: Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and Loki ... would probably lead to either mass confusion, a 4 hour movie, or short straws for a couple of characters. Somehow director Joss Whedon has avoided the pitfalls and delivered a huge action film that is loads of fun for everyone, including the fanboys.<br/><br/>Whedon does a remarkable job of giving each character their fair share of screen time, and somehow manages to make the interaction between the characters the best part of the movie. There is some terrific dialogue and the number of quick-witted exchanges are too numerous to recount. While this would be expected from Robert Downey, Jr's Iron Man, I must admit to being pleasantly surprised at Chris Hemsworth's Thor and especially Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner/Hulk. The movie contains quite a few laugh outloud moments, which is pretty impressive in a filled theatre.<br/><br/>If you are going to combine six super heroes in a movie, you need a bad guy. A villain. Actually, a super villain. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is up to the task. For me, he was a weak link in Thor, but here is a full-fledged, powerful evil mastermind looking to gain power by stealing the Tesseract (Cosmic Cube), commanding an alien army, and ruling earth. Hiddleston is clearly having fun and it shows. For the movie to work at all, his plan and power must stand up to the impressive line up of good guys he is fighting. That is certainly the case.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has come a long way from her brief work in Iron Man2, and we really get to know more about Natasha the Russian spy ... although her accent fades in and out. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye seems a bit out of place, but Renner is so cool, we don't really care. Chris Evans as Captain America does a wonderful job of taking control of the band of misfits and displays the leadership expected of a super-soldier. We even get a good dose of Agent Coulson (Phil to his friends) and Clark Gregg's deadpan deliver is a great addition. Samuel L Jackson (as Nick Fury) will be adding hundreds of millions more to his current record of being the highest-grossing actor of all-time.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. Since last we saw her, she has evidently been shopping for short shorts and helping design the new Stark Tower. Natalie Portman makes a creative cameo, reprising her awful role in Thor. Stellan Skarsgard is back as a believable scientist. Powers Boothe appears as a member of the Council that Fury reports to. The great Harry Dean Stanton has a comical scene as a security guard who stumbles onto Hulk's mess. And of course, Stan Lee makes his well-deserved cameo appearance - a tradition in the Marvel movies.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for this must go to Joss Whedon. He may finally be out of his Buffy the Vampire Slayer shadow, as this movie is quite an accomplishment. Entertaining and funny for the masses, yet detailed enough for the comic book fan boys. I was thinking how much fun this would be for a 10-12 year old, and how my mind might have exploded if something like this existed in my childhood. Even comparing this to the Christoper Reeve Superman movies will help you realize just how far super heroes movies have come."

","Enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role.<br/><br/>Whedon nailed nearly every single scene. He made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated. This movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots. I have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if I wanted to describe my feelings. And after seeing the trailer and the pictures, I already had high expectations.<br/><br/>The charisma of Captain America, the wild brutality of the Hulk, the majesty of Thor, it was all there.

","I was fortunate enough to watch a special presentation of the The Avengers earlier this week. Due to the sheer awesomeness of the movie I felt it was appropriate to spread the good word. I'll try not to ruin too much for you though interested parties know the basic plot by now.<br/><br/>A group of super-people; Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor/...Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Incredible Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) are brought together by a top secret task force known as S.H.I.E.L.D. to form a super team known as The Avengers. S.H.I.E.L.D., headed by superspy Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and a huge, expensive looking, airborne armada, face a serious threat in the form of super-villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Can The Avengers' divergent personalities come together to face such a large external threat? If they do, will the audience care? The answer is of course yes, and yes. The Avengers is less of a movie than it is a dazzling visual experience. My bet is those who lived in the time of 5 cent Captain America comics would have their minds blown by the sheer size and grandior of this flick. Its big, its bold and it delivers. But enough with general platitudes. What specifically makes The Avengers such great summer fare? Well for one it takes four characters who have dawned their own movie franchises and brings them together for the first time. Since we all know their origins, their powers and their basic personalities, this spin-off is in a unique position to expand the world in which these superheroes exist. This world of course has a lot of explosions and movie monsters, but it also has a fair amount of heart and humor too.<br/><br/>All due credit must be given to its smart script provided by Joss Whedon and Zak Penn who seemed to have had just as much fun writing the movie as I did watching it. Every scene has a purpose and nearly every joke hits its mark. That not to say the movie is all fun and games. The movie wisely shines a light on the back story of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), two characters who have been largely in the shadows in the past. This allows, especially Black Widow's character arc to become the convincing emotional core of the film. There is one confrontation between Black Widow and Loki that provided no whizz-bang vulgarities but nonetheless was an uncommonly dark and emotionally charged moment. One I wouldn't expect from such an unabashedly popcorny flick.<br/><br/>The character of Loki has improved greatly from the last time we saw him in Thor (2011). I found him a bit too unassuming and snively to really be threatening in 2011. This year however Tom Hiddleston has wisely cranked the diva dial up to 11 and lets loose. Its hard not to soak up all his bravura. Or Samuel L. Jackson's for that matter. He's supposed to be Nick Fury and god love him for trying but he'll always be Samuel L. and that's not all together a bad thing.<br/><br/>There are however some slight faults to this otherwise solid film. I know its unfair since The Avengers is a sequel of sorts but there seemed to be too little development or back story about our main heroes. I don't want to say that those who haven't seen the other Marvel movies will be completely lost but I doubt they'll have the same emotional investment in the characters coming in from the cold. A few lines of exposition without them sharing witty banter would have been enough; I'm not greedy. Also, and this is just my personal bias, Mark Ruffalo did his best but I was not convinced he was Bruce Banner. His lax, California, too-cool-for-school delivery just didn't mesh well with the sci-fi jargon he and Tony Stark were spewing.<br/><br/>Regardless of a few shortcomings, The Avengers is a profoundly entertaining movie with great action, great acting and a fun script. It sets the new gold standard comic-book superhero films have to reach in the years to come. Watch it, then watch it again.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

","There are four films this year I am banking on being at the top of my list and Avengers Assemble was the lesser. My god 2012 going to be a good year for movies!<br/><br/>Marvel Studios colossal gamble in combining four of their major comic brands into one film was subject to feeling clustered and failing, yet having gotten each hero's back story and characteristics out of the way in previous films, Avengers can go all out. No brakes. ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) is teamed up with Doctor Bruce Banner (The Incredible Hulk) Steve Rogers (the super soldier Captain America) and Thor, the god of thunder, to protect the world from a hostile invasion led by Thor's brother Loki. They have to learn to put their personal demons aside and work together if they are to succeed!<br/><br/>Avengers Assemble is another landmark in cinema after Harry Potter; keeping firm continuity on a franchise makes it stronger. The actors already know their characters, the film's first act dips wonderfully into ""character moments"", one minute it is a new Iron Man film, then it is Thor's movie, Avengers simply revels in their clashing personalities, a geeky ""what if Thor, Tony Stark and Captain America were in a room together?"". I cannot stress the credit due to Joss Whedon, co-writer and director, he brought is A-game here; the wit and stinging dialogue is here in abundance. The cinema I was in was roaring with laughter at all the right points. There are several short signature fights, giving each hero and villain a chance to fight another, though this does not feel forced. Instead each battle feels unique, memorable and is certainly eye catching.<br/><br/>The film's heart and soul is with the superheroes, and while their personal demons are less defined here (for obvious reasons, there are six of them!) the battles they wage show them struggling, Marvel's ethos of ""human superheroes"" is not completely lost here. By the end, the heroes are quite worse for wear. Loki is the signature villain, and one should watch Thor (and Captain America) to fully appreciate what's at stake. The villains are pushed aside overall, but only for the excellent team-building theme the film is about anyway.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing, for the great dialogue alone, never mind the frantic and characterful battle sequences on top of it!"

","Its not been exactly one hour when I came out watching this incredible movie.I was ever excited to watch the movie and with the same excitement I'm writing of this review for it.<br/><br/>Simply,the movie is AWESOME.<br/><br/>Special effects out of the world,a justified role distribution and superb script writing.And if you think all this a little less to mark a movie as a blockbuster then watch out the star cast.ROBERT DOWNEY JR. can be said as the only super hero who wins fight before starting it, with his verbal missiles attack.No matter who he is standing before Loki,Thor,Captain America or the green monster Hulk....each time he has shown that he is the best actor among all of them.Although all of the others played their respective superb action pack roles very good.<br/><br/>Story is been good right from the beginning and the movie goes higher and higher in action as well as in story.<br/><br/>Every Super hero will give you a chance to scream and shout ""wooooo"" with applauding your hands. Generally,the main platform of a 3D movie is Action and Avengers justifies on this word. You gonna love when the hulk gives a knock out punch to an alien monster and of course Loki got a hell out of a beating from Hulk of his lifetime.In India we call this move ""dhobhi pachad"". Captain America,Thor,black widow,Hawk eye,Loki and Fury acted best at all times. I'm lucky as an Indian to watch this movie a week before it's worldwide release as it released a week before in India.<br/><br/>GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE.....BOOM BOOM BOOM INCREDIBLE AVENGERS"

"SeussMeTub","9","2","7","28 April 2012"," One of The Best Comic Book Movies Ever!
","A culmination of several movie franchises, THE AVENGERS certainly delivers. There could have been many ways that the studios could have screwed this movie up but they chose the right director: Joss Whedon (former helmer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly on TV as well as an actual comic book writer for Marvel Comics). Whedon knows his stuff and he creates what is probably the most compatible comic book movie ever; the whole film reads as if it was an actual Marvel comic book!<br/><br/>Whedon subtly melds the disparate elements from multiple other comic book movies and effortlessly creates an epic storyline that makes sense. The tesseract (known to comic fans as the cosmic cube) that was the focal plot point of CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) has been recovered and being studied closely by the government when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the villain of the previous THOR (2011) movie appears and takes control of it. In response, Col. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson, in his usual badass self) decides to form a small but lethal response team: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Thor. If they can get along and work together then they might have a chance to save the world.<br/><br/>Being the top billed character because of box-office receipts, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets the best lines and almost steals the entire show. His wisecracks upends the traditional leader of the Avengers, Captain America (Chris Evans, playing the straight man to everyone else) and puts the latter character in a disadvantage- the movie's lone weakness is that Cap doesn't get to do much other than act as a foil to the larger than life Tony Stark. Thor (Chris Helmsworth) does shine in the few scenes in which he is at front and center while both Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) give much needed humanity since they are the only members of the team that don't have superpowers. But the one character that makes the most impact of his limited screen time is Mark Ruffalo, who plays the volatile Hulk- Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner as a smoldering Stanley Kowalski, always seemingly in control yet has a temper like nitroglycerine- his Banner is different from the brooding Eric Bana of 2003's HULK or the timid Edward Norton of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008); you don't get to see much of Ruffalo compared to the others but his character is the most intriguing of all. Hiddleston is adequate as the pouty, scheming Loki but you can't help but believe that he is simply outgunned with all these powerhouses surrounding him.<br/><br/>The movie is almost perfect but does fail to take chances with their characters. Evan's Captain America is a direct copy from the mainstream comic book but you wished he might have been given more of an edge, like the Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Captain America: a slightly racist do-gooder who prefers to smash heads when someone doesn't measure up to his 1930's morality. If only the movie had been longer there might have been more insight into his character but with this film running over 2 ¬Ω hours it might have been a systematic one.<br/><br/>In the end though, there is something for everyone in this movie, from the constant action scenes to the quiet ones that add humanity to what would otherwise be cardboard clich√©s. Highly recommended!"

","From what i have seen this will be the greatest superhero movie of all time. But i have a question that needs answering from anyone who has seen the film already: does this film have an f word or a g-dd-mn in it? I have been waiting for this film since Iron Man in 2008. I hate that kind of cursing and i want to see this really bad. The characters are deep and well acted, the dialog is smart and clever, the action is incredible and i don't want to not get to see it should it have those words in it. Captain Anerica was my favorite of the Marvel movies so far. And so far, Marvel has managed to keep their movies clean( relatively). The incredible hulk had a GD in it and thats what worries me about this film. I want my family to be able to experience this film and we cant should there be such words."

","All I could think of as the end credits rolled was, MORE PLEASE!!! I would gladly have turned around and watched it again!<br/><br/>The Avengers is not a deep thinking film. You will not leave the theater enlighted or confused. It won't cause you to re-think your world or your ideals, it won't be a debate provoking film amongst your other intellectual friends... but it WILL leave you thoroughly entertained!!! <br/><br/>Those who are not of the genre will call it ""mindless banter"" and scoff at it. Those who are OK with being transported temporarily to a place where they can forget everything for 2 1/2 hours and just enjoy it, they will love it!<br/><br/>The previous movies have given substance, background and depth to the characters (most of them). They feel familiar and ""make sense"". The story line is simple and predictable, Evil returns, wants to enslave Earth, team of superheroes assembles and drive evil away... or do they? (stay through the ending credits, trust me).<br/><br/>It's not the ""super story"" that keeps you glued to your chair. It is everything else. Somehow you are not the slightest bit annoyed (or care for) the predictability of the story. I don't think a better director could have been chosen for this film. Joss Wheddon has just the right amount of childhood wonder still in him to re-create something magical ... it was like.. watching the coming book come to life!! <br/><br/>Please tell me there is a sequel!!!"
"badmanrali","10","2","7","28 April 2012"," Greatest Superhero movie ever made. Simple as.
","Quite truly, this is a film that makes your mouth water while watching it. The man and the character that steals the film is Hulk played Mark Ruffalo. He adds this unique stint to the character commonly known to be scary ruthless monster. He actually has the best comedy 'bits' in the whole film. We all thought Iron man/Tony Stark would provide the humour in the film, he does, but I feel he was casted down to be more of a super hero. You will understand what I mean when you watch it. This brings me to the point, would the Iron Man and Avengers movie franchise be any good without Robert Dwoney Jr. He is truly an incredible actor, that is so suited to the character of Tony Stark. I don't wanna say anymore, and I am so damn tempted to give away a couple of spoilers, but I have to resist to let you enjoy this fabulous movie. GO WATCH IT."
"manishregmi20-356-983205","8","2","7","28 April 2012"," Avengers good but not as much as the hype
","I just watched Avengers, 2 hours ago, and I personally don't think Avengers lives up to the hype it has got. Is it a good movie? That's a definite yes from my side, anyone who's into action movies and who knows these characters would enjoy the movie. But for people who don't really know much about these characters would get a little bored and might find it hard to follow, as it happened with my friends. 10 of us went for the movie, 3 people though it was hard to follow. Also one should know they are going for an action movie, action sequences are awesome, dialogues are OK not exceptional but OK. They have tried to make the movie funny, but there are only like 3 laughs out loud moments, with 2 other that makes you smile. Interestingly enough Hulk was in 3 out of 5 of those moments. Iron Man is funny, but now wow funny. Thor looked very ordinary in the movie, his acting was OK not wow. Captain America looks a little misplaced among the super powered people, and sadly Black Widow has a lot more say in the movie than does Captain America. Hawkeye got his moment to shine but isn't as focused as one who expect. Hulk and Loki, their acting stood out. Of course, Loki being the main villain gets the most to do and Hulk was the funniest among them all, after he transforms. MINOR SPOILERS, it's nice to see hulk finally learn how to control his transformation although how he learns it is never shown. There are few plot holes in the movie, we don't really understand how Hulk from being a raging uncontrollable monster because a hero all of a sudden and decides to fight for the avengers. Nick Fury doesn't get to do much apart from blow up a helicopter, Captain America has some fights scenes before Loki brings his army but later Captain America didn't really play a big part in the movie at all. Aliens were below par, they didn't even spend time with the aliens, and they looked more like mindless beasts following command from their master, who is shown post credit and will not be named for the purpose of this review. There are no twists and turns in the movie, the story could easily have been summarized in few lines as Loki - World Domination - Army - Avengers Assembles - gets his arse handed to him. Action scenes were AWESOME and it's a very action heavy movie. I hope I have not spoiled anything for you because I don't really wanna get into details of how the movie actually plays. What I truly believe is you will not be bored watching the movie, but it's not something as amazing as say The Dark Knight."
"ktelliman","9","2","7","28 April 2012"," Avengers: Marvel's on top, so far.
","Marvel's Avengers...<br/><br/>A well paced movie that delivers from the beginning. It's hard to review this awesome movie without give some spoilers, but I'll try to do my best, promise.<br/><br/>I tried to keep my expectations low about this movie before it came out, because watching this all- star cast playing the ""superheroes"" is exciting itself. you have to add Samuel L Jackson as ""Nick Fury"" and a very good CGI work pumped up by a big amount of money. But I have seen a lot of movies with great casts and high budgets going down (cough *batman and robin* cough), so I decided to stay calm and not to get hyped.<br/><br/>So the movie started with a very decent action scene that sets up the whole plot fast and effectively. Even when I tried to forget what this was about, I couldn't help myself and I was sold after the ten first minutes. Why? <br/><br/>Because you can't help it!! you get to go in deep with every main character's motivations. The action never stops growing and the tension last until the very last minute. It's impossible not to fall in love with movies like this! Every relationship between the superheroes are well established and when the moment comes, it shows.<br/><br/>What are they avenging?: Spoiler! It's Hulk well done in this movie? Hell Yeah!! (finally) It's Tony Stark above the rest of Avengers?: Nope, he's part of an awesome team!<br/><br/>Is this movie worth to see on cinemas? oh, please, oh, please, don't miss it. Watch it at least once. <br/><br/>9/10 At the same level of ""the dark Knight""<br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/><ul><li>Didn't like the 3D. - Black Widow should have kept her long hair. </li></ul><br/><br/>For the rest, no complains."
"ruvikowski","9","2","7","28 April 2012"," Assembled awesomeness
","Since the dawn of men, we aspired to be heroes. We told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles, stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress. Since the 20s of the last century, some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels. Two of the people who did this were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at Marvel Comics. The created among others the rich genius in a flying suit called Iron Man, the super soldier called Captain America, a new version of thunder god Thor, two spies under the names Black Widow and Hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big, green, angry monster which calls itself Hulk. Comics like this were made into movies, but nearly all of them had some flaws. They weren't like the comics, took themselves to serious, made to much jokes or had some other flaws. Now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous heroes of Marvel (see above) and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made. The story itself is about heroes with flaws, who need to grow together as a team so they can save the world from a mighty attack from other world. If you like stories of heroes and strange folks you should go see this movie. It's not perfect, but very close being perfect."
"ani-for-prez","9","2","7","28 April 2012"," The best Superhero movie i have seen
","This was one hell of a mind-blowing, fantastic ensemble. I entered the theatre with some trepidation. Don't get me wrong, I love Joss Whedon. His Firefly, Dollhouse really impressed me with their thoughtful insights to complex subjects and excellent stories with witty dialogs. But this being a superhero movie with characters so diverse, I suspected this may just be a mash-up of said characters with some good battles with Whedon's trademark one-liners. Boy was I stumped.<br/><br/>This movie never failed to keep my mouth open with shock and sheer awe at what I was watching. Also laughter. This was a movie I will not forget. Or be satisfied with watching only once.<br/><br/>Witty dialogs punctuate every minute every one of which are neither clich√©d, overdone or badly timed. But humour is only part of its brilliance as story too is pretty good with some amazing, some awesome, some sad and some thoughtful moments. The movie is very well paced, so much so that I barely realised the 140 minutes passing by.<br/><br/>The casting was perfect, with all the characters coming over from their respective movies. Except Bruce Banner who was now played by Mark Ruffalo taking over from Ed Norton. In the Hulk movies, Bruce was a scientist struggling with his inner demons threatening to release his darker (greener) alter ego. But here, he needed to be confident, funny, witty, smart (which was seriously downplayed in the 2 Hulks) to have any chance against such powerful characters. Mark Ruffalo carries his character with remarkable panache and delivers a memorable character.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were amazing. Robert Downey Jr as Tony, the self- loving, arrogant and over-smart playboy, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the regal guardian come to stop his brother in his tracks, Chris Evans as the out-of-place hero who tries to fit in, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow who has a substantial role to play (not just eye-candy though she delivers plenty of that too), Jeremy Renner as the stoic and unshakable Hawk-eye and of course, Samuel Jackson as the enigmatic commander, Nick Fury. Tom Hiddleston, on the villainous side is amazing as the nihilistic, ego-maniacal Loki who is now stylish, confident and devious in contrast to his Thor persona where he is more childish in his harried quest for revenge. Every character is given a major role with no-one sidelined or underused. All these characters from different eras, locations and occupations are blended beautifully though not without conflicts which are highlighted as a major plot point. This was a much better idea than merely bringing them to save Earth and explaining away these differences which any other director would have easily done.<br/><br/>This brings me to Joss Whedon. With Spielberg giving us mediocrities like Tintin, Indiana Jones and War of the Worlds, this comes as a respite from old and boring directors who have been ruling big-budget screen-space for far too long. With X-Men: First Class bringing forth Matthew Vaughn, this too will bring Whedon to the limelight and hopefully, spur producers to give this underrated talent more opportunities.<br/><br/>This has been my movie of the year(so far) and the best Superhero movie I have EVER seen. Batman does not count to me as a ""superhero"" movie which is why this wins the title."

","The Avengers is the best summer blockbuster for a long time, it balances all elements of fun, drama, action, special effects, multiple egos into a well directed, paced movie. The film has perfectly edited action set pieces, no fast editing like say transformers and it benefits hugely. The first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up, but after that the last hour especially is amazing. Credit has to go to the director, you really can tell he has a love for the source material and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film. The drama is not as dark as say the dark knight. As people have been saying it is a very funny film with some laugh out moments. The Avengers is simply amazing, Hollywood is in for a bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come, The Dark Knight Rises, Spider-Man, Skyfall, The Hobbit. The Avengers has started the summer blockbuster season with a bang and may end up being the best of them all in 2012. I highly recommend the Avengers."

"morrison-dylan-fan","5","3","13","14 May 2012"," Joining Up The Pieces.
","Being left feeling slightly underwhelmed by the sudden ending of Iron Man 2,my expectations for this dream team match up were greatly increased by Kenneth Branagh's Thor,which brilliantly mixed a mythology- building epic plot with explosive action scenes and pitch perfect performances.Checking to see who had been chosen to take on this mega project,I was thrilled to discover that the man behind the stunning TV shows Buffy,Angel and the tragically short-lived Firefly had been given the chance to take on this huge ""event"" film.With my excitement building up over the involvement of Joss Whedon,I decided to take a look at the assembling of The Avengers.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Thrown out by his returning brother Thor from the kingdom which he had craved to rule,Loki starts licking his wounds by negotiating a deal with a deadly warrior army called the Chitauri,who he eventually gets to accept, his plan of stealing a powerful,new energy source which is secretly being tested by a classified US government agency called S.H.I.E.L.D.Catching S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury completely by surprise,Loki and the Chitauri's quickly grab the new energy source,and run off as fast as possible,due to having a plan of using the new energy as a ""link"" for the Chitauri's planet to fully connect up with Earth.Realiseing that the planet Earth is in dire straits,Nick Fury decides to take drastic action,and begin the formation of a ""special projects"" group called The Avengers¬Ö<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>During the movies opening 15-20 minutes writers Joss Whedon (who also directed the film) and Zac Penn initially make the film look as if it will be going in a similar direction to Penn's (co-written) wonderful 2003 film X2,as each of The Avengers are given their own mini introductions that allows a good amount of expectation and excitement, to build for the moment when all of the separate plot threads will join up.<br/><br/>Disapointingly,Whedon and Penn interrupt what should have been a gradual build up to the moment when a number of iconic characters share the screen for the very first time,by weirdly making almost all of the non-action scenes in the film feel very anti-climatic.Shortly after the introductions,Whedon places all of his characters in one confined location for 40-50 minutes of the movie.Whilst the isolated location initially hints at an opportunity for the gang to be given a little bit more depth,Whedon and Penn sadly kill the excitement dead in its tracks,thanks to the setting doing the near impossible of making a bunch of superheros look unbelievably dull.Although the screenplay sadly drains most of the excitement from the film,<br/><br/>the terrific cast impressively give the movie a ""livly"" feel which happily stays prominent for the last half an hour of the movie.Reuniting after their fantastic performances in David Fincher's stunning 2007 film Zodiac,Robert Downey JR and Mark Ruffalo each give great performances that make them the clear stand outs of the movie.Wearing a sneaky Black Sabbath t-shirt,Downey gives Tony Stark/Iron Man a wickedly sharp tongue,which smoothly unleashes the best dialogue of the film.Showing a strong Woody Allen-ness to his performance,Ruffalo makes every scene featuring Bruce Banner/The Hulk a joy to watch,thanks to making Banner someone that is surprisingly a ""normal"" guy,who along with being able to step up when needed (in purple underwear!),is also someone who would prefer to be left on their own,and would probably blush with shyness as soon as a girl started to take a liking to him."
"krorp","6","3","13","4 May 2012"," Another above average superhero team-up movie
","Just saw this movie yesterday at a local cinema, and I was only mildly entertained after seeing it.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was quite disappointed not to see Edward Norton reprising his role as Dr. Bruce Banner in this movie but after watching Mark Ruffalo's satisfying performance as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and reserved physicist, I was pleased with the end result of Hulk's casting.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that it achieved its purpose as a fun-filled, action- packed, witty superhero-themed movie. Kudos to director and writer Joss Whedon for a well-balanced character development among all the heroes, giving each of them their deserved screen time.<br/><br/>On the downside, the jokes and witty banters among the superheroes didn't bode well with me personally because I felt that it was mostly out of place and tiring to see Tony Stark with his usual ""I-am-Iron-Man- and-I-can-say-something-smart-and-you-will-laugh"" routine. The movie also failed to properly address the consequences of such a huge number of superheroes, destroying many buildings and lives of ordinary civilians, in their quest for battling evil like it's DC rival's ""The Dark Knight"" (a benchmark I've set for all superhero movies) did back in 2008. <br/><br/>Not to mention the first 30 minutes of the movie was quite a drag and not enough to maintain the attention of an average movie-goer. Also, the inclusion of a weak villain like Loki and a new race of Chitauri aliens unsuccessfully made the plot more interesting as it is evident that even Thor or Hulk could easily defeat Loki in a match.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie was quite forgettable with its main role as a summer movie blockbuster typecast."

","First off, you have to be naive way beyond Pollyanna to think that the orgasmically, hyperbolically glowing reviews were NOT churned out by a PR machine.<br/><br/>It's getting easier to decide what makes a flick great or not. I was just rewatching Nights of Cabiria, and it's a great case for how a rock solid story and labor-of-love direction more than compensates for flaws in other areas.<br/><br/>The problem with Avengers is that it's a hollow concept/myth ginned up with some admittedly clever writing and CGI. The difference is that, to me, the writing and production don't compensate for a lousy core plot line.<br/><br/>The classic deus ex machina resolves inextricable gotchas in plot development: In Avengers, the deus ex machina is the villain, introduced at the beginning to set the plot in motion and give the writers a reason to get up in the morning. Loki touches people with a weird stick and they magically become his partisans; how lame could a plot point possibly be? I will again mention that, once forces contrive to bring our good guys into some kind of alliance, the writing is remarkably good; even enjoyable.<br/><br/>But I have to mention a few more of my personal bugaboos.<br/><br/>First off, being a sort of closet Discordian, my ears prick up when a ""troublemaker god"" is maligned. Loki as an evil nemesis strikes me a bit incongruous. I like troublemaker gods! They keep us on our toes, and keep us from devolving into protoplasmic sludge. I don't like seeing the glorious tradition of troublemaker gods as agents of change being blasphemed like this.<br/><br/>Next, look at Loki's statement of intent: He wants to take away our freedom, thereby making us free.** Why do I feel like I'm watching Dr. Evil ask for ""ONE MILLION DOLLARS!"" all over again? Don't the writers know that human beings have been giving up their freedom to become free as long as there has been civilization? Are you in a relationship in which you've abdicated your principles for the short term gain of freedom from abject loneliness? Are you locked into an economic system that takes away more and more of your freedom? Haven't you already internalized the view that this kind of enslavement is freedom? Don't you pay taxes so that bombs can be dropped on benighted wedding parties full of men, women, and children who haven't yet bought into this precise species of freedom? The ""Loki"" of this flick is laughably and lamely late to the game! You can see it's difficult to get behind the ensuing Sturm und Drang when there's nothing truly relateable at stake, on the table, in play.<br/><br/>** BTW, revealing this info isn't a ""spoiler"": It's the beginning point of the plot, not a revelatory middle or endpoint."

If you're expecting a great story you would do best to rethink your choice of movie. <br/><br/>There is way to many heroes, the story becomes a messy tangle of too many stories and the only one making me laugh is Stark (Iron man). Also they all seem to have the same strength all of a sudden. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those guys getting annoyed by the impossibility behind superpowers, but this is absurd. <br/><br/>All and all this movie is an orgy in special effects and superpowers and nothing more."
"Wisesoldierthe6","10","2","8","15 August 2019"," is the MCU really that great?
","First I rated this movie a 10 back in 2017 as during that time I was still brainwashed under the MCU. I thought they were prefect. I'll keep Avengers 1 as 10/10 instead of giving it a 6/10.<br/><br/>Back in 2012 I was MCU hyped and practically worshiped the MCU and praised movies like Avengers 1. At the time in 2012 Avengers 1 I felt was the greatest thing ever.<br/><br/>Now in 2019 after my views on Avengers 1 and the MCU has changed completely. MCU is not that great and Avengers 1 even for a first take was pretty generic where it still has unanswered plot holes.<br/><br/>Avengers 1 is good. But its overrated to a point only little kids, brainwashed fans (like I was) and fanboys would be ignorant to the flaws and worship a movie like Avengers 1 and other MCU films.<br/><br/>MCU and the Avengers 1 ruins its self with lack of character/story development, under used villains, weak heroes and pointless jokes.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Watch this movie for fun while drinking a beer or some food with a lot of sugar otherwise you may get brainwashed like I was. In addition, if your will power is weak don't watch this movie or any MCU movie."
"eric-andre-lowrance","3","2","8","11 March 2015"," What the hell was that?
","If you're going to rate Marvel's The Avengers by how much CGI was fit into its mere 143 minutes, than give it the highest rating you can. Otherwise, this movie was nothing more than a huge headache.<br/><br/>Also, I am a HUGE comic book reader and fan of the original comic books, but I wasn't breathtaken at all. Whatsoever. <br/><br/>This movie was just a bore, let me tell you why.<br/><br/>If your protagonists cannot be harmed, then where's the thrill? Thor is the God of thunder, and with that title also comes a fact: he's immortal. The Hulk can be shot at with anything and still bounce out of the dust and smash s**t. Captain America has his ""magic shield"" that can be hit by Thor's hammer and not receive a single scratch (No, really! If you watch the scene the paint doesn't even get scratched). Iron Man is Iron Man. His suit can be broken but he has a million gadgets that can get him out of any trouble. Hawkeye's character in this film was nothing. The Avengers could have lived without him. Black Widow...she's just a chick with a gun. If you read the actual Black Widow comic books (pre-Iron man) the protagonist doesn't wield guns but giant blasters on the top of her hands which shock enemies to the point of paralysis called ""Stings"". Yet they managed to turn her character into an irrelevant outcast that just stands out like a sore thumb. And last time I checked, Black Widow wasn't even originally in the Avengers. The originals were Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, and SPIDER MAN. Who thought it was a good idea to put her in this movie? Sorry, but her character was cardboard. Let's also discuss the fact that the group stayed on a friggin' flying carrier boat for a good 57 minutes of the movie, I mean it really feels like it when you're pulling your hair out and praying to anything holy that something will actually happen. <br/><br/>If you're a real fan of these characters and you've spent a huge portion of your life reading about them, then please, out of respect for their original creators, please watch the movie and actually visualize what the hell is going on screen before leaving a 10 star review saying that this movie was visually surpassing or it was perfect in every way. As far as I know, this film's only good aspect was that it was sometimes pretty and it can entertain a drooling infant. <br/><br/>3/10"
"johnnyboyz","5","2","8","31 December 2014"," Very little to Marvel at here - a somewhat tame effort with an odd chuckle and a decent stunt, but mostly underwhelming.
","When we observe a supporting character, a mere mortal ‚Äì a defenceless human-being, in Joss Whedon's ""Marvel: Avengers Assemble"" decide to single-handedly take on a near-indestructible son of a God, purely so as to come to the aid of a SECOND son of God, who is trapped inside a glass box, although has at his disposal a large hammer, and indeed pays for it with their life, you know you're not mining particularly intelligent territory.<br/><br/>This largely disappointing 2012 effort begins in a quasi-Area 51 style military base where a mysterious blue cube is pulsating enough for a race of monsters, who dress like the creatures in ""Stargate"" but look like something you might have caught in an episode of ""Power Rangers"", located on the other side of the universe to be attracted to it. Like Stargate, although with the roles here reversed, Tom Hiddleston's Loki (turns out Nordic mythology was the one, true religion) emerges from a portal created by the cube into this top secret laboratory and steals the cube in order to fabricate it so that the rest of the war mongering creatures can come through at a later date to destroy all human life.<br/><br/>A measure as to his menace and ability is put across in two ways: first, the ease to which he neuters the human beings ‚Äì finding no threat in automatic weaponry and 'converting' them to his cause through a magic staff. Second, the way in which he is framed so as to encompass an eagle-like emblem in the background (actually the badge of the good guys) as he utters ""Freedom is life's great lie..."" ‚Äì something designed to invoke a Hitler-like personality with what resembles the German 'National Adler' behind him.<br/><br/>Later on, there will be a strange allusion to Nazi Germany again when, in Germany of all places, he forces a score of German citizens to kneel before him, with one brave citizen standing up and making some allusion to how there will ""always exist people like you"" people who ""want power"". Had it been me, I would have cited a very famous remark, actually made famous in the twentieth century by a Communist, which goes: ""It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees"". Had I still been in one piece to offer a further retort, I would have recommended he hop on over to the Middle East, where they're heavily into sprawling themselves out on the floor because a deity tells them to. Loki's philosophy on human existence essentially being one of desiring submission would be right at home.<br/><br/>But nobody watching Marvel: Avengers Assemble will know of anything about German life between the wars, nor will they have heard of the Versailles Treaty, nor that Hitler commanded not for people to kneel before him, merely salute out of respect and recognise that his policies had made Germany a nation that was rich enough to fool itself into thinking the Great War never even happened.<br/><br/>After Loki's theft, an otherwise needless character played by Samuel L. Jackson, whose purpose in the film is to look cool wearing an eye-patch and firing a bazooka, gets together a string of superheroes whom have each had their own blockbusters from as recently as 2008. These are the titular Avengers, although what they are ""avenging"", we do not know and the film's title card appears on the screen as if itself a response to a character's asking ""What do we do?"" following Loki's theft of the cube doomsday device. Given this, the film ought to be entitled ""Assemble (the) Avengers"". Tossed in is an archer and an expert in kung-fu, because they offer an alternative way to kill an enemy to the main heroes, who can do nothing more than keep blowing them up or swatting them away with their power.<br/><br/>The film is mostly noise, but good looking noise; made more bearable by the wonderful editing during the action sequences, particularly when a flying battleship loses its ability to fly mid-air and New York City is besieged during the finale, wherein it is clear what each of our protagonists are doing; where they are in relation to each other and how they are going about fulfilling their tasks amidst the elements. The film is essentially Superman II with multiple Supermen; a concoction of 1994's ""Street Fighter"", wherein each character is designated a fight with every other one, despite some of them being on the same side, with Stephen Norrington's damp 2003 squib ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"".<br/><br/>I don't mind action films, but action films with a great deal of special effects are often somewhat tiresome affairs. This 2012 feature is no exception here. Over the last 25 years, Hollywood has proved time and time again that the best action films carry with them that grounded sense of base-level operation being propelled by realistic heroes. This is why the street; highway and inner-city set event movies of a ""Speed"" or a ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" will always be superior to a Marvel: Avengers Assemble, films that do not rely on a tremendous amount of special effects but provide you with enough chase; pomp and bullet-time to have you feel as if you are caught in a crossfire.<br/><br/>Should be unfortunate to catch this good looking, although ultimately vacuous, 2012 feature, I sense you will be disappointed. I was left dissatisfied in being asked to believe that there could exist a form of authentic theism AND the existence of an alien species elsewhere in the universe without any of it being explored; left perplexed at the tremendous amount of science on display, in Iron Man's suit and Bruce Banner's fascinating ability to shift into a separate molecular form ‚Äì the likes of which essentially smashes the concept of creationism. It is harmless; inoffensive and does indeed fly past nicely, but there's nothing here to get excited about."

","This movie is super hero cinematic excellence. It has one of the greatest ensemble cast ever assembled. Every actor complimented each other so well and each played their respective roles gracefully. Robert Downey Jr. was funny and portrayed the classic tony stark that he did so well in the previous iron man. He maintained all the cockiness and swagger that he had previously. Mark Ruffalo was a much better Hulk than expected. He did better than Edward Norton's portrayal in the previous film. He was very intellectual and benefited the movie well. Chris Evans was the perfect leader for this heroic crew. He had great one-liners throughout. Hawkeye and Black Widow were both good compliments to the the team also.

"michael_the_nermal","6","2","8","28 August 2012"," I'm Thunderstruck by this Film's Immense Popularity
","""The Avengers"" is an okay superhero movie; that's it. A great deal of the problem is that there are too many characters at once. The viewer doesn't get any time to understand most of the characters' backstories or motivations. They are suddenly called up for duty to defend the earth against the scrawny and mysterious alien supervillain based off of a Norse god. Most of the superheroes were not interesting, as their personalities were not that well-developed. The exception to this is Iron Man, who is wonderfully played by Robert Downey, Jr. Iron Man is depicted as a wealthy sarcastic playboy who isn't necessarily a hero for altruistic reasons. The smarminess and smugness of Iron Man's character may turn a lot of people off; but hey, at least it's a ""character"". There are a few scenes where the Hulk is really funny, but that is only as the Hulk persona, rather than as Bruce Banner. The rest of the superheroes are bland and undeveloped as characters. The film is also confused as to its tone. It tries to take its superhero world seriously, like the Tim Burton's ""Batman"" but also adds in tongue-in-cheek humor and makes attempts to be self-referential and campy, like the Joel Schumaker ""Batmans"". The balance is uneven at best. <br/><br/>The film's characters, with the exception of the Incredible Hulk, do not have enough fame or notoriety, like that of Superman, Batman or Spiderman, to be familiar to a general audience. This film is catered to an audience intimately familiar with the Marvel Comics universe and all of its characters, which will leave an uninitiated viewer utterly clueless about who's who. Who the heck is Black Widow? Nick Fury? Why do Thor and Loki speak in a bizarre, overly-proper form of English? Is it because they're aliens? Why should we care?<br/><br/>It is merely a personal matter of taste, but CGI has not evolved to the point where the special effects look entirely real; the closest computer animation has gotten to being realistic is James Cameron's ""Avatar"", where the aliens have genuinely human expressions and movements. The CGI in ""The Avengers"" is ugly to look at, particularly the ship the Avengers use as a home base, as well as the alien invaders towards the end. It is not worth it to pay extra for 3-D glasses to watch grey, ugly aliens riding grey, ugly spiny snakes while emerging from grey, ugly, bland modernistic monstrosities that pass for alien spaceships. The ultimate irony is the cheap gorilla and diving suit from ""Robot Monster"" (haven't seen the movies, just stills) looks more creative and inspired than the effects in this movie. The point is that there is little color and beauty in the CGI, and it always looks more fake and lifeless than rubber puppets or furry Ewok costumes ever could. I would go so far to say that the greyness and blandness of the alien and Avengers' flying fortress design totally detracted from the power of the action sequences. Notwithstanding the distracting CGI, the action scenes, as stand- alone pieces, are engaging and entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>In short, ""The Avengers"" lacks interesting characters and, while not entirely the fault of the filmmakers (technology still has a long way to go in 2012 before anything approaching realism can be fully realized, so my criticism in unfair in that respect), the CGI wasn't pleasant to look at. Watch ""The Avengers"" for the action scenes and for Hulk and Iron Man, who are funny and interesting. It's a fair effort, but nothing that approaches a timeless action classic. At least the Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies were infused with tongue-in-cheek humor and had an undeniable camp value; ""The Avengers"" takes itself too seriously to become a nostalgic classic like ""Superman""."

","I'm a huge fan of comics and when a movie is made I need to see it no matter the number of stars it gets or the budget. Everyone talked about this movie like it's something huge but I'm not so impressed.The actors were great but for an action heroes not enough action.The first hour and a half was just a torture with mindless talk and few fights fought in dark.And the end was similar to the ending of Iron man,the same going in the high altitude,and free falling.I mean you have that massive budget and you couldn't come up with something different.But the ending is only one of the many things that could have been made differently.Just a little more imagination and less effects.Still the 'Star Wars' stand unbeatable."

Robert Downey as Iron Man was a treat to watch, Chris Evans as Captain America was exciting, Chris Hemsworth as Thor was good, but felt he was little overshadowed (But loved to see THOR though) and Hawkeye, Nick Fury and black widow were good in their roles.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo emerged to become the best among the AVENGERS. Excellent portrayal of Dr.Brcue Banner/ Hulk.<br/><br/>On the other side i never felt LOKI to be a formidable opponent for the AVENGERS.He could have been a part of a team of Baddies.

"eriktherandom","7","2","8","15 June 2012"," Good, But Not Great.
","There seems to be a lot of hype about this movie, so I went with a friend when it first came out. Sure, it packed theaters, but after seeing it two additional times with two other friends, I come to the conclusion that it's just an ""okay"" movie.<br/><br/>I understand a lot of people are going to say, ""Oh you're stupid this movie is great!"" but at least hear me out.<br/><br/>Let's get started with the special effects. Hands down some of the best I've ever seen in film. Giant aliens ripping apart buildings was pure awesome. However, I saw this movie only ONCE in 3D. Why only 1/3 in 3D? Because the 3D was godawful. It gave me a headache, and being as it was done post-processing, it didn't look convincing, not that 3D ever really does.<br/><br/>Where the movie falls short is the random times of corny, clich√©d dialog, and just downright bad acting at some points. Cobie Smulders, as much as I love her in How I Met Your Mother, was terrible. Her lines sounded scripted, and she simply existed to try to add a more surreal element to the film. Basically over-emphasizing how dangerous things were.<br/><br/>The movie was far too long in my opinion. I noticed kids in the theater starting to get fussy toward the middle of the movie because of how long it takes to setup the plot. A lot of people were confused as to how the Tesseract really worked and how it played a substantial part of the plot. Too much terminology for people to remember, to be quite honest. They should have skipped more scientific discussion in place of better character development.<br/><br/>There really was little character development. Yes, the team fought, then they made up, then they fought again, only to come back and win. That's as far as the character development goes. If you watched ALL of the Marvel movies, the first hour is rather pointless simply because all it does is establish the background of the characters.<br/><br/>The action scenes occurred right toward the last 40 minutes, and were well directed. You felt at true sense of teamwork. The biggest problem was, no character except for Ironman was in any ""real"" danger. The characters felt like they were just non-stop combat machines and you never really feel a ""on the edge of your seat"" moment except for when Stark disposes of the nuke.<br/><br/>The balance of drama and comic relief is nearly PERFECT. Tony Stark of course was the majority of the comedy.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was fun to watch, but I certainly wouldn't say it's a cinematic masterpiece. While the special effects and great cast of characters bring this movie to life, it suffers with a dull plot that can leave you dozing off at a few points."
"zacodermatt","8","2","8","29 May 2012"," Just what I expected
","This movie was incredibly charming and exhibits some of the finest acting that I have seen in a good while, Robert Downey Jr. is flat out amazing as Iron man. This movie is exactly what you would expect it to be, prepare for high adrenaline and the crowd laughing a lot more than they should about the decent jokes throughout the movie. I enjoyed watching it, but it does occur to me that the blatant lack of a plot takes it down a few notches in my eye. What these people did was create a movie that was just perfect for the American public, clever but not smart, shallow, and just the right amount of repetitive one-liners to get my fellow movie-goers going. Very exciting movie, however it felt like over an hour and a half of fighting and puns."
"thommy741","10","2","8","27 May 2012"," OK - so how much money has this production cost again?!
","OK so you have Marvel's most iconic superheroes, thrown together in a battle against giant creatures and evil bad guys - how may this concept fail? Lazy authors, bad budget, lame love-stories! Good to see that none of these problems are present here. What you get is maybe just the best superhero-movie of all time.<br/><br/>Consider this: You have had all back stories of the protagonists (minus two who barely need one to be awesome) and the movie just jumps right to the action. Of course there are some (necessary) find-and-fight-together scenes but until the end credits roll, you get it all: Good versus the bad, good versus the good (seriously! Awesome!) and good versus the bad versus the good - you better order some new pants during the show! Apart from spoiling too much (which I really don't want to) I have to tell you, that the screenplay and the graphics you'll see in the movie, are top-notch all together and especially the non-superpower-heroes really shine.<br/><br/>Trust the dialogue, trust the performance and last but not least trust the critics: If you like these kind of movies, you NEED to see this to die happy.<br/><br/>Hint: If you see this in a movie theater wait until after the final credits .."
"kluseba","7","2","8","16 May 2012"," Nothing truly outstanding but among the better superhero movies
","I will try to analyze this movie from a different point of view than most of the critics do. I went to see this movie without any expectations because of many favourable critics but I haven't seen movies such as Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and so on. Usually, superhero movies are not my cup of tea and I find them rather childish and only focused on special effects and the same old redundant stories.<br/><br/>This movie is among the better superhero movies but it's definitely not the big thing many people claim it to be.<br/><br/>On the positive side, we have the great 3D effects that are really worth watching this movie in the cinema in comparison to many movies in 3D that are not quite spectacular and only try to raise the gross. The graphics and special effects of this movie are flawless and of the highest modern standards thanks to an exaggeratedly high budget of course.<br/><br/>But there are other positive things to find. Robert Downey Jr. does once again an incredible job and becomes a better actor in my estimation each time I see him in a new movie. He is some kind of a slightly crazy but charming dreamer with a sense for romance and cool humour and incarnates the Iron Man in a perfect way. Mark Ruffallo plays a rather calm and intellectual gentleman that becomes the Hulk as soon as he doesn't control his anger. His acting is also very authentic and grounded in this over the top movie. These two actors really impressed me the most but Tom Hiddlestone as the egoistic avenger and half god Loki and the great Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury are also quite convincing while the other actors can't catch up with these four talented actors.<br/><br/>On the other side, the story kicks off way too fast and if you don't know much about the Marvel characters, you will feel a little bit lost in the beginning. It's not quite clear who is attacking whom and why in the first couple of minutes but after that, the pace of the movie slows down and introduces the different characters in a solid way. In the case of the Hulk or Natasha Romanov (as she seems to be of Russian origin, her actual name should be ""Romanova"" - it's a pity that such a famous movie with such a big budget has this kind of stupid error), the introduction's scenes are amusing and entertaining while the presentations of Captain America or the Iron Man are not very well thought out in my opinion.<br/><br/>On the other side, the story of this movie is pretty generic and also predictable. The movie also has some important length in the middle of the film as the superheroes are discussing on the giant airship. The battle scenes in the end of the movie also get rather boring after a while and lack of diversity. The ending is also too much of a common standard to truly impress.<br/><br/>In the end, there are almost as many negative as there are positive things to mention but as the quality of the positive facts is quite elevated and a more important factor than the pure quantity and as this movie was almost very well entertaining me over a quite long running time with two little exceptions, I may give a shyly positive seven points to this flick. After all, I might now try out the movies about Hulk and the Iron Man who are my favourite characters in this movie and can't deny that this movie awoke some interest in me to dig a little bit further into the Marvel world I have missed out."
"MC1-Bjornson","7","2","8","16 May 2012"," The Avengers FINALLY Assemble
","""The Avengers"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Humor, Mild Sexual Innuendo, Violence and Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hr&23mns.<br/><br/>My Take: *** (Out of ****) ---- On the IMDb Scale = 7/10 <br/><br/>Over the last four years, movie-goers have known that The Avengers"" was coming. It was inevitable. Since 2008, there have been ""cookies"" (short clips usually appearing after a film's closing credits) in certain Marvel Comics based movies. ""Iron-Man"" (2008), ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008), ""Iron-Man 2"" (2010), ""Thor"" (2011) and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011). They served as the pre-cursors to this latest world-wide box-office phenomenon.<br/><br/>At the end of each movie, there was a cookie with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate), who would eventually recruit these Marvel icons into the superhero team known simply as ""The Avengers."" This was truly a unique marketing strategy. It was essentially an ongoing ""in-house"" ad campaign and now it has finally paid off.<br/><br/>Presently, ""The Avengers"" has grossed over $381 million domestically and over $627 million overseas. Its total worldwide box-office take is over $1 billion and climbing. It is presently the 11th highest grossing film of all time. This is an astonishing feat and there is no end in sight.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" opens with the global threat posed by the rotten scoundrel Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a god-like being from the distant Ansgard at the other side of the universe. Loki plans to unleash his warmongering monster minions to storm planet Earth and enslave the human race. Loki seeks to use the tesseract, which is essentially a weapon of mass destruction of insurmountable power, to aid in his quest for global dominance.<br/><br/>S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Agent Nick Fury is not down with this. Neither is Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a.k.a. Iron-Man, the brilliant billionaire philanthropist in a high-tech super-suit of epic proportions; Natasha Romanoff/""The Black Widow"" (Scarlett Johansson), an unparalleled martial arts expert; Steve Rogers/""Captain America"" (Chris Evans), a genetically engineered super-soldier; Clint Barton/""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) a hand-to-hand combat master; Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the god-like being, who is Loki's brother; and the elusive Dr. Bruce Banner/""The Incredible Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo), a scientist with a powerful alter-ego of, well, ""incredible"" size, strength and endurance.<br/><br/>There are several characters in this movie who demand their own signature moments of screen-time and individual back-stories (which were primarily covered in the other Marvel pictures). All these elements must tie into the crisis at hand with a neat little bow on top of it all. Also vying for screen-time is the flying fortress of S.H.I.E.L.D., an elaborate flying aircraft carrier. I've never seen anything quite like it before in the movies. Points awarded for originality and making me go ""hmm"" as I watched our heroes venture into action on that aerial ""marvel."" Fans will probably gobble ""The Avengers"" up with repeat viewings, strong word of mouth and what will likely be high volume DVD and Blu-ray sales. For them, the movie showcases in spades these superheroes uniting together in the same superhero film. Each superhero looks great and they certainly deliver the goods in terms of characterizations, use of super-powers and super-strength as they battle dark forces side-by-side.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" is a very busy film. This film really is a superhero smorgasbord. It's ambitious in its approach as a piece of pop culture cinema. How the film manages to balance all of its multiple components is a strong suit. A movie like this could have felt like an enormous hodgepodge collage. To the film's credit, all the pieces fit together rather nicely. Sure, there are some loose ends that go in different directions. That's okay. The pendulums are set in motion for other story arcs in subsequent movies to follow. ""The Avengers"" accomplishes this without becoming an incoherent mess. If filmgoers haven't seen the other films, and if they don't plan to see an Avengers' spin-off to see what else happens, that is fine. This picture is relatively self-contained. How many other films of this magnitude can pull that off? While I enjoyed it, I did feel this movie could not be more than what it is. From my perspective, it meets only the checkpoints. Here's what I mean: Do we see our Marvel heroes together? Yes. Do they bicker and fight each other at first? Yes. Do they overcome their sub-cultural differences to work in tandem against the Loki/WMD/alien invasion threat? Yes. Are there a few good jokes and a Stan Lee (the founder of Marvel Comics and co-creator of many of its characters) cameo thrown in for good measure? Well, funny you should ask . . .<br/><br/>This film adaption of ""The Avengers"" was directed by Joss Whedon, who is well-known in fantasy-television circles as the driving force behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1997-2003), ""Angel"" (1999-2004), ""Firefly"" (2002) and ""Dollhouse"" (2009-2010). Given his track record and reverence for the fantasy genre, he was a natural choice to head this film. Why he had not broken into big-screen comic book film adaptions earlier is hard to say. Though, a few years back, he did try to bring DC Comics' ""Wonder Woman"" to the screen in a failed attempt. He is clearly a story-teller who knows how to get his audience dialed-in and he gives them exactly what they want.<br/><br/>Though likable, I personally found ""The Avengers"" merely satisfying and nothing more. I know there are people who absolutely loved this film, while I only liked it at arms length. Perhaps that's due to my own tastes and sensibilities. Again, I felt this film only met checkpoints and it didn't do anything to exceed that. That's okay. This film will still be treasured by its fans, and I still managed to have fun with it too."

","This movie was very triggering. It made me recall the times in my life where I saw movies that were not good. The reason this was brought to mind was because this movie was not good, other than as a sort of cultural abyss into which to stare and wonder how things were before the kind of debased species that would make this sort of movie slithered into existence.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this movie isn't very good, it has a lot of accomplished stars in its cast. Each of these unique stars brings to the film their own interpretation of a muted, listless performance. I felt Samuel Jackson's performance was especially so: his listlessness seemed mixed with deep despair, an existential disdain so consuming that even feeling disgust would be a comparative relief for him.<br/><br/>In the movie a lot of things flew around. There were threats of violence. There was all the drama you'd expect in a Mexican soap opera. There was even an animatronic Gwyneth Paltrow! Joss Whedon has ingested Hollywood's gold and laid a truly magical egg."

Jackson-Chris Evans first scene..the most cheesy line ""the world is full of forces you can't control"". 2.Mark Ruffalo miscast as Hulk. 3. Worst Director choice- Joss Whedon who doesn't clean up the mistakes in the movie. 4. Bad writing- the whole story puts boredom and annoyance on your head taking place in that big obvious CGI plane thing and at last 15 minutes- ""YES ENJOY CGI GLORY WITH FIGHT"" 5. The Fights sequences were also lame because they were stolen from Transformers series like that Big Beast thing and the light that goes up in sky...Seen it all in Transformers 3 (which is also not that great movie). 6. It is just nonsense talk all over the movie. 7. some scenes are just the most cheesy like Captain America giving 10$ for showing the Big CGI plane thing, Robert ""Dowry"" picking up lines like ""that man playing Galaga""...I mean what does it add to this movie?????? 8. Also at last scene Hulk guy comes on the bike...most cheesy s#@t ever. 9.The pacing of the movie is absurd. 10. Hawk Eye guy says dialogue like -""It is my genuine pleasure""...I mean the world is about to come to an end and you are saying this ???? 11. The police guards talks on the street. One said- ""we need soldiers or some s##t and says what is happening and the other says -""Do we know??"".....Come on, even police-dialogues were the most annoyingly cheesy. 12. I don't buy Captain America suddenly becomes a Leader and gives orders ??? 13. I also hated that Black Widow character. 14. Even in the scene with Loki in that thing...she tries to get answers...how???- by cheesy lines of course. 15. I didn't even buy how she figured out Loki had a plan to separate these people...even in that scene he denies it. 16. The concept annoyed me that how they even thought that they could cash out on gimmicks like having some heroes in movie. That Concept annoys me.<br/><br/>There are more things that I have not addressed but for my sanity, I don't feel to lose my consciousness to rant about such a thing that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>""IF YOU ARE A PARENT, THEN DON'T LET YOUR KID WATCH THIS MOVIE OR ANY OTHER LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT MAKES YOUR KID STUPID AFTER A WHILE"" -fair warning<br/><br/>I understood about the kids but the adults and older adults think that this is a good movie...baffling truth.

What is worse there is practically no plot at all in this movie. All the facts are established in the beginning and nothing new happens during the movie. Tesseract is already discovered, all heroes are what they are and don't change till the end, it is boring. How Loki was saved? Why is he so evil? How Cpt. America deals with the XXI century? We don't know. The whole plot is basically a chain of fights and battles with no surprises. There is no twists at all. Horoes don't even have to find some weak spot of the monsters, IronMan just kicks their asses... boring...

There is something missing, the believable factor I think. Don't get me wrong, the sound and the image played on the screen was super grand. The most believable was Hulk. The rest of the gang performance just so so. Loki as the main enemy was so weak, I don't feel him at all. You know, a good bad guy should 'scare' you in a way, makes you wonder what he's capable of doing, but it fell flat tho. As for the avengers team, we'll have a glimpse of their pasts. I appreciate the director's effort to keep each of their own personality in a way while building the story, but the way it was told just plain. I know there are so many characters in this movie, but come on, no need too much conversation to show their egos, how bout on body language a.k.a act... it was boring :( I enjoyed the last 40 minutes, but the rest, oh please...

","I must confess that I'm not really a massive fan of the comic book movies. I don't normally go and see them at the cinema, but someone dragged me along to watch Avengers Assemble.<br/><br/>The plot is predictably simple with an alien enemy threatening security on earth. This means that a team of superheroes are required to defeat the enemy. The superheroes that are recruited include Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and the Black Widow. <br/><br/>The thing that I disliked about the film is the fact that I didn't really care whether any of the characters survived or perished. There are plenty of funny one-liners in the style of the Bond one-liners. It also appears that the actors had a good time making the film. Scarlett Johansson looks particularly good in a cat-suit throughout the movie. The guy that dragged me along to the movie absolutely adored the film, so if you are into comic book movies I'm sure you'll have a blast."
"GusF","Null","2","9","20 September 2015"," Good fun but still rather disappointing
","The highest grossing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of the highest grossing films of all time, this is good fun but rather disappointing. I was hoping that the film would be as relentlessly enjoyable as ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", my favourite superhero film of recent years and my second favourite overall after ""Superman"". However, it never really reaches that the level that he could or should have. That said, it has quite a good script by Zak Penn and Joss Whedon and it is well directed by Whedon.<br/><br/>As an ensemble film, it does not offer the same opportunity for the actors to shine as they did in their solo films but that is understandable, if again a little disappointing. Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton, makes a very impressive debut as Bruce Banner, a somewhat more neurotic character than in ""The Incredible Hulk"" in spite of the fact that he has far more control over the Hulk than he did in that film. There was certainly a sense of inner conflict in the character but I think that this has more to do with Ruffalo's performance than the writing. Robert Downey, Jr. and Chris Hemsworth are as strong as Tony Stark and Thor respectively as they were in their own films but Chris Evans appears ever so slightly wooden as Steve Rogers in comparison. Downey certainly gets the best material of the four of them, which is unsurprising since he has the strongest and most interesting character. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are perfectly fine as Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton but their characters are far from interesting and, honestly, made no real impression on me. Characters who can kick ass still need personalities.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston gives the best performance in the film as Loki, who on this occasion is merely the servant of a far greater power. Hiddleston is clearly having a whale of a time with the role and he gets many of the best lines in the film. Samuel L. Jackson finally gets more than a few scenes as Nick Fury and is as badass as you would expect. I did like the fact that they made him a somewhat morally ambiguous character. They tried to give Agent Coulson a personality in the film but he is likewise not a terribly interesting character, though Clark Gregg tries his best. I would have liked to have seen more of Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Erik Selvig since he was one of the best things about ""Thor"" but he was excellent in spite of his limited screen time. The film also features nice appearances in smaller roles from Alexis Denisof, Powers Booth, Jenny Agutter and Harry Dean Stanton.<br/><br/>The film is not structured terribly well and I felt that it spent a bit too much time on the petty bickering between the characters in the first half. It was a tad overlong. In terms of the action sequences, the attack on the Hellcarrier and all the associated scenes are certainly the most exciting. I thought that the Chitauri's arrival on Earth was left too late in the film's running time and, even when they arrived, it was not as exciting as I would have liked. Part of the problem that I had with them is that they are basically a faceless enemy. I would have preferred to have seen more of the Other or get a proper introduction to Thanos. I also wasn't too convinced by the ending. The special effects are certainly spectacular throughout the film. I loved the fact that the Hulk actually resembled Mark Ruffalo in the face! <br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun superhero team-up film but I preferred all of the characters' previous individual films."

","I'm not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasn't too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.<br/><br/>Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.<br/><br/>And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride."

Yay, I have now seen Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk battle Loki and his minions from Asgard as the latter try to invade New York City. Co-written and directed by legendary TV icon Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", and ""Firefly""), he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the Marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we've grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four-color world they inhabit. And seeing it all in 3-D is such an awesome experience! Oh, and it's great in also seeing Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury in tow. Really, all I'll say is you must watch The Avengers. P.S. Seeing Cobie Smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her ""How I Met Your Mother"" co-star Alyson Hannigan, formerly a ""Buffy"" star, have traded stories of what it's like to work for Mr. Whedon.

Also, this movie had way, way too much talk, and I couldn't even understand or hear what they were saying. I almost yelled at the movie screen for them to speak clearly. All these random things started happening, and I began to lose track of the storyline. As a result, I fell asleep. The first movie I have ever fallen asleep during, and it was the Avengers. When I woke up, it was the last fighting scene. The same thing seemed to keep happening over and over again, so it wasn't really that exciting. The only thing I got out of that movie was some of Hulk's jokes, which were pretty funny, and Iron Man makes you laugh too sometimes. Other than that, it was only OK. Maybe it's just that I don't like super heroes that much, but I did expect a lot more."

Forget about the Middle Eastern terrorists, the ""Avengers"" terrorists come from space, an undefined limbo space so that future visitors from some other planet not feel offended. What further disappointed me is that this live-comics-on-the-screen is not even patriotic. And using a futuristic setup for making a mockery out of our way of life and our government shows a pitiful lack of class. I marked it 5 only for its entertaining virtues.

"Easygoer10","3","1","3","12 December 2019"," Great; For Children...
","I loved the original ""The Avengers"" film (1961). For this version, however, it is far different. In my opinion, any actor who takes a role in this film or similar can only have 1 (or bith) of 2 reasons: The money and making children happy. I fully appreciate both. Unfortunately for fans, if you are over the age of 13 years old and enjoy this, well good for you. For me, I think anyone older who participates in watching this (or similar) type of film, it is exactly what is ruining the cinematic ""universe"", for lack of a better word. Please don't misunderstand me; there is a place for ""comic book"" movies. Unfortunately, they are so heavily packaged and promoted, it is detracting from the world of artistic films. If I sound snobbish, so be it. Director Martin Scorcese was recently quoted in a British TV interview (BBC?). In it, he pointed out this situation: The heavy promotion, packaging and large numbers of this type of film has caused more and more independent theaters to close. He received a large number of complaints from fans of Marvel Comics, DC Comics, etc. In response to this ""pushback"" he wrote an Op-ed in the New York Times. In it he could have taken the words from my mouth. It is a shame. When I lived in New York City from the 1980s until 2016, there were many more independent theaters. Not only smaller places like ""Angelika Film Center"", which (fortunately) has expanded to other cities, or ""The Film Forum"", or ""The Quad""; but all the large independent theaters in Times Square. They were torn down and replaced with hotels and/or other types of buildings. This was all a big part of Rudolph Giuliani's tenure as mayor. His ""Quality of Life Issues"". Yes, he succeeded in arresting people or issuing citations to (mostly homeless) people for panhandling, or ""squeegee boys"" at traffic bottlenecks who would wipe your windshield with buckets of dirty water. He talked about (I'm paraphrasing) ""Cleaning up the pornos and peep shows"" in Times Square. Well, he did this, and then some. Unfortunately, the large theaters I just mentioned went out the window, too. He turned turned Times Square into ""Disneyworld"". Prior to this ""ravagement"", I used to love going to Times Square late on a Friday or Saturday night, and catch a midnight or 1:00 AM showing of some big new action film, like ""Terminator: Judgement Day"", or ""Lethal Weapon"". It was fun, simply because the audience participated. They were loud and raucus, which fit this type of film perfectly. It was great! On the other hand, if I wanted to see a great new independent film (quietly), I would typically go to Angelika Film Center. I did this because I lived only a few streets west, just off of Houston Street in Soho. I could walk there in less than 5 minutes (door to door). Anyway, if you enjoy thiskind of movie, great. All I am saying is be aware of the ""big picture"", which Mr. Scorcese so eloquently wrote about."

This time with a help of cube thingie called Tesseract, that opens a portal through which a some sort of biomechanoid warrior race runs through to do the actual conquering.<br/><br/>In order to get the full impact of the movie it would probably be the best to know a lot about the Marvel universe, either from the comics or from the movies, as the Avengers doesn't even pretend to be a movie friendly for new viewers. It's not muddled piece of fan service, but it is filled with things, that are left relatively obscure without prior knowledge of what has happened in the Marvel universe. The Avengers is fully watchable, even if you don't know that much about Marvel's world, but it does feel a bit hollow experience none the less. It just can't escape from its roots, which have been made during many other movies.<br/><br/>As said, The Avengers is not a bad movie. It's filled with great actors from Samuel L. Jackson to Robert Downy JR, almost all of which are familiar from the previous Marvel movies. Thay all do serviceable roles. They make the movie work, but none of them gets huge amounts of time as people, as the movie expects the viewers to be already familiar with them, be it Tony Starks arrogance or Bruce Banners life in shambles caused by his alter ego.<br/><br/>All in all, while the Avengeres is not a perfect movie, it is a nice start for a probably a lot more of them.

Thankfully it allowed the movies to do a lot of the backgrounds for the characters, otherwise we would have been in for an extremely long ride.<br/><br/>The Hulk was the standout character for me. Out of all of the superheroes in this movie he was by far my favorite (and has been my favorite for a very long time). Joss Whedon seriously knew how to make this movie into a Fanatic's wet dream and he held plenty of tension and plenty of drama in all the right places along with the kick ass action sequences. Though I would have liked Ed Norton to be the Hulk in this movie, the actor they picked for a stand-in was right on the money for a GREAT Bruce Banner. He was mild-mannered, smart, and cool-headed (well, you know what I mean).

I'd like to think not.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: for something to watch with a couple of mates if you'd rather stay in for the evening, The Avengers does what it set out to achieve: entertain (and make money); but it's the epitome of what has been dubbed the ""popcorn flick"", and once you've had your fill, into the bin it goes.<br/><br/>But then, nobody ever expected a film about comic-based super heroes to be The Godfather."

","The Avengers is a great movie, but not due to its plot. It's a simple MacGuffin chase, culminating in a random big fight. Also, the editing felt unfinished from time to time.<br/><br/>Nevertheless... it's not the plot that is supposed to make the Avengers a great movie. It's the fact that it brings stories and characters from other movies together. In a way, the Avengers is the finale of a bigger whole.<br/><br/>The lack of plot gives the opportunity to zoom into the different characters and how they respond to each other. We learn how Bruce Banner and Tony Stark connect. We see how The Hulk and Thor have a measurement of strength. How the straight morals of Captain America conflicts with the happy go lucky attitude of Iron Man.<br/><br/>We also get a closer look at SHIELD and we learn that the agency has its moral questionabilities. When we move beyond the Avengers, we learn how that is so in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>The choice for Loki to be the main villain connects to the firs Avengers comic. And in many other ways as well , the movie pays its respect to the comics - as we're used to in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The Avengers movie is a mile stone in the MCU, and yes, its greatest merit is being the Avengers movie.<br/><br/>It's not the plot that makes this movie great. It's the fact that it's the pay-off for earlier established characters and stories, and laying the ground work for more great stuff to come."

I also like the way although it is an action film there are aspects of a comedy film in it as I found some parts of the film funny.

","I'm writing this review in response to a lot of the backlash that seems to be happening in the reviews. Despite being the third highest grossing movie of all time, receiving critical acclaim and being in the IMDb Top 250, people in the reviews have been slamming this movie. Why? Not Dark and Gritting Enough? I Loved the Dark Knight but not every movie has to follow that formula (see Amazing Spider-Man, Man Of Steel). No one said this movie was The Godfather or Citizen Kane, because it doesn't have to be! All it has to do is entertain, and it does that in bucketloads. I remember leaving the theater and already I Couldn't wait for the second one. Joss Whedon is one of the greatest writers in the industry (see Buffy, Firefly etc.) and knows his comics (see his run on Astonishing X- Men and Runaways) making him the perfect choice for this movie. It has action and humor and all you could want from a blockbuster movie. Granted, it looks better on the Big Screen, in which case this review is too late, but none the less, if you're a fan of blockbuster movies this is the cream of the crop. If you aren't then be smart enough not to go see it."

","The success of The Avengers film is a result of the brilliant Marvel's history and its ideas. The Marvel Universe has grown a lot since its beginning in the 1950s. What started as a series of comic books would become one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world. Marvel has since expanded to explore mediums such as comic books (of course), short films, feature films, video games, and a television series all based on characters from the Marvel Universe. This process made the Marvel to a big fantastic factory of dreams.<br/><br/>The Avengers is an example of film that the people know as transmedia, because the sequence of the film happens in different media, platforms like a game online,a specific novel or graphic novel in comics form, comic, cartoon and film. The process of adaptation is very important as well, especially in this movie, because this process becomes possible to work comic features specific in a film and vice versa. <br/><br/>The film's idea was born from the adaptations of the comic book ""The Ultimate Avengers"". This comic book gets a new form, a book form that is the graphic novel. This new forn brings a new meaning to the same text.<br/><br/>The Avengers plot talks about the power cosmic cube. This power is the cause a war and in the same time it is to threat a planet's safety threat. The cosmic cube is a specific object in Marvel's stories. The concept was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in ""Tales of Suspense"", in July 1966. The power cosmic cube is important too, because it transformed its holder's any wish into reality. Here, it becomes<br/><br/>an inexhaustible source of power named Tesseract, which is under the power of S.H.I.E.L.D (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate)., organization led by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) that seeks to protect the Earth with the aid of the object. The plan backfires, when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's brother (Chris Hemsworth), who was trapped in an alternative dimension, returns there with the aid of alien Chitauri and gets the cube to revenge the Terrans and the God of thunder. From there, the feature engages in short stories full of action, which serve to show the bonds that are formed between each hero before the formation of the avengers. There are the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey JR.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and the other agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg).<br/><br/>Finally, the problem with this film is your specific plot, because for the Marvel comic reader that OK. But the occasional reader and lay person may some difficulty understanding the Marvel Universe. For example, the cosmic cube is a specific ficcional Marvel comics object and this object is very important for many comic stories creations."

","I do not read comics. I've tried, but they just seem like watered-down versions of the shows I watched as a kid, like Batman TAS or Teen Titans.<br/><br/>But I love cinema. I've been keeping up with all the Marvel movies released prior to the Avengers and they were always teasing at an Avengers movie. And let me be the one millionth to say...<br/><br/>""OH MY GOD, THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!""<br/><br/>And what a movie it is. It has comedy, it has action, character interactions, drama, EVERYTHING a movie needs. Not just a comic book film, ANY film. But, when you get down to it, Avengers is a comic book that has been cleanly and perfectly translated to the big screen.<br/><br/>But what sets Avengers apart from other movies is the mere fact that it WORKED. Every single character in this has been the leading man in their own movie (or has the potential to be) and yet the film focuses on them all. It's like if you got John Lennon, William Shatner, and George Peppard to be in a movie together with Vincent Price as the villain and the story managed to revolve around ALL of them.<br/><br/>The plot is unoriginal, but that's not what carries the movie. What carries the movie is the characters. Even the scenes with Thor, Cap, Iron Man and Nick Fury just TALKING are fun and engaging, and no scene drags or is too fast. And that's all this movie aims to be: an overload of fun.<br/><br/>Why are you still reading this? Go rent the movie and watch it, you fool!"

","Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is the cross-over movie that everyone was waiting for. All our favorite heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye) are in one movie in order to stop the evil Loki. And it is perhaps one of the most critically loved and successful movies. And with good reason: the movie is incredibly amazing.<br/><br/>For starters, the acting. Everything actor did a phenomenal job as their characters. Each actor (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, etc.) defined their characters. So was the villain. Loki was completely evil and awesome. The dialogue should also be addressed. The dialogue was beautifully written for the characters, and it seemed believable because they really weren't friends (that would be a spoiler, but we all knew that would happen.) The action was the best I've seen in 2012. It was all shot well (the one-shot in the last two trailers was the best scene in the movie.) With the Hulk smashing, Thor using that cool hammer, 'Merica throwing his mighty shield, it was Christmas for moviegoers.<br/><br/>In the end, what else is there to say that everyone else hasn't? ""The Avengers"" is cinematic gold at its finest. It was exciting, it was humorous, and it was just what 2012 needed for the Summer Movie season. This is a feeling we don't get in movies these days.

The special effects were brilliant especially during the battle at Manhattan. Lots of explosions were their too! The Jatari (Loki's army) looked great and a little bit freaky as well. That is what you need to make a good evil alien army.

","The promotional material looked like it was setting me up for disappointment. Then I saw it and found myself uncontrollably falling deeply in love. Joss Whedon was able to flawlessly bring these characters together and give them some excellent interactions. A sign of his genius is how he took Black Widow, my least favorite character from Iron Man 2, and made her one of my favorite Marvel characters. He was also able to give us the best portrayal of the Hulk. Loki also had some great scenes and some great lines. In fact, I think he was the strongest element of this movie. The music is, for some reason, quite average though. <br/><br/>This is a movie one can rewatch again and again. It's an all around enjoyable film with great, unique characters, great dialogue, a cohesive plot, and fantastic action. At this point, with its universal acclaim, there is no point in me recommending it at all. Let me just add this then: for once, the hype is completely justified."
"silentcheesedude","10","1","3","5 December 2013"," So, which part did you like?
","Ah, comic superheroes. I used to read The Avengers as a kid. It wasn't my favorite comic, but I really got into the story-lines that ranged from simple single villain battles to country-wide political issues. Teamwork was of the utmost importance, and although most of the characters had their own comic series, it dove into some meaningful character studies itself, too.<br/><br/>As for the movie, you couldn't really ask for much more. It's got everything that an action/fantasy, hell even comedy lover would want and then some. Assembling a team, saving the world against evil while trying to cope with each other is just a lot of fun to watch! Each hero had some interesting story to them. You've got the bulk, brawn, & cooped up anger of the Hulk, the out of time sturdy super soldier Captain America, The playboy genius/joker Iron-Man, the arrogant but powerful & other-worldly Thor & the Russian Shield Agent Black Widow. But not Hawkeye. Nobody liked Hawkeye so let's skip him.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston is better than he should be as bad-guy Loki. He and Agent Coulson, played by Clark Gregg somehow became fan favorites. I understand Loki, he's a bit of a tragic figure. He's been damaged emotionally and physiologically by others, & good example of evil. But I don't understand Agent Coulson. I mean, I liked the guy but he has FAN SITES, by golly.<br/><br/>Director Joss Whedon was perfect for this, he's a comic book lover, & well established in epic like storytelling for TV shows. And I haven't even mentioned Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.<br/><br/>Does the movie have flaws? Sure! But so does every other movie, including The Dark Knight, which had far, far more head scratches & dumb plot holes than I could count.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is a must see movie for all fans of the genre."

In short, the Avengers come together, at first they don't like each other, but they band together to save the world from aliens. The technical gadgets and space craft were cool and looked great on the big screen. However, with so many main characters and so much action to fit in, the funny, quirky, bits about each character were lost. Everyone got in a one liner, but not much more than that. I missed the heart pounding heavy metal arrogance of Iron Man, the fish out of water grandeur of Thor and even the mysterious plot line of Captain America. With all the fab reviews, I must just have different taste in movies. I felt less endless battles and more banter and purpose would have jazzed this up a bit.

"masterandcommander","5","1","3","2 January 2013"," Exactly as intended: an imperfect but entertaining film
","Avengers is a flawed but still highly entertaining film. I went in with pretty low expectations but was pleasantly surprised by its entertainment value. However, I think the real problem is not the entertainment value, but the value of the story.<br/><br/>Avengers is inherently an origins story. This is sort of confusing because it tells the story of numerous characters teaming up and forming an alliance. The primary goal should seem to be establishing the characters, their differences, and why each would decide to form such a group. As someone who saw only several of the previous ""set up"" films (Incredible Hulk, Iron Man,Thor) I felt like I didn't learn much about the characters. The inconsistency of both being an origin film, but also heavily reliant on previous films to know who those characters are, weighed the movie down.<br/><br/>The movie kicks off with action. Yet, it then slows down considerably with some less-than-interesting introductions. It might be silly to be asking for back story, considering the popular nature of these iconic characters, but it seems like this was the very basic requirement of the film. Who are the Avengers?<br/><br/>Back story is glossed over for a few minutes for each character in expository dialog. Thor describes that he is the brother of Loki, Captain America mumbles about some war, and Scar Jo talks about some assassination attempt. This would seem worthwhile if it was not so bland. It is very dull hearing one ultra- warrior after the next explaining themselves. This would perhaps be less of an issue if the dialog was better written. The only dialog that had some genuine wit and charm, that every character seemed to be trying too hard to accomplish, was with Iron Man. The movie suffers from ""that guy needs a witty line too"" which makes the characters just a bunch of smarties. This is a classic example of ""show don't tell"" being blatantly ignored. <br/><br/>Loki, while performed well, was a villain who left much to be desired. Making snide and childish squawks about being better than everyone else is not enough. We need to see it in action. Instead we have one character after the next smashing him and sending him through a wall while he insists on superiority. While having the main characters more powerful than the villain is not always bad (joker-batman) the villain needs an equalizer usually in the form of intelligence or ruthlessness. While Loki is certainly mean, he is anything but intelligent. <br/><br/>Loki suffers from ""why didn't he do that in the first place"" the entire movie. One wonders why he sought to ""divide"" the Avengers when they were already divided. One wonders why he would stake his entire plan on allowing himself to be captured; or hoping that the Hulk would get angry. One also wonders exactly what Iron Man points out; why would you anger numerous gods, super-soldiers, and mutated beasts who are your only adversaries right before launching an invasion? Divide and conquer makes sense only if your enemies are united. The movie was confused between trying to having a villain break up a united group when they were never united, and a divided group becoming united because they were being attacked. <br/><br/>Whedon has done great work with an ensemble of interesting characters with his previous work on Firefly. It is unfortunate that, despite many believing it to be the case, Whedon has not managed to pull off the same magic. While Firefly relied on character motivations to dictate their actions in a more or less simplistic and wandering plot line, the Avengers relies on a contrived, high-stakes, and stereotypical plot to dictate the actions of the characters while relying on previously earned knowledge of what made these characters tick, rather than demonstrating their cares. <br/><br/>The Avenger's arc of learning to work together only came about as a result of the villain taking a far too obsessive interest with angering his opponents. Instead of the characters looking within themselves for the strength to rise above their differences and work together, our heroes are only united by action taken from without by others. They are often seen squabbling over childish differences of personality rather than differences of opinions or conflicting motives. Instead of The Avengers uniting because of inner strength, they unite due to the dubious actions of an unintelligent villain. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a lie from an otherwise useless Samuel Jackson, only offers a weak emotional appeal from a character nobody seemed to like much in the first place. It all detracted from the fulfillment when the Avengers finally decide to work together in the final act. Instead of excitement over each character finding their way through their own nuances and histories, we feel excitement because the movie is finally going to have some fight scenes again.<br/><br/>This is, of course, the real triumph of The Avengers; the action. The Avengers is certainly a triumph of spectacle. It raises the bar as to what is possible with super hero movies. However, instead of raising that bar with themes in the way that Nolan's batman trilogy attempted, or creating a rather human non-super hero in Shyamalan's Unbreakable, we are simply treated to better-executed and bigger-budgeted explosions. Also, while the film may not have had the most introspective protagonists, they had some entertaining tiffs. Robert Downey Jr. elevates the other cast members' fruitless attempts at comedic relief with comedic genius. This only further solidifies him as the only actor in the bunch that doesn't need a good script to make anything sound awesome.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the intention and the effect is that the Avengers is nothing exceptional or timeless, but certainly fun and exciting.<br/><br/>My subjective breakdown of the movie's major elements: Cinematography 9/10 Editing 8/10 Art Direction 8/10 Sound 10/10 Special Effects 9/10 Acting 6/10 Pacing 5/10 Characters 4/10 Theme 4/10 Music 6/10 Overall 6/10"

","The only fault that this movie has is that its not long enough! The fights are great. Seamles panning through the war zone with ultra cool set pieces that are just used as fillers! Most movies would kill for some the little bits as the best thing in their whole film. Cap bouncing iron man's repulsors off his shield and taking out the enemies is just one example of this! Hulk steals the show probably because most people enjoyed the iron man and Thor stand alone films more than the others and thus expect them to be the best characters.<br/><br/>Every character has their time in the spot light, and the only one that could have had a bit more action is Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury.<br/><br/>Easily the best film of 2012, and for me, the best film i have seen since The Lord of The Rings! Bring on Avengers 2! i'm sure it will Destroy Justice League at the box office!"
"piratecannon","9","1","3","26 December 2012"," Marvel-ous
","It was inevitable that The Avengers would be made, especially with the cinematic gold that was produced with the Iron Man franchise, Thor, and Captain America (though the Hulk films have struggled to find any kind of footing to speak of). In this critic's opinion, the individual productions dedicated to the aforementioned superheroes ranged from spectacular to borderline dreadful (I was especially disappointed in Captain America). To think that any one person could somehow blend all of these characters' story lines into something coherent‚Äîand, as implausible as it seemed, genuinely entertained‚Äîmade me more than skeptical.<br/><br/>But, as the saying goes, never say never. The Avengers is a spectacle to behold; it's thrilling, funny, and actually musters up quite a bit of unexpected character development. How about that?<br/><br/>What makes it so fantastic is the fact that nearly every major player is given equal screen time. Wisely, Whedon decided to paint these otherworldly heroes flesh tone‚Äîthat is, he makes them entirely human. Instead of being fodder for CGI carnage (which, paradoxically, they are, in a very good way) we become invested in them as individuals. They have their problems, and never is this more relevant than when egos collide aboard a floating fortress‚Äîa scene that almost sees the would be saviors of the world nearly tear themselves apart. Another well-played decision on the part of Whedon was to play up the sociological angle of the mayhem taking place. Specifically, the fact that the battle for humanity eventually moves to the streets of New York City evokes feelings directly reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks. This strikes a particularly vulnerable chord in most of us; even though it's been 11 years since the horror of that September morning unfolded, a general sense of unease still permeates our contemporary culture. The fact that The Avengers draws such clear cut lines between ""good"" and ""evil"" makes it unexpectedly powerful, and the musings by many of the characters that the world could do with a little ""old fashioned"" reverie is certainly a well-founded one.<br/><br/>Actually, I have only one gripe with the movie. It's probably too minor in many people's eyes to warrant mentioning, but, in light of the myriad accomplishments that define the movie, I simply can't ignore it. Specifically, it has to do with the Hulk's sudden ability to control his rage in such a way as to be mindful of what he is and isn't smashing. No explanation is given as to how he's able to do this in a hairpin moment of critical importance, and it's something that could have been easily resolved with a quick bit of dialogue or a thirty second scene.<br/><br/>For everything that could have gone wrong with The Avengers, it's a miracle that it's actually watchable; actually, it's a wonderful piece of cinema, not to mention one of the best action movies that I've ever seen. If you haven't checked this out, be sure to do so before it leaves the big screen. Skipping it would be doing your inner kid¬Öheck, your inner human¬Ö a great disservice."

","Have you ever gone somewhere have no idea where you are at? Even going somewhere and having no idea what the purpose your there for is. Well ""The Avengers"" movie has all those mixed emotions and more. If you have not watched the movie, I suggest watch it before reading my review.<br/><br/>First I would like to add my opinion, that this movie overall has many great qualities of an incredible film and some not so interesting parts. To think of it, not every movie is made to perfection and everyone could think different about anything.<br/><br/>The Avengers is an action type movie which lasts about two hours and twenty-three minutes of excitement. The film demonstrates these great super hero's trying defeat the typical evil villains. Even though I am not interesting in action movies, I enjoyed how it demonstrated all the team work and effort they combined, to accomplish what they wanted and needed to defeat the villains. <br/><br/>In the beginning they start off the movie very vague and random. There are characters I had no idea who they were. Apparently the movie combines these super heroes' from several other movies. If you have not watched the other movies, you have no idea who these characters are. After watching and having to do some research, the characters come from the movies; Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Captain America. Obviously you would identify the big green character instantly in the video because everyone should know who he is, but for the rest of the characters I think they should have acknowledged that everyone does not know them. In the beginning it was very difficult to connect who all these people were, because there were so many Super Hero's and had no idea who they were.<br/><br/>Overall this movie feels like a typical super hero action movie. If I was not told that the characters came from other movies, I would have never known and would have thought this movie was the best action movie ever created. The title ""The Avengers"" fits perfectly with the combination of all of them. It demonstrates the usual actions of the hero's winning and the evil characters loosing. As to the film itself and how it came out, I would say this video has some great video effects. We are now in 2012 and the effects of everything seems so real to an extent. Obviously we still are not able to fly but the fighting and weapons and everything seems realistic and makes it even a better action movie. I don't want to ruin too much and add many details on the movie, because I believe even though you have not watched the other movies. The movie itself is a great film and should be witnessed. Spend those 143 minutes on a great movie, and judge everything yourself, you will not be displeased."

","Being the comic book junkie that I am, and seeing numerous attempts at making decent super hero/vigil-anti films, most of which ending in disaster. From the terrible 'Fantastic Four' films to the ridiculously awful 'Thor' film, there was no doubt in my mind that the film would lack any real substance, but instead focus on immature, repetitive, one- liners. My only true incentive for paying to see this in theaters was Joss Whedon being the writer and director. That being said I enjoyed the 'Iron Man,' 'Captain America,' and 'Hulk' films as well. My expectations were low for this ensemble super hero flick, as I sat in the back row of the movie theater. It was surprisingly very good. it was well written(for the most part), the acting was superb, the plot was juicy and consistent, the characters were believable, and the CGI and other effects were great. The film had many one liners, but they were mature, well thought out, humorous, and best of all: the film didn't rely on them to make itself memorable.Aside from the over the top Thor and Loki characters, and far too fast progressing beginning the film was excellent. The film began very fast, and then suddenly slowed down which was a slight bit annoying. But with all things considered, especially the other acting and special effects, the film is a great film, well worth viewing and/or owning."
"OttoVonB","8","1","3","6 September 2012"," The secret ingredient is ""fun""
","IronMan, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Eagle Eye and the Black Widow unite under the SHIELD banner to face a colossal threat led by fallen god Loki.<br/><br/>I come at this both late - the film is already one of the most financially successful films ever made as I write these lines - and relatively indifferent to the whole Avengers mythos. I am also unfamiliar with said mythos. Superman and Batman are well established in Europe, but many of Marvel's properties are much less so. With that in mind, the folks at Marvel deserve an award for long-term strategic planning.<br/><br/>Under almost any shape, an Avengers film would have made a deal of money. So it is to the credit of the powers behind this behemoth that time was taken to establish each of the heroes individually before embarking on this group adventure. The choice of Iron Man as a starting point, particularly with the genius casting of Robert Downey Junior, proved especially savvy. Iron Man has many similarities to Batman, but where the latter, now the heart of a hugely successful rival film franchise, is at heart quite dark and brooding, Iron Man is inherently light- hearted and fun, something the first film outing captured brilliantly.<br/><br/>Assembling the Avengers was not always a smooth process. The SHIELD line felt a bit shoehorned into the Hulk's reboot, derailed the plot or Iron Man's sequel, and frustratingly cut short Captain America's period solo potential. And now that they were finally together, supported by fresh film back-stories of varying quality for the uninitiated, you'd think the studio would sit back and enjoy an easy success.<br/><br/>Thankfully, you'd be wrong.<br/><br/>From the first few seconds up to the ending, the film oozes with love for its characters, giving most of them not only defining moments but also the fine small details that make you care. Downey Junior could have easily walked away with the honors regardless of the overall film's qualities. That the filmmakers try their best to create a sense of balance shows both respect and confidence in their other characters, and a strong determination to make this work as a team vehicle. The often square Captain America is thankfully done justice, and after two different attempts, the Hulk is finally spot on, Mark Ruffalo giving the film most of its heart and pathos.<br/><br/>Until the Avengers, the world was gearing up for the Dark Knight's grand finale. A trilogy that took a mildly ridiculous premise and turned it into a dark, gritty and grand opera. And for all their admirable qualities, Nolan's masterpiece and its two companion pieces sometimes felt a tad grim. The Avengers strikes a perfect balance between serious stakes and its inherent ridiculousness. Here Joss Whedon - of whom I was no fan coming into this - proves himself ideally suited to the task. His trademark wit is perfectly attuned to the material.<br/><br/>The biggest Summer blockbuster of 2012 is a finely crafted, rousing adventure, sparkled with humor and character, a love of its protagonists, and above all fun.<br/><br/>Thank you Marvel and everyone involved for creating such high expectations, and then exceeding them."

","I'm not a big fan of the genre, but I enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>An action movie based on marvel comics: that implies thrills and over-the-top-CGI. This is a great movie if you are not looking for anything more.<br/><br/>Action movies stand or fall by their foes. In this case, you are presented a great villain.<br/><br/>As for the heroes, Robert Downey Jr is at its best, and Samuel L. Jackson does his part.

","I'm not what you would consider an authority on the Avengers, but I did grow up reading all the Marvel comics I could get my hands on. I eagerly watched every movie, TV show & cartoon starring super heroes. I was a big fan of the old Incredible Hulk TV show starring Bill Bixby & Lou Ferrigno. I read Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, & Avengers Comics as well.<br/><br/>I would suggest before seeing the Avengers, Seeing Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America & Thor. It's not prerequisite, but it would certainly enhance your enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon is one of my favorite directors/writers/producers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, Dollhouse & Cabin in the Woods). I love his sense of humor.<br/><br/>At first I was disappointed that Edward Norton didn't return for the role of Bruce Banner, but Mark Ruffalo was Incredible as the Hulk! Samuel L. Jackson brings the bad ass to the role of Col. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.! Robert Downey Jr. brings his charisma to Iron Man again. Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) all brought the magic in their roles!<br/><br/>The story and action were amazing. Just the right balance of eye candy, character & comic relief. I plan to see it again in the theater & buy it on Blu-Ray. I've only seen a handful of movies in the Theater more than once, so that is high praise from me. I eagerly await the next Marvel movie!"

","Avengers movie review Oh my god I love this movie. I went with a friend who prefers to be not named. We both loved it. It was incredible, amazing, and awesome movie. This time I will say the plot first. Col. Nick Fury brings together Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye together to become the Avengers and fight Loki and his army of Chiturai. Robert Downey JR is Tony Stark. There is no one else that can play this role and if they get someone else he will pale in comparison. Chris Evans is so awesome as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth really nails the role as Thor. If anyone is worried about Mark Ruffalo not doing a good job as Banner. I almost feel he was better than Ed Norton. I like the Norton as Bruce too but Ruffalo really feels like Banner. He is incredible as Banner. The Hulk looks Incredible. He looks like Mark Ruffalo. You feel it. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as Black Widow. There is a scene where she speaks in a foreign language she does such a good job. She is not a perfect Black Widow but she does a good job of bringing her own take to the role. Jeremy Renner is Hawkeye. He was my fan pick. I feel like they listened to the fans when they casted him for the role. Tom Hiddleston is so sinister as Loki. He was great in the Thor movie but he is even better in this movie. Samuel L Jackson really nails the role as Nick Fury. He does such a commanding role. He knows how to take charge. Clark Greg as Agent Phil Coulson does a great job too. He knows how to take charge and he was such a fan boy around Captain America. Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill is so good. She is a great SHIELD agent. The Shield Hellcarrier is like right out of the comic book. WOW! The Quinn Jet is great too. Loki's Army is so amazing looking. Then you have the Levathion. It is not Fing Fang Foo the Dragon from the Iron Man comics. But it looks so incredible anyway. They call the cosmic cube a Tesseract. If you don't know what that means basically it can open up wormholes. The first time I heard that word is when I read the book Wrinkle in Time when I was a child so that is how I understand what it is. Everything you wanted is in this film and more. When I saw the Artist I thought no movie would beat it until now. I feel this movie has smashed my scale. I friend gave it 11/10 and so am I. So to quote Spinal tap. This dial goes to 11. For this movie it is 11/10. It is that great. This will be on Blip TV and Youtube soon. Big Guy Movie Reviews"

"Fluig_2013","9","1","3","29 April 2012"," Stunningly Intense, Emotional, Likable and Funny!
","Saw it yesterday with my nephews and niece and enjoyed it more than any other Marvel adaptation since Spiderman.<br/><br/>I can't think of any other recent film that could make this granite-faced 39 year old crack a grin at its moments of old-fashioned super-heroic ""awesome!"", such as when Captain America intervenes at the last moment to save a brave civilian from being vapourised, or simply watching a succession of childhood heroes duke it out with many a ""THOOM!"" and a ""WHAM!"" <br/><br/>Yes, this film taps into our need for larger than life heroes, while at the same time making them likable by allowing us to laugh at them: Captain America is super-strong, brave and handsome, but probably wouldn't know how to use a computer mouse. Thor, aka ""PointBreak"", wears his mother's drapes. The Hulk is a dangerously powerful toddler in torn shorts.<br/><br/>I even preferred Tony Stark in this one than his own films: somehow his wisecracking arrogance is much more impressive when it's at the expense of demi-gods and superhumans! <br/><br/>With the tactical prowess of Captain A., the director has managed to get each character to play an equal part in their own special way, while providing a lot of fun and interest in the way they interact, whether they're cooperating or otherwise.<br/><br/>When a film's heroes are near invincible it can be hard to induce a sense of jeopardy, but this film succeeds in doing that by providing an unexpected event which also lends a strong emotional core. We are also shown that our heroes can bleed: in 2 effective moments I remember there is a pause, we see that a hero is badly injured, but he carries on without complaint.<br/><br/>Such is the goodwill fostered by the film, I'm prepared to skim over the negatives. I'd have preferred the gathering of the team to be hastened on a bit, and I think one stunt pulled by the Black Widow seemed more believably suited to a super-powered being, which was unnecessary as her more ""down to earth"" abilities were already enough to prove that she was a valuable part of the team.<br/><br/>After we emerged from the cinema, we were all still pretty stunned from the intensity of the action. The verdict of my companions? The film rendered the life of my 15 year old nephew complete; his 11 year old brother thought it was ""OK"", and my 7 year old niece was inspired to switch her favourite character from Thor to The Hulk."

","At last! The Avengers is released, and does not disappoint. It begins with a fast and mysterious, with few characters, which eventually merge to form The Avengers. The movie has action scenes very well done, and confrontations between the characters of epic size, the film also features humor, that feels good and it accounts for most of Iron Man One of the greatest strengths of the story, is that all characters have their heroic piece in the movie, and not entertain to lift just one. Another point is that Loki, despite the average character Thor, feels like a great villain for this group of heroes' . As to 3D conversion is a medium, are limited in some scenes just send things to people, but the scenes of Iron Man in his suit look great, it looks like these you into it. At the end of The Avengers is an epic film, which now brings together the best of the superhero movies, which is fast and not disappoint the fans of the films of these characters."

","MY TOTALLY ORIGINAL SUGGESTION, is they do a Dr. Strange movie, why not get the rights to that? While it might seem minor, a bit of knowledge of Dr. Strange helped give me a more solid picture of the Marvel universe when the glistening cube was shown ""connecting different parts of the universe"" in this Avengers movie (definitely going to see it a 2nd time TONIGHT, AS SOON AS POSS, at least a 2nd time), Dr. Strange's weird dimensions being that other side of the universe.......especially the early Steve Ditko version, often with Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. as the other half of the comic.......CGI representations of Steve Ditko's surreal intertwinings of dimensions would be fantastic, ESPECIALLY IN 3D!<br/><br/>Otherwise, totally incredible film, loved everything.....couldn't't really fault it. A Hawkeye film would be cool. <br/><br/>By The Crimson Bands of Cytorak, that was a brilliant film, Joss. Wonder if Keanu Reeves would be a good suggestion for a Dr. Strange?"

","PROS: I, too, was piqued by the anticipated team-up between Batguy, Scatguy, Iron Dude, Deep-Driller, Work-the-Shaft Man, Mushroom Maven, and other characters and properties that were interesting until I realized that I had responsibilities. The best part of the movie was when Batguy or one of those other interchangeable, starry-eyed dolts turned on his magical jet-skis thereby exciting all of the overgrown basement-dwelling bedwetting imbeciles who still subsist entirely on allowance money. Oh, man. You should have seen them. You could smell the Doritos and undigested quesadillas from a mile away.<br/><br/>Oh, and can we have more of AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" during the teasers for each superhero's own movie?

"Morbius_Fitzgerald","1","4","27","22 July 2014"," Disappointment that still catches up with me.
","Anyone that has seen my activity on The Avengers boards know my opinions of the film aren't all that high. To fully explain how disappointed I was, I have written up 4 reviews on IMDb and yet none of them, I feel, have fully captivated what I felt among leaving the theater. I saw IMDb reviews, I saw the ticket line that went out the cinema, through the food court and out the door, I saw the name of a man I idolized creatively tied onto this, Joss Whedon, and I saw that this would be what my childhood went into (because, believe it or not, Marvel, in part, was my childhood). To say I came out disappointed is like saying people got hurt at Hiroshima, understatement of the millennium.<br/><br/>Before I start, I will name some good things about the film. The cinematography did get the lighting and framing right that looks like an actual comic book come to life, the acting, for what they're given, is okay, and for the most part the CGI is actually pretty well done in terms of making things like the Helicarrier, the alien army and The Hulk come to life.<br/><br/>So with that in mind, what would be my complaints? Okay, have you ever seen a Joss Whedon TV show? Then you'll know the formula of ""they argue and a tragedy strikes to make them band together"", have you seen an alien invasion film? Then you'll know the routine of ""the world is in danger, we need the best we can get"". Have you ever seen a comic book film? Then you'll know the routine of ""the hero(es) face a threat, they stop it and yet come out victorious"". I don't know, I was expecting more from this film especially considering at the time I saw it, it had the IMDb rating of 9.1/10.<br/><br/>When it comes to a fun film, of course you don't need to make it dark, serious and as depressing as all hell but when it comes to the greats; Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Die Hard, Batman 1989, Superman 1 and 2, you get the idea, they all had elements that did make people say ""something is at stake"". In Superman 2, we had this all mighty and strong hero reduce himself to a weakling while others who are like him take over the world. In Star Wars (Empire and Return), that film tested the hero morally in the sense that he couldn't kill his own father for obvious reasons but it was brought back with the humor (which, unlike this film, didn't go too overboard). In this film, the only one that dies is someone who is brought back to life later so not only did that rule out the thought of ""there's something at stake"" but it made the motivation for the team to band together, eventually, entirely pointless.<br/><br/>However, I need to address something else, the humor. Oh God, the humor. Now, I'm not against humor in films but this film threw every joke it could in the way of the audience to get any giggle it could but keep in mind the best joke is ""I am a God you dull creature, I will not be bullied by-"" *beats the crap out of him*. That joke got an applause in the theater I was in, that gives you an idea of what the humor of this film is like.<br/><br/>Another problem is that Loki is too weak to be matched with The Avengers, sure, he has his army but before they invaded he was beaten in combat 3 times, once in an earlier film. Not exactly feeling the weight of him as a villain if the heroes have demonstrated that they can defeat him at every turn they've encountered him! Oh and Thor is in this film, if you remember the first film you'll see that the only means of teleportation between worlds was destroyed, they made a sequel to Thor and do they explain in the sequel or this film how he managed to get back to earth for the events in The Avengers? Establishment, whats that?<br/><br/>Essentially, the major problem with this film is that it plays way too safely and its predictable. Nothing happens in this film that makes you feel like ""I care for these characters, I want them to make it out okay"" nor ""this villain is way too powerful for any of them to take on alone, I hope they make it out okay"". If you want your audience member to be invested, you NEED these things to be going through the mind of the viewer. This is not on the basis of a Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders or Stanley Kubrick film, this is on the basis of Star Wars, Superman 1 and 2, Die Hard etc. Basic films that had these elements in them that made them classics.<br/><br/>Overall, I have bitched and moaned about this film for ages but nothing can really capture how disappointed I was with this film. It basically turned me into a cynical bastard that was aware of all the tricks and manipulative tools used to make this film have so much hype. To be fair, it could be okay for any die hard comic book fan but for those that expect this to be anything more than ""another comic book film"" or ""another Joss Whedon film"" or ""another blockbuster""...you're better off not seeing this."

","Earth's mightiest heroes gather together to fight Loki and an invading alien horde in the payoff to one of the most ambitious cinematic concepts ever, that of a shared universe between multiple films with different characters and stories. My initial reaction when I first saw Avengers three years ago was that I liked it a lot but thought it didn't quite live up to the hype. I saw it again a month later and had an even less favorable opinion, focusing more on the flaws that time around and strictly comparing it to what I considered the truly classic comic book movies. Now that I've seen it with fresh eyes after a few years and several more Marvel films (including the sequel to this one), I can say that all of the hype did influence my first opinion of it. It's hard to dispute now that it is a terrific movie that was probably the best Marvel had put out at that point.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon does a fantastic job directing and handling the grand scope of it all. His script is smart, funny, and impressively services all the different characters well. He even improves upon some of them from their previous characterizations, particularly Black Widow. Here we get a vast improvement over her depiction in Iron Man 2. Whedon really gives Scarlett Johansson a chance to shine and prove her character deserves to stand alongside the 'big leaguers' in the group. Mark Ruffalo replaces Ed Norton as Bruce Banner and, at the time, I wasn't crazy about this. I liked Norton in his Hulk movie but I think it turned out to be a good change. Ruffalo brings something different to the role. I'm not sure how Norton could have fit in with this cast or especially how his interactions with Johansson would have been different. Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Robert Downey, Jr. are all perfect. Jeremy Renner is arguably the weakest link in the cast but that's largely because he isn't given as much to work with as the others. The special effects are great, except for a couple of iffy spots in the climactic battle against the Chitauri. Also, Captain America's costume was clearly still a work in progress. The blank back where a star should be just makes it seem like incomplete. That's a minor quibble, though.<br/><br/>It's not flawless but it's damned entertaining. The action scenes, particularly the fights, are exciting and spectacular. I can't imagine any fan of the comics or the movies being disappointed by them. There's something electric about seeing the characters from the prior movies come together and interact. The little kid in me who was once satisfied to see a shoddy version of Thor appear on TV with Lou Ferrigno's Hulk would never have thought he'd see something like this on the big screen in his lifetime. Seeing these characters hanging out and fighting with and alongside each other is a dream come true for any longtime Marvel fan. Whatever else happens with this shared universe, whether Marvel ever tops this film or not, I'll always cherish the movie just for that."

","When this movie was first about to hit theatres, I won tickets to go to see the advance preview. Unfortunately/fortunately, I choose the latter, I was not able to attend as I wasn't in the region of the preview at the time....THANK GOD! because if I had had a whole days sleep, woke up and attended this movie I still would have fallen asleep watching this drivel. I have attempted, and I emphasis the word attempted, to watch this movie three times before I was able to watch it in full finally after a fourth attempt. I fail to see how this movie scored so damn high....I could literally put a bunch of chimps into a room and they could write a script at the absolute least two times better than this movie. I could also think of more fun activities to do instead of watching this, for example: stabbing two pencils into my eyes and moving them around for the duration of this film....exaggerated....yeah well so is this film and the hype that surrounds it. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate Joss Whedon and his works e.g. Buffy (Brilliant) and Dollhouse (inspired) but this movie was an absolute miss, why people rave and rate this movie good baffles me (I had to say this again because I just can't work it out). No character development, and yes I get that you don't really need that as they all have their own individual movies (so I recommend just watching them) and why put the black widow in here, did she even use powers?? all I saw was her using pistols, was she supposed to appeal and be empowering to the female audience?? cause if so I missed that memo, and the fact that there was so much CGI use they don't need that, they are superheroes for Pete's sake SUPERHEROES! and don't even get me started on the amount of fighting, yay fun, its an action, but some was just pointless, where on earth do I even need to put any thought into this movie let alone see what the heck is going on cause the explosions and gunshots are so distracting, I think I have literally put more thought into writing this review than the amount of thought running through my mind whilst watching this movie. Pretty sure my IQ dropped even knowing about, let alone attempting to watch it this many times. What can I say, I'm a trier. I'm giving this movie a 1/10 I would give it a zero but I felt the scene at the very end of the credits when all the heroes are sitting in the diner with the bored tired looks on their faces depicted exactly how I felt after watching this movie. Plus I can't rate it zero.. Don't watch it, and if you do don't say I didn't try save you 2 hours and 23 minutes of your life."
"DustinRahksi","7","2","10","8 December 2012"," Looking back.
","As far as me liking superhero movies, it's either spider-man or batman, why? Because everything else usually sucks, this film is no exception. I would like to know why they would bring back Loki as the main villain, he is boring, he ain't menacing and overall doesn't offer any thing intriguing. Well, let's think what kind of army Loki will lead, I got it! Generic alien invasion. Where will it take place? why New york of course, oh my. Not to mention the aliens were weak and never poss-ed any threat, besides they are all coming out of a hole in the sky, very easy to concentrate fire for the military, but instead they send four super heroes. And the fact that the government was willing to destroy New york with a tactical nuke within 30 minutes of the invasion, and killing millions of people is absolutely ridiculous. But of course iron-man has got to save the day. You would think all of these superheroes together would be entertaining, and for the most part they are. If you are looking for something refreshing or even remotely smart, you will have to go somewhere else.<br/><br/>The film is genius in the sense of bringing all these heroes together, the more times I watch it, the more I like it. I do have some gripes with it, but overall I hate to admit it has less faults then the dark knight rises, and is better then it to a certain extent. Really, I just like it for Tony Stark, the rest is alright."

Now when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything all that original. A certain team needs to get their act together and not quarrel, bicker and fight amongst each other. In order to fight and win against a battle or a game when the odds are against them. Seem familiar? Because it has been done countless times. But the execution is the most important thing and the execution for the movie is well done and entertaining most of the way through. The final fight at the end is worth the price of admission. However when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything special that makes it stand out. The plot and editing in ""John Carter"" in my opinion is more well done than this in my opinion. But unfortunately ""John Carter"" didn't do so well at all when compared to this movie. Now Josh Whedon did a pretty good job when it comes to the Marvel characters portrayed in this movie and stuck pretty close to the comic book materials. But in the comics although the characters are arrogant there are other elements that turns it away from it being the main focus. For this movie arrogance is the main part of what the characters face and is one of the biggest obstacle in their path. What ""The Avengers"" do is constantly have a penis measuring competition with each other when the world is at stake. Anyways the fighting and action sequences are really entertaining and cool to watch. Some scenes are like superhero smackdown battles so those scenes were entertaining as well, despite it all happening over arrogance and pride. So that is why I give this movie a 7.8/10.<br/><br/>7.8/10"
"mia-manns","6","2","10","14 June 2012"," To be fair...
","If you haven't seen The Avengers yet, you must be completely immune to hype. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder.<br/><br/>But to be fair, it is entertaining and worth the watch, especially if you're interested in witnessing a curious film trend I've been noticing lately that's pretty much formula for The Avengers. The trend is this: the beginning is smart, suspenseful, and witty, with a somewhat interesting story. For the end, you can just turn your brain right off. And people love it.<br/><br/>We start out with characters who have interesting back stories to divulge, some weighty threats and the hilarious jokes you knew would be there the second you found out this would be directed and written by Joss Whedon. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) absolutely rapid-fires the hilarity, as expected, and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a comedic accomplice. Who quickly vanishes from the story. The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) hints at some dark secrets and it's not clear whether Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is a help or a big looming threat of letting loose and tearing everyone to pieces. Actually, if you've ever seen a movie before, it is pretty clear. Captain America (Chris Evans) had some potential because he's from WWII era, but was used mostly for jokes at the expense of his anachronisms; he was frozen for half of the past century so he doesn't really get modern cultural references, technology, etc. I can't stand Thor and I cannot believe what a joke his solo film looked like from the trailer, nor that Natalie Portman would get herself mixed up in that mess, but maybe that's just me. But the other Avengers are interesting and well- written. For the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>What bothered many critics wasn't even a concern to me. In a search for something to be nit-picky about, lots of critics have complained that there was too much in-fighting between the heroes, who were clearly being manipulated to turn against one another by evil-mastermind Loki. However, this didn't take up much screen-time and was done in a well-written and believable way. I thought what they were bickering about was kind of reasonable. I would be a little upset too if my boss lied to me about developing nuclear weapons of mass destruction.<br/><br/>I was led to believe that half of the movie would be the Avengers fighting each other (and when you say fighting with relation to Super Heroes, you think actual, physical fighting). Nope, it was just one scene of some very reasonable banter.<br/><br/>Okay there is one fight scene between Thor and Iron Man that went on a little while, and I personally can't even keep my eyes open during action scenes with no dialogue, but I felt like it was justified and when you think about it, people want to see Thor go up against Iron Man. Again, not incredibly problematic.<br/><br/>They were right about the enemy not having a very good, strong, reasonable or deep motivation for taking over Earth. This is another reason why I think we were given leave to turn our brains off after half of the movie. At the beginning, it looks like Loki might be a worthy and complex opponent. He has some qualms with the American belief in freedom. Kinda seemed like he was going somewhere with that. But he didn't, which makes it seem like a gimmicky attempt to make this bad guy stand out from Sauron or Darth Vader, which, while one-dimensional, were good villains because they stood for something metaphorical i.e. the dark side of humanity or the Germans in WWII. Loki's just evil for the sake of being evil. But you've already heard that.<br/><br/>The real problem in this movie is that after all that time spent writing up interesting characters and weighty plot points that delve into issues like a possible limitless energy source and the dangers of nuclear war, actually managing to cover new territory on that front, and making a formidable enemy that should require something brilliantly clever to defeat, we get a really long extended fight scene, fixes that aren't believable and border on plot holes, a complete undermining of the big bad guy's abilities, not to mention some predictability. Oh boy, where do I start?<br/><br/>The screenplay must have ended after The Avengers got to Manhattan. I'm gonna guess 2/3 into the screen time. From there on out, it's mostly one-liners. Yawn. I liked the flying things that made me cringe when they flew into the beautiful New York architecture that is now, in that fictional world, gone forever. I didn't like the all-brawn and no brains approach."

","These characters/heroes (Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, etc.) allow the audience to pick and choose their favorite characters as well as identify with certain heroes/villains. What Joss Whedon does a phenomenal job of is the portrayal of most of the heroes' humanity. The constant reminder that, ""they're just like us""; people REALLY enjoy that in a super hero movie. Though many Hollywood movies rely on special effects and CGI, their marketing ""tactics"" are certainly well grounded. People want to sit down with their friends/family/etc., watch a movie, and walk out feeling energized after a stressful day at work or school. Not that thought-provoking movies are ""too much"" for audiences, but sometimes ""reality"" isn't what people want to pay to see. On a more personal note, I really enjoyed Robert Downey Jr.'s witty remarks and character in general, or maybe I am a bit biased since we train under the same Master (Eric Oram)."

","Special effects, action scenes, sound, humor, acting all is great as expected from such blockbusters. However, dare not expect much in the realm of coherence. One can argue that surrealism and fantasy is at the core of the Marvel Comics experience. However, some people expect a degree of reality to mix with the fiction, which is where ""magic"" happens and classics are made. The enemies that the heroes must face look a lot like video game characters, mindlessly going about their do-harm business for no other reason other than that they are ""bad"". The tactics employed by the enemies are laughable and their strategy non existent. One would expect more of these enemies, especially considering that they are supposed to be so technologically advanced. So in my opinion, it deserves a very high 7, because of the way this is presented, and because it can really entertain for one evening. Just don't expect have much to think or talk about afterwards."
"jeremygarlick","3","3","20","9 July 2012"," Vastly overrated here
","It's not really clear to me why this film is so highly rated here. There are only two things to recommend it: spectacular special effects and the acting of Robert Downey Jr and most of the rest of the ensemble, who make the absolute maximum out of the material. All kudos to them for their fine performances.<br/><br/>The main problem for me is with the story, which is absolute dross. What the hell is going on with the flying aircraft carrier, for example? Yeah, it looks great on screen, but in terms of logic there is none. Why are the giant bugs so intent on destroying or dominating Earth? Why are there these Scandinavian demigods running about when everybody knows these belong only to Norse mythology and not to the real world? I could go on but I won't bore all of you who are no doubt going to retort with lengthy explanations of all the ins and outs of the history of the fantasy universe this all arises from. However, viewing this as a stand-alone film, without knowing the extended comic-book background, the events in the film, however exciting, don't make much sense.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I'm not a superhero buff (I admit it, I hate superhero comic books), but seriously none of this guff makes any sense. I'm sure Robert Downey Jr would agree if he wasn't cleverly making a fortune out of the Iron Man franchise. Give me intelligent SF any day."
"Quinoa1984","10","2","12","30 April 2015"," Fun, and great characters and dialog first and foremost
","Any comic book movie - worth its salt far as budgets go - can give us terrific action with mind-blowing CGI and special effects. Marvel's The Avengers, the culmination of the work of five movies (one of them a sequel to the first, Iron Man), is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes Captain America, Incredible Hulk, Thor and Tony Stark (plus relative newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye, with Nick Fury and Agent Colson in the wings), and if you want to get your money shots, Joss Whedon doesn't skimp out. But the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn't just for name cachet (though it probably helped).<br/><br/>What Whedon's done over much of his career in TV and other films and webseries (Buffy, Firefly, Dr. Horrible, Angel, etc) was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical, supernatural, other-worldly/alien forces, but making it always about stakes, humor, horror, drama and solid conflicts. Villains don't just act nasty, they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do, and if they're not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters, full of the stuff that makes them great to watch, especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone (i.e. the Mayor on Buffy, for those that recall).<br/><br/>So here we get Loki, previously a villain in Thor (and later sort of brought back for Thor 2), and is by far the highlight of the film as Tom Hiddleston chews up scenery, but does it in a kind of elegant, theatrical, relishing way. By the time he spews out 'Muelling quim"", you're on the edge of your seat. His performance, what he does with every moment of screen time, is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky. And yet his ego and petty-mindedness does him in, and Whedon has a lot of fun writing this character, making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances.<br/><br/>This is one of the best of the Marvel films just by the way that Whedon goes about the sort of 'Ghostbusters/Ninja Turtles' formula - the four main players, each distinct, playing off one another, but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that. Along with Hiddleston, Downey once again makes Tony Stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters. And Johansson actually has a few really great scenes - Whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other ""complex"" male characters to shame - and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on, she stands out, especially Widow's scene with Loki. Ruffalo, too, does a lot with a little... until he gets to the ""other guy"".<br/><br/>I don't know if Avengers is great art, but it does what I want to see when I go to big giant behemoth-like spectacles: provide me a host of characters who have to work together, and gives them interesting, entertaining and believable things to say. At 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well - not too fast, not too slow, nothing drags here, and that counts as well. Along with the first Iron Man and the recent Marvel Netflix show Daredevil, this is the MCU at the top of their game."

"TheMovieDoctorful","3","1","4","4 November 2018"," Yawn
","Sometimes I think that the MCU is the worst thing to happen to comic book films. That's not to say that a majority of their films are bad, but the MCU as a franchise has turned comic book movies into something more corporate as a whole. Something more cynical and bland. That's not to say that the DCEU is any better (Though, they arguably were up until Justice League ruined everything), but the MCU as a whole has grown to represent the reinvention of superhero films as a product. Joss Whedon's The Avengers is perhaps one of its more hollow examples.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm missing the point. Maybe Joss Whedon's Avengers as a concept is more about the novelty, the extravaganza and the size of the event than it is about the filmmaking. Many defenders of the film will assert this and they aren't necessarily wrong. There is an undeniable appeal to watching such a massive scale crossover event between our favorite Marvel superheroes after years of solo outings. The first shot of The Avengers back to back as a Chiutari invasion closes in on them is quite a memorable one and touched me in all the right fanboy spots. That being said, with The Avengers being such a hyped up and ambitious film, I had my expectations set rather high. I wanted this film to be great more than anything, but in the end, it just let me feeling empty and unsatisfied.<br/><br/>The musical score is certainly a major highlight. Alan Silvestri's score is one of the most rousing, uplifting and exciting in Hollywood blockbuster history and if anything comes close to delivering the epic feel that this movie is so obviously going for, it's his music. It's catchy, it's triumphant and it stands head and shoulders above more than half of the forgettable orchestral scores used in these kinds of films.<br/><br/>The performances are fine. There isn't a single miscast here, as these actors have more than proven in their solo outings. The problem is that the film gives them absolutely nothing memorable to do. There are no small acting choices that really stuck with me, no moments that really challenge their skills as performers...There are quotable lines, sure (Most of which extend to trailer talk), but very few genuine character moments apart from some new quips. Some characters get far more focus than others (Thor and Captain America have no purpose here) and the only one who gets anything in the way of any real character development is Iron Man. Nobody else goes through any kind of genuine arc in this film at all. Nobody has grown or changed throughout the course of the film outside of Stark, who grows to become more of a team player. Everyone else on the team merely comes together out of necessity to save the world.<br/><br/>This brings me to another massive problem with the film; specifically, the chemistry between the team's heroes. There is none. The Avengers spend over 2 thirds of the entire movie arguing amongst themselves like children over the most childish reasons imaginable. Of course, because that's what I've waited 4 years and 5 movies to see; the world's greatest superheroes engaged in a perpetual pissing contest because they don't like each other's attitudes. God forbid we actually try and develop any kind of bond of chemistry between the team members. Many may point to Coulson's death as a justifiable rallying cry to bring the team together, but Coulson's relationship with the heroes isn't nearly as strong or developed enough to make me invested in their change of heart. So most of the film is just The World's Mightiest Heroes Fighting Like 12 Year Olds. How epic.<br/><br/>Loki is a joke in this film. While there have definitely been worse villains in the MCU, Loki is still a nonsensical, inconsistent and poorly written character. We follow him after the events of Thor where he's trying to take over the Earth as fascist dictator, with the help of a Chiutari army granted to him by Thanos. His motivations had nothing to do with fascism or personal ambition in Thor, but apparently, touching on his personal need for validation and unconditional love that was established in that film was too difficult a task for Whedon to deliver on. Instead, he's a generic, one dimensional bad guy who says nasty sexist things to cheaply make the audience hate him easier. Do I really need to mention the cringeworthy and emotionally manipulative scene in Germany where a Nazi regime survivor stands up to Loki in order to make a hamfisted and boneheaded allegory to Hitler? If you're going to reference that dark, horrifying period in world history, you need to earn that moment tonally, narratively and emotionally. The Avengers doesn't even attempt to earn such a scene and Loki's similarities to Hitler pretty much start and stop at ""He's a dictator who thinks others are lesser than him.""<br/><br/>I'm really not trying to rain on anyone's parade. Most of my friends love this film and I can definitely see why. The ambition of the concept and grandness of the production definitely lend itself to some praise. For me, however, as someone who was deeply excited for this film, it really falls short. Furthermore, I think that it's had a very negative affect on the more streamlined style of Hollywood blockbusters today. Nearly every insufferable and boring cliche I've found in them can be traced back to this one. The film went for a circus show when it should have gone for an epic and that really saddens me."

","Having watched this at least a dozen times now, I can honestly say it's one of my all-time favourites. It's a perfect example of recent Marvel films; corny as ever, full of great one-liners and epic fight scenes. Mark Ruffalo is hands-down my favorite Bruce Banner, it's a tough line-up to pick from but he's also my favorite actor in Avengers also. My only disappointment about this Hulk is that each hit he takes doesn't cause him to grow even bigger & stronger, it was one of the best parts about Eric Bana's Hulk that left you wondering if there was any limit to the Hulk's power and abilities. On the other hand, the animation is absolutely flawless, there are a number of truly surreal moments because of this. Most notably, the free-roaming camera shot that follows the final battle throughout the city, moving from one fight to the next each time heroes cross paths. This is set to be a blockbuster classic for years to come."

Thor is annoying and Scarlett Johansson is as flat as ever--being ""eye candy"" pays her bills. Also, even granting the comic book nature of this film, Samuel Jackson was clearly just picking up a paycheck, since I've never seem him so lifeless and unconvincing.<br/><br/>This movie is pure sugar with no redeeming nutritional value, but as a guilty pleasure it succeeds well, although too much of this stuff would personally make me nauseous."

It has a rather dark finish to it, maybe it is the new thing after the dark knight that it has to have a bit of a gloomy and dark feel, I am not especially fond of it for this film, since they are all dressed in bright colored costumes and are a more fun loving crowd then the big black bat.<br/><br/>This is definitely entertaining and delivers a solid action packed adventure, with plenty of effects, smart replies, blasting sound and great characters."

I was so happy to see this film come to life and for Marvel to be able to pull off something as grandiose as this movie. And then when the movie came out, it was awesome! Amazing! Over the top--one of the best action movies ever made!<br/><br/>And I still feel that way. ""The Avengers"" rocks. It really is a superb film. The action was great. The characters were great. The story was great. Everything was great.<br/><br/>But now, fast forward three years, and I've watched all the Marvel movies numerous times, and there are other MCU movies that have been made since then, too. And so I sat down to watch ""The Avengers"" again the other night....and.....well........I guess familiarity breeds contempt?<br/><br/>The movie is still great, but I suppose that after several viewings it gets sort of repetitious and you see the imperfections a bit more. Hemsworth is not up to the standard he set for himself in ""Thor"", for example; or the contrived notion of Coulson's death pulling the team together. The latter is probably the worst facet of the film.<br/><br/>Still, ""The Avengers"" is great. One of the best comic book movies ever made, for sure.

"GeorgeRoots","7","1","4","1 November 2014"," Marvel's Approach To ""The Avengers"" Is A Great Payoff, But There's Still A Lot Left To Be Desired.
","And so, here we are with ""The Avengers"". Back in the 1990's Marvel was filing for bankruptcy leading Stan ""The Man"" Lee, to sell the film rights to many of their characters. The only rights they have left is ""The Avengers"", and explains why they've had to dig into their more obscure past to turn other franchises into movie productions (Namely 2014's fantastic ""Guardians of the Galaxy""). Still, I love the approach they took towards building their big team movie. By establishing this ensemble cast in their own features starting with ""Iron Man"" (2008), the following five years lead to a bunch of movies that have many highs and lows leading us all to this point. The results are a success, but also far from flawless.<br/><br/>Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of the peacekeeping organisation S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). To form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from subjugating Earth, and a much larger looming threat.<br/><br/>Knowing that Joss Whedon was going to be writing and directing this, I could already see what directions this movie was going in. Whedon has a rare quirk in his writing that really allows characters to bounce off each other effortlessly, but the directing in some areas always feels stiff to me. I look back to his previous outings as a director, and could easily say that ""The Avengers"" have the exact same chemistry as the characters of Whedon's ""Firefly"". Still it feels like he has mastered the way he likes to approach his material, and there's enough to carry its lengthy 2 hour 20 minute running time.<br/><br/>Every actor does solid work, and the ""culmination"" of these characters from their respected features feels effortless. I want to give Mark Ruffalo and the FX crew particular praise for finally bringing out the Hulk's familiar traits that have felt absent for so long, but I also wish that the character had felt more uncontrollable like in its comic book counterpart (Where they trick him into fighting specific people). I also find myself very underwhelmed when using Loki as a villain. Tom Hiddleston is a fine performer and the role has garnered him hundreds of many fans, but by the third act he's rarely a threat anymore and even then the payoff feels like I said: ""underwhelming"". Saying that, many villains appear throughout the movie that are sure to please the die-hard fans, and promise that the situations will escalate in the inevitable future sequels.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: When all is said and done, the dialogue and chemistry works, the scenarios range from great to average and enough substance is here to promise more to come from Marvel's ""Phase 2"" of movies (And the upcoming sequel ""Age of Ultron""). It's a Hollywood blockbuster for all ages, and a damn fine one at that. 7.5/10."

Collectively the super heroes are called the Avengers; Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Iron Man is played by Robert Downey Jr. who is a boy genius playboy until he's wearing his super-robotic--suit and fighting crime. Thor is played by Chris Hems worth a demigod, protector of the 9 realms, with the mighty and powerful hammer. Captain America is played by Chris Evans, the first super hero that was known to man; has great strength and a powerful and authoritative shield. The Hulk is played by Mark Buffalo who is a mild-mannered bright scientist that specializes in gamma radiation until he gets angry; and then he expands into a green muscle creature that smashes anything in its path. Then there's Natasha or better known as the Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson; specializes in spy stuff and mind tricks. Finally Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner carries a bow and arrows demanding respect and justice by using his impeccable shooting skills to take down the aliens. The theme of the movie hovers around separate egotistical super heroes that mature, bond together to form a family called The Avengers to stop an alien invasion for world dominance; the whole theory of leaving playboy-party-puberty time and becoming an adult with high morals. The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division or S.H.I.E.L.D. is an international peace keeping agency; has located the mysterious Tesseract device and the Army's super soldier Captain America. The Tesseract is actually a gateway to an entirely new world of the powerful gods called Asguard. When S.H.I.E.l.D. activates and starts recording the Tesseract's energy output; the evil God and brother to Thor known as Loki transports through the Tesseract and enters Earth; immediately assumes that he can rule all human beings.<br/><br/>Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson, the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. takes this thievery of Loki as a terrorist act on Earth; starts to form a highly decorated task force, The Avengers; motivates them to use their combined skills to stop Loki and lizard- looking- mindless-army.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie, leaving playboy-party-puberty time behind and becoming an adult with high morals, is a theme that has been used through movies for decades. The most famous movie that comes to my mind immediately is the movie Star Wars part 4, The New Hope. Luke Skywalker starts off as an unsure, mischief-trouble- finding, no direction young adult to a mature, self-controlled, high morals, team player to defeat evil. <br/><br/>The use of special sound effects when the super heroes are in action just grab your attention, pull you to the edge of your set, and personally made me feel like I just pummeled my arch-enemy and showed him how an insignificant little wimpy of a boy that he truly is. <br/><br/>The special technique to be able to actually write, direct, and tie all the Marvel Hero movies together to enable the viewer have such feeling and meaning of freedom, comradery, and defeating evil.<br/><br/>The Avengers movie is a classic good defeats evil, action adventure, adrenaline-rush feel good movie. After watching this movie you feel the sense of happiness and calming effect that there are higher more powerful beings that will protect you at all costs."

","(69%) All that build up from all those already very big movies was about worth it as this is quite an accomplishment to not only bring together all those superheroes, but also to give them each an pretty equal share of screen time and importance. The script works well despite the plot being very big budget Hollywood, and it has some nice funny touches here and there. The final battle in New York (where was Spider-man when all this was going on?) is very well developed that sticks to the equal share of each character very well and gives a good portion of what the audience want to see (action mayhem). This is without doubt one of the better superhero movies ever, and one of the best Marvel movies to date. Roll on the next mammoth."

","The Avengers, a movie based on very popular Superhero comic book characters. The key word being ""Comic Book"".<br/><br/>This movie hits the nail perfectly for every comic book fan & Superhero Fan in existence. I mean you have Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America & Thor all brought to the Life in vivid explicit detail. <br/><br/>Personally, I'm a comic book reader (an avid reader actually) & I never in my wildest dreams thought something like this would be made. A lot of comic book adaptations kinda miss their mark completely- they end up being totally revamped or ""matured"" (I hope you understand what I mean by this- sometimes it works like in the Dark Knight) but thank Goodness! This movie is straight up for the fans. What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>I tell you seeing the Hulk actually being the Hulk & watching a comic book movie actually delivering the action just like a comic & even better- is truly a rare thing indeed. Especially for these type of comic books.<br/><br/>One other important thing ... if you don't know who Bruce Banner is or the name Tony Stark & perhaps have never heard of MARVEL... Please, don't even bother. This movie will just be another Popcorn flick for you or worse... (the stuff happening in this movie will just fly straight over your head & you won't even begin to understand what's going on)"
"CMTiago","10","1","4","5 July 2014"," Ultimate superhero movie
","There have been many superhero movies that I have massively enjoyed like Spider-Man and the much praised X-Men 2. While I do get that some people consider X-Men 2, or even Spider-Man 2 as the best examples of a superhero movie done right, one cannot ignore the sheer magnitude of The Avengers project. With the set-up beginning in 2008 with Iron Man and ending with Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), fans had been waiting anxiously for the result and I for one loved it. The plot revolves around the threat that Loki poses as he hopes to conquer earth with a feared army of advanced alien beings that will be transported to our planet through the energy source known as the Tesseract. In this dire situation, Nick Fury will look to assemble a group of remarkable people that will be known as The Avengers.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is wonderfully done as it takes about 30 minutes to introduce the characters in the movie. From then on, the perils outside but also within the group's personality will create the conflict the film needs. The choice of going with Joss Whedon as the director and co-writer was definitely a wise one, as he supplies us with his sharp vision of the story and characters, but also his dynamic and funny dialog. Everyone of the performances were great with everyone having their time in the spotlight, at least in my view. The effects are of course very well put within the film and only add to its spectacle.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, it may take a long time for me to get sick of this movie, and even then that's a remote possibility. With it's spot safely secured within my Top 20, its unlikely I'll ever watch a film like The Avengers. I just hope the sequel can deliver as much as this, and perhaps something even more unexpected.<br/><br/>Rating 9,5/10"

","But then again anything with Robert Downey Jr. in it is Simply Awesome!! I am also now interested in Thor. My title pretty much sums up what I think of this movie! I will gladly watch another one, if I can find out if another one is being made or not?<br/><br/>I'm going to watch it again on Netflix. I would like to know if this is the only one out there? The avengers and if there is going to be another The Avengers, as well. I will watch that one too! Normally, my genre of movies is Paranormal, Syfy or Stephen king related, but this works for me, as well. I will now look into action films, as being my second favourite Genre of movies and television!..;)"
"RossRivero99","10","1","4","14 June 2014"," Best of the MARVEL film series
","Joss Whedon's The Avengers is truly one of the best action moves along with a perfect cast for an action picture of which that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Scarlet Johannson. With great action sequences, costumes, and special effects, this movie was one of the most groundbreaking visual achievements of 2012. The movie also goes on a par with great MARVEL films such as the Iron Man trilogy, Spider Man's 1 & 2, X-Men, The Incredible Hulk, Ghost Rider, Captain America's 1 & 2 and more. Not only this was a great movie it was also one of the best movies of 2012 because of how well this movie was done."
"rathertfamily","9","1","4","2 June 2014"," Avengers is awesome!
","Marvel's The Avengers is a fantastic movie! Director Josh Wheldon did a fantastic job creating this movie. I highly recommend it to watch, but beware to those with young children...this movie should hold true to the PG-13 rating it was given. There is some language and intense battle scenes. But the overall message is great you have to come together to conquer evil. This movie gets that message across in a unique way of pulling together the world's best superheroes: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. All the characters have been previously developed through other Marvel movies, which will help your understanding of this movie a lot more if you watch them in advance. Also, it never fails to amaze me how Marvel always manages to work in the cameo appearance of their founder and comic book writer, Stan Lee. I look for him in ever Marvel movie now. The overall basis of the movie is that Loki, Thor's not so nice little brother, is trying to take by the Tesseract, a blue cube that is an energy source and can connect multiple worlds. SHIELD, led by Nick Fury, pulls together the best superheroes to protect all people from Loki. Through a complicated, but well scripted and funny plot, the movie ends in a huge battle. Which you'll have to watch the movie to see how that goes... It really is a great movie with a well planned out cast and an amazing script. One of my favorite quotes is ""There is only one God, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that"", said by Captain America. SO surprising that modern Hollywood will still say something towards Christianity; it was refreshing. Overall an amazing way to kill a couple of hours! I recommend it to anyone who likes action with a side of comedy."
"Sherazade","10","1","4","1 June 2014"," As close as we'll ever get to perfection
","I challenge anyone who did not or does not think this was a 10/10 film to make a better version. People, especially picky ones just like to nitpick for the sake of doing so. When I saw this film, I did not even go in expecting to be blown away or anything but that happened any way and so much more. Marvel's 'Avengers Assemble' was such and ambitious project because they were tasked with not only bringing together some of the greatest superheroes every written but also making it work. Each one of these heroes (Thor, captain America, Iron man, Black widow, Hawk eye, The hulk) can helm and deliver their own action packed titular vehicle in their own right, so taming the egos (which did flare up during the course of the film) long enough to get the job done was also a commendable task that was accomplished here as was the amazing chemistry shared among all the cast members. Centering the main plot around the alien force of energy known as 'the tesseract' (which has been a subject in other Marvel flicks) was also brilliant. The sub-plots of Natasha's skill set, Loki playing up the hulk and Nick Fury and the S.H.I.E.L.D's insidious agenda for regaining 'the tesseract' were also spot on. Iron man/Tony Stark's amazing one-liners had me in stitches, he was even funnier here than he is in his own movies."
"LokiLg","10","1","4","10 May 2014"," It's a superhero movie what should I say more, one of the best that is!
","This is single-handedly one of the best, if not the best, superhero movies in history. Not just by the shear story and acting but by so many actors (most of them very good ones in general) who play those characters so great. They are specifically cast to be those characters which we can really see. Movie, of course as any other, has its' quirks and mistakes but to a true fan of Sci-Fi in general especially to the Marvel fans this will be in their top 5 movies list. This movie isn't piece of film art but it is not intended to be either and this review is written from that perspective. Acting is really good and one of the main reasons is that almost all actors already had their movies or were part in Marvel movie so they are used to Marvel universe. Another reason is that all actors are really good and are getting along really well. Special effects are also amazing and they have enormous contact with environment and it is hard to distinguish is it really happening or not. SFX are going to draw you even more into the movie. I watched it hundred times and I can't get enough. I recommend it to anyone who likes genres like this and to ones who just want to have plain old fun!"
"Cs_The_Moment","10","1","4","12 April 2014"," Fast Paced With an Incredible Cast
","The Avengers is an action-packed, superhero-filled film that focuses on the peace-keeping S.H.I.E.L.D agency, bringing together Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to create the Avengers. When Earth is threatened by Thor's brother Loki the Avengers must unite to save the planet from catastrophe. <br/><br/>Full of impressive visuals and action in nearly every scene, this film is fast paced and exciting throughout with plenty to keep you guessing. The final battle is epic in every sense: impressive CGI mixes with the New York skyline as the Avengers lead the fight against evil in a thrilling chase across the city. The story itself pulls in elements from each of the individual Avenger's stories, in particular Iron Man (2008), Thor (2011) and Captain America (2011) (I may be slightly biased in saying this as they are my favourite Avengers so I notice the references more) and I'd highly recommend watching the individual films, although they are not a necessary prerequisite. <br/><br/>The casting is first class. Each character is a contrast to the next; Downey Jr as the egotistical genius Iron Man; Evans as the charming and heroic old-fashioned Captain America; Hemsworth as the tough, brave demi-god Thor; Johansson as the smart, feisty Black Widow; Ruffalo as the quiet but unstoppable Hulk; and Renner as the quick, deadly Hawkeye. What really makes this story is how all of these characters learn to use each other's strengths as the plot unfolds, and each is as important to the team as the next when it comes to the crunch. Tom Hiddleston is deviously wicked as Loki, delivering an impressively smooth and convincing performance as the enemy of the story. Samuel L Jackson brings his usual mysterious Nick Fury, providing many unexpected laughs from the delivery of his character's one-liners. Fans of other Marvel work will recognise supporting characters played by the likes of Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgard and Gwyneth Paltrow.<br/><br/>Avengers Assemble is yet another example of the great work that Marvel can produce, with a fast paced and exciting story that encompasses their best characters. Definitely one to watch, and if you haven't already seen some of the individual character's films this film will probably make you want more! There's only one question that plagues me when I watch this film: would I want to be saved from near death by Iron Man or Captain America? Having seen the incredible new Captain America: The Winter Soldier recently (which I can't recommend highly enough) I'm going with the Captain for now!"
"Milo_Milosovic","7","1","4","7 April 2014"," Avengers Assemble
","Well-drawn characters, beautifully shot and fine set-pieces. Anyway, that's enough about The Artist now onto Avengers Assemble. I'm going to start by telling you I should have liked this. I like a good leave brain-at-the-door, popcorn stuffing uber romp as much as the next person. Having grown up reading Marvel comics I have a bit of a soft spot for The Avengers. I should have liked this... a lot. But... but... but.....<br/><br/>For the uninitiated here's the plot: one-eyed Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (don't ask it gets sillier) assembles a team of disparate superheroes to save the planet from the pan-dimensional pantomime baddie Loki and his army of marauding alien invaders. Yes! Together at last! Mister Blonde, Mister Angry, Mister Smug, Mister Boring, Mister Forgettable and Little Miss Lycra gang up to punch CGI aliens repeatedly in the face whilst Tom Hiddlestone does his best Shere Khan impersonation. Flying battleships? Collapsing buildings? Alien invasion? Rock 'em sock 'em punch ups? Snappy dialogue? Scarlett Johansson in Lycra? Sounds good doesn't it? Well....<br/><br/>Robert Downey Junior does his smart-talking smug thing again. Chris Hemsworth does his blonde bombshell anachronistic demi-God thing again. That dull bloke is that dull Captain America again. The Hulk bounces around in unconvincing CGI destructo mode again. Scarlett Johansson does her pouty, spandexy ass kicking thing again. Again and again and again. You get my point. It's all more of the same. Except multiplied. A running, jumping, punching, flying, exploding, CGI extravaganza. All sound and (Nick) fury but signifying nothing other than an, admittedly, smart director helming some famous faces in front of green screen while a legion of CGI artists beaver away at the rendering. Is this movie making or games design? There are plus points. There is at least an attempt at some character development. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner has a good line of banter with Tony Stark/ Iron Man. There are some decent gags. Tom Hiddleston is enjoying himself being archly camp as the baddie. But, it's just not enough. As once again the whole thing collapses under the weight of more CGI aliens. Let's be honest I went in with the biggest bag of pop-corn. Brain checked in at the door. Expecting to be entertained. I guess I was but to be honest I don't really remember much as I my primary register was... deep breath... boredom.<br/><br/>Now before I get kicked to death by hordes of Marvel fan-people (look how PC am I?) None of this is the fault of the film. The 13 year old me (whilst being grumpy with the portrayal of Hawkeye) would probably have thought all his Christmases had come at once. Yet, Avengers Assemble has left me teetering on the edge of an existential crisis: I'm just too old for this s**t."
"kanyst","10","1","4","30 March 2014"," Great Movie
","The Avengers is one of the best action films that I have ever seen. The idea that some of the great Marvel superhero to fight together against evil, I seemed brilliant since I heard of it. Interesting effects, very well located, a perfect combination and as a bonus, very realistic. The action is great, all fighting united against the ultimate evil, Loki. Although I wanted to see someone else in the role of antagonist. Besides that we have some superb action film contains some scenes with some humor in it, which brings a +. The locations chosen for the film are absolutely wonderful, idea of movie is great, the whole movie is amazing. Overall, I think that it is a great film that I highly recommend."
"Buddy-51","7","1","4","28 March 2014"," Top-notch action movie extravaganza
","In Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers,"" three Marvel Comics superheroes - Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) - are recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to do battle against Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has come to Earth with an alien army to claim the world for his own. But can three such distinctly talented yet strong-willed individuals put aside their differences and egos long enough to function as a team - as the Avengers - to save the planet? <br/><br/>There's no question that gathering three classic superheroes into a single film was a stroke of marketing genius, as well as a considerable treat for fans. The movie itself is lively, loud, and epic in scale with just enough character delineation to keep us engaged on a human level. Plus, it culminates in a spectacular jamboree of destruction in New York City that turns into a veritable Valhalla for CGI aficionados.<br/><br/>All the above-mentioned actors enter into the spirit of the enterprise, as do Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Powers Boothe, Jenny Agutter, and Harry Dean Stanton as the pure humans in the cast.<br/><br/>Good fun."

When the camera focuses inside Iron Man's helmet, the real percentage of ""475"" can be seen. It appears to the left of the screen, close to Tony Stark's and destroys the forest but when they come on board the floating ship and discuss the coming together with loki messing with everybody head of the ship comes under attack
In Norse mythology, Thor's father Odin had two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who would bring Odin information from Midgard (Earth). (This film repeats During the scene where the Avengers are discussing Loki and his scepter can control anyone he likes with as its the soul stone
Loki brings the Chitauri alien race to Earth to help him invade it. The Avengers are formed to prevent this from occurring. As it was a dream so Fury says of coulsen This is in keeping with the first issue of their self-titled comic book series, in which Loki is responsible for manipulating a chain of disasters that bring The Avengers together in the first place plus destroying new York with the team slowly coming together with speactular alien attacks loki attacking hq. Hawkeye and blackwidow and the avengers theme playing as the Hulk does smashing good and the captain trying to convince locals he is a good guy
And iron man suits count is up to, 8<br/><br/>: The Mark VI is an upgrade of the Mark IV, and the first to sport a triangular chest piece containing the new vibranium-powered Arc Reactor. This suit offers an all-around upgrade to the flight and weapons systems, including mini wrist-rockets and a palladium-powered laser system on the back of each hand that cuts through anything like a hot knife through butter. The Mark VI is the first to withstand submersion in water, but was, once again, ultimately destroyed in the Mandarin's attack.: Like the Mk V, this armor does not require a gantry system to apply, instead using lasers that identify and couple with totes adorbs wristlets worn by Tony, initiating a similar auto-equip function as seen in The Avengers when Loki throws Tony out of his own building. It has additional thrusters on the back, calves, feet, chest, knees, and toes (knees and toes). It's equipped with 90+ high-explosive micromissiles, two tri-barreled laser modules, an anti-armor missile, and upgraded plasma chargers, which increase repulsor rates.<br/><br/>
then the attack of New York is amazing as there is so much battles going on that action going on with all the superheroes doing there thing is epic the evolution of iron man suit is great to watch one hell of a great film cant wait for the follow up stories wait till a few minutes to see the credit roll and see the twist epic film"

Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character despite the big cast. It's good that we get to see our favorite heroes Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and Hulk all join forces to defeat evil. Amazing indeed! <br/><br/>Joss Whedon's film is about how our favorite heroes form an alliance called S.H.I.E.L.D and their mission is to stop Loki, Thor's half-brother from destroying New York City and the rest of the world.<br/><br/>This film boasts an impressive cast indeed. Robert Downey Jr is here and witty as usual. Chris Evans as Capt. America is great and a good leader. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is very good. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was an interesting casting choice but it works out. Tom Hiddleston as Thor is a slimy, sarcastic guy but he makes a great villain. On a side note, one of my favorite scenes involves a confrontation between Loki and Hulk.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one amazing superhero movie! It's funny, action-packed, and emotional. The final 45 minutes is just great with all the action scenes. This movie is essentially Transformers but with a better story. This movie has me waiting for the sequel and subsequent spin-offs. A word to DC fans who hate this film just because it's from Marvel: It's a great film(just like the Batman films.) This is one impressive, action-packed, visually-thrilling, and emotion-provoking film. I rate this film 10/10."

","If you are a fan of The Avengers than you won't be disappointed. This movie is like a sequel for Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk all together. A lot of action, story is quite good, and when I've watched it I was 100% into it, no boring moments in the movie. There was no favoring of heroes, every one of them got their part in the movie, and they all have done a brilliant job. If you've never watched movies with Avengers heroes than you should really start asap. Iron Man movies have started all of this so you should start with that, and enjoy in brilliance of Tony Stark in performance of Robert Downey Jr, which was perfect for the role of Tony Stark, and my personally favorite Avenger. Thor is also incredible, Chris Hemsworth really nailed it, and this movie is like quite important for the story in the Avengers, so you shouldn't been missing this one, and Captain America is just quite interesting 'cause he is actually the first hero of the franchise who even went to fight in the World War II. And naturally, there's no person who doesn't like Hulk, and Mark Ruffalo is the best Hulk so far. I just can't wait for second and third movie, because it's just gonna be better and better. Enjoy!!"

","From the beginning in the movie The Avengers there is an ongoing battle between an agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. and the evil Loki. After taking a staff with an unlimited amount of power called the Tesseract Loki planed on opening a portal to allow aliens to invade earth but the team S.H.I.E.L.D. had other plans and launched project Avengers. Recruiting the Marvel Super Heroes of earth: Iron Man a.k.a. Tony Starks, the Incredible Hulk a.k.a. Dr. Bruce Banner, Thor a.k.a. god of lightning, Captain America a.k.a. Steve Rodgers, Hawkeye a.k.a. Clinton Barton, and Black Widow a.k.a. Natalia Romanova to stop Loki and his alien army from taking over earth and possibly destroying it. I was impressed in how well they did in bringing all the characters together and connecting their story lines one way or another. A good example of how some the characters story line connected in the Avengers is Tony Starks a.k.a. Iron Man's dad was a great scientist/inventor. He was the genius that was able to turn Steve Rodgers into Captain America and giving him his powers by experimenting on him; making him into a great success. Tony knew very well about Captain America because of his dad telling stories about him. Years on down the road a scientist tried to recreate the experiment on Bruce Banner that was done to Steve Rodgers and gave him his powers but it went wrong causing him to change in to the Incredible Hulk When he gets angry. Thor's dad basically adopted Loki when he was a baby making Loki Thor's brothers. Thor was chosen by his dad to be the god of lightning and the protector of earth where all the Avengers live. All the characters had their own individual story line but somewhere in the line they connected to each other some more than others.<br/><br/>The reason the Avengers were brought together was because Loki came through a portal in to the base of S.H.I.E.L.D. to take the powerful Tesseract so they made it their mission to recruit the Avengers to stop him from continuing with his plan. It wasn't easy convincing them but they all had their own motives as to why the thought they should help save the world. They had been keeping up with all the heroes without them know in case of a global emergency like this. Bruce asked Black Widow ""how did you find me?"" and she responded ""we never lost you we have been keeping up with you"". He was not real easy to convince to help but they really need him on their team. Iron man was not very hard to find but he found his own reasons to team up with the Avengers and save the world. After missing out on the first war he fought in Captain America did want to miss out on this battle so he was ready to fight with the team. Thor saw the evil his brother Loki was causing and decided to join the Avengers in a battle against him. That is how the Avengers got brought together after having their story lines cross.<br/><br/>Before all the characters got together to become the Avengers they all had their own movie telling their own story line as to how they got their powers and got where they were. All their story lines crossed each other at some point some more than others but at the end they all got brought together by team S.H.I.E.L.D. The epic battle of having to stop the evil Loki and his alien army from taking over earth is what brought all the heroes together at the end of it all. Even though some of the stories were connecting more than others they all got connected by the battle equally with each character having their own role. The connection between the characters was well plotted out in this movie."

","The Avengers delivers on being a great superhero movie with quality special effects and an entertaining plot while also making the audience laugh throughout the entire movie. The opening scene causes suspense with a very dark scene of Loki being given his scepter by his master. It also shows their creepy looking army and their goal of capturing the Tesseract, a cube of great power. The line of ""What can the humans do but burn"" foreshadows that they are going attack the humans. Loki uses his scepter and the power of the Tesseract to teleport from Asgard to Earth. He then steals the Tesseract from the humans. This causes the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, to call together all of the world's superheroes. These heroes are Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye, Thor, and Black Widow and they try to stop Loki and his Chitauri army from taking over the world while also dealing with internal conflicts between heroes. The introduction of the Avengers is very well done because they show each one being recruited back into the Avengers. They do a great job of incorporating the backstories of each one by referencing their individual movies. The dialogue is used to explain each hero's background to the audience so it would appeal to everyone and not just hardcore comic and superhero fans. Flashbacks are used to explain some details of the past histories of the characters. Loki and Captain America both have flashbacks and Captain America's shows his past experience with the Tesserract. The special effects are used to make the sci-fi parts of the movie seem possible. The blue cube of the Tesseract is beautifully created with blue swirls inside of it. The transformation of Bruce Banner into the Hulk is very well done with him going mad and then slowly growing into the Hulk and the Hulk looks giant, ripped and very green when he is smashing everything. The futuristic looking ships and aircraft are made to look very complex by having very detailed electronic and mechanical parts and the helicarrier is a great example because it is an aircraft carrier that turns into a flying helicopter ship with four giant engines. The movie also includes plenty of comic relief. Phil Coulson is asking Captain America if he will sign his vintage collection of Captain America cards every time he sees him. There is a great moment when one of the workers on the helicarrier is playing galaga instead of working and Tony Stark calls him out for it. The constant references of modern things, like Stephen Hawking, made to Captain America are funny because he doesn't understand any of them. Some of the most memorable moments are comic relief moments with Captain America ordering Hulk to smash before the final battle and when Loki gives his little speech to the Hulk and then the Hulk picks him up and smashes him into the ground multiple times. The Avengers shows that superhero movies can also be funny."

","This was not a standalone film. This was the culmination of 5 excellent superhero films in their own right. The build up was cleverly done, with small bits and pieces here and there involving Nick Fury, agent Coulson etc. <br/><br/>For people who had seen the other films, no character intro was needed, but there was still easily enough development within the film itself for newcomers to get to know each character enough to see their importance in the team. <br/><br/>The story was good, with all actors involved putting in fantastic performances. Mark Ruffalo was an excellent new Hulk. Even the smaller characters, such as Coulson, were put forward well, for example in Coulson's case development through the previous films, culminating in his very emotional death (or not Agents of Shield!). <br/><br/>I was amazed at how they managed to portray all of the main characters individual struggles in such a short space of time. This made you feel even more for the characters as the film developed. <br/><br/>Of course, what the majority of people are looking for in superhero films is action. We got that. The alien invasion was done superbly, and on an epic scale. <br/><br/>This film is brilliant for people who know their superheroes, or people who don't. I loved it, and so will most who see it. Bring on the next round of films and Avengers age of Ultron!"

","I will not say that it's a good movie; it's a great movie. All the casts did a wonderful job to bring these heroic characters to life. It was not just the best superhero movie made. Starting with Robert Downey Jr.; who seemed to slip through scene to scene. He played almost fluently, providing his lines with virtually eases providing his charisma, personality and smugness to brighten up. <br/><br/>The well 2 hrs+ movie, Avengers is well-paced and time quickly flew by. The effects were top-notch and the performance was quite good. The script is the main part that drives the whole movie in elevating manner. For those people who have not seen any other movie, we are bringing enough information to bring everybody to momentum. The movie provides more than normal comic book movie but the story with cause that was backed up with unbelievable humor and action.<br/><br/>The Avengers was greatly entertaining. All the action scenes were great and satisfying.No one is short changed during the action or fighting scene. Not a single scene looked bad to me. A few dialogs seemed off but once you recall the character, it all makes perfect sense. Every respective characters is honest and true to itself. Everyone brought up their persona to the movie and definitely it is the best Marvel movie till now. Superheroes want super troubles to resolve to shine up. Each hero in this movie has to handle some sort of problem to its personal super power. Only by working as a team, they can conquer the evil threats. One of the best things in this great movie is the utilization of the leather jackets. Avengers got its success with the use of attractive leather jackets worn by different characters to uplift their personality. Desert leather is the manufacturer of quality Hollywood style jackets as worn in every blockbuster movie. This super hit and memorable movie easily satisfied the expectations needed. I simply loved this wonderful movie Avengers which covers all point of views, and delivers its depth with entertainment. I don't hesitate to give it a good 8/10!!"

","Bringing Earths mightiest heroes together was a brilliant idea as I have never seen a better superhero movie like it, And in the bright, action world of Marvel. Watch the heroes do whats best from each individual as they all have their fair share of screen time such as Iron man being cocky, Captain America being heroic, Thor bringing the lightning and of course... Hulk Smash. I couldn't hate a minuet of it and its always a great film when you want to see more at the end.<br/><br/>The only criticism I could barely dig out from the depths of my thoughts was Stan Lee could of had a better cameo but sometimes life doesn't go that way. But if you can get over a 89 year old man having a short part that lasted 4 seconds then you will appreciate this amazing film. If you want a good time to spend some hours gazing at the first film to unite multiple heroes to one universe, then this is it!"

"rebfan111","10","1","4","6 July 2013"," Amazed at numerous recent negative feedback, I've watched 30+ times
","In 18 months on IMDb, this is my first review. I was scrolling through IMDb for some background and stumbled into the user review section. Of the first 20 or so, it seemed 15ish rated this film a ""1"". Shocked, I actually put down my phone, paused the movie, and fired up my computer just to write my first review of ANY film. I am more than willing to concede to the negative posters that the storyline is relatively predictable. However, I cannot fathom why they think it would be so easy to weave a complex story arc (like those found in Dark Knight, Star Wars, or others mentioned) that could adequately involve 4 super heroes, 3 heroes, 1.5 bad guys, and assorted support cast and come in under 5 hours. How could anyone possibly write a Batman-Joker-Dent relationship that applied to all of the Avengers? Just look at how much reel time it took to develop the Batman-Bane relationship in DKR. If I were to judge this effort solely on originality, I probably wouldn't give it a 10 either. However, I firmly believe that Mr. Whedon and company did an excellent job integrating all of the characters into an action packed story that still manages to touch (if not address) various flaws of numerous characters. I further dismiss the opinions that say there are no unexpected plot twists in the story (the death of Coulson stands out immediately to me - a beloved character from previous movies). Also, I think he manages to further develop Fury, Romanoff, and Barton despite the limited time in a movie such as this. Obviously, I think the movie was a great success and hope others will at least give it a look despite the more recent negative feedback. If I had one complaint, I think that the scenes cut involving Steve Roger's character should have been left in the original. Probably not something Mr. Whedon wanted left out either; but, the extra 5-6 minutes should have made it past the editors."
"cmv32261","8","1","4","25 June 2013"," Banner/Hulk and Thor characters
","Let me reiterate, 10 line minimum impractical and extremely annoying. Minimum and maximum amt. of words, that is truly a lame brain policy. Topic of Thor, How much common sense did Stan Lee put into creating this particular comic book hero? Norse gods are nothing more than superstitious myths/theology. Far more rational to believe these ancient stories are based off how man at the time perceived the science of older races with far more advanced technology. Science will eventually disprove the existence of gods and a high percentage of ancient mysteries that some attribute to aliens, or time travelers. Here is a theory it is believed in the scientific community that life evolved and perished repeatedly over the past 4 billion yrs., what if not all those who evolved to create their own technology died out, they would be so advanced they would easily be able to hide among society today. Witless faith people as in Jehova, or anyone else who quote their particular religious text chapter and verse wake up, those disasters conveyed in religious texts are bunk, again all can rationally be explained through science in this case natural disasters. Maybe that is why we are not forced to actually make sacrifices to these alleged gods, because they sympathize with us because they can still recall when they were much like us, the truly god-like do not expect to be worshiped. As for the character of Loki if Norse myths/theology is based on advanced beings from space or remnants of past advanced earth civilizations, I like to think of the Star Trek animated episode of the Enterprise traveling to the center of the galaxy and the crew finding themselves in a dimension where things can be created merely by one's thoughts. In preceding mentioned STTAS, the character Loki, who was also Lucifer, or should I say the Patron Saint Of Enlightenment was actually much more like Thor seeing potential in the inhabitants of our planet to grow and become compassionately wise. Fact be told the Tora most likely describes Satan as wicked because he did not see the logic in keeping mortals ignorant whether it means complete peace or not. Alright that is enough about Viking gods and myths/theology. When did David, middle name or not David at least is a respectable sounding name, Bruce sounds like a name that should be applied to the mentally deficient such as your Christian Coalition, inbred, hillbilly, redneck type, much like the name Douglas where you feel tempted to say Dougie, or Doogie, might as well say Doobie, because you would expect someone with such a stupid sounding name to have zero brain wave activity such as person high on THC. Digress again which 1 is compelled to do from the start (* 10 line minimum). I have never been much of a reader of comic books, more important things to save what little money I had on, but shame on the screen writers of this movie, from what I know about the fictitious character of the Hulk, all texts cast Dr. David Bruce Banner/Hulk as a Dr. of medicine, more precisely biochemist/geneticist and possibly microbiologist in this movie he was no more than a physicist which means he would have no chance of curing his genetic mutation since 1 would not only need to have some knowledge in physics, but more so in biochemistry and genetics. Confused as to the part of the part where Nick Fury is explaining to Steve Rogers about the Hulk being created out scientific research related to the technique that create him, come on now, scientific knowledge of the first half of the 20th century. If you exposed anyone to gamma radiation with what little knowledge was known about effects of any given amount throughout much of the 20th century they would have died from radiation poisoning. Considering there has been so much talk about the dangers of radio waves, electromagnetism judged from people who have been exposed to RADAR type devices, or high levels of electromagnetism such as high voltage power lines, transformers without sufficient research you will die. Banner's survival was because his nucleotides were rearranged in a fashion that prevented the radiation levels from killing him. What is the source of this version of Banner/Hulk constant anger? Being that this is an entirely different Dr. Banner history from previous story lines the Dr. David Banner of the television series suffered from far more heartache than this 1. Wait do not tell me, Loki will be spewing hatred for his adoptive Asgard brother Thor and Asgard alike along with his condescending loathing of us worthless mortal humans, wreaking havoc and being responsible for more death and destruction, damn either kill the character off or scatter his subatomic particles across the vastness of space, he is an imminent threat to mortals just as Muslims are an imminent threat to those who do not adhere to the same religious doctrine as them. Do I detest the Muslim faith, damn straight I do, because no other religion is followed by people as ignorant and/or state of denial of it's origins as them. My 2 favorite scenes is where Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America turns to the Hulk to provide tactical strategy and says Hulk (carefully choosing words) smash, in response the Hulk smiles, and later in the movie where the Hulk is confronting Loki again in an arrogant soliloquy and again proclaims he is a god, indirectly insinuating mortals exist solely for his amusement, and the Hulk grabs him smashing body against the floor and/or walls in response and says puny god."
"cyanacheak07","9","1","4","11 June 2013"," Considered one of the best films of 2012
","To start out: The casting was phenomenal. Mark Ruffalo was thought to be a poor choice for the Hulk, but after seeing him in action, the thought had left everyone's mind. Edward Norton, a great Hulk himself, would not have fit in with the team. Now that I even try to think of it, I think this film would not have been nearly as great with him in it.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, it was well rounded, well written, and was fairly proportioned, considering the size of the team (No single actor got too much screen time, not even top billed Robert Downey Jr.) Joss Whedon did a spectacular job. No one could've done better. He had the perfect balance of each character, as well as the perfect balance of action and comedy. This film was amazing from start to finish. <br/><br/>If you didn't like it, you probably don't like fun."
"halfshadows6","10","1","4","2 June 2013"," Great film!
","The Avengers is one of the best action movies I've ever seen! Honestly, I didn't mind but didn't really appreciate the Marvel films until I saw this. The characters, good and bad, were great and the whole thing really flows nicely. The movie has its fast and slow parts, but nevertheless it never gets boring and worth watching more than once. In fact, I saw this many times in the theater. Another thing is the humor brought into this. It isn't a dark or very scary film. And even if you don't like it, or the humor just isn't funny to you, there are some scenes that are so funny everyone is laughing (ahem, Hulk and Loki). The actors really portray their characters nicely, and the whole thing is simply great. I have no issues with this film besides a few scenes that involve people busting through glass, such as Tony Stark and Hawkeye (technically, Stark would have died), but that is to be expected in these kind of films. This is truly, in my opinion, ""the best superhero movie ever""."
"Zazwaz","9","1","4","1 June 2013"," Exceeds Expectations
","The Avengers has gotten a lot of praise, much of which it rightly deserves, but the plot is somewhat uninspired. It's your classic comic- book movie formula with an evil villain who wants to take over the Earth and a team of superheroes is the only thing that stands in his way. But that isn't really what the film is about anyway. The presence of the evil villain merely serves as a means to an end; in this case the end being the assembly of the Avengers, an event the previous films have all been leaving up to. And while the plot is predictable and could have been a lot more innovative, the way the characters are brought together is handled masterfully.<br/><br/>This brings me to the actors, and the cast in the Avengers is superb. Uniting the cast of all the independent previous films, with the exception of Edward Norton who was sadly unable to reprise his role from the Incredible Hulk (2008), the Avengers consists of an all star cast whose performances are definitely largely the reason why this film is so good.<br/><br/>The main reason, however, for the Avengers being the success that it is is the director. Joss Whedon was the perfect choice for this film for one reason above all others; he has the talent to create a fantastic on- screen chemistry between characters with very different lifestyles. While seeing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans) having an argument is a terrific crossover moment on its own, Whedon's sense for chemistry really makes scenes such as this stand out where others might fail to do so.<br/><br/>Combining this with fast paced, intense action scenes with amazing special effects makes for a visual thrill ride, however Whedon also never forgets what the film is really about; these superheroes from across space and time coming together to fight a common enemy.<br/><br/>The result: a well balanced, well paced blockbuster that also has a lot of heart. And for me this more than makes up for the superficial plot, especially considering the amount of work, time and money Marvel has invested in these films, making sure everything ties in and adds up, all leading up to this.<br/><br/>When it first came out, a lot of people were afraid that the Avengers could not live up to the expectations raised by the other films. In my opinion, not only does it live up to the expectations, it exceeds them.<br/><br/>You won't be disappointed by this film, however I strongly recommend you watch the other films first to really be able to appreciate the masterpiece that the entire series is."

","As the title to this review says, ""So Much COULD Have Gone Wrong"" however, nothing did, in fact, it was the best movie of 2012 (until the Dark Knight Rises came out, but that's a whole 'nother story). Although the plot was a downfall, the action and the perfect screen-time for each of the heroes redeemed it. Also, the camera angles are so unique that you just have to appreciate the movie more. If you liked Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, or The Incredible Hulk, you will LOVE this movie. Also, they change Hulk for the better, so now he becomes the Hulk when he gets mad (not when his heart rate goes up) and he was more there for comedy. However, the climax and the way they solved the problem was bad, just having Iron Man fly up into the oblivion of space. Well, actually, that part was okay, but when he came back down to Earth he was unconscious, so Hulk stomped and roared to wake him up. Although it was funny, not exactly the way I would like Iron Man to be revived.<br/><br/>This brings me to another point, this movie was very funny. I'm not saying that it was funny for children, no, it was funny for all ages, with Hulk's anger getting in the way with some people (i.e., Thor) and just some jokes that were sprinkled into the conversations throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is great. It is action-packed, fun for kids (and pretty much any other family member), and it is (for a change) funny! Although the plot and the climax is a potential downfall, that should not stop you from seeing this movie."
"betterthenyou","7","1","4","1 May 2013"," Novelty Hype Avengers
","The avengers is one of the most talked about films in recent memory especially when it made such an explosion at the box office. The avengers was breaking and creating box office records left right and centre. The avengers you would think would be an interesting idea if done right and it most certainly has been.<br/><br/>There are 6 avengers members and there master nick fury which you would think with all the characters history and really complex individual story lines it would just be a great big mess just trying to fit them all in equally and there lives to fit into the story which is surprisingly done well but could be better.<br/><br/>Although the Avengers does great at fitting the characters in, that isn't always the case. On some occasions such as Bruce which is the Hulk, is given a more of a side character feel, such as his dilemma being the Hulk and given into anger is sidestepped a bit. There are inconsistencies in the story for example during the beginning they build up Bruce's character slightly (when not giving in to one liners and action movie formula clich√©'s). Bruce has to deal with his hulk anger issues and attacks the female avenger but later is completely in control out of the blue, which isn't bad, it could probably have been done better and built up more.<br/><br/>The movie of course does have some shinning lights in the picture, Iron man and Thor clearly take front row in the story due to Thor having family issues with the antagonist to resolve and Iron man's very big charismatic personality is hard to ignore and could be seen to take some of the spotlight in the movie.<br/><br/>The American avenger possibly needs more conflict in this movie like dealing with the modern day world or having a deep connection with somebody he didn't just share less than 1 minute of screen time. The American avenger is just the usual possible leader figure of the group, that is just there to deliver one liners and be the conflict with iron man.<br/><br/>The avenger with the cross bow didn't really have a developed background in comparison with the others but did instill some form of sub plot that could have probably been done without. To be fair even though well performed it wouldn't of made a real difference if he wasn't there, he doesn't add to the story and has next to no real conflict to speak of.<br/><br/>Nick fury which is performed by Samuel L Jackson which really does suit the role and definitely needed more screen time as this was simply the best actor in the film and the films greatest asset. There is hope that in the next film of the avengers there will be more conflict and story for this character, Nick Fury wasn't well developed in his background and didn't really have enough to do but was performed brilliantly.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Loki was an excellent role for the unknown actor Tom Hiddleston and really excelled at being the vengeful younger brother. This role probably would have been more fun if he had played to more humour(It's not that like he's the god of mischief or anything) instead we got a more one dimensional character that was bitter, jealous and ambitious which was just about it.<br/><br/>The script itself was not flawless there were a good few plot holes and a few lazy and convenient plot point to carry the story forward. The villain leader of the mighty alien army that the avengers was fighting and what seemed dark and mysteries figure. The villain came and looked like he could double cross Loki at any time and what seemed like a very fragile alliance came to nothing.(A waste of a very potentially brilliant story ark).<br/><br/>The film you could argue didn't really have enough tension in the story, the story possibly made it a bit to easy for the heroes and during the conflict. They had the attitude as if it was a sports match instead of the end of the world dilemma, so there was no real fear, dread or relevant emotion from the heroes and just stayed in the comfort zone characters. The villain Loki could have been made better if he had been a bit more humourful instead of the stubborn whiny, I want power now attitude.<br/><br/>The CGI in the film was amazing and used really well, not to the point it's shoved in your face or there is to much going on in the background to notice it. The CGI was used really well and found the right balance with making the dangers threatening and not overcrowding the whole scene with explosions, in every street corner until the audience get bored, the fireworks if overused to the point of having the same affects as sparklers on the big screen as the novelty wears off.<br/><br/>The avengers was a great film, not a flawless film and certainly no where near the hype it was given. The film is family friendly and does have a few good characters and a paced developing story. The film is something worth noting as a film that is definitely worth seeing not going as far as saying unmissable and does get to slow at some points but all in all worth catching if you have time.<br/><br/>This film is a good 7 out of 10 and definitely recommended film to see but could be considered overrated, to much hype and a dab of the novelty effect."

All the acting is pretty secure and the effects good. All the actors suit their roles and bring together a successful film on a group of heroes (sounds easier than it is).

My favorite character in the Avengers is the hulk. I like how he tries to remain in control then after a while all of a sudden something just sets him off on a rage. The whole action scene is just to live from the graphics to the hulk ripping thing out of the walls and throwing them. The whole idea of this movie is excellent.

"toughtoe1","9","1","4","19 November 2012"," The avengers is another masterpiece in the marvel Universe
","Avengers Initiative The Avengers is an action packed film that leaves one asking for more. This film takes your classic comic book heroes and brings them to life on the big screen. From the very beginning the characters are already set in place previous movies. That is right if you don't want to be lost you unfortunately have some homework to do first. This should not be too difficult of a task. Marvel takes many of their beloved Heroes and puts them all together in a super powered formula. This team is a ""time bomb"" just waiting to explode. The characters are as different as night and day which causes many clashes from physical beat downs, to witty and comical banter between them. All the Heroes have one common goal that in the end brings them all together, the fight for the ""greater good"". The stakes are set high from the very beginning. This allows one no time to be distracted. You have Loki who is a constant threat; weather manipulated others, or fighting himself. This villain allows the watcher to be on their toes in order to know what he is really doing. He also has a slow developing scheme that becomes steadily more known and dangerous as the plot develops. One of the most interesting things about this movie is the character interactions. These vary from violent and destructive fights, to hysterical jokes. There is Tony Stark (Iron Man), a brilliant business man that is often betrayed as a large, rich child. He knows all technologies and yet, pokes and jabs at Bruce Banner to see if it will release the Hulk. Bruce Banner who is very seemingly calm at all times has as stark puts it, a big green rage monster waiting to come out. Yet he has his secret of keeping the Hulk under control. He is angry all the time. You have the super soldier that is very lost in a modern day society. An alien named Thor who blames himself for bringing this whole situation upon the earth. Then last but not least, Black Widow who you never know what she is going to do. As great as the Avengers is, it does have its flaws. If one does not know the characters nor seen the movies leading up to the Avengers, they don't know much about them. In the movie they are all already developed giving someone very little room to learn who they all are. Most of this movie is one action seen into the next leaving little time to add to the plot in between. Next to these few flaws, the Avengers is a fantastic film that takes many extraordinary fictional people and makes them feel real as the person sitting next you."
"rassel2413","9","1","4","19 November 2012"," Avengers invests in its characters depth.
","From the opening scene to the final seconds, Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is an action packed thrill ride that'll leave you begging for more. The overall storyline is nothing special, bad guy wants to rule the world using and alien army, but the true genius of Avengers lies in its execution. Joss Whedon moves the movie along at a pace that leaves the audience without a feeling of being rushed. The threat is quickly established, but a majority of the time is spent assembling the team. Though at first one is quick to point out that this tactic would lengthen the movie and draw things out in a bore, it is another credit to the directing/writing of Whedon. By slowly introducing each character we are better able to see each hero's personality bounce of the others in a sort of entertaining experiment that takes place right before our eyes.<br/><br/>A good super hero movie often hinges on its villain (""The Dark Knight's"" Joker), and it isn't an easy task to make the audience doubt the heroes' ability to come out on top. Especially when there are six of them, but Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, acts the part to perfection. And speaking of acting, it would appear that the third time is in fact the charm as no one could have predicted the show stealing performance by Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk who succeeded where Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not. His role as the cool, calculating scientist with a touch of emotional instability, ""I'm always angry,"" was highly engaging. As for the rest of the cast, they benefited from the group dynamic. Each hero was the star of his own movie and when they come together their respective egos clash resulting in action such as the fight between Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, or hilarity in the case of Iron Man calling Captain America, played by Chris Evans, ""Old Man.""<br/><br/>Amongst all the stars of the movie, there is still one more, the special effects. Delivering one the best action movies of the year could not be possible without serious CGI and Avengers delivers in outstanding fashion. From the ascension of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mother ship to the moment the alien army's arrival in New York, the art department shows it has what it takes to compete with the likes of Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan. The Hulk is brought to life in astounding realism as well as the character many forget isn't real either, Iron Man.<br/><br/>As a whole there is little that can be said against Whedon's new masterpiece. The expectations of every comic book fan and superhero movie buff must have hung heavy on his shoulders. The buildup to this was unlike anything ever seen in Hollywood. Whedon, in his magnum opus, reveals himself to be the true hero of ""The Avengers."""

","""Marvels The Avengers"" sounded like a movie that I would just not be in to because of the fact that it has to do with a bunch of superheroes but all in to one movie. To be honest, that is just not my kind of movie. Once it was announced in our class that we would be watching it I was not excited at all, all I thought was that I was really going to be bored and just want to sleep the whole time, but that was not the case. The movie really was intriguing and really snatched your attention right up.<br/><br/>The fact that Joss Whedon was able to put all of the superhero movies that everybody knows and loves all in to one movie and make it all fall into place without changing any of the characters in anyways was really a great thing. The movie also was just not an ordinary action filled movie with the same old action that all those types of movies carry; it had so much more and was so much more advanced in every single way. The graphics, the special effects, the fighting scenes, and every little detail was so precise and on target. Nothing ever let me down in this movie that I thought should change or be different. All in all now when it comes down to this type of movie I know I will not judge it just because of the fact that it is an action filled movie that comes from comic books because who knows, it could be really good just like ""The Avengers"" was.<br/><br/>The only bad review that I would give the movie is that in the beginning it was a little hard to follow. Especially if you are person watching it for the first time and don't really follow all of the other movies that are put in to it. My only advice would be in the beginning to show who the characters are and what they were all about so some of the viewers watching the movie for the first time can follow a little easier and not have to take the time to figure out what exactly is happening and who the people are that are playing the characters like Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and etc. At first in the movie I didn't know what actor was playing the Hulk so that really confused me. Over all, this movie was a really great action packed movie that portrayed to be a really good attention grabber."

","The Avengers was a good movie, but took a little while to get into. At first I was very confused, seeing as I have not watched any of the other Marvel movies. Nothing was really explained as to who the characters were and what their importance was, it was just assumed that you knew. As I was watching the movie I asked many questions to my companions and needed things to be explained to me in order to understand everything that was going on. Without these people to clear things up I may not have understood a good portion of the movie which would have made it boring and uninteresting for me to watch. As the movie began things jumped around a lot, which made the storyline hard to follow. Characters were bouncing around from place to place and new people were being brought into the story without any real introduction or reason. Further into the movie everything came together and was more understandable, but they could have done a better job writing the beginning. Again, without explanations from the people I was with I would not have understood exactly where the character were coming from and why they were being brought it. The only reason a person would not like The Avengers, in my opinion, would be because they had not seen previous Marvel movies in which these characters were featured. Once things were explained to me and I understood the role each character played it was a very good and entertaining movie. The plot kept twisting and just when you thought something was under control it spiraled off into a huge mess. Things such as the villain freezing himself and collecting more and more power or such as the people he turned evil becoming good again just in time to help save the day. It is an action packed movie with something new and unexpected going on at all times. All of the superheroes come together in order to stop an ultra-powerful force from outer space, but their ideas and morals clash in ways that could inhibit them from making clear decisions and in the end saving the world. Besides personality clashes, the hulk is also unable to control his powers and becomes a threat to everyone when he morphs into his large green alter ego and begins to tear the place apart. This nerve wrecking movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you watch hoping that everyone can get along in time to defeat the villain."
"t-thatcher94","10","1","4","18 November 2012"," My review of The Avengers
","The Avengers is a behemoth of action that comic nerds and casual movie-goers alike can enjoy in the same vein. It's not only action packed, but the humor, and the script altogether, was well written and compliments each character completely. For example, Captain America speaks like how you would think: a bit dated, not exactly knowing much of his surroundings yet. He speaks as anybody who just woke up from being frozen for seventy odd years. Bruce Banner, also known as The Hulk, speaks in a sort of timid, nervous way. He mumbles a bit, and is constantly scared that something will happen that makes him very, very angry. Mark Ruffalo, the actor who plays Banner/Hulk, pulls this off gracefully as he truly is Bruce, and not just an actor playing him. Brilliant performances from the cast are a major driving point for this movie. Tony Stark is as sarcastic and witty as he normally is. Thor is awkward with his mythos and his stories of battles and what-not. In fact, Thor would be the only character that sort of didn't mesh in with the rest of the team. The actor who played him, Chris Hemsworth, didn't convince me that he was actually the character he was playing like everyone else did. Even though Thor was powerful and awesome, the actor who played him was a hit and miss for me.<br/><br/>More praises aside for the other actors, the action of this movie raises the bar for how a superhero movie should be made. Explosions, gun fights, jets, super powers, and martial arts can make for a summer blockbuster if done right. The Avengers is done right. They do a good job in accurately showing each characters different abilities and strength levels (in the fight between Iron Man and Thor, Thor is clearly shown be stronger than Iron Man's armor, but Iron Man's repulsors are shown be as powerful as they are in the comics, knocking Thor off of his feet). Hulk is portrayed as the unstoppable beast that he is, utterly destroying everything in his path as he fights the alien antagonists of the movie. He even pummels Loki, and to a much lesser extent, Thor, who were both worshiped as gods at one point. Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye are shown to be proficient in martial arts and that shows that normal people can be a super hero too.<br/><br/>The editing of the movie, along with the plot, action, special effects, and the pop culture references, make this movie out to be one of my genuine favorites. Being a comic book fan, I am truly pleased with this movie and I'm very excited for the future of Marvel Studios. They pump out action-packed super hero movies all the time, and if The Avengers is any indication of what's to come, they have my vote. ¬ï Plot-A ¬ï Special Effects-A+ ¬ï Sound-A ¬ï Humor-A ¬ï Real world references-A ¬ï Comic Lore-A-"
"dgriz13","10","1","4","18 November 2012"," The Avengers Review
","Hype was filled in the air as this star-filled, action packed, superhero movie was about to come to U.S. theaters. In my opinion, all of the hype was delightfully fulfilled after its release. The Avengers smashed the box office and grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide becoming the third highest-grossing film of all time.<br/><br/>Let's first take a look at this all-star cast. Robert Downey, Jr. plays a billionaire playboy philanthropist named Tony Stark (Iron Man). This is the second best performance in a superhero type movie that I have ever seen; next to Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. He brings a lot of wit and charisma to the film which is a big part why it became as successful as it was. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor, who is the crown prince of Asgard. His Spartan-like appearance and acting skills is the reason why I think Chris was the perfect choice to play Thor. My favorite part is when Thor fought with Captain America (due to Captain America being chosen as the leader) because it was so unexpected. Speaking of Captain America (Steve Rogers), he is played by Chris Evans whose physic is perfect for this role. His character is adequately developed throughout the movie. Mark Ruffalo's acting as the Hulk (Dr. Bruce Banner) I thought was very good. Joss Whedon got great use out of the hulk for the limited time he was in there. The epic battle with Loki at the end when the hulk smashes Loki was a highlight of the film. Whedon use of the hulk's strength is brilliant and even sometimes humorous. Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) in the film. Her charm and sexy looks bode well with the character. Being a woman in superhero movie seems like it would be a tough challenge, but she hit the nail on the coffin. My favorite scene with her is when she is being violently interrogated by a trio of gangsters. The gangsters reveal their master plan before Johansson breaks out of the chair and takes down all three men. This scene showed her amazing acrobatic ability.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye, a very skillful marksman. He seemed to play this role very confidently and was almost flawless throughout the movie.<br/><br/>For every superhero movie, there's always a villain. The villain in The Avengers is named Loki and is played by Tom Hiddleston. In my opinion his acting is superb. He plays the character of a very menacing and mad man.<br/><br/>The minor characters (Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Samuel L. Jackson¬†as¬†Nick Fury, Cobie Smulders¬†as¬†Maria Hill, and Stellan Skarsgard¬†as Dr.¬†Erik Selvig) are all decent at their respected roles. Although, I think Samuel L. Jackson should have had more airtime as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. <br/><br/>The plot unfolds very quickly in this action-packed movie. Without spoiling the movie, I will access the basic plot structure. Nick Furry, who is the leader of the peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D, and Black Widow¬† have to assemble a special group to combat Thor's evil brother Loki after he takes the cosmic cube and uses his¬†scepter¬†to brainwash Dr. Selvig and multiple agents, including¬†Hawkeye in order to help him in his getaway. The heroes have a hard time working together but eventually learn how to. Bruce Banner (Hulk) plays an important role because he helps track down the artifact's gamma signals. The plot is developed very nicely and is exactly what a superhero movie should be.<br/><br/>The graphics and for this film is superb to say the least, especially on blue ray. The fact that most of the filming for this movie was actually filmed in a big city (mostly New York and Cleveland), rather than a made up Hollywood set, gives it a feeling of realism and an illusion that the viewer is actually in the movie. <br/><br/>The special effects are second to none in The Avengers. The huge explosions, giant hole opening up in the air, Hawkeye falling out of the sky and shooting his arrow, and hulk smashing Loki are just a few of many excellent examples of amazing special effects.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this film two thumbs up. The flawless acting, explosive plot, superb graphics, and excellent special effects all add up to a perfect superhero movie. I would recommend this movie to any person who loves action-packed, superhero films."

","The movie was not what I expected at first. By watching it , I really thought it was a good action movie. Most action movies I have seen I thought this was one of my top movies. By using the actors Whedon has used made this movie even better.. The actors that played Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Hulk( Mark Ruffalo), Captain America(Chris Evans ) , Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. ), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye( Jeremy Renner )and Loki(Tom Hiddleston ) . Worked really well together and got to show their own strength in the movie. The evil Loki didn't really get to show that much of his evil. I think they should of showed more of his evil side. It mostly looked like it followed the story line of Thor because it was mostly about him and Loki. When I watched this Black Widow and Haweye I didn't really know because they didn't have their own movie outside of this movie and I don't really read comics but by seeing this movie it made me want to watch more of this kind of movies. I would watch this movie again. The special effects were really good it went well with catching the audience's attention and to keep watching it. I think they should of changed the setting of the battle that happened in Manhattan, where the bad guys went against the heroes .The ending kind of made you think there was going to be a second one coming out, and not leave you hanging like most other movies. The best scene I think was the best in the movie was when all of them were stopping the portal thing that Loki had opened and they all came together.It showed how even though they have different techniques on fighting there enemy that can still help each other and defeat the enemy. Most people would like to watch this movie even if they aren't into action movies."

","The movie Avengers is a must see film for all viewers. The all-star movie fulfilled the high expectations of the world most powerful superheroes saving the human racing. Within two minutes, the movie quickly picks up after the self-sustaining energy force, that is stolen by a semi god named Loki. As gripping as the story line starts off, the special effects are just as spectacular. The headquarters ship to aircraft sequence was breathtaking enough. The effects were so realistic that it begged the question if such technology is real. Thor's sex appeal is enough to keep the ladies watching with his hammer of steel, lengthy hair and rugged style. Thor's fight with Captain America was certainly unexpected. If anything we expected an all-out war with the many quips that Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man flings around. He brings comic relief to the otherwise tense cast. Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a Hulk is remaining calm as ever and typically does nothing for a good part of the movie besides fondle some technology and look busy. Every once in a while, Dr.Bruce Banner comes out of his office along with Tony Stark to explain the magnitude of the energy force and the some strategic advice. Later on, he character becomes truly essential to defeating the bigger aliens. Captain America is almost as useless in the beginning because he's not up to date with any of the technology so he just sits around trying to grasp the concept most of the conversations between Mr. Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, and the rest of the avengers. At one point he blurts out ""I get that! I understand that phrase. I do, I get that one."" Referring to a pun made by, none other than, Mr. Stark. We do however find out that Captain America is arguably the wisest of the team. Somehow he's able to slide in some subtle wisdom like ""we've got to put that (problems) behind us and get this job done"" and ""Sometimes there isn't a way out."" Iron Man earns the most improved award in this movie. He goes from a rich self-absorbed hero to a still rich, now deserving the title, hero. Sad to see but other characters didn't really change much during the film, or grow in morals. Sometimes, it's nice to see such super heroes grow into better people. Along with the almost stationary characters, the background didn't really changer either. Most of the action and plot took place of the aircraft. The movie can be dwindled down to two main back drops, the aircraft and the downtown of New York City. Combat in this movie is of epic proportions. You have the entire kick ass fighting styles of a super hero and Special Forces but without any of the excessive blood splatter that can sometimes just demean an entire movie. Crowds should flock to this movie for its stellar use of special effects, heroism, and best of all to see our daring young heroes compete in war."

","Avengers Unleashed<br/><br/>The highly anticipated movie from Joss Whedon, ""The Avengers"" was released in the theater in May 2012 and the DVD release was in September 2012. I could not wait for this movie to finally be released, after watching Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America on the big screen. I would finally get to see a full team on screen, what kind of story would they do and make it work with all these different characters and cast. Robert Downey Jr. AKA. Tony Stark / Iron Man does a great job with his part, his sarcastic one liner's are great and humorous. Chris Evans AKA. Steve Rogers / Captain America does a good job, but some moments I felt were kind of flat. Mark Ruffalo AKA. Bruce Banner / The Hulk steals the movie with his interpretation of his character, he reminded me of Bill Bixby's character he played on the TV version of The Incredible Hulk. There are moments in the movie that will catch you off guard and make you laugh with The Hulk. The rest of the cast does a great job with their characters and makes the team work well together. I would still like to see some of the back stories on some of the characters. <br/><br/>The movie started slow for me, but then gets action packed and is nonstop for the rest of the movie. The story line works well, has some good underlying messages, like Loki in Germany and wanting everyone to kneel to him. Wasn't there a leader from Germany that wanted everyone to kneel to him? How did that work out? Tony Starks realizes that his building is the power source for Loki to bring his army through a portal. Throughout the movie The Avengers have to figure out how to coexist and work with each other. In the end they get it done and now some like them and some don't.<br/><br/>The movie is shot well and put together good, I seen the movie in 3D at the theater. It was OK but it didn't seem like most of the movie was shot in 3D. Just most of the action packed parts of the movie. I watched at home a couple of times on DVD, I liked it just as much. The CGI was done good with some good scenes, loved the flying battleship. Overall this was a great movie and would recommend it to everyone. Joss pulls it off and makes The Avenger into a great movie, can't wait to see the next one!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Mk2369","Null","1","4","12 November 2012"," Nothings perfect...but this came close.
","Joss Whedon's, ""The Avengers"" was the most talked about movie since the trailer first aired. I was excited to see it and yet I ended up missing it in theaters and sadly had to wait for it to come out on DVD. When I finally was able to rent it and put it in, I knew right from the start what everyone was talking about. This movie has everything that anyone could ever want out of an hero action packed, semi comical and slightly sad movie and yet, to me, there still seemed to be some mysteries that were left to question. <br/><br/>Like any other films that are made to lead up to another it is usually important that one sees the films beforehand so that way they know each characters original story. I felt that with ""The Avengers"", for the people that did see all of the movies: ""Thor"" with Chris Hemsworth, ""Iron Man"" with Robert Downey Jr., ""Captain America"" with Chris Evans and even ""The Hulk"", whose character has been played by three different celebrities, that ""The Avengers"" movie did not follow suit with what had happened in the prior movies. For instance, in the movie ""Thor"" we last saw him trapped at his home land of Asgard, unable to come see Jane (his love) who is back on Earth. Yet in the movie ""The Avengers"" he seems to be able to use his lightning bolt powers to magically come down with no explanation and join the rest of the crew in the future. Also when he did come down, he was not with the Avengers yet, he should have taken time to see her. <br/><br/>Another thing I did not quit understand (this may be the fact that I do not read comics) is how the Hulk cannot control his anger when he is a raging green monster and he at first fights with anyone that is in a four foot radius but as the final battle scene rolls around he suddenly knows who is the enemy and who is not which also relates back to the fact that when we first meet him in ""The Avengers"" he has himself hidden away someplace peaceful so he does not get angry and lash out. I just think that those might be some minor flaws in the story line.<br/><br/>However, all around, I think that ""The Avengers"" is a good movie. It has everything that a person could want out of a Marvel movie, which has been dishing out amazing stories for a long time. The choice of actors/actresses for each character and each movie makes up for the little ""umm,so wait, how did that happen?"" with their personalities and the way they make it seem as though they have been those characters all their life. With all the flair the movie has, despite the leaks in the story line, I would give this movie an eight out ten."
"millernicholad","9","1","4","10 November 2012"," Good but not Perfect
","""The Marvel Avengers"", directed by Joss Whedon, has its own take on the many different types of the Avenger's team that cannot be defeated by any foe. For instance the first Avenger's team (which should have been in the movie if going in chronological order) features Iron Man, Ant-Man, The Wasp, Thor, and the Hulk. In ""The Marvel Avengers"" the team consisted of Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, the Hulk, Thor, and Nick Fury. I say it has its own take because in the episode that the Avengers take on the villain Loki, the Avenger's #1, there are no aliens. The episode with Loki is actually how he tricks the Hulk to destroy train tracks, however, with the more action packed society today this story wouldn't have gone over as well.<br/><br/>The new story of Marvel's Avengers might be better than the old but the characters need some work. If the history of the characters is taking into consideration the movie is way off base. First of all the first Avenger, Captain America, is suppose to be a man from Brooklyn but he does not have the typical ""r-less"" speech we hear from New Yorkers. Further on this idea is Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) is suppose to be a highly trained spy from Russia, yet she doesn't sound like a Russian. On a better note though I think that the avengers Hulk is by far the best so far and even hoping they try a third time to get it right, starring Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. A couple characters I think that ""Marvel's Avengers"" depicts very well are Thor, Iron Man, and of course the Hulk.<br/><br/>Another drawback of ""Marvel's Avengers"" is the relationship between Hawkeye and Black Widow. In the comics Hawkeye and Black widow are both in love; however, Hawkeye is clearly more in love as he follows Black Widow to steal Stark's technology. In the movie they depict Black Widow as the one following Hawkeye around completely switching the roles of their relationship. Furthermore the relationship between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts was brief but spot on. Pepper Potts is the calm one that is realistic behind the irrational, volatile, Tony Stark, the true proof that opposites attract.<br/><br/>In conclusion, in ""Marvel's Avengers"" there may be small setbacks in the characters but it still does not take away from it being a very good movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet but it does help to watch the marvel movies that precede it such as, Captain America, Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, and the Incredible Hulk. The changes that Joss Whedon has made to the Avengers I feel relates to today's society very well as how many Avengers teams have changed to adapt to society. I will be in line awaiting the Avengers 2 in May of 2015 (the due date so far)."
"oezeka","8","1","4","8 November 2012"," Is avengers the best movie ever
","The movie Avengers is a good movie because of the the marvelous effects and the plot. They picked the excellent actors to play the characters. The actors Robert Downey Jr.( Iron Man), Chris Evens (Captain America), Jeremy Renner (Hawk Eye), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and many more good actors. The other reason Avengers is a fine movie to watching is the action, adventure, and the bravery. <br/><br/>In addition ""The Avengers"" is a a satisfying movie because the heroes are trying to protect the world from the Thor's brother Loki. The movie has frequent scenes with fighting. In most of the movie Loki's army is trying to invade the world. While Thor and the rest of the avengers are trying to assure the world safety. As the world is being attack and protected at the same time. The Earths Mightiest Heroes are fighting and as music is playing it makes feel like you are in an awe while your watching the movie. After about five seconds it goes back into all the action that is accruing around the world. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie ""Avengers"" has a lot of adventure. In the movie the heroes do not like each other very much but have to learned to get along especially Iron Man and Thor. ""The Avengers"" have to learned how to fight with each other and to grantee the world safety. It is an adventure because while they are on the verge to fight Loki and his army. They make Hulk mad and he turns into the green monster and he conveniently almost kills BlackWidow. <br/><br/>Although there is a abundant of fighting, I thought there should have been scenes with close friends and family. It would have been better if some of the heroes might have said bye to their families. I thought they should have to said they might not make it back to some one they love. The movie would be a fantastic movie if they had just a little less action. <br/><br/>Evidently In this movie there is a lot of bravery. There is bravery when Iron man says ""We have a Hulk"" telling Loki to back Down in different words. As they are fighting when they get knocked down they just get back up. There is even more bravery when Loki throws Iron Man out the Window and iron man is brave and waits for his suit to come and save him. Even though Loki is evil he stills stands up to Hulk then Hulks repeatedly beats Loki.<br/><br/>Finally as the movie ends the avengers meet at street and they all just stand there; Nick Furry tells them they did a good job and if there is another invasion they will avenge it. Other wise I give ""Avengers an eight because of things they could have done to make the the story better. So they would have got people caught up in the sympathy."

But a good flick is such that, regardless the genre, possesses features like: *Good ""trainy"" storyline (conceived out of the script) *Emotional content (even if its a little bit of suspense, intrigue or unpredictability) *Realness (excluding the visual-special effects, which is not Real, but cool and allowed)<br/><br/>I had such high expectations for ""Marvel's The Avengers"", but i was disappointed. The storyline is very weak. <br/><br/>The Other: ""The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power, but our ally knows its workings as they never will. ..."". How did the tesseract come about? From where and how did it come to manifest on earth? And how come the Asgardians (from a distance light years-planet) speaking English??? <br/><br/>I could predict this movie from scene to scene till the end. Its like watching one cranked-up episode of super-man cartoon.<br/><br/>This movie is a 143min of explicit action and special effect (which i so love), but all these, without the afore mentioned points is like eating jam without bread.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is my opinion, and you are so rightfully entitled to yours. Nice day y'all :)"

"DrGlipglop","8","1","4","25 August 2012"," Amazing end product of mediocre films
","I never thought going into the cinema that the previous Marvel films would amount to so much. They are nothing in comparison to this masterpiece. The films leading up to this being Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk and the Iron Man films. These films range from average to decent, decent being Iron Man 1 which is the best out of the prequels. <br/><br/>This film works in so many ways! It's hard to know where to begin with the review. The acting is good, the story line isn't complex but not too simple either. Each character is given a good amount of screen time and no character is left under-powered or look insignificant. The effects are very good maybe some of the best ever so far in film making. Josh Whedon has done himself proud! I loved Firefly and now I love this!<br/><br/>Overall a very very VERY good film. It is incomparable to The Dark Knight or the other Batman films as it is a completely different type of film. I do love those films as well. It just.. works."
"legend_killer0123","8","1","4","22 August 2012"," Brilliant But Still A Little Overrated!!
","First of all i would like to say that the avengers is marvel's best film to date and there are quite a few positives in the film.<br/><br/>The direction and screenplay is nothing short of brilliant. Joss Whedon deserves a lot of credit. The film could have gone awfully wrong with so much heroes in one film but the director has successfully tightened up all loose ends. For a film in which so much characters are sharing one screen space you would expect a lot of things to go wrong but not in this one.<br/><br/>The acting was nothing short of brilliant. All the characters were completely faithful to their roles but the standout was Mark Ruffalo as the hulk. He was nothing short of amazing. I won't be surprised if marvel makes a stand alone hulk film with him.<br/><br/>The special effects were outstanding. I have never seen anything like it in any film before.<br/><br/>Now to the negatives about the film. One of them is the soundtrack that doesn't quite live upto expectations.<br/><br/>The other is the dialogue. As far as i can think there were no memorable dialogues at all. All were pretty mediocre.<br/><br/>The main negative thing about the film was the lack of emotional depth which was in abundance in spiderman 2 and nolan's batman trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall i would say it is a brilliant film but a little overrated. I don't think it should be more than 8 on IMDb. 8.6 is too much and very close to TDK and TDKR which were pure masterpieces. However it is marvel's best film upto date and certainly raises the bar for marvel at the movies."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","4","20 August 2012"," Cinematic Cotton Candy, For Better or Worse
","The culmination of Marvel's four-year, five-picture master plan is, puzzlingly, both as good as I'd hoped and a mild disappointment. It excels at playing up the larger-than-life aspects of the story, from the testy initial relationship between heroes and the looming magnitude of the threat they're called together to face. Such moments are dispersed liberally, perhaps once every five minutes, and they're an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration. What's missing, at least from where I sit, is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks. Robert Downey Jr. is again excellent in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo might just be the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin, shallow and (for lack of a better word) cartoonish. Captain America, for example, wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture, and never feels quite right as the commanding field general he's presented to be. The most intriguing aspect of his character, an emotional detachment from modern culture, is barely even mentioned. He, and the rest of the team, feels like a suit of armor with a few good one-liners, not a living, breathing human being. It's a trap that was mostly evaded in the stars' preceding solo shots, so it's a shame to see it tripped here, especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each individual's motivations. Those nitpicks certainly aren't enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing we'll ever get to an all-splash-page crossover mega-event on the big screen, but they're also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit. It's a herculean effort with some truly great rewards, but not the picture-perfect ensemble masterpiece it would have you believe."
"lomax82003","7","1","4","19 August 2012"," They make the ""effects"" better and better
","I'll start by saying that when I bought tickets to this show I was a little sceptic. First because I did not imagine how can you build a story involving Hulk and Thor, were is Tony Stark's arrogance and attention going to fit and finally will it all be just a bunch of no sense fights. But as the action went on all my fears were shattered, Tony was still arrogant but funny in the same way, I loved the nagging between Hulk and Thor, Captain America was exactly how it was in his own movie, a true believer, a true American. The story was not that good but I did not see huge plot holes lake I've seen on Battleship for example and the small comedy involved between the fighting scenes made this movie even greater."
"gaetan-servajean","7","1","4","30 July 2012"," The Avengers, a comic books fan review..
","If you are a hardcore fan and read the comic books, as I do, (read all the avengers and civil war storyline) it will be a major disappointment for you because of the plot. Another thing that disappointed me is that the movie is in my opinion a total copy of Transformers: Dark of the Moon, at least how it is performed, half of the movie (from the start to the mid) they are just talking about what they have to do and Loki plays with their mind. No action till the mid-movie just like Transformers. Although that after the mid-movie I must say it was pretty entertaining, but ,if you knew that C. America beats the sh*t out of Ironman in the books, just like Thor and both of them without trouble, it will again break it to you since he is like the most overpowered guy in there after The Hulk. Also America is not stupid in the books...."
"shacklefort","Null","1","4","27 July 2012"," As Amazing As Any Movie Ever Made!
","In keeping with Marvel's best efforts, Joss Whedon sets this movie apart from every other standard adventure movie, by the way he communicates the overall experience. We live the story and we feel the intensity and gravity of every situation. We fully embrace the characters as we go along on this amazing ride. It's so wonderful that we got to know each of the major players in their own solo movie(s) before this adventure. That just adds a ton to the depth. This movie isn't about comic book pulp or things that go ""boom"" but about a powerful, exciting and meaningful story. The elements are fantastical but perfectly balanced by the characters and the way Whedon grounds everything.<br/><br/>Visual and emotional imagery are presented throughout the movie and provides the viewer with greater insight into the heroes AND even the villain. Everything here screams quality and screams fun all the way through. Yes, despite the depth and serious consequences there is a great deal of fun. That's something I'm so grateful that Marvel usually delivers. For those going into this flick expecting a lot of fun, prepare to enjoy. But remember, fun is not the only piece of this pie. In fact, I think most movie fans will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon.<br/><br/>This is a smart and surprisingly deep film that really delivers on everything promised in all those teaser set-ups from other Marvel films."
"Laakbaar","7","1","4","26 July 2012"," Adrenalin rush
","In a nutshell, the Avengers are six superheroes brought together by an organisation called SHIELD to protect the Earth. The Avengers (a product of the Marvel comic book publishing company) are Black Widow, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and Iron Man. <br/><br/>Four of these have already had movies made about them (as part of the same franchise) and this movie draws heavily on that. Out of the four earlier movies involving these superheroes, I enjoyed Thor and The Hulk. I was not particularly bowled over by the Iron Man and Captain America movies. I have to admit a bias: as a childhood DC fan, I was never able to get into Marvel comics. Also, I'm not into video games at all.<br/><br/>As you might expect, this movie was a parade of spectacular effects, superhero stunts, fearsome aliens, wild technology, city obliterating fights, shootouts, chases and so on. When I say spectacular special effects, I am not kidding. It's astonishing what filmmakers are able to show on screen nowadays.<br/><br/>There was also a good deal of superhero clich√©s (of the good kind), jingoism (both noble and sappy), comedy, snappy one-liners, oiled biceps and tight leotards. <br/><br/>Speaking of the latter two, Chris Hemsworth makes a great Thor.<br/><br/>Chris Evans...well, let's just say I don't quite get Captain America as much as I get Chris Evans. I prefer him as the wise-cracking Torch. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was OK as Bruce Banner, but the script didn't really give him a chance to do his stuff. <br/><br/>This movie was mostly about Iron Man, but I'm not into this superhero. I really don't get Iron Man. Such a waste of a good actor.<br/><br/>In general, this movie seemed a little forced to me. There were parts of it that I was unable or unwilling to follow closely. The film had a very fast pace, perhaps too much action. It was clearly designed to be primarily an adrenalin-inducing visual experience. The problem is that I don't go to movies to get an adrenalin rush. I go to be entertained, an emotional and intellectual process, not a physical one.<br/><br/>I also have to confess that this movie seems quite similar to other action films I've seen lately. It's getting hard to tell them apart. Scary aliens, awesome technology, skyscraper carnage, endangered Earth. This genre seems to have the same four themes popping up over and over again. <br/><br/>I suppose I've become jaded, but maybe it's time for something different? Now that we can show virtually anything on film, it's time to move to other things, don't you think? <br/><br/>I yearn for the near-religious awe and excitement I felt when I saw Close Encounter of the Third Kind for the first time many years ago. Avengers is the kind of movie that doesn't deliver that to me. This movie evoked no emotion in me at all really. <br/><br/>I didn't feel anything for the characters in this film. I didn't really care what happened to any of them. <br/><br/>I felt mostly annoyance at the NYC destruction scenes. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film for me involved the amusing final scene with Hulk and Loki, but that's all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining film. No different than the others really. You might as well see it. Everyone else has. <br/><br/>The score assigned to this movie on IMDb is far too high and casts a shadow over the entire IMDb ratings concept."

The chemistry between the actors is great and all the superheroes deliver. Especially the Hulk, Mark Ruffalo gave the Best performance of any Hulk on the big screen. Robert Downey Jr. isn't as witty and charismatic as in Iron Man but that is expected due to him having to share the spotlight. Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki is one to be praised the misunderstood god in Thor becomes much more menacing and this time he knows exactly what he wants. His performance is reminiscent of Heath Ledgers in his Oscar winning performance of the joker. Overall, The Avengers is a fun superhero film. I is not Oscar worthy, but it a great popcorn flick."

","Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) make The Avengers. This film is pretty sweet. <br/><br/>The Avengers assemble to face off against the god of mischief himself, Loki (portrayed by Tom Hiddleston). <br/><br/>What does The Avengers have? Awesome visual effects; great characters; great direction; not the best plot. I can't think of any other villains that they could have fought against, well villains of these superheroes. Magneto or a Batman villain could have worked, but of course that goes out of their section of villains. I just wasn't feeling the alien invasion thing. Though, the action was incredible ‚Äì and it prevented the viewer from becoming bored. The gags were really funny, Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk added charisma to the film. The film casts a big box office shadow for upcoming super hero films like The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises, so hopefully those don't disappoint.<br/><br/>My expectations were high, from hearing all of the awesome things about it, so I didn't enjoy it AS much as I wanted to. Granted, the film is still better than one's average super hero film and was still enjoyable. <br/><br/>VERDICT: 84/100"
"siddharthhazarika","9","1","4","24 May 2012"," This is it!
","This is what we go to the movies for. For edge of the seat action, intriguing plot and to have a good laugh from time to time. Avengers has it all. Story wise it actually picks up mostly from Thor ended. But be make sure that you have watched Captain America to catch some of the jokes and Iron Man 1 and 2 just to keep up with Tony Stark! Avengers is a very intelligently made piece of work that manages to satiate almost everything that a superhero movie fan craves for. Very well timed humour from the entire cast(especially from Iron Man of course) is actually its biggest strength. When this project was announced, I could not even begin to imagine how the makers would manage to make enough room for so many heavyweights on one canvas. But they do it incredibly well and how! watch it if you already haven't(repeat viewing may be forced) and then also buy yourself a copy when it is released on DVD. That's what I am going to do. :)"
"jonnyfendi","8","1","4","24 May 2012"," The Earth's Mightiest Blockbuster Movie
","Why ""The Avengers"" could easily become a huge success? I think even some of you could answer thiz question. Thiz movie is the culmination of Marvel's hard work over the past couple of years. The lucky guy who was appointed to direct thiz movie is Joss Whedon. The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) initiates the Avengers initiative by assembling all the super humans to save the world from the powerful evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The storyline isn't as dynamic as I think it is, there's a time when the story is stuck and filled with unnecessary dialogue. The power of thiz movie obviously lies in its character interactions. Nick Fury is originally written as a white guy in the comic book but Samuel L. Jackson confidently steps in to play thiz character. Thiz isn't the first time thiz has happened. It reminds me when Michael Clarke Duncan portrayed the overweight crime boss Kingpin in Ben Affleck's ""Daredevil"" (2003) and I'm also so excited to see Laurence Fishburne as Clark Kent's boss Perry White in upcoming Superman's ""Man of Steel"" (2013). However, in thiz case, I didn't see Samuel L. Jackson became Nick Fury, instead it was Nick Fury became Samuel L. Jackson. But in the end, it's totally acceptable. Samuel L. Jackson is able to present a precise leadership aura to his Nick Fury's character. Once again, I have to remind you, what made thiz movie so interesting is when these superheroes gather around and interact with each other. We can see ""The Duo Chris"", Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth who successfully demonstrate their muscular bodies, just like in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) and ""Thor"" (2011). Thiz is how superheroes should look like! The brand new figures in thiz movie are the master archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the elegant Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders who is widely known in ""How I Met Your Mother"" {2005-present}). The other figures who have been introduced since ""Iron Man 2"" are the loyal Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and the sexy heroine Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson has a fairly large part in thiz movie. Wait a minute, on second thought, if you have Scar Jo in tight sexy latex suit, of course you will exploit it more. If we're talking about Iron Man, thiz is also one of the most interesting parts. It looks like Robert Downey Jr. have already fused into thiz Tony Stark's character so deep, he can represent thiz self-centered character very well without any problem. But in thiz movie, the one who really becomes a scene stealer is the giant green rage monster named Hulk! Once again, it's the Hulk's character, not exactly Dr. Bruce Banner or Mark Ruffalo but it's all of them in one. Some fresh and funny moments are obviously when Hulk is around. The most unfortunate thing is that they didn't bring up the original founding team such as Ant-Man and The Wasp into the movie. In the end, I confidently can say Marvel Comics seems to be one step ahead from its competitor DC Comics so far. Recently, thiz movie has ruled the box office chart and it turns out to be the earth's mightiest blockbuster movie. You know what that means, right? Oh yeah, the next Avengers movie will be coming soon. Maybe next time Marvel Studios will enrich their universe with the presence of other superheroes like Quicksilver, Black Panther, Vision, Doctor Strange, She-Hulk, Wolverine, even Spider-Man.

"LukeNickels88","10","1","4","24 May 2012"," The Best Comic Book Movie Ever!!
","OK as a child I grew up reading comics. Every weekend I would go to the book store where they sold these comics. I loved Marvel, they had the best heroes ever. But the Avengers was always my one favorites series. Hulk, Iron Man and Captain America as Earth's Mightiest Heroes in one comic together was a big deal. I always knew they would make this movie but I didn't know it would be such an epic film.<br/><br/>If you watched previous Marvel movies( Iron-Man 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger) you eagerly anticipated that these bigger than life characters would grace the screen and they finally did.<br/><br/>Well heres a summary for the film. Loki has returned to Earth to rule it. But he needs to get the Avengers out of his long hair. At first the Avengers don't really get along, they fight and bicker amongst themselves which is exactly what Loki wants. But once Loki opens up another dimension to destroy Earth, the Avengers Assemble in an epic battle.<br/><br/>Now everyone gave great performances but Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner stole the show much like his other side the Hulk did. The battles were great. The humor was pretty funny. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was once again a high point in the film. I don't like how fans of Joss act like he is some sort of Demi-God but I have to give the man some credit for this film, he really outdid himself. But once the movie is over you have to grasp or pinch yourself because its that epic."

And the movie really focuses on the plot. There were no additional useless scenes, which makes you think of how much of a tremendous work was put into this film. I don't really think there's really anything else to say about this movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet you better go see it! It's truly MARVELous! It's not a disappointment, it is a movie worth money. Fabulous job MARVEL and Disney. I hope the sequel will be as great as this one."
"rawalshadab","10","1","4","23 May 2012"," The True Comic Book Movie
","There's something unique about this movie. It speeds through a complex back story (many back stories actually) and yet makes it work through excellent dialog and even more incredible and often subtle acting. It adds more action than a Michael Bay film but does it right by investing the audience beforehand, not to mention how much better the actual action is. It assembles characters with very uneven powers but manages to make them all shine.<br/><br/>Basically it's excellent. Everything's good in it. But I'll just state the reasons you should see it. The dialog and character interaction is AMAZING. The fight choreography is unrivaled. The comedy is just as incredible as the action and they often intersect beautifully. The cast is excellent. The villain makes the world conquering routine seem fresh (which is not easy to do). The stakes are high but at the same time it's a personal battle. Each of the characters has a different reason for being there and the movie gives them all importance which is one of the most difficult things about ensembles like this. There are even more subtle story arcs that expand the viewers interest in the heroes personalities given them depth while foreshadowing directions for future films in this franchise.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things this movie had to overcome that it did beautifully. For one thing it was the first movie that I know of that attempted to build off of other stand-alone films. It connects them quite well. Then it had to survive the editing room. Apparently over an hour of footage was left out (most probably at the request of the studio). The pacing is still great. It had to live up to fans expectations. Don't know about other fans but I've been collecting comics since I was 8 and this movie blew my mind. Joss Whedon's greatest achievement had to be to introduce these characters to each other, create group tensions and then quickly have them learn to work together. If you pay attention you can see them learn each others rhythms and adapt to each others styles slowly as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed Mark Ruffalo. I was skeptical about this casting choice (even though I really liked him in Shutter Island). I have to say he plays the hulk much more enjoyably than any previous incarnation. While others have always portrayed him in a more clich√©'d ""Jeckyl and Hyde"" style, he plays him with his own technique. He attempts the character of Bruce Banner like a person who's learnt to overcome a crippling addiction/flaw, similar to what a lot of recovering rageaholics (real thing) go through. But the world and Loki seem to be begging him to release ""the other guy"". You truly feel for once, that the Hulk and Bruce Banner are the same person but in very different states of mind, which is how it's supposed to be. He also has a sense of humour about his condition making him more likable than the usual whiny Bruce Banners. His Hulk is just the most amazing character. When the big fight scene happens he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The cinema experience is great. The movie is 2 and a half hours long but just flies by.<br/><br/>What I personally most enjoyed about the movie is that it wasn't shy about being a comic book movie. In fact it celebrated the comic book over the top attitude with everyone and not just fans. There was no humor in this that was an in joke that only fans would get. It pokes fun and shows flaws in its heroes. It makes the hero villain struggle very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Basically this is the movie I've wanted since I was a kid. It's big and it's smart but also didn't have to go to dark and gritty story lines like a lot of other comic book movies (which often feels out of place and humourless to me).<br/><br/>A definite must-see."
"delanos53-170-482861","10","1","4","23 May 2012"," Very Good story, it has a Moral, writing and good acting.
","It's about time. Another movie without senseless violence. It has a moral. Some will claim it's sappy or Clich√©. But I was so in need of a action movie with a moral and a positive theme. I could have done with a little less violence so kids could go. Just a little to much but thankfully not graphic. All in all I loved it. I am also really hoping to see more like it especially anything not a Zombie movie. I don't always agree with Marvel Comics or Stan Lee but on this one I have to give a thumbs up. Now if we can just get some other Genre's with a plot and good acting. Thanks Marvel. OH almost forgot thanks for letting Captain America be Captain America."
"TheXeroXone","8","1","4","22 May 2012"," The Earth's Mightiest Buddy Cop Film.
","I can't help but be a little reminded of Sergio Aragones' take on Marvel Comics where all the marvel characters had gotten together to face off against the Seagoing Soarer, only to be reminded that whenever Marvel comic characters assemble in large numbers they must always fight amongst themselves, regardless of the reason or the consequences.<br/><br/>Its the same with most buddy cop movies. Such introductory films require a little adversarial tension in order for headstrong individualistic alphas to come together and overcome the foe that is bigger than either could handle alone. Lethal Weapon. 48 Hours. Tango and Cash. The Last Boyscout. Red Heat. Etcetera. Etcetera.<br/><br/>This is the same basic formula that the Avengers follows. Its a buddy cop film with more explosions and the Hulk. The animosity here, however, tends to come from the machinations of Loki, and the general distrust of working with a secret organization, albeit one with our best interests in mind.<br/><br/>The characters are not two dimensional caricatures. Each with their own emotional weaknesses and psychological strengths. The development is meager, but adequate for an action film. One moment of blatant Chekov's Gun exists where a character's devotion is called into question and then takes on a ""suicide"" mission at the end of the final battle. I'm not quite willing to call it lazy writing at this point, but it is painfully reminiscent of the ""you're a valued part of the team, too"" episodes that every 80's cartoon series had. Multiple viewings may be needed to come to a final verdict on that minor and relatively unneeded subplot.<br/><br/>The only other minor gripe I had with the film is that there was very few scenes where the heroes worked together in a fight. A couple more well choreographed fight scenes involving multiple heroes would have been welcome, but its nothing more than a minor inconvenience.<br/><br/>The Earth's Mightiest Buddy Cop Film."
"dfranzen70","9","1","4","19 May 2012"," Yup. They did it right.
","Guess I'll come out and say it right away: The Avengers may be the best superhero movie made to date. It has plenty of action, an understandable plot, multiple and discernible heroes, plenty of laughs, and terrific effects. Now, I'll admit it: everyone else seems to be saying the same thing. So do I need to maintain my integrity as an amateur reviewer- person by going against the grain and finding fault with the movie? Or can I feel secure in my own opinion, even if it's shared by fanboys and nonfans alike? (Hint: it's the latter.) Who are The Avengers, anyway? Well, there's Captain America (Steve Rogers), who's actually from the 1940s but was frozen for about seventy years. There's Iron Man (Tony Stark), a man in a weaponized metal suit. There's The Hulk (Bruce Banner), who smashes. There's Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), a superspy with some powers of her own. There's Hawkeye (Clint Barton), a master archer. And then there's Thor, a Norse god. We've been introduced to most of them already through their own films, so they seem like old pals to us. Helps cut down on backstory issues, anyway.<br/><br/>It seems that Loki, the half-brother of Thor, has decided to open up a portal from his side of the universe to Earth itself, thus allowing a rampaging army of aliens to come in and slaughter us wholesale. Colonel Nick Fury, who's been recruiting our heroes to fight as a team, calls everyone in from wherever they were. They don't know each other, except by reputation. Can they stop bickering long enough to save the universe? It is possible.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that our heroes are, well, discernible. This is no small feat, considering how many there are in the movie. Tony Stark is a narcissist. Steve Rogers is an anachronism. Bruce Banner has anger- management issues. Natasha is manipulative; Barton is manipulated. They're simultaneously human and superhuman.<br/><br/>After assembling his team, Fury gives them the skinny. Banner's job is to find the Tesserac's location, an artifact that can produce immense power ‚Äì or be wielded as an immense weapon. Supposedly, the Tesserac is high in gamma radiation, something Dr. Banner knows a little bit about. Meanwhile, the others are tasked with finding Loki, who's quite the badass. All of this is directed by Fury from a flying fortress that also can float. Kind of neat.<br/><br/>Without the burden of needing backstories for everyone, writer/director Joss Whedon is free to throw thrills at us. The fight scenes are plausible and, at times, not at all cartoonish. This means that younger kids (it's a PG-13 movie) might find it a little intense. But there's very little blood, and what's seen is more like scratches on a face, or something. At any rate, although it's an unapologetically violent movie, it's carefully done; the amazing set pieces don't get in the way of a compelling story fraught with plenty of angst and anguish. This is how Transformers should have been.<br/><br/>Boy, is there conflict. It's not as if the superheroes all show up mentally on board with Fury's plan. Not only are some of them mad at him, they snipe a little at each other. Sometimes this is the work of the masterful Loki; sometimes it's the natural difficult of strangers needing to form a cohesive unit.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Nick Fury is a role for which the estimable Samuel L. Jackson was born to play (and which he's played as a cameo in several movies already). Scarlett Johanssen picks up where she left off as Black Widow in Iron Man, and Robert Downey Jr., to no one's surprise, is effortlessly suave and jerkish as Stark. Chris Evans, as the idealistic Captain, and Chris Hemsworth, as the mighty but humbled Thor, are both terrific as well. Mark Ruffalo makes for a quietly intense Banner (and portrayed The Hulk via special effects). Jeremy Renner, seen very briefly in the Thor movie, is Hawkeye, a character with which most of us had had no prior exposure; Renner, however, gives his character so much depth that we're involved in his side story even more than we are with the others.<br/><br/>So why wouldn't you watch this movie? It does have a lot of action, so if you hate that you should skip it. It's over two hours long, so if you don't like to sit, you should also skip it. It has strong female characters, hissable villains, heroes of all sizes, complicated love stories that sit in the background, and the fate of all mankind resting in the balance. Wait, I was supposed to be giving reasons not to watch it. Too bad, I've run out."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","1","4","16 May 2012"," Straight up one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies ever made. SMASHING good time!
","Starting in the Summer of 2008 with the first Iron Man film, and wrapping up with Captain America last July, Marvel finally brings the ""Avengers Initiative"" full circle in high fashion. The Avengers finally arrives, receiving mad critical raves, and smashing box office records (Specifically grossing $207 million dollars opening weekend, more than any movie in history), and all for good reason. The Avengers is straight up one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies ever made. It's the Raiders of the Lost Ark of superhero movies.<br/><br/>Here's the gist of the plot: Exiled god of Asgard Loki returns to Earth, and attacks the base of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division) to retrieve the powerful tesseract, and unleash his vengeance with an army of creatures known as the Chitauri. To fight this new threat, SHIELD director Nick Fury decides to call in the help of sarcastic billionaire Tony Stark (Iron Man), superstrong patriot Steve Rogers (Captain America), ill tempered scientist Bruce Banner (Hulk), Asgardian thunder god Thor, Russian double agent Natasha Romanov (Black Widow), and expert marksman Clint Barton (Hawkeye). Six heroes for the price of one, with an awesome cast and action sequences that would make even Spielberg jealous, all directed by fanboy extraordinaire Joss Whedon?! I want a sequel, now! The achievement that The Avengers represents is simply unprecedented. All of the previous singularly released Avengers movies were wonderful in how they took their time and delivered consistent quality. Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America were all wonderful breaths of fresh air that delivered the laughs and the thrills. Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk may have been slight weak links, but still remained enjoyable. To have The Avengers bring this idea all together so seamlessly is terrific, but it also makes just as good a separate achievement, a heartfelt, hilarious, and exciting ride to behold.<br/><br/>With such a big cast of characters, the fact that they all feel satisfyingly developed is something of a miracle. Not everything is always perfect, but as both a writer and director, Joss Whedon is spot on with how he treats these characters. He gives them all their equal share in the spotlight, and literally NO ONE stands out amongst the others. Robert Downey Jr. is delightfully deadpan and sarcastic as Stark, Chris Evans continues to play a very likable character with Rogers, Chris Hemsworth's Thor is just as fun and hammy as ever, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are aces as Black Widow and Hawkeye, and Tom Hiddleston brings a fantastic villain out of Loki. As for Mark Ruffalo (replacing Edward Norton), his calm and cool personality as Bruce Banner is the perfect opposite for his split personality, and the green muscle man is so awesome - and hilarious - when he finally takes the stage. Hulk smash, and we love him for it! This isn't even mentioning the bravura action sequences. Whedon is smart to not overwhelm the audience with braindead action without first giving an honest emotional investment, and throughout most of the movie, he's smart in how he spreads them out. When the movie's epic 30 minute climax begins, that's when Whedon finally lets it all loose in genuinely, gleefully exciting fashion, complete with stellar visual effects and awesome sound design. Also, this is a really long movie, nearly two and a half hours, but it doesn't even feel that long. I honestly felt like I could have watched it for even longer, maybe even all day. The original cut of this movie was apparently three hours in length, and I would have loved to see that version, just because the whole thing just flies by so smoothly.<br/><br/>With such a great kick off to the Summer movie season, we can only hope that everything else will be at least half as fun. The Avengers is the ultimate in Hollywood nerdvana, and I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>****1/2/ *****"

I confess my motives for watching it were completely perverse, I went to drool over Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr, which i did but the humour it was i remember most. To top things off there was stuff blowing up. Comedy, sex appeal and action. I would definitely recommend going to see it to all those that haven't gone yet (seriously?! dude, you are like a very small minority at the minute, go and watch it!!)"

","The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. <br/><br/>Marc Ruffalo...brilliant and a welcome addition and so much better than the last Hulk - Edward Norton. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon did one hell of a Job directing and writing this original script... the end title sequence is like 20,000 names long... wow. Amazing to think how he was able to juggle that and pull this film off. Highly Recommend!"
"joex-94","9","1","4","19 May 2012"," The Movie That Made Me Believe In Superhero Movies Again!
","Superhero movies. Now that's a name that brings to mind images of clich√©- filled action sequences, non-interesting and non-involving storyline, and either ridiculously bad-ass or plain dumb actor/actress performances. That's what most superhero movies has been as of recently, with a few exceptions. <br/><br/>Now, why should this movie be any different? I mean, this time it's not only one hero, but six (I think at least), so why in h*ll should this be anything else but good-looking yet pointless action times 6? That was a thought that flew through my head, yet so many had said and written so much good about this movie, that I still had to see it. So, I phoned a friend, we booked tickets, and today we went to watch this could-be- good-but-probably-not-so-very-good movie. I had expectations, of course, and they were met all right, with loads to cover them like 10 times or something. Because, needless to say really, I was wrong, horribly wrong.<br/><br/>This movie has all this would-be eye-candy action that can make a movie look awesome, but that's about it. But, this movie had so much more. It had dept, it had personality and it had a sound and believable identity. And most of all, it had a story. Not the best one in history, but more than good enough to keep you glued to the seat for the major part of the movie. The action packed scenes and stunning visuals did the rest of that job.<br/><br/>So, now I've given you my story of this encounter with a turn-point in my life, and it really have been. I went in somewhat excited yet skeptical, and came out a believer. Because that certainly is the case. I have had renewed faith in superhero movies, because this movie, The Avengers, has shown me that this genre still have the ability to deliver. Now,I'm not saying that this will automatically become the best movie of the year overall, but it will definitely be a worthy candidate."
"FSfilmblog","8","1","4","19 May 2012"," Great fun which exceeds expectations but disappoints as it doesn't live up to all the hype...
","So here we are now. After years of development and a few film establishing the main characters, we get to see a team of superheroes being, well, a superhero super group. My initial response was of dread as I could not see it working well but to my surprise it is one of the most entertaining films of the year.<br/><br/>With Earth being under attack from dastardly villain Loki and his evil plot to rule Earth and its inhabitants, it is down to Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) to pull together his group of superheroes to save the human race. Luckily for those of you who have seen all the individual films, the need for each characters origin and development is unnecessary as they have been fully established in their own stories.<br/><br/>The film does start off very well and establishes a plot (although very well worn) about an attempt by Loki (main villain from Thor), to take a mysterious cube (the Tesseract) which harnesses a power that can open a teleport/wormhole to allow an alien army which he commands to take over the world. Even with this simplistic and over familiar storyline the film has many entertaining moments and is littered with loads of Whedons trademark witty one liners.<br/><br/>The one truly great thing about this film is how well it manages all the superheroes characters and never does one character feel like it's just a film about them with a few extra superheroes tagging along. Each one of them have a similar amount of screen time and a specific purpose which drives the plot forward. Another thing is that the guy behind the film (Whedon) knows his material and creates a loving, authentic and workable story which means each character never feels like a bit character. A very balanced juggling act which allows the stars to shine and show their unique personalities.<br/><br/>The only minor criticism I would give is the over hype that this picture has garnered by many and judging by it's box office record breaking takings, people are going in their droves to see what all the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong, the film is good but not an all time classic. The plot is nothing new, and the alien invasion at the climax of the film is a bit reminiscent of Transformers 3, and a team that doesn't get on but eventually stand together and realize a common enemy, all very clich√©d."

I wanted to tell the world how great it is and still do and this is the best way. For every epic moment there is something hilarious to follow it up. I came out with the thought that every one of the super heroes was a total bada** and Samuel L. Jackson is awesome too he gets s*** done. I read some of the bad reviews and most say that there is no real emotion but if you actually pay attention you can see small things that make sense and relate to history and stuff.

","On hearing the news and only that Joss Whedon would undertake the risky venture of five super heroes collection, each ""Diva"" and in his own franchise (except the Hawkeye's Jeremy Renner), in an all-for-all cinematic achievement, I knew immediately (like millions of other Marvel geeks) that his heart was in place and the balance in the universe would be restored now - nobody knows how to handle the geek material better than the actual arch-geek who inspired the ""Toy Story"" and gave the world the ""Buffy"". And he knows not to disappoint his audience. The ""Avengers"" succeeds where they failed individual films of heroes that includes (with the exception of Iron Man, Thor and the Captain America) incredible hulk and others.The Thor with ego the size of the galaxy against all mortals, the Captain America of the innocent patriotism of 40s to fall victim autocratic cynicism of Tony Stark and all trembling with the green monstrous alter ego of Bruce Banner.The ""Avengers"" is the dream of the average comic buff come true, a perfect fantasy adventure with a record (in kind), humor and action levels you expect ( and much more) 10/10"

It has humor, but not too much, and enough awesome action to live up to the enormous hype surrounding it. I've notices that sometimes, high budget comic book movies have good CGI but bad acting, or vise versa. Not the case with this movie. All the characters were amazing, even most of the supporting cast which doesn't usually happen in a movie like this. I was sad when it ended. Do I recommend it? YES!!!! Go see it if you haven't already... I guarantee it's worth it. I didn't see it in 3D so I can't say how good the 3D is."

The characters all jump back into action except this time they are assembling their powers to form a team that cannot be beat. The movie takes a little time to refresh you on any character development you may have forgotten and then it jumps right into the team building experience. It takes a while for these superheros to learn how to use their powers together to help one another, but once they learn how they are a force to be reckoned with. <br/><br/>Once the action scenes start, it doesn't slow down and you have yourself a good hour or more of solid action of buildings blowing up, the hulk smashing everything, and so much more.<br/><br/>Calling a movie the best movie ever is almost used too much that the saying loses credibility, but trust me on this, The Avengers seriously is the best movie yet!

"seaview1","9","1","4","16 May 2012"," Whedon Assembles a Mighty AVENGERS
","In the 1960s, Marvel Comics pioneered mature story lines for its super heroes, of whom many have been successfully adapted into blockbuster films (Spiderman). The Avengers were a group with individual icons like Iron Man who had already established identities contrary to The Fantastic Four and X Men. Marvel began to feature stand alone films that methodically built this core of characters, and several years later, it has culminated in The Avengers, a thoroughly entertaining adventure that never fails to engage and 'marvel' its intended audience. As orchestrated by versatile writer/director and comic book fan Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the results set a high standard in filmic super heroics; it's nirvana, a comic lover's dream come true.<br/><br/>The Tesseract is a cube with unknown powers and coveted by the fiendish Loki, Thor's half brother. Kept for study by SHIELD, the elite security agency, (and once possessed by The Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger), the cube can open a doorway to another dimension. When Loki steals the cube to unleash a demon army and conquer the earth, the SHIELD agents are no match for his supernatural powers. What to do? Who ya gonna call? <br/><br/>Well, there's nothing like 'puttin' the band together' for the first time. Assembled by SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and aided by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), the Avengers Initiative sought to collect special operatives in the event of an insurmountable threat that was beyond human response. These Avengers comprise of six extraordinary individuals: an otherworldly warrior, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a genetically enhanced superhuman from the past, Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans), a meek scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and his anger induced, gamma radiated monster, The Hulk; inventor Tony Stark, in super armor as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and two SHIELD agents, master archer Hawkeye, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and top assassin Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson). <br/><br/>When Loki's legion of soldiers descend on Manhattan, it's 'Avengers Assemble' time. Drawn by remarkable circumstances and led by Captain America, it's teamwork at its finest as The Avengers battle these nasty hordes to save the earth. <br/><br/>After initially bickering and fighting each other, it is fascinating to witness such disparate personalities coalesce into a fighting unit as they flow from self to selflessness. This film can stand on its own for newbies not familiar with the previous films, but it certainly does not hurt to have seen Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk. Whedon and company neatly tie the threads of those films together with sufficient focus given to each hero's personal life. We learn some interesting background on Romanoff and Barton, who you think would be outmatched by their superhuman colleagues, but they more than hold their own and figure prominently in the explosive climax. Rogers, the honorable, idyllic soldier, has to adjust to a world like a modern day Rip Van Winkle. Dr. Banner keeps his anger at bay, but what will that mean for the Avengers if it can't be controlled? Whedon also cleverly includes familiar supporting characters e.g. Stark's assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), from other the films.<br/><br/>All the stars perform ably including Tom Hiddleston who is appropriately devious as Loki. Downey, who clearly improvised much of his dialogue, has a rousing, good time. Jackson embodies Fury as the manipulative leader who does whatever it takes to safeguard humanity.<br/><br/>This is the third movie version of The Hulk, and while Ruffalo does a very good job as the sensitive and haunted Banner, his alter ego beast actually behaves so unpredictably that some of his actions become comedic and the results are a riot. To say more would spoil some hilarious moments. The filmmakers got this Hulk right. <br/><br/>A couple things don't quite add up like how does The Hulk decide to be a do-gooder at a critical moment? Who is the mysterious Council (resembling the Syndicate from The X Files) that SHIELD answers to, and what are their intentions? There are, however, nice touches like the Stark building in the finale and what is left of its logo as an obvious tribute to the Avengers. When the grand showdown is imminent, there is a marvelous circular shot of the Avengers that is iconic. <br/><br/>When the evil army attacks, one is reminded of Ghostbusters and the apocalyptic scenes of Superman II and any Transformers film. Whedon, though, never forgets to include intimate moments and details. Although each Avenger gets a heroic moment to shine, the film never loses sight of personal loss amid the spectacle. The film is also about self sacrifice, and people do perish in this film including a major character. <br/><br/>Despite a 143 minute running time, the film is full of subplots and well-paced action, and every bit of the enormous, effects laden budget is on the big screen. The Avengers is perhaps not the best super hero film ever made, The Dark Knight being the apex, but it is the most complete, entertaining, multi-hero film to date. The question now is what do you do for an encore, and how can anyone hope to top let alone match this achievement? It would require the abilities of a James Cameron or Peter Jackson, or maybe studio executives can plead for Whedon's return. Let's hope so. (Do stay for the end credits for a double dose treat.)"
"MikesIDhasbeentaken","8","1","4","16 May 2012"," Well done Joss Whedon
","You can't argue with that! OK so it's sounds pretty hard to mess up this kind of film, with the budget and history behind it. But Hollywood has messed up these films many times before (... hulk... twice...)so would this be any different? Yes. It is different, more so than you'd think.<br/><br/>Firstly, the action scenes are some of the best action scenes i've seen, the transformer battle sequences are truly pathetic in comparison.<br/><br/>Then there's the comedy, and I defy anyone not to laugh out loud while watching this film at least 3 times, the hulk steals the show here (his scene with Loki one of the funniest moment of the film).<br/><br/>Just everything worked with this film, and one i'd gladly watch a few times over. There's finally a big budget film that actually delivers! SO as I said, Well done Joss Whedon."

"alicep-372-681969","9","1","4","16 May 2012"," Review on ""The Avengers""
","I went to see the movie on the third day of it's release after the whole internet was buzzing about it. Well, I submitting to the buzz! The movie isn't simply good- it's AWESOME! With the unpredictable plot, I could only guess that at the avengers will win in the end. The actors played their part realistically, and the special effects only added fuel to the scene. I absolutely love how characters that have had their own debut have been put together, to cooperate on something more epic then what they have brought as solo. The movie features characters from ""Iron Man,""""Thor,""""The Hulk,""""Black Widow,""""Captain America: the first avenger,""and a Marvel comics character ""Hawkeye."" The Avengers are summoned up by a secret agency called ""Shield,"" dealing with highly dangerous villains. The team is needed when a cube which contains unlimited power (entitled the Tesseract) is stollen from Shield's secret base. The one that stole the Tesseract is a particular Norse God of Mischief, featured in ""Thor,"" names Loki. As it occurs, Loki has come to Earth, to take over and control the planet, and the Tesseract is needed to open a portal that would invite his army to the party. I have seen ""Thor,"" and my impression on the movie wasn't as positive, I found it rather boring and unrealistic in terms of special effects and costumes. As well as back in ""Thor,"" the characters seemed plain and bordering lacking of any kind of interest in them. Unlike in the ""Avengers,"" Loki returns twice as evil, finally resembling the mischief that he is the god of. He seems to know exactly what he wants, and lives of 'pathetic mortals' as he calls humans, does not bother him. In fact, there are moments in the movie, where the actor demonstrates the character so perfectly that it is a sealed impression of him. The way Loki deviously smirks, looking savage and insane. Yet his speech proclaims him a ruler, as he yells at humans to kneel before him. Tom Hiddleston (the actor the played Loki) has perfectly presented his character.<br/><br/>Captain America (played by Chris Evans) stays fond of who he is proclaimed. He is a brave, fearless soldier, and his display of leadership is highlighted in battle scenes of the movie. Iron Man a.k.a Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) is the one that makes people laugh during the movie. A character full of sarcasm who doesn't play well in a group, and has a huge ego doesn't even try to be nice to whoever it is near him. The movie is definitely worth watching! P.S- Marvel has announced the sequel of The Avengers, scheduled to 2015!"

","Joss Whedon, who has made a name in television, namely for ANGEL (tv, 1999-2004), FIREFLY (tv, 2002-2003), and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (tv, 1996-2003), as well as having written the screenplays of TOY STORY (1995), ALIEN: RESURRECTION (1997), TITAN A.E. (2000), and the concurrently showing CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012), establishes himself as a full-fledged director with a big bang. THE AVENGERS features an array of box office stars, fantastic special effects and tightly-directed action scenes, with a sprinkling of dramatic moments and comedic relief (mostly from Robert Downey Jr's wisecracks and Clark Gregg's gay-like adulation of Chris Evans' character). The major players (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Incredible Hulk) are introduced briefly but markingly, and from the onset you know Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has his hands full, bringing together this group of superheroes with flamboyantly clashing personalities. The tesseract, a cosmic cube of debatable origins that has unlimited powers, has been stolen, and Fury assembles the Avengers to retrieve this cube. Villainy is provided deliciously by Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Gwyneth Paltrow is a welcome addition (from Downey's IRON MAN films) -- as well as Colbie Smulders, making her Marvel film debut as Agent Maria Hill. Only the last third of the film loses steam, with one vaguely wondering why the robots-attack- city scenario is oddly familiar (TRANSFORMERS, anyone?). An ambiguous ending also mars the otherwise energetic proceedings, with Thor accosting his brother Loki back to Asgard. Alan Silvestri's vivid musical score adds to the kinetic frenzy, and Seamus McGarvey's cinematography is impressive. Whedon has crafted a well-crafted action movie with much visceral excitement and an earnest cast."
"southbase","6","1","4","12 May 2012"," Pummeling, fanboyish 1st half, much better themed 2nd half
","Clippy, extremely lore-crammed launch of the first major big-screen Marvel Comics teamup goes a little too much into the anime-type features and weaponry of the SHIELD spy agency and its monochromatic personnel during its first half but soon settles into a huge yet decently Medea-theme-motivated exploration of the superhero identity, and an occasionally funny action film based upon several evolving lines of the comic characters' histories (non-readers who know little if anything of the arcane intricacies of the Marvel Amazing Fantasy/Strange Tales/Tales of Suspense/Ultimate Avengers lines will find this a bit of a slog) as SHIELD's eyepatched lead agent Nick Fury's agency's base is invaded by the Norse god/trickster, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who steals a new intergalactic energy cube called the Tessaract for the invading alien race called the Chitauri. Fury, with the help of the slinky, red-headed Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) organizes the participation of a small group of terrrestrials/magnates/scientists better known as the Hulk (a pleasantly-greyed Mark Ruffalo)/Iron Man/Thor (the sturdy Chris Hemsworth)/Captain America a.k.a. the Avengers, who recently had a variety of individual adventures but are now needed to defeat Loki and send the Chitauri back to their interdimensional plane. The film's unexplained, insistently locale-centered structuring‚Äîweaving from a destroyed SHIELD hidden land base to their floating battleship called a helicarrier, where the Avengers collect and argue their theories‚Äîseems almost at cross-purposes at times from the charmingly insultive, rowdy, obdurate band of costumed characters getting some help from the crunching sound-effects and punchy yet glacial camera-work. Director Joss Whedon is not David Lean or even Superman I's Richard Donner (he doesn't seem to know how to subtly build grand and stacked sequences or use scale into centered release points for the audience to invite them into constant rousing applause for these 'heroes'). But Whedon does evoke a non-cynical appreciation of these characters minds (Chris Evans' Captain America is as much a straight shooter as straight arrow) and hearts (Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/cardiac-wounded Iron Man probably comes off the most believable considering he had two full screen adventures of his own, yet the character's mogulistic resources‚Äîenough to bankrupt several continents‚Äîbeggar the question as to why he would need SHIELD at all instead of starting his own superhero gang), and their clear-cut stagings and streaking, powerful choreography even during the most complicated effects scenes does make the appropriate impact. Once the Avengers assemble to defend New York City against a final invasion of giant slug-like creatures and Chitauri attackers THE AVENGERS illustrates the dichotomy of current genre epics, written for tween or undiscriminating audiences yet grandly casting decently talented actors in noble roles for the staying power of a halfway legitimate drama, and settling for digital-image glorification of a superhero costume instead."

","Minor spoilers ahead. If ever there's a movie for shedding tears of joy, this would be it. The beauty of seeing a long-term plan come to fruition has a satisfaction hard to replicate in any other fashion. That's the feeling you'll get after watching ""The Avengers"". Marvel's ambitious venture of building up a five-movie saga in anticipation of one grand epic, which ties a ribbon on those movies while simultaneously paving the way for future endeavors, not only pays huge dividends, but blows up the screen with pure amazement during the process. There's a certain awe to behold when watching montage fight scenes seamlessly transition from Captain America's ground-level assault to Iron Man's fly-by attacks to Hulk's crushing of gigantic enemies. There's a sense that they've got each other's back, that they're truly fighting as one team. That's the magic that drives ""The Avengers"" to heightened plateaus of superhero storytelling. These Avengers have been assembled for this purpose and show that nothing can stop them if they work together. It's during those scenes that make you think ""This is what I've been waiting for."" Makes you feel like the kid who fell in love with these stories when first reading the comics. It's a good thing the superheroes finally start working from the same playbook, because the weight of imminent failure is lurking. Loki returns as the evil leader, and he's more power hungry and bent on world control than ever. Like any superhero movie, the bad guy's quest to control the world is at the forefront. But there's realism and a dark nature to Loki that creates a sense of peril and pressure to the task of stopping him. It requires sacrifice, something some of the Avengers need to learn. Loki is truly twisted, believing that mankind needs a ruler so it can be ""free of freedom"" (it actually gets a little thought provoking). Throughout the movie, there's an unsettling feeling of the grand sinister plot, not just a gimmick that most shallow bad guys cling to. ""The Avengers"" is a little darker than the other movies. Tons of destruction ensues as the scope of the grand battle covers all of Manhattan and takes casualties along the way. Even the backup plan of a nuclear missile wiping out everything comes into play. The humor that has made the characters lovable and entertaining is present and accounted for. It was a tough balancing act to get the interactions between all the superheroes to seem fitting, but director Joss Whedon concocts the perfect mixture of screen time and blends all the superheroes together brilliantly. Yes, tensions even arise as Iron Man and Thor duke it out. From Nick Fury giving Hulk the order to smash to Tony Stark calling Coulson by his first name, ""Agent"", there's plenty of laughs from everyone, none of which are contrived (okay, some are, but not any more than any of the other Marvel films, which is a good thing). During some of those interactions, a lot is learned about the superheroes. There's some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye that was sorely needed. Bruce Banner has some moments in the sun (side note: Edward Norton was a better Banner, but Mark Ruffalo did a good job). Captain America steps up to be the leader he was meant to be. At times, it seemed like the movie could (and maybe even should've) piggy back on anyone of these stories and flesh it out a little more, but Whedon did a good job of keeping the movie's somewhat broad focus on target. Special effects were top-notch. The art design of enemies for the final battle was creative and organic. Music was stellar. Actually, it was cool when the musical theme would get switched up a little depending on which superhero was fighting at that particular moment. Indeed, the long wait was worth it. ""The Avengers"" reaches its potential and brings out the giddiness and excitement we've all had for these superhero movies. One last note: There are two end-of-credit scenes, so stay all the way through. One gives a glimpse of what is to come in future movies (there'd better be more of them) and the other is simply a perfect capper."
"ijolvera","7","1","4","7 May 2012"," A Great Summer Film!
","A must watch superhero movie! Overall its pretty good and very action packed. The few problems I would say that kept this movie from being perfect are some character inconsistencies and the need for a stronger antagonist. The chemistry between all the characters was great although I would say they got a bit cheesy sometimes. I would also have liked to see more back story regarding Hawkeye and the Black Widow. Most of the movie is shot on the aircraft carrier and in my opinion it did not really pick up until the final scenes. The turning point of the film seemed a bit exaggerated to me as well. The film did do a good job giving each character enough time on screen to really show the diversity of the super heroes. The set pieces were very elaborate and I was never visually unsatisfied. Overall it was a great film!"
"theindustry","7","1","4","7 May 2012"," A Thrilling Ride
","This new superhero flick by ""Marvel"" is quite good. Being a fan of many past Marvel movies, I feel that director Joss Whedon did give most comic book fans a film that they will remember. It is packed with action, costumed superheroes, villains, gadgets, plot-twists, witty dialogue - much like a well written comic strip. However, for those not entirely familiar with the heroes, as well as those who are looking for a more serious plot, they won't find anything deep in this flick. It is, as Roger Ebert put it, ""The Westminster Dogshow of superheroes."" The production team incorporates myriads of digital visual and sonic effects to give film-goers the biggest bang for their buck.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, children will find it very exciting, as will most Marvel aficionados. If you are a sucker for a pleasing Friday-night flick, with not too much to offer other than a thrilling, star-studded adventure, and a number of humorous jests by Robert Downey Jr. this is certainly for you.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","All right, everyone knows this movie is awesome and can't be improved without taking away from what made it awesome. So we need to focus on how to make the sequel just as awesome. So we know Thanos will be the next guy to fight but... OK obviously (even though he's sometimes lame but superbly human) is Ant-man Pym and the Wasp. Need the Wasp because we've now evolved that women can kick ass as much as men and we can't be so unbalanced that Black Widow takes all the credit. But Pym...the abusive husband that can make himself big has a lot of potential, especially when the seemingly undersized Hulk puts him in his place. We have a good half hour there of a sequel. So let's get other ideas to feed Joss Wheedon so he can keep on avenging!!!"

","My only complaint about this excellent action movie with strong female characters (Marvel, can we PLEEEASE have a Black Widow movie now??? What's her story??? We want to know! She's interesting!) is that it did not pass the Bechdel Test.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know this test, it's three simple questions: 1) Were there two or more female characters with names? 2) Did they speak to each other at any time? 3) If yes on #2, did they speak to each other about something other than a man?<br/><br/>The bad news is that this movie does not pass this test. But good writing is good writing... and it was so satisfying to see the story overflow with character development, cooperation and friendships. It was great seeing gorgeous Black Widow holding the team at the center as a woman (okay, an ass-kicking woman), with no fuss or sexism, just plain old everyday respect, fighting her own battles, and still be able to have a personal moment full of heart and soul.<br/><br/>Read my essay, ""The Perilous Pumps of Pepper Potts,"" about heroines, feet, and the two main women in this movie at http://wanderingpie.blogspot.com/2012/05/avenge-this.html"
"lx-sosna","9","1","4","6 May 2012"," Most fun, crowd-pleasing movie in years!
","The Avengers is the most fun, crowd-pleasing movie I've seen in years. Its no wonder Marvel's The Avengers shattered the box office record with over 200,000,000 dollars domestic this weekend. It's barely been out and its made half a billion dollars. The Avengers has been around for about 50 years and after 5 movies leading up to this, the Avengers delivers. The theater was a mad house when I saw it Saturday. There were little kids and old people as well. This movie is great for all ages. The older people finally get to see the super heroes they grew up with finally on the big screen and the little kids will get great role models to look up to. The movie puts great emphasis on how teamwork results in victory. The character development is great. Each superhero gets enough screen time, but the Hulk steels the show and is sure to be everyone's favorite. The best moments in the movie are when the Hulk is on screen. They did a good job on showing how Captain America assumed the leader position on the team. Iron Man/ Tony Stark is witty as always and Thor is also cool. The team is balanced and everyone, even puny Hawk Eye and Black Widow, contributes. This movie has it all. Great action, character development, comedy, and story. It can be a little cheesy but in a good way. There are moments when the whole theater will laugh, clap and cheer. Its a fun way to start off summer. I know I'm picking this up as soon as it hits the shelves. Along with Spiderman 2 and Dark Knight, the Avengers is one of the best superhero movies to date. Can't wait for number 2!"
"addiewhiz","8","1","4","6 May 2012"," Great film to open up the summer
","When I first saw the trailer for The Avengers, I was a little worried that it would just end up being a large special effects feature. Part of this is because this film has so many big name actors who play so many important roles, that one would worry that there would be little character development. However, this film did not fail me, as it kept me on the edge of my seat for all two hours.<br/><br/>Despite all of the big names playing big roles, I felt that the characters in this movie all seemed to interact quite well with each other. This is especially true regarding the conflict that arises between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. Both personalities fit the superhero they belonged to and both were able to interact well with each other.<br/><br/>I feel that Joss Whedon was the perfect director for this film as it was very in-keeping with his style. Even in the most action packed scenes, the superheroes managed to crack a few jokes will still seeming as though they were taking the crisis seriously and still sticking to the personality and ethos of their character.<br/><br/>This is a modern superhero film, to the standards of the special effects were set quite high early on. This film without question, met those standards. When large objects would collide, it actually looked like the objects had considerable momentum and were striking other objects with considerable force. Along with having a satisfying story, this film is great eye-candy. <br/><br/>Such a difficult film, is however, not without a few flaws. First is that Nick Fury is supposed the be a brilliant leader, but with so many big characters, it was difficult for Samuel Jackson's acting to shine through. The other problem is that Loki is supposed to be a brilliant mastermind, but he never acts like it. He simply comes off as a villain who was power-hungry, and in the end was consumed by his own ego. My final problem is one that may possibly explained with more knowledge of the Marvel Universe, but I find it a little difficult to foresee that. All along, Loki's plan inside SHIELD's ship was to make Bruce Banner lose control of himself and become The Hulk. This did in fact happen. However, when in Manhattan, Banner was suddenly able to harness his powers to fight against Loki in a relatively controlled way that involved taking orders from Captain America. I simply do not see how he is loses control in Hulk form in one instance and is able to control himself in another instance. These however are small issues and do not take much away from the overall quality of the movie.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is definitely a good movie that hopefully preps us for what is about to come soon in The Dark Knight Rises. I intend to see this film again after some time, and I am guessing that I will probably enjoy it."
"zetes","8","1","4","6 May 2012"," Excellent, though they could have done better with the bad guys
","Loki has come to Earth and stolen an ancient artifact that will give him unlimited power. S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers a group of superheroes, which they call the Avengers, to defeat the evil. Okay, the villains and their goals are kind of lame (disappointing because Loki was a great villain in Thor - although, I must say, Tom Hiddleton is still very good in the role), but the focus of this film is mostly the superheroes. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye - with all of these guys, this movie should be a total mess. But the screenwriters (Joss Whedon & Zak Penn) have handled it beautifully, meting out dozens of great moments for all of them, not letting any one of them take over (although the Hulk almost does just because he's so awesome - funny, as he's never had a successful solo movie) nor fall behind, and never seeming too hard like it's trying to do that. There are times when the film is too thick with exposition, but the characters and the actors are all so good that it rarely drags (there's one long sequence where a bunch of characters are fighting amongst themselves that I thought felt a tad forced). The heroes' personalities and histories are utilized in impressive ways - I especially love the way they use Captain America's datedness (one particularly hilarious gag - and Whedon does a great job with the comic moments - has Captain America feeling overjoyed at finally getting a reference when someone refers to The Wizard of Oz). That this movie is anywhere near as good as it is is something of a miracle. It's pretty much the perfect summer movie - everything else this summer is going to have a lot to live up to."
"mitesh-sahu","9","1","4","6 May 2012"," ""The Avengers"" kicked all the bottoms but...""HULK IS THE STRONGEST THERE IS!!!!""
","The meanest and most awesome comic-book-flick I've seen in a long time. The Avengers has it all.I am a very big 'HULK' fan and that's what shows in the movie along with the title of this review I am writing. It only falls short of the Christopher Nolan directed ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>The cast of characters is very good... ""unparalleled"" to be exact, as I liked Edward Norton(in The Incredible Hulk-2008) more cause he did portray ""Puny Banner"" better, trust me when I say because he resembles the most with the original Bruce Banner(or the ""Puny Banner"" that's what the Hulk calls him) in the comics. What can I say, Ed Norton did not sign a longer contract with Marvel :(. <br/><br/>Now lets get to the movie(No spoilers for people who have not seen this movie cause I really want everyone to see it). Nick Fury knows that the world is under threat and he plans to defend it with everything and anything he has. He has got one Scientist who can become a ""Noble Laurette"" in a subject in one night, he has a Super Soldier who woke up after eight decades, one Demi-God who controls thunder-and-lightening, one sexy-super-hot-spy who would do anything for what she believes, a guy with exceptional killing skills who could shoot a bird from a mile with a bow and arrow and ""THE INCREDIBLE HULK"". Loki played by Tom Hiddlestone is perfect(just not as menacing as the comic books). However the movie unfolds with unknown enemies from the sky like the ones never seen before and more. This movie is about not one man or superhero(though it begs to be). What I mean is if ""The Hulk"" is taken out dunno who would have won(I am definitely biased here, you see I heard the most whistles and applaud when Bruce Banner came back to Manhattan on a bloody old motor bike in ragged clothes both the times I went to see the movie) and I agree with them.<br/><br/>For those who came in late please watch all the movies I am listing here Hulk(2003), The Incredible Hulk(2008), Iron Man(2008), Iron Man 2(2010), Captain America(2011) and Thor(2011). You need to see all the titles to know what is happening and please please please don't forget to see the end credits as Marvel packs a punch in the end(post credits scene), those are the most important scenes if you want to follow a series finale such as ""The Avengers"".<br/><br/>I am waiting for Iron Man-3, Thor-2 and ""The Hulk - Reboot series from Marvel"" before another Hulk movie in 2015(possibly). Sorry Mark Ruffalo but Ed Norton was more convincing screaming ""HULK SMASH..."" than you however you did a great job taking over from him. ""Hats Off"" to Josh Whedon for this awesome flick I witnessed.<br/><br/>Looking for more from you Josh :). 9/10 for your effort."
"mjw1011","10","1","4","6 May 2012"," Avengers review
","I'm not going to try to win everyone over by giving my review a cheesy over-done headline. I'm not also going to try to persuade you by comparing this movie to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. I am a fan of both DC and Marvel Comics. when people do so, it drives me nuts. So I'm not going to give a review bashing the other like a lot of ""fans"" on here. so that being said; The Avengers is a great movie. All the movies that lead up to this film made this one a fantastic start to what could be an even better new saga. From the get-go, this movie starts out with what the rest of it will bring. I for one think sometimes 2 1/2 hours for a movie is a little drawn out, and very few times i have sat through a movie that long and felt I was short changed. It is very entertaining, very funny, and full of action. Joss Whedon truly lifted these characters from the pages of the comic into real life. Go see the movie, I saw it in 3-D IMAX, but to be honest any form of this movie is going to be just as great. If you enjoyed the last (actual) Marvel movies that lead us to this point, you definitely wont be disappointed.Stay for at least the first after credit footage, If you're an Avenger comic fan like I am, you will grin from ear to ear."
"cthulu17","10","1","4","6 May 2012"," The Avengers: Delivering the goods
","If I was to describe the Avengers in a single word it would be this: Nirvana. The film wants for nothing. There's action, story, character development, and well placed humor bits. It's everything we were promised and nothing we weren't. You want super hero conflicts? You got 'em. You want gratuitous amounts of action? You got it. You want Stan a Lee Cameo? Better question: could it be an Avenger movie at this point without one? You want Hulk Smash? You bet your sweet candy ass Hulk Smash! There are a few nit-picky things that I could say about the movie, but they all fall wildly short of what the movie gets right. This movie is a rock star affair from start to finish, with the screen play by Joss Whedon (geeks try to hold it together), and visual and sound effects done by none other than Weta studios and Skywalker light and sound.<br/><br/>You already know the cast, we all know the score. So its time to strap in and enjoy the ride. And you had best strap in since the pace for avengers after the intro sequence is somewhere between frenetic and murderous. There really is no lull in the story or the action that lasted longer than my attention span, and that's saying something for a man with ADHD. There really is an awful lot crammed into that 2 hours and 23 minutes and believe me they make use of damn near every second. With so many stars though, it is true that some character development got sacrificed, most notably for Hawkeye, but it seems to have done very little to diminish the film as a whole.<br/><br/>In a somewhat cross-related issue, the substitution of Mark Ruffalo for Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk was a much welcome change in my opinion. The skinny around town is that Norton wanted more money than Marvel was willing to put up and negotiations broke down. Bet he'll be kicking himself in the ass for that choice come Monday. Especially considering how many fans of the hulk this film is likely to generate. But I've always found Norton to be a little annoying and Ruffalo does a great job, but that's just my opinion. All the other characters are amazing too, Cap is great, Iron Man steals the stage whenever he can (but not as much as I thought he would) and Thor actually levels out a bit to make a fuller transition from brash youth to wise veteran warrior.<br/><br/>A final word on 3D and IMAX: See it in IMAX 3D, it's absolutely astounding! Catch the matin√©e showing if you have to, but don't miss your chance because it really does impact the cinematic experience. And as always STAY AFTER THE CREDITS and I do mean STAY AFTER ALL THE CREDITS. Seriously, YOU WON""T WANT TO MISS IT.<br/><br/>Peace out.<br/><br/>So will Avengers change the entire world as we know it? No, probably not. But it will set a precedent and a higher standard for all other films to follow."
"phantomshark3","Null","1","4","6 May 2012"," Not just a great super-hero movie
","I went into this with guarded optimism- let's face it, the movies that led up to it were fun but nothing more. But after seeing this movie, it not only gets my nod for best super-hero movie ever, it's probably going right into my top 10 all-time movies.<br/><br/>Director Whedon has proved that he can take intense action, witty dialogue, and some real emotion and tie them all together into a package that never feels forced. Too often ensemble movies like this try too hard to manufacture tension between members, or artificially manufacture importance for one character at the expense of another, but everything here flows. The Avengers have always involved internal conflict, and the movie portrays it perfectly without going over the top or under-playing it at any point. It's also obvious that there is real love and respect for the characters, as it all feels true to how they were originally written. In all ways, a true winner."

","The Avengers has been years in the making. The budget, cast, director, and storyline show just how much effort has been put into this movie. The graphics are unbeatable. The director was able to bring life to the characters while making the film as fast-passed as it needed to be. To top it off, the cast bill consisted of Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, and many more. The storyline was unlike anything I have seen in a superhero movie before (although it did remind me of Chronicle at times).<br/><br/>The only problem with The Avengers is the script that Joss Whedon wrote. He may be a great director, but that does not mean he should also be a screenwriter. With such talented actors, far too many lines were simplified or dropped completely. At times, the dialogue just feels like filler until the action starts again. However, there is one upside to having Joss Whedon do the screenplay: he's quite funny. From a remark about Legalas to plenty of Hulk jokes, he knows how to make a theatre roll with laughter.<br/><br/>One of the fears that comes with making a beloved book/comic book into a movie is that it will be difficult to follow if you are not a fan. I, for one, have never picked up a comic book in my life. Aside from minor aspects (the scene after the credits, the science behind superpowers, etc.), there is almost nothing in The Avengers that will trip you up. There is even enough backstory in the first hour of the movie that you don't need to have seen the five ""prequels.""<br/><br/>With a $200 million opening weekend, The Avengers will likely go down as one of the highest grossing movies of all time‚Äînext to Star Wars IV, Star Wars I, Titanic, The Dark Knight, and Avatar. Although The Avengers fits in well with these movies, it is rather unique. The studio behind this movie‚ÄîUniversal‚Äîwas able to manufacture this monster of a film by carefully crafting teaser movies over the past several years. It is quite unlike anything the movie industry has ever seen. The Avengers may not be the best movie out there, but it will be known as a game-changer in the movie industry. Expect movie ""teaser movies"" and ""manufactured blockbusters"" in the years ahead.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, the only people who shouldn't see this movie are those who don't like action movies. The Avengers is nowhere close to being one of the best movies of the year. However, it will go down in history. Not only as a movie that smashed box office records, but as the movie that changed the meaning of blockbuster. Like ""Jaws"" and ""Towering Inferno"" of the 1970s, this movie will change the course of Hollywood and how studios vie for the top spot at the box office.<br/><br/>reillyreviews.wordpress.com"

","""The Avengers"" (2012) is the newest film from Marvel Studios / Disney Studios with the classic superheroes, directed by Joss Whedon (from TV series ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") and starring multiple characters from other movies, together, for the first time: Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/The Hulk), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury).<br/><br/>The film follows the ending hook given after the credits of ""Thor"" in 2011 (just a note, there is also one in this movie, but before the credits, for a sequence of Avengers), with the cube Tesseract of ""Captain America"" ‚Äã‚Äã(2011) being in the hands of SHIELD that analyzes it, and Loki (""Thor"") being the main villain who seeks it, and that is brought to Earth by its activation, so that with the help of a mysterious ally and his inter-dimensional army he cans conquer and actually dominate the Earth as a ruler.<br/><br/>Due to these growing threats in the story, SHIELD active the plan from a team of superheroes, The Avengers, with the heroes mentioned above to help prevent the plans of Loki.<br/><br/>Visually the film is one of Marvel's most well made, with action scenes to the level of Iron Man, but more intense: the downsides of characters of other films, that were not as successful as ""Thor"" and ""Hulk"" were corrected here, and the characters have greater expression.<br/><br/>Of course, in terms of special effects there is nothing wrong - the scenes are very intense and uses it very well, and are impressive in some parts, as well as the fight sequences between the characters.<br/><br/>Musically I am without criticism, as all the movies from Marvel the orchestrated soundtrack fits perfectly with the action - the same can be said of the sound effects used in the film.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent, each character is significant in themselves in the story, and their different personalities are displayed perfectly, even in characters without much impact on earlier movies.<br/><br/>The differences in personalities secured a good laugh as well as some comic lines and scenes. Thus, the entire cast came to life - even Loki, in the role of the ""eternal loser"".<br/><br/>And tell by the way, I thought that no character has been erased by the presence of another, despite the stronger personality in the movie, of Tony Stark to be the most striking.<br/><br/>The story itself is not worthy of an Oscar for best screenplay, but this is not the intention of the film - but the fun is, remember that this is the basic reason to watch movies, and at this point it beat my expectations, being almost as good as ""X-Men: First Class.""<br/><br/>One of the constant criticism that I have seen is about the main villain Loki, said to be too weak for the role: I think he fits the role allocated to him, as is evident through the story itself, the comic lines and the bonus credits hook - I think a greater villain is reserved for the sequel.<br/><br/>In short: it is a great action movie, with a solid script for the style, with excellent performances and visual effects - and it is what you want when you go to watch something in Cinemas, looking for fun pure and simple.<br/><br/>It serves as a reminder because every year we expect so much to see the upcoming movie from Marvel / DC Comics ... My score: 9.0 / 10.0."
"mrda1981","9","1","4","6 May 2012"," Super-b!
","The much-hyped superhero ensemble project finally sees manifestation on the big screen: the wait has been worth it.<br/><br/>Ensemble projects like this always carry the risk of being bloated, or ruined by overkill; thankfully, Joss Whedon sees fit to not only give each of his superpowered protagonists ample screen time, but also effective characterisations, too. Hell, even Hawkeye and Black Widow--two characters who were treated as mere appendages in previous Marvel flicks--have a strong presence here. Tom Hiddleston, makes a mischievous antagonist, playing Loki as a megalomaniacal Jack the Lad with a potty mouth (never thought I'd hear the term ""mewling quim"" in a mainstream, all-ages flick); but the strongest standout, for me, has to be Mark Ruffalo's ever-on-edge performance as that big green wrecking machine, the Hulk.<br/><br/>Action-wise, there's no disappointment, with each set-piece giving our heroes an excuse to show off their pet powers. If the ensemble panning shot during the climactic battle doesn't win some sort of award for camera-work and direction, I'll be very surprised! The real mastery comes from the entwining of characterisation and conflict, with the course of the latter very much informed by (and informing) the former.<br/><br/>In short, this is a must-see as a supe move, a summer blockbuster, and an all-round great piece of action cinema."

","This, by far, is the best super hero action movie, ever. Forget the actors, forget the graphics and forget the heroics of the hulk, the script is so captivating and the screen play so damn good that it is impossible to feel unimpressed when one leaves the show. I rate this 9 just because I happen to watch it with 5 of my friends, none of the group watching any of the original films of the super heroes. They were confused initially till I find sometime and give them the brief of each of them. And when the movie finished, they were grinning ear to ear, with a promise to watch all 5 movies of the super hero movies. That captivating this movie is! The movie predictably starts slow so as to introduce the superheroes and then picks up speed never to stop. The goosebumps were felt till I left the place to return the 3D glasses :D<br/><br/>Then comes the performances. Everyone gave their best performance and the list is topped by the performances of Robert Downie Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Cobie Smulders. The dialogs were crisply written, entertainingly delivered and thoroughly enjoyed! The 3D was not so worthy to die for. It my be the theater, or the glasses but it is not up to the mark of not even Mysterious Island as I found one of my friend just removing the glasses and watching the film as is. The CGI was good, Iron man just awesome and HULK, no words! I have found the trailers good but living through the scene of the group of super heroes is just a brain freezing experience for me.<br/><br/>Go watch it and enjoy it. Definitely can be watched in 3D but 2D in a good theater works just fine. I will watch it again and might probably buy a DVD/Blu-ray for my 42"". Deal!"
"cat_ranchero","9","1","4","6 May 2012"," Over all... EXCELLENT!...
","I first have to say I saw the film in 2D (none of this 3D nonsense for me) and even so I did find some of the scenes very dark. Also, the aspect ratio at 1.78:1 seemed totally wrong to me, most films these days are shot in a ratio of 2.35:1 and I can't see why this one had to be different (it may be a 3D thing, but it niggled me slightly). As far as performances go, well everyone did a great job but I particularly liked Tom Hiddleston as Loki.<br/><br/>Of course there are plot holes here, as there are in all superhero films and I'm not going to chime on about them now, I'm sure there are many out there that are better qualified than me so I'll leave it to them. What I took away from it was a very entertaining film with a lot of (sometimes subtle) humour and I really enjoyed it. The narrative did seem to get a little stuck in a couple of places though, like when Thor arrived and ended up having a fight with Iron Man, but I can forgive these because as a whole it all worked pretty well. I was a little disappointed with the back-story to Black Widow and Hawkeye, it was only alluded to quite briefly and, I guess because they are more minor characters, I wanted to know a little more about them. But over all I must say it's well worth the admission fee!... Highly Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.9/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.8/10 (based on 65,676 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>MetaScore: 69/100: (Based on 40 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 93/100 (based on 230 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 96/100 (based on 199,821 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","After finally watching it, I see what the hype was all about. With a cornucopia of extraordinary and awesome special effects, The Avengers is truly the best-super hero film. <br/><br/>An ensemble movie that intermingles four major Marvel characters into one awesome movie that has all what a comic fan would want--a fight scene between two of the most powerful and popular character, Iron Man and Thor, and the combined force of the Avengers shown in one movie. <br/><br/>Not only does it rise in special effects and cinematography, the superhero extravaganza also has its characters well depicted with powerful the acting wit of Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey, and the many others. Humor is also a major component that Whedon doesn't seem to forget, however, at times it seems a bit supererogatory. <br/><br/>Looking at it from a general view, the film seems superior to any other Marvel film. However, its most obvious downside is the Hulk's lack of humanity which left him with almost nothing but a child playing around with a doll--although it was truly jocular. <br/><br/>Overall, Marvel's the Avengers is a great film that will surely quench the thirst of many action-movie goers while having some dramatic and a few romantic scenes for other-genre of movie goers. Its truly a movie worth watching--the movie of 2012. Not only has the movie been praised for its special affects and acting, but it has also broken many records internationally. Waiting for this weekends predicted staggering results, I have high expectations."
"Hellmant","10","1","4","5 May 2012"," A comic book fan's orgasmic dream come true!
","'THE AVENGERS': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Joss Whedon directed and co-wrote (with Zak Penn) this long awaited film adaptation of the Marvel comic book. Marvel Studios has been building a story arc to this film through five other individual comic book superhero movies (2008's 'IRON MAN' and 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', 2010's 'IRON MAN 2' and 2011's 'THOR' and 'CAPTAIN America'). They brought on Whedon (who many comic book and film fans worship) to co-write and direct the film and being a true comic book fan himself he knew exactly what the fans wanted to see. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Stellan Skarsgard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Paul Bettany all reprise their roles from other Marvel comics movies and Mark Ruffalo was brought in to replace Edward Norton as 'The Hulk'. The movie is a comic book fan's orgasmic dream come true, all other film fans and audiences should be more than pleased as well though.<br/><br/>The story of 'The Avengers' revolves around the world peace keeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D.. Nick Fury (Jackson once again) is the director of the agency and has spent the last five Marvel movies recruiting superheroes for a special team known as the Avengers. When Loki (Hiddleston again), brother of Thor, invades the planet and steals the Tesseract, which he uses to control the minds of multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents including Hawkeye (Renner again), it's finally time for Fury to call on the Avengers to assemble and save the world. Loki wants to use the Tesseract to enslave the planet unless Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and the others can stop him. The heroes must work through their own inner demons and conflicts with each other before they can work as a team and find the strength they need to stop Loki and his army.<br/><br/>I was expecting something much more campy and mainstream fun but Whedon takes the material very seriously and actually structured a really well written story which develops all of the key characters pretty evenly (with the exception of Hawkeye). Most comic movies kind of cheat their fans by trying more to appeal to the masses whereas this film makes the comic book audience it's target audience (as it should). It doesn't do so to the extent of losing the interest of everyone else though. For me I much more enjoyed 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER MAN 2' or 'X2' as far as comic book films go but I can really appreciate this film. It doesn't give me as big a boner as a lot of my comic book friends but it's definitely a crowd pleasing action film and one of the best of it's kind. I don't know as much about the source material as comic book nerds but I know a good movie and this is one. Whedon was definitely the right man for the job!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNk88XWi4A4"

","I waited a long time for this movie, and the pay-off was definitely worth it. Measly words like 'epic' or 'awesome' are not even close to describing this brilliant film. This movie is jam-packed with action, explosions, fight scenes, and comedy. There is never a dull moment, and time just flies by during this 142 minute extravaganza. The agency of SHIELD accidentally use the Tesseract to open a mysterious portal and unleashes Thor's evil brother, Loki. Loki brainwashes Dr. Selvig and Hawkeye to help him bring his army, the Chitauri to Earth. Nick Fury assembles Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow and the Incredible Hulk to help stop him. Thor joins the group later. (Thor is my absolute favorite Avenger and he had some decent action scenes and funny moments. I wish he had a little more screen time) Tony Stark and Steve Rogers often clash with each other, but they must all work together to defeat Loki and become....THE AVENGERS!!!!!"

","There is only a few things i would like to share; I have not seen a movie that amazed me this much until the day i watched the Avengers. I do not want to point out any specific parts of the movie, but i want to say this, this movie is a compilation of brilliant acting, fluent action, the amazing fantasy world (for the ones that love the comic books) and comedy that leaves a smile on your face throughout the entire movie. I must say i wasn't expecting this much fun. The only thing that stood out for me, was the appearance of the Hulk. It was very good, but not perfect. I don't know about the current technology for these kinda stuff, but i think it could have been done a bit more realistic. Anyway, for those who didn't watch the movie, i strongly recommend that you watch this movie immediately. I guarantee you it will NOT be a waste of time, on the contrary i believe you will love it. I know i did and so did a hundred of my friends. I am definitely buying the DVD or blu-ray as soon as it hits the stores."

","This movie ROCKS! I've been waiting for this movie for 37 years. Joss Whedon nailed it, the action is paced just right, with a good amount of one liners to keep it light. Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of fun as Tony Stark. The story works well and the actors sell their roles with ease. I wasn't sure about Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, he did alright, but he's a little too beefy to be Bruce. All the other actors have played their characters before and this just cements their position. This movie is better than any of the solo hero movies that led up to it. Hopefully Joss comes back for the next one and can pull it off again. I saw the IMAX 3D version and while it looked and sounded fantastic, the 3D didn't pop as much as it could have. It had some depth but it didn't really add much. It should make a substantial amount at the the box office, and should get a few nods for the Oscars, but we all know that won't happen, the Academy always passes over movies like this. I just want to state again, this is a great movie, action packed and hilarious."

Now here we are in 2012, people had doubts about The Avengers, but those people are wrong.<br/><br/>First off, I got to see Avengers at midnight release here in Canada, and the energy was terrific. Everyone was excited, and everyone was respectful of staying quiet during the movie. We couldn't help it however, when laughs came up because The Avengers is hilarious. The jokes are very well written. Tony Stark is his usual self, and Cap is now trying to adjust to modern day. Thor, being from Asgard is also confused by some of our customs and sayings, and example being when Nick Fury refers to Loki and his ""trained monkeys"", and Thor questions what monkeys are.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon wrote and directed this movie to a wonderful extent. He knew every turn and plot point he wanted for the movie, and there's no better way this movie could've turned out.<br/><br/>I can't describe the great joy I feel from seeing this movie, and once is not enough. I could go on and on about it, the acting, the fight scenes, Mark Ruffalo being the best Hulk/Bruce Banner yet and how I, without exaggeration, had a smile the entire movie, but it's something you must experience for yourself.<br/><br/>Enjoy!

","Short and sweet, probably THE best super-hero movie ever made. I went in to this with some trepidation. Most flicks with an ensemble cast waste way too much time and energy on the special effects and action and not enough on character development. (Like those horrible Batman flicks pre-Christopher Nolan.) But the Avangers are the exception to the rule. This was just a fantastic movie. The fight scenes and action moments were spectacular without going over the top ala' Transformers and the character development and interaction was superb and totally entertaining. Some of the most enjoyable moments of the movie was the banter between the characters. And I won't ruin this for anyone but stay for the end to catch a glimpse of the next bad guy. Apparently it's been announced on the web but I didn't know until I seen the film. I was blown away. He looked awesome! What a great flick."
"aikidofreak","8","1","4","5 May 2012"," I never thought this would work out... and then it did.
","I went to this movie going 'oh my god, Michael Bay meets Spderman vs X Men or something. I didn't really had high hopes for it. But I figured 'what the hell' and went to see it anyway.<br/><br/>Just came back from the cinema. And I must say I haven't been this entertained in a long time watching a movie. The Avengers is really a -lot- of fun to watch.<br/><br/>first off, the scenario. Sure, the story is a bit shaky, a few plot holes here and there. But nothing that makes you go 'wtf is this nonsense?'. For a story that covers such a weird, unrealistic theme, it's pretty believable actually.<br/><br/>The characters. This is where The Avengers shines. Throw a bunch of (some less) well known superheroes in 1 movie, throw in a semi-slapstick villain and let rip. all the characters are good. Stark, Thor and Hulk provide the lulz. Even Loki allows for a few laughs. I've never heard of Black Widow or Hawkeye but they fit in just fine and carried the story along.<br/><br/>the action. Michael bay, take note. This is how you let stuff blow up and get demolished -without- giving the audience seizures. the action is fast paced, well times and the screenplay at times is just brilliant. hats off.<br/><br/>the humor. the backbone of this film. very witty lines, good slapstick jokes from time to time. some hilarious (punch)lines that really make you laugh. It's not just Iron Man and his snide remarks this time. Almost everyone chips in. this movie doesn't take itself very serious at times. And that's a very good thing.<br/><br/>If you're a superhero fan, go see this. you simply cannot be disappointed I think. I myself am no superhero fan but I was entertained for the whole 2.5 hours the film went on, not 1 moment bored.<br/><br/>What a laugh."
"TheTrexr","9","1","4","5 May 2012"," An Impressive Accomplishment
","This movie is all about the hype. Its existence is based on four years of gradually building anticipation in the nerd community, so that now some of us are at the breaking point waiting for what we all hope could be the perfect movie. The big question on all of our minds is 'was it worth the wait?' My response to that question is yes. The Avengers is shockingly good in every way.<br/><br/>The plot concerns Loki, god of mischief, who, after receiving a magic death wand from some aliens (yeah, that's about how much they tell you about it), comes to earth, steals the mysterious otherworldly megabattery the Cosmic Cube, last seen in Captain America, from the supersecret spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D. He kidnaps a few of their scientists and agents, and takes off. Concerned, Nick Fury, the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., played by a Very Awesome Samuel L. Jackson with no hair and an eye patch, wants to begin rounding up earth's mightiest heroes to combat the threat. The government argues that it doesn't make sense to round up civilians who happen to have acquired powers and expect them to act as a dependable military task force. Fury argues that they don't have a dependable military taskforce equipped to handle a God and an invading alien army, so he goes ahead and does it anyway.<br/><br/>His heroes consist of Iron Man, who has just completed work on an energy efficient tower that he can't seem to stop talking about, the true significance of which doesn't come to light until the very end of the movie. Captain America, who is understandably depressed since waking up seventy years after he last fell asleep, and is trying to figure out if he has any place in the new world. Thor, who is obviously having some personal issues because he feels responsible for his brother Loki's actions. Black Widow, who is technically not an Avenger, but just a really talented agent who hangs out with them, and Hawkeye, who is also just an agent, but happens to be really good with a bow, so he also gets to hang out with the Avengers.<br/><br/>I cannot express in words just how impressed I am that each character gets enough screen time to satisfy both the needs to see them and to have them grow in complexity. Somehow, over the course of its two hour run time it manages to do justice to each of its characters simultaneously by bouncing their personalities off one another.<br/><br/>The action is plentiful and awesome. The first half to three quarters of the film the heroes are fighting one another as their confliction agendas bring them to trade blows, and that is entertaining. We get to see Hulk fight Thor, Thor fight Iron Man, Black Widow fight Hawkeye, Black Widow running in terror from Hulk, etc. This is all unbelievably good fun, and they all get to show off the full brunt of their powers because the other heroes are tough enough to take it. When they finally do make peace with one another and get down to fighting the bad guys there as an endless wave of faceless aliens for them to tear in two/smash/electrocute/explode/shoot/whatever without you caring about the deaths that come as a result.<br/><br/>Now for the bad parts, and there were a couple. The opening action sequence when Loki destroys the underground S.H.I.E.L.D. base is too long and too boring. Also, Loki gives these weird speeches throughout the movie about how freedom is stifling, or something, and they didn't make sense given his character. He doesn't need more motivation than wanting to be a king to be doing what he's doing, and at the very least they could have done a better job explaining his feelings about 'freedom.' I think I figured it out anyways, but I'll leave the interpretation to each audience member. Also, there is a great scene where Thor is defending Loki's honor in the face of the understandable accusations coming from his teammates, only to insist that Loki's only his adopted brother two seconds later for the sake of a gag. It bothered me A LOT because it was really interesting to see him still caring for his wayward family member despite his wrongdoings. And what was with that alien Loki was talking to? The one with the two thumbs. It looked, moved, spoke, and was filmed like something out of a bad sixties sci-fi movie. And I mean the really bad kind. In a movie filled with awesomeness, it stood out like a sore thumb. Or two sore thumbs, given its bizarre anatomy. SPOILER ALERT! SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE! At the end of the movie when Doctor Selvig announces that while under Loki's mind control he maintained enough presence of mind to install a failsafe kill switch into the portal generator, I couldn't help but feel that the screenwriters had taken the lazy way out. The fact that he did that makes all of their collective actions basically irrelevant, and it undermines both their superiority and their heroism in no small way. Essentially they won the war because some guy didn't mind control very well, and that's really lame. This was the weakest point in the film, and I feel very strongly that there's no particular reason that Hulk couldn't have just smashed his way through the unsmashable force field.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is unbelievably good fun, and surprisingly satisfying given the wait. It homages the characters and the stories of all the movies that have come before, and it leads into whatever comes next very well. Oh, and stay after the credits. There's an awesome clip for anyone patient enough to wait. And I don't mean the one with the aliens. I mean after the longer credits."
"StevePulaski","9","1","4","5 May 2012"," Six heroes, one challenge
","Remember how last year we were met with an unusual abundance of superhero flicks focusing on heroes that seemed to have come out of nowhere? It was all buildup to Marvel's The Avengers, one of the most anticipated films of 2012. This is the first time I sought out a superhero film in theaters. I usually don't see them because I've never cared for them. They're not my kind of thing.<br/><br/>This is the Freddy vs. Jason for superhero fans. The story goes like this; after Nick Fury (Jackson), leader of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D., discovers that an energy source by the name of Tesseract has opened a portal allowing Thor's brother Loki (Hiddleston) to use the source's ability to control the minds of people, he calls together, ""The Avengers."" They are The Hulk (Ruffalo), Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Hawkeye (Renner), Captain America (Evans), Thor (Hemsworth), and Black Widow (Johannson), only two of those characters never got their own film. Isn't that something? Captain America can get three, Iron Man can get two, with an upcoming third one, and Hulk can get two non-related works within the same decade, but Black Widow and Hawkeye get the cold shoulder? Guess no one wants to pull another Green Lantern.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is not-so-much devoted to character development, as much as character interactions; how do heroes react to being a room with other heroes? There's a nice feeling of uncertainty amongst the crowd, and we get the feeling these heroes are intimidated by the presence of possible competition. The feeling of inferiority is always lurking.<br/><br/>Director/writer Joss Whedon, whose subversive horror film The Cabin in the Woods is also currently in theaters, has two great things going for him right now. One, he speaks to the world of fandom and nerdom, and never disconnects himself from this sort of medium. You can see he likes these heroes, and he tries to imagine how their interactions and conversations might've gone on the pages of a comic. And two, he knows how to devise a brutal, relentlessly intriguing third act that never relapses. I'm not the biggest fan of hardcore, lengthy action scenes, but the half-hour to forty minute brawl in The Avengers didn't bother me, mainly because I realized Whedon wanted to showcase all the different possibilities that could exist if six superheros fought against one destructive villain.<br/><br/>Not to mention, how difficult it must've been to construct a film where six different heroes come together for the first time. Whedon has the task of mixing the patriotism of Captain America, the shameless cynicism of Tony Stark, the demigod-abilities of Thor, the subtleties of Hawkeye, the wise-remarks of Black Widow, and the anger of the Hulk into one coherent film. The result is superb, commendable, and utterly terrific. Each character, too, gets their own time to shine, rather than some going unsung and others fighting to get in front of the camera in a ""look at me, ma!"" sort of fashion.<br/><br/>In the mix of all the violence, talking, and scientific jargon, occasionally, comes a nice sprinkling of humor and wit. Most of the humor comes from the wise-ass Stark, whose comedic timing and infinite possibilities may lead me to seek out Iron Man and its sequel.<br/><br/>Marvel's The Avengers may appear to be another superhero flick, just with more heroes and less villains, but it's the effort that shines through the material. The effort, determination, and challenge of combining six different heroes was definitely something to overcome, and Joss Whedon (who is by no means a newcomer, with a resume comprised of the Television shows Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) has made an explosive mainstream debut, with a film that dripped potential. This is a kinetic and stylistic piece of work from a man, I believe, just getting started.<br/><br/>NOTE: Just to fuel the tired joke of Black Widow and Hawkeye never getting their own picture, anyone else anticipating the Ant-Man film in 2014? Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by: Joss Whedon."
"FilmPulse","9","1","4","5 May 2012"," Destined to become a classic
","In 2008, Marvel Studios gave us the first film adaptation of it's super hero Iron Man, with the promise of big things to come. The film was an astounding success, proving that Batman wasn't the only hero that can have a good movie. What followed was four more films, The Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America, all critical and financial successes, and all leading up to one massive blowout known as The Avengers. Culminating all five films into one massive adventure was a seemingly impossible task, however writer/director Joss Whedon somehow, against all odds, pulled it off in a big way.<br/><br/>It's something that has never been done before in film. Taking these characters, who have proved they are strong enough to carry a film by themselves, and putting them all together in one over-arching continuity. The problems that could arise from this concept are endless, and yet this films works. Not only does it work, it's so brilliantly pieced together that it is destined to become the greatest super hero movie ever made.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon, of Firefly and Buffy fame, is no stranger to creating stories featuring ensemble casts. The contrasting personalities of the team play a large role, and Whedon explores this with astounding fervor. This is a character study as much as an action film, and the witty dialogue Whedon brings to the table only enhances the personalities of these extraordinary individuals. The banter between the heroes during lulls in the action is just as engaging as the mind-blowing action itself.<br/><br/>And the action will blow your mind. The main reason most people want to go see this film, is to see The Avengers kick some ass, and there is no shortage of ass-kickery happening in this film. Although The Hulk steals most of the jaw-dropping moments, even the lower tier characters of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) get just as much screen time, and each have their own ""wow"" moments.<br/><br/>One thing that is an absolute must when having such an over-powered team like this, is having a worthy adversary. Tom Hiddleston's character of Loki plays the perfect villain, and what better an adversary than a crazed God and his army? When it was first revealed that Loki was the film's antagonist, the initial fear was that we already saw Thor defeat Loki in his own movie, so why is there a need for The Avengers to be involved, when we already know Thor can beat him single handedly? Fortunately, this and all the other fanboy and critic's questions are addressed and taken into consideration.<br/><br/>Since I was a child, I have always talked about the prospect of an Avengers movie, and it looked so unattainable that it seemed like it would forever remain just a 12 year old's dream. Having previously dreamt of a G.I. Joe movie, it comes as no surprise when The Avengers was announced, I was left with cautious optimism. Much to my delight, it seems that Joss Whedon was somehow able to look into my soul and produce the best comic book movie ever made. The Avengers is a masterpiece, and should be placed on the mantle of greatness beside Star Wars and Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>FilmPulse.net"

The action was impressive, the jokes were funny and the characters were likable.<br/><br/>The main area of criticism I have seen so far seems to be that this movie does not ""deserve"" to be held in the same regard as other high scoring films on this website. All I can say is that this film is pure and simple fun, it is well worth the money and is well worth your time to go and see.

","Definitely one of the best superhero movies ever... Everything about the movie was awesome. The storyline was great, fit well with the previous Marvel movies. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk- all their movies now seem to have a common purpose- to converge and culminate into an epic story! Guaranteed entertainment!<br/><br/>The premise remains the same as that of any other superhero movie. The Earth is in peril, and its fate depends on a handful of superhumans. A super villain has a cunning masterplan- Recruit a deadly alien army, let them loose on earth, then rule it. Transformers did that too and it was all chaos. The story here was far better woven, with all loose threads from previous movies tied up neatly.<br/><br/>When a Powerful thing goes into the wrong hands, and the fate of the world is at stake, Nick Fury(Jackson) assembles the most extraordinary team to retrieve it. Hulk (Ruffalo), Captain America (Evans),Black Widow(Johansson), Hawkeye(Renner), Iron Man (RDJ) and Thor (Hemsworth) embark on a mission to stop Loki (Hiddleston) from taking over the Earth.<br/><br/>The performances of all the actors were great. But the real show-stealer was RDJ. The witty comments and the hilarious banter by Stark kept everyone gripped throughout the story. There are instances where you'll laugh out loud in really serious situations. The way the humor has been intricately embedded in such a grave storyline is lovely. <br/><br/>Among the awesome story, fantastic direction and spectacular cinematics, the 142 min running time seems too short. Every main character has his/her moment of glory. All the hype which this movie has created is totally justified. Go in with high expectations- Thou shan't be disappointed!"

This is hands down one of the best films of the year. If the quality of Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and Captain America had an threesome, this would be the result.

The movie is not only well-acted, it has a great story with snappy dialog, impeccably delivered by an all-star cast. The special effects are phenomenal and the movie succeeds in keeping and maintaining the audience's interest and attention. Even the bad guys are wonderful. This movie is probably the best sci-fi action movie in years, perhaps in all of cinematic history. It combines all of the best features of the sci-fi genre plus a generous inclusion of amusing one-liners which lets the audience know that this movie is supposed to be fun to watch. Here, the director succeeds in transforming a comic-book story into a something substantive and enjoyable. For these reason, this movie is worth watching."
"khfan250","9","1","4","5 May 2012"," The Avengers Assemble for One Heck of a Summer Blockbuster!
","After four years of anticipation, Joss Whedon's The Avengers hits theaters. And, of course, it is really good. There was no doubt in my mind that this movie wouldn't be good. And, if it disappointed, it'd still be looked back on as the culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>I think Whedon is the only one who is able to put a movie like this together. I'm not a huge fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Hunter"", ""Firefly"", or some of Whedon's other works, but he does have a knack for taking a bunch of different characters and making them all relevant. And he brings that trademark talent to this movie. Every hero is given just enough screen time. We see Captain America's struggle of pulling his team together, we see the regret Thor has for having to battle his brother, we see Hulk's desperate attempts to control ""the other guy"", and we see Tony Stark as the narcissistic playboy that's always equipped with a great one-liner.<br/><br/>One thing that sort of concerned me about ""The Avengers"" was Loki as the villain. I thought he was great in ""Thor"", but it seemed kind of weak to have all these great heroes teaming up against a re-used villain from a previous prequel. Fortunately, I was one hundred percent wrong; Loki is great as a villain. He's more intense and less whiny. Combine that with a lust for power and an army of aliens and you've got one of the greatest villains in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The effects are great, of course. You've seen the trailers for this, I'm sure, so you know that the movie's climax takes place in Manhattan. It was gripping, exciting, and even laced with a bit of comedy, with none of it being offensive or racist. The entire time I just kept thinking to myself that this is what ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" should have been. I can see who the heroes are and even identify with them, while the action is entertaining and not too long.<br/><br/>Final verdict: The summer movie season hasn't been kicked off this well since the first ""Iron Man"" movie. Ever since Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", I've been waiting for another superhero movie to come along and do something new. And ""The Avengers"" has done just that. It takes a very basic, traditional story and amps it up. It's smartly handled, well made, and, most importantly, a lot of fun. I look forward to taking another trip to the theater to go and see it."
"TheMovieSnob247","8","1","4","5 May 2012"," Believe the hype: The Avengers deliver!
","If you're looking for a fun time at the movies this weekend, look no further. There was just a tremendous amount of hype for the film (I mean I couldn't go anywhere or do anything without seeing some sort of ad). But I'm very happy to say, they met my high expectations and then some. <br/><br/>Firstly, the bad stuff. The first half of the film is a bit too slowly paced. I felt Whedon spent a bit too much time on ramp up and origin story (especially when each of the important characters had their own origin film for that purpose). Maybe he felt the need to do so because not everyone would've seen the other films. But as someone who made the time to see them, I felt this was unnecessary. Once things picked up in the second half, it was definitely a worth the wait. <br/><br/>There's quite a lot lot to love here. There are some fantastic action sequences and battles (pretty much the whole second half). A few moments where you just say ""that was #$@&* awesome!"". A surprisingly frequent number of laugh out loud moments. My crowd even had a few spontaneous outbursts of clapping as well. The script was very cleverly written and the story was engaging (albeit very simple). There's something for everyone here. <br/><br/>It's amazing the film was almost 2.5 hours long, because it didn't feel like it dragged (slowly paced start withstanding). And I felt that Whedon did a great job at allowing each character adequate screen time for you to be connected to them. This is a rare feet in films where there are so many characters as it's very hard to do, yet Whedon handled this perfectly. I didn't feel there was a single character who didn't belong or was just filler (see the X-Men films). Every character was necessary, every character played a pivotal role, every character meant something. Again, can't say enough of how much I appreciated this. <br/><br/>I loved the performances. Robert Downey Jr. was once again brilliant as Iron Man (and really is the most interesting character in the film, he steals virtually every scene he's in). Sam Jackson puts in a stellar turn once again as Nick Fury. Chris Hemworth and Mark Ruffalo were on point as well. But the surprise for me was Chris Evans as Captain America. I really was disappointed in last summer's Captain America and I felt he was miscast because he didn't feel as authoritative as I expected Captain America to be (and not as grizzled or mature). But he was clearly much better here as I actually believed him this time around than in the origin film. Combined with the other performances, I really felt this lifted the film. <br/><br/>Be sure to stick around after the credits (although really, you should have this figured out by now, it's a Marvel staple). There's not one, but two extra scenes to be seen (the 2nd of which is quite hilarious). While it's not at the level of The Dark Knight, it's pretty damn good as a ""stuff gonna blow up"" summer film. It's just a great way to start off the summer movie season. Hopefully the rest of the summer lives up this.<br/><br/>Head out to your nearest multiplex, get your popcorn ready and enjoy this action gem!<br/><br/>For more of my reviews and general movie discussion, check out my blog: http://andretms.blogspot.ca/"
"Bbenbb","9","1","4","5 May 2012"," Best Marvel Comic Movie Yet!!
","This is definitely one to see in theaters.<br/><br/>The clashes, unworldly displays and explosions are impressive enough, but the director's unique presentation through camera angles and gut-wrenching motions can only be appreciated on the big screen, and with big surround sound speakers.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's philosophical prowess is a perfect match for the comic book genre. The moral thread that ties each character together as a team is subtly challenged. The clashes between epic characters if considered as a battle between personal philosophies matches the booming fireworks we see on the screen.<br/><br/>An essential element for tying each character together is to give each character their 15 minutes. Whedon has a talent for this. We are drawn to the less powerful super heroes who aren't so fantastic but whom we can relate to. From there we eventually relate to and appreciate a demigod.<br/><br/>It is a spectacle from beginning to end... more so near the end."
"CinemaJackIX","10","1","4","5 May 2012"," The Avengers
","My Experience Part When I saw the trailer for The Avengers and was skeptical. I loved 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'The Incredible Hulk', and even tolerated 'Captain America: First Avenger'. This could have easily gone either way because a movie this big had never been done before. I walked into the theater for the midnight premiere with 3D glasses in hand not knowing what to expect. Fast forward to the end. I walked out of the theater flabbergasted wearing a grin from ear to ear. <br/><br/>Review THE GOOD: The Avengers certainly earned their name. Joss Whedon was able to do what most cannot. He took very different characters from very different universes and brought them all together for one of the best comic book adaptations my eyes have every had the pleasure of watching. The story was solid and plausible for what Marvel Studios has created. The cinematography was great, especially the 360 shot with all of them in a circle ending with an establishing shot of the group with aliens on the New York skyline. And of course, who can forget the Hulk. He stole the show and the motion capture animation was breathtaking. THE BAD: God bless him, but I was not feeling the Captain America suit. He stuck out like a sore thumb which was a real shame. AND THE UGLY: Movie ticket prices are a bit too high. I wanted to watch this at least 2 or 3 more times after seeing it for a second time."
"helperzine","5","1","4","5 May 2012"," At last: A superhero-movie that dares to reinvent
","When it started getting easier to make superhero-movies (because budgets became bigger and visual effects became cheaper) it became clear that any superhero-movie is horrible by nature, and only with a good crew and cast would that change. The past couple of years haven't shown much promise in this area... But 'The Avengers' shows that with an intelligent and capable director, enough good actors/actresses, a limit to the amount of deaths and explosions that there can be, and a screenplay that at least tries to get away from those nasty clich√©s, there can still be a 'savetheworldfromdisastor'-movie that can entertain with its freshness. For all superhero-fans from all walks of life, as well as for those wishing to discover what a 'superhero-film' is all about. It's an all-in- one bargain!"
"TrippDigital","10","1","4","5 May 2012"," Amazing!
","Flashback to 2008. I was clapping my hands along with many others in a packed theater as the end credits of Iron Man rolled on the screen. But as the credits finished, a hush fell over the crowd. A new scene played out, in which we were introduced to Nick Fury. A collective gasp was let out by those of us in the know when he said the word ""Avengers"".<br/><br/>Four years and four films later, that little tease has become the biggest and best superhero movie of all time.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the Avengers is that there's no need for an origin. Thanks to the other films, we already know these characters and have seen them in action. This allows the filmmakers to get the ball rolling quickly. And boy, does it ever roll. It hits the ground running and doesn't stop until the end. But that doesn't mean it's just a mindless action movie. The character development here is great and the chemistry is amazing. You feel their frustration when the group falls apart and share in their triumph when they ""assemble"".<br/><br/>Simply put, it's the most entertainment I've gotten out of a film in a very long time. Seeing those characters together on the big screen spoke directly to the 10 year old in me. I can't recommend it enough. Even if you've never read a comic book in your life, you will enjoy this movie."
"filmcritic3","9","1","4","5 May 2012"," Alien Invasion thwarted by battling Super Heroes
","THE AVENGERS So, what's not to like? THE AVENGERS promised to be the biggest movie of the year, that is, until the release of THE DARK NIGHT RISES. It is. Mix four of the world's greatest superheroes with three of the world's best spies and assassins and pit them against an invading army from outer space, with some of the best SFX guys in the business, and how could you not have the popcorn movie of the year? This begs the question: How can mere mortals fight along side superheroes? The three in question are Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Director and writer Joss Whedon does a fine job incorporating these characters with those who have powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.<br/><br/>Is there great acting? No. Doesn't have to be; none of the characters calls for it. Robert Downey, Jr. can do the wise-ass Tony Stark in his sleep. Mark Ruffalo does a credible job filling in for Edward Norton, but I keep thinking how much better Norton's sneer would have been as Bruce Banner. (Original reports issued from the Hollywood PR machine claimed Norton was holding out for too much money and really didn't want the role. After the spin died, my sources revealed Norton very much wanted to be in the film and reprise his role as The Hulk. The studio cut him out and put out a smear campaign against him, making him persona non grata. Rumors are Downey was afraid of being upstaged, but I find that hard to believe as Downey and Norton have both painted the town red, with aplomb, in the past.) Is there a superior story? No. The invading army coming through the time warp portal is too reminiscent of MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. I half expected to see Frank Langella riding one of the space carriages as Skeletor. The mechanical dragons harken back to the god-awful Hercules films, starring Lou Ferrigno (the original Hulk). And, there are enough continuity errors to scratch your head and cause you to anticipate the extended DVD version, which will certainly plug up the holes with deleted scenes.<br/><br/>And, we couldn't have a Hollywood movie without putting a bit of an agenda, now, could we? Even the epitome of American Exceptionalism, Captain America, cites Americans as losers and avers the Stars and Stripes are tarnished. This is an obvious ploy to cater to the anti-American crowd that so loved the comic issue where Captain America lost his faith. It isn't necessary in this movie, and it adds a sub-plot that is never resolved. Thankfully, Nick Fury tells Cap: ""we need to believe in those things again"". Amen, brother. Amen.<br/><br/>The stars of films like THE AVENGERS are the techs. They do a masterful job that is the sweetest of eye-candies. The film is shot in 3D and IMAX. It doesn't need it. There's no amazing 3D sequence, like there is in WRATH OF THE TITANS; so my advice is save a few bucks and see the movie in a regular theatre with standard projectors.<br/><br/>Is it big? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Especially the scene where Loki tries to explain to the Hulk he is a god. Is it a great night out? Absolutely. Is it the film of the summer? Ah, no. I still think that will be THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.<br/><br/>THE RATING FOR THE AVENGERS = A -30-"

"MisterJackles","7","1","4","4 May 2012"," Good! But not worthy of Top 250...
","I saw 'The Avengers' due to the constant praise and elevated status in the 'Top 250 Films of All Time.' When those final credits rolled and the short sequence ended which promises a sequel, I was thinking. Storyline: Amazing, Acting: Amazing, Action: AMAZING! Well then why did I sit back with a big ""meh"" ? Every aspect of this film was perfectly executed yet for some reason it lacked that absolute WOW factor for me. That final touch that makes a good movie into a great movie. Perhaps it was the constant humour instigated into the story which by the way were hilarious, that possibly was overdone and seemed to ruin the movie a bit for me. At times it felt like a bit of a joke to me, which left me cackling endlessly but evidently shaking my head at how they could do this. I just lacked the ability to take this film seriously at times. However immediately giving 'The Avengers' a 6 or even 5/10 I realised that it did what it did perfectly, and although I didn't get what I wanted out of it, and the fact that it didn't live up to my expectations, doesn't make it a bad film. In fact looking back it was quite the contrary. I enjoyed it, and it is most likely that you will too. If I had of gone into it with an open mind I would of loved it, and I intend to do that on my second viewing. However I recommend that you definitely see 'The Avengers' as it certainly is a good and entertaining film, definitely Marvels Best! Just enjoy the film and you will laugh and gasp at its perfect execution of action that at times puts CGI to its test. I look forward to a sequel and a second viewing of this.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ntvnyr30","10","1","4","4 May 2012"," Impressive, most impressive
","I was waiting for this film and was not disappointed. My 10 rating does not place it in the same class as ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"" et al. This is the ""Citizen Kane"" of superhero movies.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, my friend and I used to argue about which was better: Marvel or D.C. I used to complain that the Avengers fought amongst each other too much, instead of the ""Justice League of America"" who fought their foes more harmoniously. I think the former is probably more realistic, since all these egos on one team cannot work in complete harmony. There is a good scene where they are all bickering and challenging each other.<br/><br/>This film is not only action-packed, but there are some very funny scenes--more funny than any of today's supposed ""comedies"". The Hulk has many comic moments which is ironic since the two ""Hulk"" films were somewhat disappointing.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. also has many good lines, better than in ""Iron Man 2"".<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully entertaining film, which is a rarity these days. I highly recommend seeing this film. Also, while there are some violent scenes, it is more viewable for the kids than ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>My friend was right all along, the Marvel characters are much more exciting as a team than their D.C. counterparts, although I would love to see a live-action ""Justice League of America""."
"gardoma","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," A masterpiece of popular entertainment, succeeds in the delicate balance between comics, movies, and storytelling
","I watched Avengers on a special Marvel Marathon that included all the previous movies in the series. I have mixed opinions on the previous single- superhero flicks (loved Iron Man, hated the sequel; cold on Hulk, hated Captain America). I can definitely say that this movie far exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>It' s hard to define how its charm comes from the subtle the balance of many elements. It does not reinvent the comic books, and does not pretend to make it a 'serious' version by adding additional cerebral sub-texts (like Nolan's Batman movies). Instead, it plays by the rules, respectfully including all the popular elements of the Marvel comics. But Joss Whedon plays his cards (both as a screenwriter and as a director) with exceptional class. First, the screen writing is perfect, with great pace and great sense of rhythm. The movie is full of humor, but it is character-driven and does rely on tired one-liners. The characters are developed with such a secure writing that it takes them just a few words to define their types and personalities. Whedon manages to keep the continuity with the previous movies, but also adds his own, adult and smart, sense of development. For instance, Stark's individualism and diffidence is brought to light in a much more developed fashion that in Favreau's Iron Man movies. Even more impressive is Whedon's result with the Hulk: Whedon manages to accomplish what Ang Lee and Leterrier failed, i.e. portraying Banner as the angered, emarginated individual he is, and giving angst to his conflict with his alter ego.<br/><br/>Whedon's direction also shines through with fantastic touches. While respecting the Marvel universe movies, where skyscrapers need to be smashed and heroes bounce against each other in unreal crashes, Whedon manages to keep the visuals stunning, give realism to the scene while keeping the fun. When the Helicarrier rises in the movie, you can appreciate how Whedon manages to make it look imposing without overdoing it. When heroes have comic crashes against each other (Thor and Hulk, or Thor and Iron Man), Whedon plays with irony. When the crashes are painful (Captain America during the invasion), Whedon does make it look painful--the hero stills smashes through walls and cars with his body, but you can feel the pain. These differences lay in subtle changes in pace and visuals, and Whedon really knows how to control each scene's tone with subtlety and craftsmanship. <br/><br/>Recalling the movie, I have a hard time not to smile thinking back at how much I enjoyed each scene. I am hard pressed to think of a movie that gave me more fun at each level. It makes the Marvel universe real and tangible without making it look childish. More importantly, it communicates love for comics and for movies in equal measure. If Francois Truffaut were alive, he would have probably found in Whedon's blockbuster the same love for the capacity of telling a story in a movie that he loved in his favorite films.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. And I find it very hard to believe that somebody could hate it."

","Well, that movie was definitely as great and epic as everyone has been talking about. If the movie lacked in anything, it gained in its action. The only reason I kind of feel disappointed was that I thought there'd be more villains besides big and bad Loki and what ever he unleashed onto the Earth. Other than that, the movie was absolutely terrific.¬†<br/><br/>The heroes did seem to play like their normal selves like they were in their separate movies. Tony Stark was still cocky and such a smartass (excuse my French or whatever), Thor still had that meathead mentality, old Cap'n was still always ready to help anyone in need, and the Hulk was....the Hulk. This version of the Hulk though humored me the most since he always had jokes about why he had to act so cautious. The only characters that you really get to fully know more about are Nick Fury, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, who was my favorite of course. The actor who played him sure knows how to be in the roles I just love. I did some research before the movie on who the original Avengers were and I kept thinking that this one lady who was basically Nick Fury's right hand ""woman"" would be ""Wasp"", but maybe that will be for a later sequel.¬†<br/><br/>Speaking of sequels, there sure will be one judging by the sneak peek I got to see in the middle of the credits. Sadly I left after that and didn't wait until the end of the credits like a true fan. I hope I didn't miss anything great. Ever since ""The Grey"", I've always been staying after movies like these which you know would have some huge secret at the end of all the credits. All in all, this movie was just so beast. I totally recommend this movie a thousand times over, a million times over if you're a die hard Marvel fan. I'd give it a 9/10. Now for a month or so wait until the next big movie I want to see comes out: Dark Knight Rises. Oh man, I just can't wait to compare that movie with this."
"jdkraus","10","1","4","4 May 2012"," What I want in a super hero flick!
","""The Avengers"" is not an average action flick. In fact, it is an excellent one. The success of this film relies not only on the spectacular visual effects and sustained action sequences, but mostly on the characters and the interactions between them. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Hawkeye are treat to watch as they kick ass, exchange clever one-liners, and desperately work together to fight off Loki and his minions. Each actor portrays their character with zeal and believability. We don't just see Robert Downey Jr. sarcastic nature or the ripped biceps of Chris Evans. We see Tony Stark/Iron Man and Captain America saving the world from certain demise. As a result, we find ourselves cheering them on! This is what makes a great super hero flick! RDJ does get most of the lines, but he does not steal the show entirely from the other characters for they have a chance to develop too.<br/><br/>For nearly a 2 hour and 30 minute film, ""The Avengers"" flies by. The action scenes are not just big explosions and blatant CGI (one sequence in particular is reminiscent to the destruction of Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon), but there are several one-on-one fights with the super heroes and the villain. Not trying to give any spoilers, but the fight between Thor and The Hulk is a true, visual effects feast and a well-choreographed sequence. Some of the action scenes are very long, but unlike the last few Michael Bay films, I found myself begging for more. <br/><br/>The plot is nothing special or too memorable. However, it is easy to follow Anyone who has not seen some of the other action films (ex: Thor, Captain America, Iron Man) will not be confused, for the scriptwriters made ""The Avengers"" a film of its own, and not a crossover of the other features. It is worth noting that the writers also pack a lot of witty and sometimes unpredictable humor into the mix. To sum up, ""The Avengers"" is the best super hero flick I have seen years. It has everything I ask for in the genre."
"marco_dg91","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," This is what it's all about: Fun!!!
","There comes a time every once in a while when a movie is released to the public that changes everything. Star Wars changed sci-fi films forever, the Lord of the Rings trilogy re-defined fantasy and made it a respectable genre, and now, we have Joss Whedon's Avengers, which I can say with assurance that is nothing short of the most entertaining comic book movie ever made, and all I can say to my fellow comic book fanboys (and girls) is this: This is the best time to be a comic book geek in history.<br/><br/>Let me make it clear that this is a spoiler-free review, so do not worry about reading further on in case you have not watched the film yet.<br/><br/>Avengers represents the culmination of more than 4 years worth of work and setting up since the release of the first Iron Man movie back in 2008. And boy, does it deliver! Whedon and co. knocked it out of the park. Without giving too much away, the story consists of Loki, the demigod we saw in last year's Thor, with Tom Hiddleston reprising the role, who has somehow attained an alien army under his command, and plans to use it to invade Earth. Obviously, S.H.I.E.L.D. and agent Nick Fury, played by the always-awesome Samuel L. Jackson, don't like that, so they now must resort to assembling the greatest team to fight this army the world had ever seen, and among these individuals are Iron Man (aka Tony Stark), played by the ever- entertaining Robert Downey Jr., the WWII-era super-soldier Captain America (aka Steve Rogers), played by Chris Evans, the god of thunder Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, and of course, everyone's favorite brute, the Hulk (aka Bruce Banner when not the green, raging monster) played by Mark Ruffalo, who I initially had doubts about his abilities to play a good Bruce Banner, but I assure you, and this is coming from a comic book geek's point of view, he does NOT disappoint. The question is, though, will this team of superheroes get along well with each other?<br/><br/>What I loved the most about this movie is how Whedon so masterfully gives each character enough screen time to make them feel essential to the plot, and all of them serve an important role one way or another, and they all get their own moment to shine. Even those who doubted that the ""normal"" S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Hawkeye and Black Widow, played by Jeremy Renner and the (oh so attractive) Scarlett Johansson respectively, would stand out among the roster of super- enhanced heroes would be proved wrong. Nobody is left out. And everybody gives an awesome performance worthy of the characters they're playing.<br/><br/>The screenplay itself also consisted of witty one-liners and is full of hilarious moments. I could even go on as far as saying that this movie gave me more laughs than any comedy I've seen in years. The humor has perfect timing all around, and it's used at just the right level to not make the film feel silly. The drama is still there, but the comedy adds a nice change of pace for when things might start feeling maybe too dramatic for some.<br/><br/>The action scenes, of course, are some of the best I've seen in years. The special effects department has really outdone itself in this movie, giving us some amazing and thrilling sequences filled with punches, explosions, arrows, bullets, laser beams, missiles, rubble, you name it! It's essentially ""everything but the kitchen sink"". Just the last 30 minutes alone of this film would be worth paying the (admittedly hefty) $18 IMAX-3D cost, which is the venue that I had the joy of experiencing the film in. Which brings me to my next point, the 3D. Now, I know many people are not fans of 3D, and it's understandable. The movie itself was not shot with 3D cameras such as how Avatar. But nevertheless, I never felt bothered by it during the whole film, despite it being a post-shooting conversion. Although I guess you won't still miss much of you see it in 2D. Either way, you'll enjoy any of the 2 formats.<br/><br/>There is also a special surprise for the audience about a quarter into the end credits which hints at what possible developments will take place for the next Marvel movies following Avengers. And there is also another scene at the very end of the credits which I also recommend that you stay tuned to watch. Without giving too much away, it is perhaps the most hilarious image of the whole film. <br/><br/>All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is one incredibly entertaining experience which everyone should watch in theaters. Do not be cheap and decide to watch it in your computer screen. Watch this movie in a cinema, as it is easily the best way to enjoy this wild ride of a film. I assure you, this is the movie that fans of comic books all around have been waiting their whole lives for. The 4 years of hyping up this film have easily paid off, and now, I can't wait to see what the next chapter of the Marvel Movieverse will take us."
"drew-288-135826","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," I didn't think it could be done, but Joss Whedon pulled it off.
","Last year, I had similar reactions to both Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger. While they were mildly amusing, they were often quite boring, lacking any big-blockbuster spectacle, and seemed only around to lead into another film. That film of course, was The Avengers, and not only did I not appreciate a film out to only promote another movie, but I had little faith four films with such different styles and backgrounds would come together to work as one film. <br/><br/>However, the film that Joss Whedon has made completely proved me wrong and exceeded my expectations. The Avengers may actually be the best Marvel-adaption to be in the vein of the comics. It's enormously entertaining, with witty humor, and a satisfying, engaging character driven plot.<br/><br/>What makes the film work so well is that the filmmakers (of both The Avengers and the previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) find a way to blend the characters separate mythologies into one arc that feels natural. In that sense, I have a newfound respect for Thor and Captain America, for how they properly develop their characters individually and establish their own timeline, while at the same time developing the background for some of the major plot devices in The Avengers. While Thor, and Captain America may not work as great entertainment on their own terms, when looked at as one huge overlapping arc ‚Äì which also includes Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and The Incredible Hulk -, they make for a great series.<br/><br/>Where it seems today the only way a superhero film can be great is if it's re-envisioned to be more realistic and dark in the vein of The Dark Knight or Sam Raimi's Spider Man series, Marvel's The Avengers shows that a great superhero film only needs to satisfy it's audience, with two solid hours of action-packed, energized entertainment."
"JGomez3248","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," Very very good but not without its flaws and has room for improvement
","Let me just state something from the beginning, I had extremely high expectations for this movie and that deeply affected how I viewed this movie. I have not seen Iron Man 2 or all of the Incredible Hulk before seeing this movie so that may have effected my view as well.<br/><br/>Alright now to the movie. This movie in general has some great parts and some terrible parts. The first half of the movie was very slow but understandable because of the need to introduce the characters. Toward the beginning/middle of the movie, in all honesty, I hated it. I just felt that it was terrible. I didn't understand it at all, but the movie went on and things were okay after that.<br/><br/>The character's dialog was very funny at times which had the whole theater laughing (Tony Stark: to Bruce Banner You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? for example.) Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury, but was not as good as I would have expected from him. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, and Scarlet Johansson all gave very good performances. Chris Hemsworth was good but not great as Thor but I don't feel he was given enough screen time. Tom Hiddleston was OK as Loki but not great. The CGI however was very good and the 3D was not very distracting even though at times it did bother me.<br/><br/>I think the absolute best parts of this film was the action sequences as they were very good but could be better. The large action sequence near the end when the alien army attacks is very good but simply could have been much better. If it had been extended and more intense explosions were included that would have solved the problems.<br/><br/>The story itself seemed a little thin at times but then again I don't know how it could have been done much differently. This movie I see as the superhero equal of The Expendables which I felt had great action but a thin story and a cast of superstar actors. The entire movie seem a little off to me but that was just me. There was no deeper connection like I have with many great films.<br/><br/>In the end, I only listed many of the negatives about the movie but there are many good things in the film as well. But all and all this is the best Marvel movie to date and I can't say I'm excited about Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but we'll just have to wait and see. But like all Marvel movies, the more you think about them the less you tend to like them."
"bshannon718","10","1","4","4 May 2012"," Absolutely Wonderful, They Nailed It!!!
","This movie was hands down perfect! We go to movies like the Dark Knight to enjoy dark anti-heroism and deep meaning; then when we're in the mood for some good old-fashioned kick butt action and heroism, we go see Marvel movies. I for one love super heroes, sci-fi, fantasy, you name it; I'm a film buff who loves the fantastic, and there's no denying that this movie was fantastic! The direction of the action scenes was nothing short of genius; they flowed perfectly from hero to hero without even changing the camera. The acting was perfect, granted some were better than others, but there was really no weak link, they all had their big moments in the film, and they all shined when the time came. This summer is a great summer for superheroes and I for one am extremely excited. First, it was kicked off by the sensational Avengers. Second, we have the new take on the Amazing Spider-Man. And third, we get the finale to my favorite superhero series of all time with the Dark Knight Rises. I simply can't stress it enough, GO SEE THE AVENGERS!!! Sit back relax, enjoy being part of the crowd, enjoy the film, and when your done...go see it again (I know I will)."
"FrmSyriaWithLuv","10","1","4","4 May 2012"," (NO spoilers)
","I'm very satisfied with the outcome of this theatrical event. The movie has actually succeeded my expectations. Okay, maybe not succeeded, but it definitely fulfilled them. I'm sure anyone would agree that this was, by far the best of the Marvel series. There were many laughs which is one of the fine parts of the movie. Tony Stark played by returning Robert Downey Jr. had most of the witty lines, but he wasn't the only one to bring laughs. Another fine point of the movie was the action. This movie had non stop action. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't just a blow up everything movie, it all had reason. It had well choreographed fight scenes like the one involving Black Widow playing by the lovely Scarlett Johansson and many others involving the Avengers. Loki, Tom Hiddleston, was the best villain one could ask for. He was menacing enough to take seriously, but yet he still managed to be likable. The first scene when he comes in is just amazing. Tom Hiddleston obviously just loves show stealing because he's do it again. And HULK, let's talk about him. If there's someone who stood out in this movie, its definitely Bruce Banner, played by the first time hulk, Mark Ruffalo. He was, I'm sorry but, INCREDIBLE. There are some scenes where you just can't help but to cheer for him. He is the best Hulk ever. Come on Marvel, before you give Cap and Thor another movie, why not give him one? He had the best scenes in the movie. Mark's acting as Bruce was just as good as Hulk's CGI. I could talk about Hulk forever, but moving on, I like the character development. I felt like the movie went at the right pace to bring everyone in and it was well timed. Joss Whedon should be proud.<br/><br/>Also, besides the Hulk movie, I also think they should do some kind of Halkeye/Black Widow movie. They need their own movie to have their whole story told and also they're cute together. <br/><br/>Plus, if you have yet to see this in theaters, when you go, don't forget to stay for the two extra scenes, during and after the credits. <br/><br/>~If you actually read through that, thank you. That's like the longest movie review I've ever done, but I needed to get this out. If no one reads this than, its whatever"
"gibs-lair","10","1","4","4 May 2012"," Awesome!!
","I saw this movie today and was a bit confused as to how they would fit all stars in the storyline. I would say...wow!!!...they did an awesome job. A unique movie I've seen were all heroes get placed just perfectly. Excellent story, amazing action and graphics (not overdone but just right), and keeps you at the edge from the start till end. I would recommend this to all, but don't watch this in 3D. The director has done his best to capture the true characteristics of each marvel hero, especially hulk!. Humor has its place in the movie with unbeatable action. I gave ten for this.<br/><br/>Long time since I saw such great direction in a super-hero movie."
"tangochan85","10","1","4","4 May 2012"," This is what super hero movies need to be doing, they need to be thinking not just going with the tried and overdone.
","I've been watching super hero stuff since I was first introduced to television, and I have to say that this is the best super hero anything I've ever seen. First, the writing was very tight and suspension of disbelief was not a challenge. The acting, directing, and editing were also examples of the best in the genre. The movie knew its audience, what we've seen, what we've experienced and seemed to set out to make a super hero movie that was everything you could want from a super hero movie without being your stereotypical hero movie. <br/><br/>The Avengers are not perfect and even straight edge Captain America has his own faults. They come together because they have to and they want to. Mark Ruffalo is the best Banner/Hulk anyone could ask for, so if he gets replaced in the next movie, the people behind the replacement would be crazy. He is what all the Hulk movies needed to make the character work both as a person and a monster. <br/><br/>My biggest quibble with this movie is the same quibble that I had with Captain America (2011) and Thor (2011). These three movies seem like PG movies on hyped up violence, and part of me wonders if they couldn't have been excellent with a PG rating. Did we need the PG-13 violence? I think in Marvel's Avengers, the level of violence works despite the rest of the plot being rather PG. In Thor and Captain America, it cut into the atmospheres of both of those movies, but it seemed to work for this movie."
"Astralan","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," A great beginning to the blockbuster season!
","I came into the fanboyhood of Joss Whedon late in my life, realizing I was a fan of his productions unknowingly. I didn't put him and Avengers together until recently, but after that I was rather in anticipation of it since. Very much filmed with the same eye for sci-fi as Firefly, the continuity of the film had a warmth and familiarity to it that was easy to accept.<br/><br/>First off, it is a fantastic start to the summer blockbuster movies. With films like Prometheus and Batteship also on the horizon I will be probably more critical of what is to come as opposed to what just set the bar. With a legion of special effects people and filmed for 3D, I believe I did an injustice seeing it in a theater that was doing 2D: Some of the shots just did not come out the way I think it would have if viewed behind the glasses (I saw it in 2D because I am not a huge fan of 3D and all the hype). Technically, it was directed and filmed for 3D, and doing a backward compatibility might not have been the best. However, I do believe that when released as a BluRay disk, most people would not be able to watch it. The production crew may need to tweak it a bit before then.<br/><br/>Secondly, a master hand was at the helm shifting the weight of the film skillfully between CGI, Action, Drama and comic relief. Every artist has the right to interpret a story the way they see it. Based on characters the movie-going public have already been introduced to I'm sure helped, but for many, only Iron Man has had the most press. Hulk seems to have failed; Captain America did well at the box office but was oddly out of place; Thor wasn't as well received and his future as well wasn't a forgone conclusion. Natasha, Hawkeye, Nick Fury: If you didn't really read the comics you just wouldn't have guessed at their place in a movie with so many super-ego's in it. Somehow, Joss managed to extrapolate these vague characters and put them into a solid mix that did not always get along to at the gitgo.<br/><br/>The story is strong with continuity and weaves a strong relationship between the superhero's without haste. With a strong beginning, the plot is revealed very early but then dwells not so much on the story but the intermixing of the characters to form what the comic book is about: The alliance of superheros as a team called The Avengers. Ever been in a band where all the musicians compete for the spotlight but end up just increasing the gain of their amps? It is not an easy lesson to learn but it was obvious that Iron Man was the primary focus. Meetings, indifference, competition and cooperation, very hard lessons to learn when the world as we know it is at stake but they manage to put aside their egos for the common good and the saving of Manhattan.<br/><br/>Damn, why is it New York City is always the focus of monstrous plots? Guess I better not go there.<br/><br/>Navigating the story, there were many points where homage was paid to movies that preceded it. Obvious was Independence day, Ghostbusters, Avatar and the likes. You had a mix of Asian, northern euro and American curltures which made for a multifaceted presentation. I had a few problems with future-world design, like the water/air ship which staged the initial disharmony of the superheros. I will also reiterate my comment about 2D and 3D screen presentation.<br/><br/>Alan Sylvestri does a stunning soundtrack, which didn't have the usual signature of the initial measure pop as in preceding films. It was appropriate though a solid theme was lacking... or maybe I just could not get a theme figured out while viewing all the action.<br/><br/>One of my biggest surprises was the re-write of Bruce Banner/Hulk. Totally unconventional, the taught character of the gamma-altered human was harsh, intellectual and sometimes more unemotional than his counterpart Hulk, who really stood out as a serious contender for a relaunch or maybe a new franchise if Jeremy Renner is open to it. The super-hero team accepted him and knew how to kindle the huge green giant's passion and formed an amazing bond with his peers. I would love to see a new Hulk movie with this reworked character.<br/><br/>Joss has weaved together an amazing story with very few holes, and maybe I will see it again, but this time in 3D just to see if my observation of the 2D version is correct. Go see it. Great action, great compassion, great story. Thanks Joss."

More recent movies have a lot of one liners that are annoying, but this was great, people were laughing out loud. We of course loved the characters, which made the movie even better, because of how they set this up to this point. I think that was a lot of it, they pulled this together from movies we already loved, so we didn't have to watch characters develop, but got deeper into ones we already knew. The audience loved it,everyone clapped at the end and were talking and laughing about it as they were leaving.

"redryan64","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," Spectacular Marvel Universe Superhrero Celluloid Crossover!
","OUR ONE GREAT concern about doing this review now, is that sending it to IMDb at this time may help in causing a crash of the Website. We had just seen it at a Suburban Chicago shopping center multiplex,and much to our delight, we found it to be very much more of a film than had been anticipated.<br/><br/>BEING JUST A LITTLE long in the tooth, we cam well remember when Marvel Comics' title, THE AVENGERS, first hit the news stands. It was in July of 1963 and Superheroes were definitely ""in""; with their popularity swiftly rising during that period.<br/><br/>ALTHOUGH THE GENRE was probably the most popular one in the comics field from those 2-3 years before the United States' involvement in World War II; beginning a gradual decline in the Post War years. Peacetime brought readers' interest in Westerns, Romance, Movie Tie-ins and ""Funny Animals"", among others.<br/><br/>THE GREAT COMREBACK of the cape & mask ""long underwear"" characters was due to DC Comics' updating old favourites (The Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman) and to Stan Lee's introducing some new characters (Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Fantastic Four, Spioderman) and bringing back Sub-mariner, a new Human Torch* and, most importantly, Captain America! <br/><br/>WELL NOW, INASMUCH as we are now close to being a half century beyond this 4 Colour Heroes Rennaissance, it stands to reason that a screen adaptation of the feature would look just a trifle different than a 1960's version. We are, after all, in another Century, a new Millennium.<br/><br/>FOLLOWING A SERIES OF Summer Blockbusters, Marvel Productions & Paramount Pictures have perhaps, come up with a Blockbuster to end all Blockbusters.<br/><br/>AS MUCH AS old timers, such as yours truly, may lament about certain departures from the original, wee must admit that if we had our way all the time, there would be no progress, in any field. Invention and advancement in medicine would be at a standstill. Tadio, television, space travel and mass communications would all be stuck in the doldrums. Instead of the Internet, we'd probably be using smoke signals.<br/><br/>BUT STILL, WHY can't we still see Captain America with actual wings on his mask, Hawkeye wearing his unique mask and Thor sporting that Viking winged helmet? Is that asking too much? I mean, it was okay for Loki to model his helmet while sparring with old ""Goldilocks""; why can't Thor also wear his own headgear? We suppose that all is due to all of that revisionism that has gradually changed the story over a nearly 50 year period. It is almost like DC Comics' Earth One/Earth Two UIniverse. <br/><br/>ON THE MUCH more positive side of things, the production team gave us a truly epic story; the sort that is on the grand scale of which this certainly deserves. It is the cinematic comic book equivalent of those great stories that Mr. Stan Lee presented to us; all continued for many issues.Indeed, this may well be the best superhero outing ever since the release of SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE in 1978.<br/><br/>IN ADDITION TO the outstandingly portioned servings of great fx, the film manages to insert a great deal of the humor which Stan lee used on the printed page. Even a sort of self spoofing is in evidence, when Tony Stark ridicules Loki's rather stinted speech patterns with the remark; ""So what's this, Shakespeare in the Park?"" <br/><br/>ALL OF THIS begs the question: ""Since we now have Marvel's THE AVENGERS as a screen franchise, can DC Comics' JUSTICE LEAGUE OF America be far behind?<br/><br/>NOTE:* It was Johnny Storm of the Fantastic Four who took over the title of 'The Human Torch."""
"sinaes1","Null","1","4","4 May 2012"," Avengers: action adventure at its best
","Like everyone else who was anticipating this movie, I had heard the massive hype, and built up my expectations to the point where let down was all but inevitable. And so I went to the midnight first showing, hoping for something good, but half-ready for a bit of disappointment. Things didn't quite go like that. To put it simply, The Avengers is a triumph of a comic book/superhero film. Among fans, it will no doubt rank as one of the best Marvel based movies to date, if not the best. It's a downright great action film, right alongside any blockbuster, and a fairly solid adventure film.<br/><br/>Let's start with the characters, acting, direction. The team here is composed of seven heroes, many of which have their own proper films, and each of which is played by a very talented actor. While this might seem to bode well at first glance. It can't be understated how hard it is to balance such strong personalities, both the characters and the actors themselves. How do you make one movie, that basically wants to tell seven stories? And where each of those stories basically demands to be center stage? It's not easy at all, you have to fit a lot of pieces correctly. And Avengers is something which could easily have fallen flat if one of those pieces was off.<br/><br/>But Joss Whedon and cast did a commendable job of balancing all the characters' needs together, bringing each one fully to life, while still allowing the team story to take center stage. No one here gets left out, everyone has their time in the sun. And yet collectively it all fits together to make the movie more than just an ensemble of heroes, but the story of an actual team. In particular we see very good, believable dynamics portrayed, with how everyone is assembled, then has to adjust to working in a group setting, and ultimately become more effective within the Avengers then they would be on their own. In particular portrayals by Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo all shine in molding the team together. Iron Man is used to going solo; The Hulk has never been able to be a team player; and Captain America has a hard time dealing with people who don't really want to follow a group. That said, it really was all bright spots in the cast and characterization. Let alone, there is never once where the individual portrayal of the actual heroes comes into question, they are all spot on.<br/><br/>The visuals and effects are of course as good as one would expect. Top notch all around, as good as blockbusters get these days. One thing that I did not expect is how funny this movie was; there were so many good witty bits here and there, I think people were laughing throughout the whole film. Some moments were outright hilarious. Which is another thing about this movie, it was fun. Period. If you can leave the film critic at home for a moment, this movie is escapism at its best. It's a pure ride of action, adventure and fun, wrapped up in delicious effects. The last half of the movie flows so smoothly, it's all over before you even know it.<br/><br/>Some will want to compare this to the Dark Knight, and basically they will criticize it because it's not 'dramatic' enough. But not every film is a drama; not even necessarily every good film is a drama. The Avengers is not the Godfather or Dark Knight, and it was never meant to be. But if you can live with that, then it's a fantastic action-adventure movie, right alongside such greats as Indiana Jones, Aliens, and Die Hard. Among fans, it is sure to become a classic. And again, it's just wonderful escapism, which aside from Pixar animated films we don't usually get enough of these days. Everyone wants to be so serious :)) It's a family film too since there's not much objectionable here. Overall, very highly recommended."

The effects, the acting, the script, everything comes together perfectly and with a flow that makes the nearly 3 hour run time zip by. I wanted to go see it again fresh out of the theater. I do recommend seeing all the preceding films, unless you are fully up on your Marvel history (and even then!) Whedon fans will find themselves enjoying the familiar Buffy/Angel/Firefly style patois that defined Joss as a voice. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is inspired casting and adds to the film in a big way.<br/><br/>Just go, see the thing."

"s-maniatopoulos","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," The all-time-classic super hero movie.
","Being a kid that grew up with comics eventually does come down to some basic questions that must be answered: Who would win in a fight between Thor and Hulk? Between Hulk and Iron-Man? Does Captain America stand a chance against a God of Asgard? All these answers have been partially answered through the comic medium; however, seeing this childhood memory play in front of your eyes (and in 3D) is quite the eye opener.<br/><br/>The Avengers is not an origins movie. Which means, a story must be told! Mr. Whedon did the super hero genre an immense favor by achieving what almost no one else managed in the last 12 years: he filmed a comic book! The ""Avengers"" is a typical MARVEL story, its recipe being the one that kept comics popular for the last 60 years or so: Bad guy makes move; good guys make a stand but fail because they are divided; through their loss they understand they must unite, and united they win.<br/><br/>MARVEL delivers on all levels: It knows that Robert Downey Jr is the movie's super star, so not only he gets the longest screen time, but he also has the funniest lines AND proves to be a better man that he believes. Chris Hemsworth is a better Thor than last time. Mark Ruffalo steals the show as Bruce Banner/Hulk, making this the only worthwhile appearance of the character on celluloid. Captain America does not quite live up to the challenge, but Mr. Whedon knows how to use the character in a valuable way. As a result, all the scenes between the movie's big heroes (with big egos) are smart, funny, and keep getting better and better.<br/><br/>The film's visual/sound effects are magnificent and 3D make this movie an unforgettable experience, so do yourself a favor and watch it in a cinema. The action scenes are a wonderful cocktail of action&humor that comes across very successfully, as over-dramatization in this kind of films usually proves ridiculous. <br/><br/>MARVEL was very lucky in making a fantastic Iron-Man movie out of the blue (mostly thanks to the talent of Robert Downey Jr), while the other three films that introduced the Avengers characters were rather average (Captain America, Thor, Hulk 2). This made a lot of people, including myself, very uncertain about whether the Avengers movie would not be the biggest flop of them all. <br/><br/>I was extremely surprised to see a film that delivers on all levels and is, in my opinion, the best super hero movie MARVEL has ever made. This is a personal triumph for Mr. Whedon, who scripted and directed (rather modestly) a film that could had failed in so many different ways. It is also a great achievement for the production team, the all-star cast and the crew, who cooperated successfully to manage a very fine balance between action, comedy and special effects.<br/><br/>If you like comic books, this is single-handedly the best super hero movie since X-Men2. And if you like super hero movies, it doesn't get better than this."
"sketchmasters","10","1","4","4 May 2012"," avengers greatest superhero movie ever

Acting, directing , script were all top notch, well made to perfection and this is what all the comic book fans have been waiting on for years a comic brought to life how it should be done, in tradition of Marvel Comics ""BRILLIANT"" film making. The Avengers is without a doubt action packed but it is also funny, clever, and serious with innovative cinematography and art direction, but its a shame award members will not recognize the film for its movie greatness with a best picture nomination maybe some technical categories that's it other than that trust me and go see it you won't regret it even the non-superhero fans will enjoy it."
"MJalazo","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," Effortlessly ties together various story arcs, with great action and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments
","I've never been a comic book geek but have seen all the Marvel movies thus far (the sole exception being Iron Man 2) and have loved them all. Until now, Thor was my favorite, simply because I was a huge fan of the otherworldly cinematography, the Shakespearean dialogue and characters, and because I found Tom Hiddleston's Loki to be the most captivating villain in any superhero movie to date. So, perhaps just as much as seeing The Avengers come together, I was equally stoked to see Loki again as the arch-nemesis. Simply put, he was fantastic. There is a scene when he confronts Black Widow, about halfway through the film, that is nothing short of haunting and allows him to show his full range of talents. He's brilliant.<br/><br/>As far as The Avengers themselves... Joss Whedon does two things very well here. First, he allows each character ample time to harness and exhibit its individual conflicts, and how they would play out among the team. After all, putting four superheroes in a room and asking them to play nicely should be no easy task, given the massive egos you would expect to be involved. Whedon plays this collective angst out very nicely. Second, he ties all the story lines from the individual movies together, in a near seamless fashion. Amazingly, everything made a good deal of sense as it came together, with no major storyline flaws. Quite the accomplishment, given the diversity of many of the stories told in each film.<br/><br/>Robert Downey is great, capturing the cynicism and narcissism of Tony Stark better than he did in the original. Captain America and Thor bring unexpected humanity to their roles. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was quite the surprise, as he does what Eric Bana and Edward Norton failed to do, and that is underplay Banner (rather than portray him as a neurotic, hyper fool). The best Hulk yet. Scarlett Johannsen does a very nice job as Black Widow, also conveying deep emotion and pain.<br/><br/>Probably the best dynamic is between Stark and Banner... two intellectual geeks who form quite a bond that is believable.<br/><br/>Lastly, I saw it in IMAX and that probably added an extra point to my 9/10 rating, as seeing it in a less profound format wouldn't quite capture everything that is on display here. All in all, definitely worth seeing and I'll be back in the theatre again before it's on DVD, which will certainly be in my collection."

The movie keeps up to the promise with characters being original and behaving exactly how they are taken out from their original places. With all the super heroes at one place, it creates chaos and one hell of entertainment. On a stage where you have all the superheroes together, its quite obvious about the target to stop something which causes the end of the world. On the other side you cannot expect for a great plot since its all about the heroics of the Avengers... So have some popcorn and enjoy the movie..."

They concentrated on other factors that affects, and this time they came up with giving it a comic appearance than comics, and boy, they came out as winners, I didn't remembered any other Hollywood movie I laughed out so much and the good thing is its a movie you can enjoy with your family as there are no or negligible vulgarities into it.<br/><br/>The movie takes it to the next level of movie making with superheroes.

"Victory_Over_Trolls","9","1","4","4 May 2012"," So much of the movie already appears in trailers.
","Marvel's Avengers or whatever it's called in your country is the culmination of the Marvel movies that have been released promising a massive team-up between the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and more.<br/><br/>The ambitious film does a decent job of weaving together the various heroes so that it feels like they all serve a purpose in the film. It might seem, on first glance, hard to swallow that a film will find a character like Hawkeye as important as Thor, and one might be afraid the stalwart Captain America would be short-changed by the immensely popular Iron Man, but thankfully the characters are given reasonably equitable amounts of screen-time.<br/><br/>Superhero films tend to be somewhat predictable, but despite the amount of promotional material released, that's one thing the film is not. I'm writing a spoiler-free review, but all I can say is that when you think you know where the film is headed, Dr Banner and his alter- ego manage to mix things up.<br/><br/>In typical Marvel style, there are some loose ends and some mid/post-credits scenes. Stick around for the mid-credit scene if you're a longtime Marvel fan, but the end-credit scene adds very little to the experience unless you're extremely hardcore.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for anyone who's into superhero films. For everyone else, it's an exciting action film, but if you haven't seen the other Marvel films (especially Thor), it's going to be hard to follow, but just sit back and enjoy the ride."

","I saw the movie in 2D and loved it. The summer of 2012 begins with a BANG and the rest of the season movies ""have met their match"".<br/><br/>Making the blockbuster ""The Avengers"" into a masterpiece of entertainment, at the time it was announced, seemed impossible for me to achieve with such a high level of efficiency and art. Not even the news of Joss Whedon directing (which I'm familiar with since his ""Buffy"" times""), not even the actors cast, not even the most recent trailers, could have prepared me for HOW WELL this movie is made. I already knew it was gonna be good, but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS GOOD!<br/><br/>All the actors are at the top of their game. I won't stand out anyone, let's just say they're all excellent. From the main cast and even the secondary characters like agent Coulson or agent Hill. They're really good in this. And they all get their moments to shine, not only individually, but as a group. I didn't feel that one or the other got more ""screen time"" than the others, or that one was more important than the rest (speaking about the super-heroes). Each had its own relevance, contributed to the group, and we can clearly feel that when the team finally bonds, ""they're tough as nails"". This is a rare feat when dealing with ensemble casts. I'm wondering if any other movie has achieved this level of balance with such a high caliber group of actors.<br/><br/>The script and the dialogs between characters, between the Avengers or between each one and Loki, are also spot-on. It's more than obvious the Whedon touch, who creates a tapestry of living words that sometimes goes beyond the ""comic book"" feel of the movie into something more (specifically the lines Loki delivers). And there's no shortage of humor: there are laugh out loud moments, funny moments that we weren't expecting, especially one very short scene between Thor and Hulk that takes but a blink of an eye. Oh, before I forget: if the trailers left you with a bitter taste of ""Transformers"" in your mouth, make no mistake: the action isn't, and by far, as robotic, tedious and soulless like in those movies.<br/><br/>Regarding the technical aspects, there's not much to tell here. ILM delivers as usual and almost like no other. The art direction, the sound effects, the costumes are great. Alan Silvestri's score is more than competent.<br/><br/>In short, ""The Avengers"" reaches without a problem the title of best movie of 2012 so far, and it will surely be in many top ten lists when the year is done. It is a landmark of cinema and in its particular genre that, although different from other movies of the same quality (""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight""), will absolutely not go unseen by lots and LOTS of people (fans and non-fans), and that we will remember like a ""Hulk smash to the head"": a 2h 20m punch that goes by so fast and that leaves me wanting much more. Joss Whedon had a gigantic task ahead of himself, and not only he delivers perfection, he may finally get the recognition he's been deserving for years: he's become the next great director not to miss. Welcome to the big league, Mr. Whedon! When will ""The Avengers 2"" be coming out, sir?<br/><br/>9/10 (which may well be a 9.5 or 10 after a second viewing)"

","Pumped, excited, mighty, happy and satisfied. These are just some of the feelings I got right after watching this incredible movie. Driving home from the cinema, talking about it, commenting are favorite parts while storm is brewing over us. It was like Thor himself was watching, proud of work that he and his superhero friends have done. This is much more than a summer blockbuster, much more than a popcorn flick. This movie has a point. It is the culmination of everything that happened from Iron Man through Captain America. It starts with a bang, it ends with it. It's action packed, funny, and will keep your eyes glued to the screen for 143 minutes. Special effects are top-notch, beautiful, simply incredible and if you choose to watch the movie in IMAX 3D you're going to shake in your seat. But effects are just that, this movie features an amazing cast. They fit together so nicely, everyone got just enough of screen time, everyone's motives explained. Many will again say this is not that much of an art, it's just a lot of explosions and fights between superheroes. But it is so much more, you just have to see it to believe it. Me, being sort of a geek, waiting patiently for this master piece since it was first announced, and since Nick Fury first appeared in the post credit scene, I got what I hoped for. This is a must-watch!"

","Wow, I've just seen this film in the cinemas and I am blown away. This is easily one of the best superhero film I have seen. It has everything you would want; Great action, good acting, superb special-effects and extremely good interaction between the characters. I won't give anything away but the interaction between The Hulk and Thor is hilarious, especially near to the end of the film. Chris Evans is great as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo is good as the calm Hulk, Chris Hemsworth is good as Thor yet again, the rest are decent but the star of the characters is Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. He is such a smart, witty, funny character and he makes the film a lot more interesting. My only fault with acting is that Loki is not ""bad enough"". The actions scenes in the film are really intense and the effects are amazing and realistic (if you include flying robots).

Thor is easily as convincing as he was in his debut movie and Robert Downey Jr. plays a great Stark. <br/><br/>There is just the right amount of humour and just the right amount of quiet moments.

"deepesh-355-609949","9","1","4","2 May 2012"," The Avengers
","Starring Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans. Directed by Joss Whedon. 140 minutes. Opens midnight Thursday at major theaters. PG Agent Phil Coulson will love The Avengers. You surely will, too, if you recognize his name. Officious but lovable S.H.I.E.L.D. sleuth Phil is one of many Marvel Comics minions Joss Whedon summons to his energizing superhero adventure, making this first blockbuster of summer 2012 something of a geek drill. It helps if you go to the film having already seen the two Iron Man movies, plus Thor, The Incredible Hulk and Captain America: The First Avenger, all released between 2008-11 and leading up to this ensemble nerdgasm. But you don't have to sport a propeller beanie to enjoy The Avengers, and this may be the highest possible praise for what director Whedon and his co-writer Zak Penn have wrought. They've cannily crafted a saga guaranteed to pass muster with the Comic- Con cognoscenti, without forsaking regular popcorn munchers who just hope to see the planet get saved with maximum firepower and a few laughs. Whether you love or merely like The Avengers, it will likely all come down to the performances and not the perfunctory plot or the on-the-fly back story. You don't need to know Agent Phil's connection to the Marvel multi verse to appreciate Clark Gregg's expanded and surprisingly emotive take on him here, as a combination of fusspot and fan boy. And past knowledge of two iffy Hulk movies isn't required to marvel at the nuances that newcomer Mark Ruffalo brings to the green-skinned beast, even though ""the other guy"" within mild-mannered Dr. Bruce Banner isn't revealed until the 80-minute mark of this 140-minute bladder test.<br/><br/>Also new to the team and the evolving Avengers narrative are Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow, a lethal gymnast who demonstrates early on that a chair makes a dandy weapon, and Jeremy Renner as special agent Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, whose arrows aren't quite the Robin Hood anachronism they appear to be. Robert Downey Jr. returns in fine scathing form as billionaire playboy Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, the ferrous phenomenon who shields everything except his sharp tongue. It's pretty much business as usual, meanwhile, for the two most dislocated Avengers: Chris Hemsworth's Thor, a Norse god fallen from the heavens; and Chris Evans' Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America, a Second World War super soldier still shaking off decades of deep freeze and culture shock. They've all been brought together by eye-patched persuader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., a global version of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. ""It's sort of a team,"" Stark glibly says of the Avengers, and ""sort of"" is the operative phrase for much of the movie."
"boeing100","9","1","4","2 May 2012"," Entertainment at its finest
","After reading mixed reviews about this film, I decided to give it a try, with both Digital 3D and D-Box as add-ons. Let me say that I was certainly not disappointed! Though the storyline in itself does not bring anything new to the game, I have to say that I have not been this entertained by a movie for a long time. Firstly, the CGI was best in class. The characters, including The Hulk were lifelike and believable. I remember thinking before the movie started ""Let's see what a $200 million movie looks like"" and the results are more than impressive.<br/><br/>In regards to the 3D, YES there are some darks scenes where there is no real sense of depth, HOWEVER the final scene in NYC alone is worth paying the 3D premium for. Flying through the Manhattan skyline, dodging explosions and twist-and-turning in wrecked cars were some of many scenes that make you feel like you are actually there. This must have been helped by the D-Box chairs, which I would also recommend to make this experience complete.<br/><br/>Finally, the actors all did a great job both in hilarious one-liners as well more emotional sequences. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the cinema experience for the thrills, as this title will not fail in keeping you on the edge of your seat!"
"Dash1969","Null","1","4","1 May 2012"," Superb! Hits A High Standard Of Excellence
","Hands down, this is THE best film the genre has ever produced.<br/><br/>All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Then there's the rare beauty that hits ABOVE the mark. The Avengers is such a movie. It EXCEEDS the already high expectations. It's the best big budget movie that I've EVER seen. It honestly may be my favorite movie of all-time. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, charisma, crisp and witty dialogue, the perfect villain, actual character development and puts it all together in one amazing package. For those few out there that didn't have high expectations, this movie will surprise you with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil within each character as well as the outer friction between such diverse individuals worked exceptionally well. We really can relate to each character and why he or she feels and acts the way that they do. Rest assured that The Avengers does delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments.<br/><br/>It's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated and will continue to generate now that people are seeing it and falling in love with it completely."

","Following 5 solo movies the team is finally here, suited up and ready to take on Loki, Thors adopted brother; a demigod. Loki who is conjuring a devious plan to let all hell run riot on dear earth that we all sincerely love has bad things coming his way. The N√öMERO UNO Tom Hiddleston super villain will stop at nothing unless THE AVENGERS have something to say about it!<br/><br/>The hype for one of the most anticipated movies of summer 2012 has taken 4 years to build on. With the unveiling of IRON MAN in 2008 up until CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER from 2012 these movies are merely well crafted teaser campaigns. Opening up in the UAE on the 3rd May 2012 the expectations on this Paramount Pictures/ Walt Disney distributed production has its work cut out for it. Cinemas have already sold out most of its shows for the premier night and I would anticipate it to be so for a few weekends considering the box office stratosphere potential THE AVENGERS pack. <br/><br/>Captain Steve Rogers aka CAPTAIN America sacrificed himself during the WWII destroying with himself the Tesseract that contains immense energy to create sustainable energy. Dr.Stark Senior and S.H.I.E.L.D who retrieve the Tesseract and the captain from the depths of the ocean has since then been experimenting on extracting its power. When the Destroyer of Asgard posed a massive threat to the human race in THOR, S.H.I.E.L.D began its experiments in phase two of the Tesseract. The demigod Loki infiltrates the highly secured S.H.I.E.L.D premises where lab tests are being run and reduces it down to a sand pit before taking with him the Tesseract, Hawkeye and Selvig. Loki not only hopes to use its powers for sustainable energy but more over he wishes to use its power to open a portal to outer space and thereby bringing to earth a breed of aliens that would destroy the human race. This is big! Dear readers this is merely the beginning of what would be considered to be an epic Superhero mash-up. This in terms of avenging a crime is sheer MOTIVE!<br/><br/>Now that Loki has the Tesseract it's up to Nick Fury and Agent Phil Coulson to bring in the parade. It is time. It's time the avengers assembled. Re-branded in the UK as AVENGERS ASSEMBLE it gives a better feel to the tone she carries through her 142 minutes. Samuel.L.Jackson and Clark Gregg finally have more screen time. I personally believe that Samuel.L.Jacksons performance is of great aid to the motive of the entire assembly. None could have rolled out that dialogue and convinced us that we need super heroes to save the earth since we are way above our heads and make it sound convincing. We are at War!<br/><br/>Another well thought out angle to the production is direction and screenplay. Joss Whedon has focused intently on the motives of each superhero. This move is wise since the stakes are quite high in terms of expectation of the audience. It is important that he convinces that each superhero needed to be present for earth's survival. Each Superhero is given equal prominence. No one has been overcast by the shadow of the other. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye although very much human are in no way lesser to Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk or Thor. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth have been there and done that and do know how to keep the intensity and the humor flowing. While undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr is the in house comedian amongst the avengers its amusing the way Joss Whedon works some humor out of Thor (who is now sleeveless & flexing his biceps) and the Hulk. If there is one way of being human with no powers and still fitting in perfectly into the avengers unit is to have the right attitude. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner is all about the attitude right from the word go. Tom Hiddlestons psychotic interpretation of Loki brings THE AVENGERS to their knees before they rediscover themselves. It's clearly 6 against 1 and that's a lot of pressure on the British star. Successfully pulling a character such as Loki on a summer blockbuster hit will do wonders in his career.<br/><br/>All of the above with the bonus point of some breathtaking CGI is the entire production. There aren't any breakthrough moments in terms of technology in the field of CGI. Joss Whedon is using the industries best but nothing innovative is exercised. THE AVENGERS isn't a war movie but it's a movie of war! It's fought by hammers and shields, it's fought by unity and perseverance. <br/><br/>With 3 sequels in the pipeline with CAPTAIN America, THOR and IRONMAN THE next big question is when will we see a follow up to THE AVENGERS? I will answer that with a quote from Joss Whedon himself. He stated ""I don't want people to go out saying when the next part is? I want people to say; OH I want to see that again!""<br/><br/>Readers around the world; the key word with this movie is advanced ticket reservations!<br/><br/>TITLE: THE AVENGERS : AVENGERS ASSEMBLE DIRECTED BY: JOSS WHEDON STARRING: ROBERT DOWNEY JR, CHRIS EVANS, SCARLETT JOHANSSON, JEREMY RENNER, MARK RUFFALO, CHRIS HEMSWORTH, TOM HIDDLESTON, CLARK GREGG, COBIE SMULDERS, STELLEN SKARSGARD, GWENYTH PALTROW & SAMUEL.L.JACKSON RATED: PG 13 RATING: 08/10 142 MINUTES"

","I can't say that I was that keen to see this movie, even with Joss Whedon's name attached to it - a man who has had a career in reverse, with his ""Buffy the vampire"" TV series coming across as the culmination of a career in the industry, whilst other TV series of his that I've seen not reaching those heights - but the good reviews for the film made me change my mind. This is a movie which is as superhero movies should be...a rollicking spectacle. Generally I'm pretty selective about what superhero movies I watch (haven't seen the ""Captain America"" outing as...I'm not American...jingoism doesn't sit well with me). Also, I tend to jump off a franchise pretty quickly too...Iron Man 2 was so-so, so I probably won't watch the next instalment. It will be interesting to see if this series can maintain the levels of the original. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments for me in it (I did see ""Thor"" due to some amusing clips in a movie review TV show...but the clips showed the funniest bits...and they weren't as funny in the context of the movie). No doubt Joss Whedon's time on ""Buffy the vampire slayer"" was invaluable in crafting the kind of comedy that works so well in this movie...hopefully the runaway success of this movie may see Joss given the chance to make a sequel to ""Serenity""...I want to see what that kick-arse chick is capable of!...I think the actress' name is Summer Glau...I'm not sure if Whedon has an intention to make a sequel to that movie, which was based on his okay TV series ""Firefly"".<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot concerns Thor's younger brother Loki obtaining a device which can see him seize control of the Earth, via an unholy alliance with some ugly looking villains...and it's not clear who has the better end of that particular bargain. One of the biggest laughs I got was with Thor's comment about his relationship with Loki, after a comrade of his lists Loki's 'achievements'. Nick Fury has to assemble a team of superheroes in order to tackle Loki's allies...and there are some heavy hitters...the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America...then a guy and a chick...if you don't lump Captain America in with the ""B"" team. <br/><br/>The fight with Loki's allies - when it comes - is impressive. <br/><br/>It was after finding some blockbuster franchises became ho-hum for me that I got a real kick out of the 'new wave' of superhero movies...like ""Hancock"" and ""Kick-Ass"". They were the perfect antidote to when blockbuster sequels were merely lame attempts to cash in on a superior original. Time will tell if The Avengers falls into the same trap...and if it does, it's a pity that Chlo√´ Moretz is now too old to have that same wonderful impact that she did as Hit-Girl in ""Kick-Ass"". Anyway, if Joss is onboard for the sequels to this film, I'm onboard...for at least one more time!<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 3D in Xtreme screen. Didn't find the 3D particularly spectacular...parts of the movie are in regular 2D too.<br/><br/>Just by the by...I'm not that familiar with Norse mythology or whathaveyou...but I do find Thor's hammer rather lame, in an amusing kind of way...it's sort of like his handbag or something. Is it Louis Vuitton?<br/><br/>Lastly...this movie being called ""The Avengers"", when I heard the name, I was expecting it to be about Steed and Purdie! Or Steed and Emma Peel...if I was older!"

"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","30 April 2012"," Worth the wait
","For we super-hero fans, this movie has been long time coming but the end result largely justifies the wait. We've had two Iron Man outings and separate films highlighting Captain America, Thor and the Hulk. Now these four - plus the lesser- known Hawkeye and Black Widow are assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D to combat Thor's evil brother Loki whom we have seen before. Balancing so many larger than life characters and featuring so many special skills must have presented a mega challenge but director Joss Whedon - who gave us another ensemble piece in the under-rated ""Serenity"" - has done a skillful job and as co-writer he has crafted a sharp script with plenty of wry humour.<br/><br/>No viewer will doubt that British actor Tom Hiddleston makes a wonderful super villain, but opinions might differ on who makes the best super hero. All six candidates - Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson - give fine performances and bounce well off one another in the early, competitive phases but, for me, Downey Jr is still the ace in the pack.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action and excitement and the special effects are well done, although it might make a change for a city other than New York to be smashed up and, in the 3D version I saw, the extra dimension only really worked in the final titanic battle."
"paulozac","8","1","4","30 April 2012"," Great movie, but proves that 3D sucks!
","I was skeptic about The Avengers. Very few heroes movies have deserved good critics, but I must admit the film is great. Great action, amazing special effects and a script that goes straight to what we expect: action and fights, the kind of things we expect from super heroes. While Transformers really sucked because of spending a lot of time on stupid romancing and forced jokes, The Avengers succeed on providing intelligent, funny scenes even in the middle of war. That being said: I've seen some comparisons between Avengers and Dark Knight. Sorry to say, but Dark Knight is miles away (and that being said by a guy who just liked Marvel comics).<br/><br/>Now, the bad part:this movie has confirmed my feelings-3D definitely adds nothing but a discomfort to the movies. I've gone to the iMax 3D just to be sure my issue with 3D weren't the theater. No good: you can't barely notice 3D. I've seen Inception on iMax 2D: it was amazing. After leaving the Avengers, I really desired I had seen the 2D version.<br/><br/>After all, the fact that 3d sucks so much doesn't reduce the fact that if you're looking for fun, The Avengers will provide you a lot."

"Jonathon_Natsis","8","1","4","26 April 2012"," The very definition of 'crowd pleaser.'
","Anzac day. Public holiday. Late night session. Not an empty seat in the house. The atmosphere was at a deserved premium for the year's most anticipated film, and The Avengers did not disappoint. The king of sci-fi television, director Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly) enlists the help of one Samuel L. Jackson in assembling Earth's mightiest heroes to protect humanity against the greatest threat to our existence in history. Sounds pretty stockstandard, right? It should, because The Avengers makes no move towards trying to reinvent the genre, but rather takes everything that makes a film like this enjoyable and cranks it to eleven, proving there's some life in the blockbuster yet.<br/><br/>All is peaceful on planet Earth with the all-powerful Cosmic Cube safely in the hands of Nick Fury and SHIELD. That is until Loki, Thor's evil half-brother from another realm, storms the castle and commits larceny of the grandest scale. His actions convince Fury that the world is indeed at war, and he is left with no choice but to reinstate the Avengers Initiative. With it, he brings together The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and the big cheese Iron Man to take down this mighty foe. Unfortunately, all signs point to the superheroes killing each other before saving the Earth. 'Cause, you know, priorities.<br/><br/>The film's unquestioned drawcard has always been its ensemble cast and, more importantly, the potential for spectacular chemistry between the leads. This forced sceptics to beg the question: How long will this gimmick last before everyone starts to get in each other's way? The final product allays such concerns with ease, as Whedon, his fellow writers and the actors all deserve equal credit for their depiction of the superteam as the ultimate dysfunctional family. <br/><br/>To the mere mortal, a superhero can appear angelically honourable and beyond reproach. Throw four of five of them into one room and they become stubborn, irritable and deviously arrogant just like the rest of us. Watching this dynamic progressively unfold throughout the film is a treat, as the Avengers bicker over almost anything, all with a watch-me-prove-I'm-better-than-you macho attitude. <br/><br/>A witty script almost entirely devoid of clich√©s that allows room for sufficient individual character development certainly helps this dynamism. Stark copes with fighting for something greater than himself for once, Banner draws sympathy as a brilliant mind struggling with a crippling case of split personality and the contrasting ideas Thor and Loki possess regarding freedom, arguably the film's most prominent theme, all contribute to the film's depth without disrupting the excellent pacing.<br/><br/>Walking into this film in the right frame of mind, one would find most minor flaws few and far between. Not every one-liner or scripted joke hits the mark, in typical Marvel fashion, and Cobie Smulders' character comes off as underused and unnecessary in stark contrast (no pun intended) to her prominence in the trailers. <br/><br/>Kudos must also go to the execution of the 'megascene', that is, the forty-minute climactic battle between the Avengers and Loki's army. While it is certainly nothing new, the megascene has become more and more of a staple in major action franchises of late, including the last Harry Potter and Transformers films. The ambitious nature of the set piece by sheer design means things can get ugly and repetitive in a hurry if care is not taken to ensure the audience is engaged at all times (see: Dark of the Moon). <br/><br/>With The Avengers, though, the final act is not only visually fascinating, but also mentally stimulating, constantly jumping between various settings and characters involved, with new developments occurring every couple of minutes to ensure one doesn't even come close to losing interest. After a string of commercially dominant but critically indifferent projects, it appears Marvel has finally hit the jackpot in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
"ssvikas","8","1","4","30 April 2012"," A multi-starrer of action heroes!
","Following the success of 'Iron Man' (2008) Marvel Comics came up with the idea of putting all superheroes together in 'The Avengers'. A sequel to 'Iron Man' and films like 'Thor' also played their part in building excitement in the run up to the film's release. <br/><br/>Its biggest star, Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as Tony Stark/ Iron-Man and has Scarlett Johansson as Natalia Romanoff/ Black Widow who had a role in Iron Man 2 for company. There's Gwyneth Paltrow in a brief role as Pepper Potts. <br/><br/>Also from the Marvel Universe, there's Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as his brother the villain Loki, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, director of SHIELD. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye are the other first billed actors. <br/><br/>The story starts at a secret facility where scientists are researching on an unknown energy source, the 'Tesseract'. Then, things go awry and a portal is opened up allowing Norse God Loki to come through. And evil Loki plans to use the power source, team up with an alien race called the Chitauri and subjugate Earth! <br/><br/>With the world on the verge of falling apart, Nick Fury can only rely on his superheroes to save the world. But, getting these larger than life characters with massive egos to work together proves to be tougher than it seems. The rest of the story plays on the Good vs. Bad theme replete with action, stunts and cool gadgets. <br/><br/>The film's selling point is not its theme, but the way they go about telling the story. For one, it doesn't have heroes coming together spontaneously, making speeches about good and bad and then going all out battling the bad guy. Here, they are shown to have their own issues, and obviously issues with one another. <br/><br/>The altercation between characters gives us some really nice one-liners. One of my favorites was when Captain America asks Tony Stark/ Iron-man 'Big man, in a suit of armor, take that away, what are you?' to which Stark responds 'Uh, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist' with his usual arrogance. <br/><br/>'The Avengers' is also a visual treat. Filmed on digital media, it was converted to 3D in post production and was digitally remastered to IMAX format. The special effects are state of the art and offer edge of the seat action. Although I watched it on a regular screen with 3D, it would definitely be worthwhile on IMAX. <br/><br/>Since it is based on a comic-book theme and Superhero theme, there are those who may choose to skip on the pretext that comics are just for kids. Ah, get over this idea and let 'The Avengers' overwhelm you with its action and fantasy!"
"uttiyo-sarkar56","8","1","4","30 April 2012"," Visually Mesmerizing and Definitely worth the watch!
","So After Months of waiting for it and getting some excellent reviews about it, I Finally went to see The Avengers at the Movie Theatres and Here is how i felt it was.<br/><br/>Exciting, Visually Mesmerizing and Very Well Acted and Directed, The Avengers is superb to any movie lover and is full entertainment from the start, and the brilliant Visual Effects, the great acting by the whole cast who really justify their characters and some great Direction by Joss Whedon just makes it even better and worth the watch and great entertainment throughout the watch.<br/><br/>The Story which is quite reknown is based on the comics named as the same, with the 6 Superhero's coming together to make an Alliance and defeat the villain Loki The Brother of Thor, who's mission is to rule the whole world and with some help of his alien friends, he gets very powerful to really test the Avengers. <br/><br/>The Acting by the whole cast is quite superb, and every person have done their character justice by portraying these Superhero's very well, But i thought Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Tom Hiddleton as Loki really took the cake as they were quite excellent in portraying their characters. Robert Downey was his quite arrogent self as the Iron Man, Renner again gives a powerful performance as the Hawkeye and Tom Hiddleton is really good and cunning enemy who is also quite influential and powerful. The Humour by the characters are also quite good and it really does'nt let the movie go bland.<br/><br/>The Direction by Joss Whedon in this movie is quite superb, as he has done a convincing job in making one of the best 3d movies in the past year with excellent 3D Effects, Great Acting by each and everyone in the cast which he helped in, and the shots taken in the movie(specially in the last battle in Manhatten) are really breathtaking and for that the Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey also deserves his due credit for giving us such breathtaking scenes, but Whedon has really made one of the best Visually Enthralling and one of the better Superhero movies of all time. He Does'nt let the movie go bland or boring by keeping the humour coming in, and with fight scenes in good times, he really has entertained the audience.<br/><br/>The Story of course which is known by many comic fans is quite great and the Screenwriter who is also Joss Whedon and the derivers from the comics Whedon and Zak Penn have taken an interesting and gripping story which has ensure in entertaining the audience throughout the movie and really keeping you at the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>The Visual effects and the 3D effects, as I said earlier are quite simply superb and one of the better 3d movies of the past year, and the 3d effects in all of the fighting scene's are really breathtaking and hats off to the visual team for doing such a great job with the visual effects which make this movie so good. The Music of the movie is quite good too and really sets the tone in the atmosphere of the movie and I really liked the background score, so Music Director Alan Silvestri also deserves his due credit for his contribution towards this movie, and the contribution by each staff really needs appreciation.<br/><br/>This Movie really deserves a watch by anyone who likes entertaining movies and really deserves to be Seen in 3D, and this is one of the better superhero and 3d movies of the past time, and this really is a bright sign to the great summer blockbusters to come in the near future.<br/><br/>8/10"
"snowman2k","10","1","4","29 April 2012"," Joss Whedon is a God
","Awesome is another word that should be in the title, Joss Whedon did the business with this film. Please do not do another as it will ruin a spectacular first outing.....nah i'm kidding roll on the next one. Plenty of action and laughs throughout the entire film. Make sure you stay past the initial credits for the extra scene which was no surprise when you have watched a few Marvel films. All the cast have plenty of on screen time and they did milk a scene and rightly so during about 2/3 in when the Destroyer weapon is used.<br/><br/>Funniest bits were with the Hulk mainly punching people....Yah violence."
"Cable-Hogue_2099","8","1","4","29 April 2012"," They did it! Fantastic blockbuster
","When I first heard of the idea to actually produce an Avengers film I was of course intrigued, as the idea of making a super-team movie had never been accomplished before. But the Marvel Universe films had all been cleverly inter-connected and the stage was ripe for the Avengers to be made. Naturally in a film with so many A list actors, so many hero's and so many ego's, the potential for disappointment was vast, but I'm happy to say The Avengers was thoroughly enjoyable. The script is funny, the action comes thick and fast, and is choreographed much better than in any of the other Marvel films, and all the things you liked or cared about the characters before has been carried on. A very enjoyable summer movie, easily living up to the weight of expectation."
"sarathcnair","8","1","4","29 April 2012"," Movie that delivers a lot of action and special effects.Worth watching.
","I had a chance to watch The Avengers on Friday night and got to say the movie was way better than i expected.I didn't had much expectations for this movie because last couple of times i expected some movies to rock but they all let me down,lets say Transformers III?Yeah.<br/><br/>The Acting was awesome and the special effects,one of the best i have seen in the recent times.And of course the 3D was great too.It guarantees you a fast paced action from the beginning to the end.The Movie is successful in every way.In terms of story telling and CGI action was awesome as it gets in every sense.If you are looking for a great movie that u are planning to watch it in the Cinemas?Then don't wait The Avengers is just what u r looking for ;-)"
"benrobo","9","1","4","29 April 2012"," Best superhero movie ever?
","I'm not sure what everyone else thought about this film. I was worried, really worried. It just seemed that the studio was rushing it through.<br/><br/>I watched it as soon as it came out, before I had even read any reviews and I have to say that so far, it's in my top 5 films of the year, easily.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has done a fantastic job. Each Avenger is given a good amount of time on screen with Iron Man having the lions share. The dialogue is snappy and all the actors do a great job with the script. Mark Ruffalo does a superb turn as Dr Banner as does Tom Hiddlestone as Loki (who clearly likes being the bad guy). In fact there is not one thing I could say is wrong with this film.<br/><br/>There are a few good laughs in this as well, 2 of the best come from the Hulk. I wont spoil it for you but one of them I actually laughed out loud on (and I very rarely laugh out loud in the cinema).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic film. One that you could watch even if you only had a small understanding of the Marvel universe. If like me though you are a Marvel fan and read the comics, you will enjoy all the subtle references in the film as well as all the action.<br/><br/>Go see it. You wont regret it."
"lekgolah","8","1","4","29 April 2012"," Joss Whedon sets the bar high for future Marvel films.
","Putting Thor, Hulk, Captain America and Iron Man all into one film was never going to be easy, what with die-hard fans of certain characters demanding they each have their moment to shine. However, Joss Whedon succeeds in creating such a balanced film with a huge cast, he makes it look effortless. Avengers Assember/ The Avengers (take your pick) is one of the best films of the year and it hard to think of any other director who could have pulled it off. Sure there are many other great directors out there, but Whedon ensures that you don't to have of read the comics to appreciate this. <br/><br/>The cast, direction, the script, the editing (very smooth), cgi, cinematography etc is amazing but I'm sure this has already been a lot mentioned about it. What made the film for me personally is the sense of camaraderie between all the characters as they work together, that is essential in any war/ team film that depicts people working together. Each character is also nicely developed, particularly Bruce Banner aka Hulk. Supporting members including Nick Fury, Hawkeye and Black Widow are also given their time to shine, and each actor is well cast. <br/><br/>While Loki's motif could have seen a little more development, the film feels nicely rounded and the action is amazing to watch as New York is torn apart. The film is funny in places but never feels goofy or unnecessary (pay attention Michael Bay). Whedon's ability to keep the action fresh ensures that this film never falters and becomes tired. <br/><br/>Avengers Assemble is an amazing film that gives the audience what they want and more, and is a sure contender for the best superhero film to date. While The Dark Knight Rises comes closer to its release, it is important to note that these are two very different films. Regardless, there is something for everyone and I strongly recommend watching it on the big screen."
"patyjchoi","9","1","4","29 April 2012"," A Marble's Gigantic Symphony ""Hero""
","Even though I am not a passionate reader of American comic books , I really enjoyed this movie. This film succeeded to penetrate my firewall and planted a strong desire to master all the Hero comic books.<br/><br/>The movie has a long running time of 142 min, not to mention of it, the director needed long enough to provide appropriate conflicts to the respective avenger members. The first half of the movie shows member's conflict, whereas the second half shows their reconciliation and reunion.<br/><br/>That is also a good example of how the members cooperate in such as desperate situation ""The earth is under siege"" Thanks to perfect CG and perfect acting of heroes/heroines, this movie is almost gave me joy of listening to a well made classical symphony. <br/><br/>The last 30 min of war scene is outstanding and memorial. Marble comics did it. Really this is a phenomena."
"joab-rey","9","1","4","29 April 2012"," kick-ass!
","I brag about movies being good all the time, but rarely when I believe they are great. I'm a fan of all genres of movies, but lately I have felt a bond to grow with superhero movies because they keep getting better, it seems Hollywood finally listened to regular, common people that pay to watch the movies they produce. It has been a while since I walked out of a movie theater with a sense of satisfaction, and today was no exception. I live in El Paso Texas, but today I crossed the border(legally of course), to Juarez to watch the avengers movie. I know I am still a little immature at my age(35), on some things of course, but sitting at the movie theater I felt like a kid again, happy, excited, and with a smile from cheek to cheek when it was over. I am a geek regarding comic books, superhero movies and stuff, heck, my favorite toy and item of collection is my wolverine #1 in near-mint condition, lol. But seriously, this is a movie to see more than once in movie theaters, specially in 3d, then purchase it on blu-ray when it comes out, because it will be one of those movies that you can watch over and over, I am very happy this movie was made, every other superhero movie that comes out after this has to be spectacular, near- perfect, because this movie just raised the bar for the genre, good job, and thanks to everyone involved in creating this awesome production. Go watch it, take your kids, nephews, grandkids, your entire family, or even just yourself, you will not regret it! :-)"
"ronydn","8","1","4","28 April 2012"," The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America).
","Before the Avengers assembled we've had 2 Iron Man, 2 Hulk, 1 Thor & 1 Captain America movies. Black Widow was seen in Iron Man 2 and Hawk Eye makes a first time appearance in this one. If you do the math it is pretty clear that to get The Avengers right the director has to get Hulk and Iron Man right. Iron Man is safe in the good command of Robert Downey Jr. but Hulk was the only character that never peaked in spite of two actors (Eric Bana & Edward Norton) trying to nail it in two different movies. For me the biggest triumph of The Avengers is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. He is the best Hulk yet.<br/><br/>Whats it about? For those who have not followed the series, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) lands up on earth searching for a cube that will help him rule the earth. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has to stop him so he assembles Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Rufalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson), Hawk Eye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to stop Loki. <br/><br/>How is it? Paisa vasool entertainment.<br/><br/>My Take Like I mentioned above Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk is the bestest part of the movie. You have to be patient enough for The Hulk to appear. His entry is almost after an hour but Mark Ruffalo prepares the perfect build up as Bruce Banner with his restrained and almost vulnerable portrayal of a character struggling with his condition. The second best thing is the humor. Joss Whedon gives all the characters some really witty lines to deliver. Since most part is about the Avengers coming together the humor helps in keeping the audience engaged especially those who are not well versed with the back stories of each individual superhero. Out of the all the superheroes I was only interested in Robert Downey Jr and Mark Rufalo. The rest were great supporting actors at their best. The icing on the cake is the last 30 mins when the film peaks as a special effects loaded summer blockbuster movie. If you look at director Joss Whedons filmography you'll wonder what made the studios trust him with a rumored 220 million dollar budget film. Now, that is the story I am very interested in knowing! He is the only guy I know who has taken a giant leap from T.V to the big screen. <br/><br/>Word of mouth The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America). <br/><br/>Rating - **** (Very Good) <br/><br/>Ticket Meter Worth any amount of money<br/><br/>P.S. If you have it playing in an Imax theatre drop everything and make an effort to watch it there. The fun just multiplies with the Imax experience."
"Prichards12345","9","1","4","28 April 2012"," Most action-packed Superhero movie ever - but the plot's a bit basic.
","Well, for years Marvel Studios have been building up to this movie, teasing the fans, and providing a lot of solid entertainment flicks along the way. So does it live up to expectations? Well, for me at least, it certainly does. The movie is often jaw-dropping, exciting, funny, and full of those fan boy moments we've all dreamt about. Thor vs The Hulk? You got it. Thor Vs Iron Man? Yep, present and correct.<br/><br/>The actors all do well and have many moments to shine, but Robert Downey Jrs' Tony Stark gets a lot of the best lines, while Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow gets a surprising depth to her character. Director Joss Whedon has skilfully avoided the Iron Man and the Other Guys movie this could have been - Avengers is a true ensemble piece with a script that skilfully blends the various heroes' backgrounds and personalities. Whedon has scored big time.<br/><br/>Boy do you really feel the power of The Hulk and Thor - this is on a different scale to those characters' solo movies. Mark Ruffalo is easily the best Bruce Banner ever, and The Jolly Green Giant has never been so awesome. And there's a surprising amount of screen-time for some of the ""lesser"" characters - Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye's is great and fan fave Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson is again top notch.<br/><br/>With all the awesome mayhem going on, poor ol' Steve Rogers must feel mightily underpowered when up against The Thundergod, O'l Greenskin and The Golden Avenger; yet Capt America gets some good moments, too. Tom Hiddlestone is again excellent as Loki - a bad guy with some weight always makes these movies work better. His confrontation with The Hulk is a sheer joy, the sort of thing which smacks you full in the face and makes you laugh out loud.<br/><br/>My only gripe is the central plot idea. Marvel themselves must have used it a hundred times at least in their comics, and if you're gonna do an alien invasion story why not use The Skrulls or The Kree - better known aliens? What you do get is a spectacular battle for New York between The Avengers and the aliens. The latter are just cannon fodder but it's terrific, stupendous stuff. If you want brooding introspection go to The Dark Knight. Want Wham! Bam! Kapow! go here!!!"
"vikieinstein","10","1","4","28 April 2012"," Vow awesome and fantastic movie.
","The movie is awesome, 2 and a half hours non stop action and story twists, the main thing is the movie, when the fight comes i wont that to stop. I want it to continue, it is done in such a graphics and design. Looks real and superb. Even on watching the avatar movie, i don't experience this much fun and acceleration. This movie is meant for non stop action acceleration. The climax is good, i felt sorry that the movie is over, bcoz i don't want to miss the super heroes, even my family too. Everybody from the age of 1 to anything it is, will love to watch the super heroes performing a splendid action to save the world. If you are not watching this movie, you are going to something in your life which is a world wonder project i would say.

"letyouwin1991","9","1","4","27 April 2012"," A movie of 3D in terms of screen and character!
","A must watch for May ! This movie definitely keeps the style of Iron Man : lots of funny lines, excitement, quick peace line and mouth-dropping high-technology weapons <br/><br/>Well-written dialogue loaded with entertainment, message and clue. Some lines make you laugh spontaneously , but when you think them twice will reveal the value of each character.(E.g A:We need a plan of attack B: I got a plan, ATTACK!)<br/><br/>The plot is very 3D ! It well-depicted the role, character and struggle of each hero to make you hardly dispense anyone of them in the movie. Say I cannot imagine how this movie will looks like if your take The hulk away, not to mention Iron Man!!!<br/><br/>In short, I never check my watch during the play as every second is so breath-taking Currently it is the first runner up on my comic hero movie list, just after Batman (the villain and the inspiring quote of Batman is unparalleled!)"
"markverdini","8","1","4","25 April 2012"," The Avengers Review spoiler free.
","OK so this is my first review I've done so sorry if it isn't grade A standard.<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying before you see this movie make sure you watch the movies that lead up to The Avengers it doesn't take away from the experience but you'll get to know the characters better and add depth to them all. The 3-D nothing special maybe one part that did it well but other then that just your usual converted 3-D. The characters were good Tom Hiddleston (my opinion) out shines them all except for Robert Downey Jnr but maybe its because I'm a big fan of Robert and Mark Ruffalo performed well. There is some good comedy in there even during the final battle. One problem I had though was with Captain America suit, I know it's part of him and from the comics but I felt like I couldn't take him seriously and by the end of it Hulk didn't feel like Hulk I would explain but I feel like it would spoil things. That being said though I still enjoyed the movie. <br/><br/>Please take into concern this is MY opinion don't take it seriously, people like different things. Thank you for your time."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","5","22 August 2015"," Delivers pretty well on the big budget, though still a little over-hyped.
","I guess you could call this the staple of the whole Marvel universe. From what I've heard and seen, it sounds like most of the teasers and connections from the subsequent films come together in this collective movie. It was bound to make a lot of money at the time of its release, but the people in charge seemed to take a lot of care with the other movies and create enough of a backstory so that the movie functioned like a sequel, but not so much that you were lost if you didn't see the other movies. They had a very big budget to work with, but I think they spent their money well and it resulted in a pretty HQ movie. That doesn't necessarily mean it will please everyone (though it certainly tries to), but you can clearly see that there was a lot of work and time and stuff that went into the two hours we all spent at the theater.<br/><br/>The story is mostly character driven. The plot is mostly directed by Loki's plan of world domination and disbanding the Avengers, and this is what you'll probably pay the most attention to on your first viewing. There are lots of subplots involving each of the heroes' different problems, and much of this involves background information from the previous movies. The thread involving the Avengers trying to come together is quite prominent, but it's harder to focus on it the first time around because you're probably concentrating more on Loki's scheme. The way Loki uses their volatility and power against each other is great, and the dialogue in those scenes of tension is very well written. To top off this conflict is a conspiracy within SHIELD to use the tesseract as a means to create high-tech weapons.<br/><br/>The six (or seven if you count Nick Fury) superheroes are treated pretty equally in screen time, plot relevance, internal conflict, and combative ability. Hawkeye/Clint Barton seems to get shorted a little bit, but he also isn't really himself for 75% of the movie either. They are all distinctly different and, as I mentioned before, have clashing personalities. The idea of bringing them together kind of defies the idea of a superhero, who is basically supposed to be a one man show. They are well developed too, which is probably helped by the previous movies. Loki is a pretty good villain in a psychological sense, though not the best of his kind by any means. He's intimidating and has some battle skills with intelligence to boot, but his most notable attribute is how he gets into people's heads and exploits their weaknesses and humanity. All the characters have flaws, and all of these are addressed. They're personified well by their actors, though nobody has a spectacular performance. I could talk about each character separately, but I don't think I've got enough space. I'll just say that the featured parts along with the obvious heroes and villains are, Phil Coulson, Maria Hill, Eric Selvig, and Pepper Pots.<br/><br/>The visual effects and action choreography are really good, as they should be with something that has such a big budget. The directing is pretty good for most of it and even has a few outstanding moments. I liked the script for the most part, except when it came to comic relief. Sure some of it's funny, but it's kind of annoying at the same time. I don't think they should have just scrapped all attempts at humor, but either they messed something up, or that's just my sense of humor.<br/><br/>If you like any of the featured superheroes, I would expect you to enjoy this, though I don't know how well it sticks to the comic books. If you haven't seen any other superhero movies and want to ease your way into the genre, this is the best movie to start with, though not necessarily the best of its kind. It's worth seeing twice if you liked it the first time around. If you hate absolutely every character from early on, go ahead and stop. But if you only have a problem with one or two characters, keep going. I absolutely hate Tony Stark's arrogant personality, but I like Bruce Banner and Steve Rogers so it remains a pretty positive experience. It's probably okay to watch it with your kids if your comfortable showing stuff like Pirates of the Caribbean, Narnia, Goonies, or Harry Potter. It is predominantly action, but can cater a little to people who favor other genres. So watch if you're interested, but just know that you don't need background information apart from knowing character names. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

","Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"bay-furst-1","9","1","5","2 January 2014"," One of the best movies of all time.
","I'm not a big fan of superhero movies, but watching The Avengers turned me into one. I love how they wrapped all of the separate stories/movies and combined them into one. I also like how they were able to keep all the actors and didn't need to recast. The story was pretty easy to follow and understand. It also included a lot of humor, especially from Robert Downey Jr. I was also very impressed with the special effects, especially The Hulk. The acting was also very good. All of the characters that already had their movies did a good job sticking with that characters attitude and demeanor from those movies.To sum it up, very impressed with the acting and everything else overall."

","Although some May not be huge fans of the traditional comic books, The Avengers are placed into reality by science fiction animation and an outstanding ""All Star"" cast. At some point in the average persons life they have heard of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, The Hulk or the God of lightening, Thor. These characters have been apart of the American culture for decades and at last they all come to life. This movie highly recommended as a must see. It has all the elements for a nonstop, action-packed family movie. It is shear genius that the plot for this film be intertwined and ran off from the other previous movies that the Avengers starred in individually. I do agree that some parental guidance should be suggested based on some scenes being potentially violent. Overall, I give this film the highest rating do to the outstanding cast, Director influence, costumes design, plot of the movie and awesome display of special effects used to place the movie together."

","I have always preferred DC movies to Marvel. However, Avengers really changed that and provided a Marvel movie that could go toe to toe with the best of other comic book adaptations.<br/><br/>This is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. Certainly the best Marvel has put out. The jokes are hilarious, the action is intense. Every character, even Loki and Nick Fury, have scenes that give us insights into their characters. One of my 5 favorite movies of all-time, and a must go for any fan of the comic book movie genre. I can't wait for the Age of Ultron, and the Avengers 3 with Thanos!<br/><br/>10/10"
"nikki-lovely","7","1","5","13 November 2013"," A great action packed movie with the hero's we have come to love and know.
","It's really exciting seeing an actor in a movie then seeing them again in a different movie, you get a little bit excited that you know something or someone. Well when characters from movies are in other movies, just like with The Avengers, you feel more than excitement, it's very joyful. When your watching Iron Man and you see Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), then you see her in The Avengers, it's just a 'wow' moment. As well as all the other movies, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk,n even seeing characters like Nick Fury or Agent Phil Coulson, even Pepper Potts, also seeing Hawkeye, all come together to be in one movie, is really amazing. To see how their characters get along is very comical and brings you together. It makes you feel as thought we are just looking into their lives through separate movies. Even with the new television show, Agents of Shield.<br/><br/>A group of S.H.I.E.L.D Agents including Iron Man find a Tesseract, a power source with unknown abilities. It is a cube like structure that Steve Rogers in Captain America took with him in a plane to the bottom the a freezing cold ocean. This is bad news. Loki, the brother of Thor and God of Mischief, comes to earth with the promise of ruling with the Tesseract's power. Thor arrives to stop his brother and then is recruited to the S.H.I.E.L.D team. Hawkeye is already working with S.H.I.E.L.D at this time, Loki then breaks free with the Tesseract leaving director Fury and Agent Coulson stuck. They have no other choice but to initiate the Avengers protocol. This will bring in Hawkeye, Black Widow, then Bruce Banner, who has contained Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. They work together to find the Tessaract and stop Loki from destroying the city, and then the world. The Tesseract suddenly activates and then creates a wormhole above New York. Loki uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and several agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. Thor captures Loki to try to convince him to stop what he is doing and to go back to Asgard with him, he then agrees to take Loki to the S.H.I.E.L.D aircraft to be imprisoned in a strong glass cell. Loki is just a distraction while the team are trying to locate the Tesseract. Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers try to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.<br/><br/>The Avengers rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location, but quickly realize they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together he, Rogers, Stark, Thor, Barton and Romanoff battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed of Loki's control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mother-ship and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into free-fall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing to the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard. Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has a wonderful cast, interesting plot line, action, romance, emotion, and humor. It is enjoyable to watch and a great time if your watching it with friends. I give this movie a big thumbs up it is definitely worth buying on blue-ray, no alcohol required to enjoy this film."

","Review<br/><br/>Joss Whedon is often jokingly referred to as ""God of the Nerds"" but his title is apt considering his ludicrously extensive experience in the so-called ""geek"" genre. The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, Joss Whedon has been knee-deep in the nerd world since he began directing and writing in 1997. A widely popular aficionado of the comic book world, he has been known for his unique characters, stories, and usage of cheap practical effects instead of heavy CGI; though he is an accomplished director, it still came as a welcome surprise for comic book fans everywhere when he was chosen to direct the comic-book movie of a lifetime: Marvel's The Avengers.<br/><br/>Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Iron Man: these are The Avengers, Earth's Mightiest Heroes. It was the opportunity of a lifetime for Marvel to undertake the daunting endeavor of bringing all these well-known heroes together in one feature film. This type of movie had never been made before; it consisted of a legion of famous actors that all had to be balanced perfectly with an interesting plot with running over each other or crowding the big screen. When Marvel announced in July of 2010, fanboys everywhere breathed a collective sigh of relief. Of course, there was some doubt due to his inexperience with such strong actors and a huge budget, but Joss Whedon, of all people, was going to get it right.<br/><br/>The creator of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog promised a spectacular show, and he delivered with compliments. The Avengers went on to be one of the top grossing films of all time, shattering records by flimsy franchises such as Harry Potter, Twilight, and Titanic. The Avengers received praise from a wealth of critics, highlighting the powerful storytelling, camaraderie between actors, special effects, and intense actions sequences that paid homage to its heavy comic book origins while remaining grounded in reality. I personally have seen the fil over seven times and each time I notice new nuances in the plot and little ""easter eggs"", or special treats a director inserts into a film that only true believers notice. Unlike anything ever done before, The Avengers blends dozens of famous actors into an engaging plot full of action that is contrasted by the subtle points of human reflection and punctuated by brilliant special effects and superb acting. Yes, Joss Whedon promised a comic-book movie like never before, and he surpassed even my expectations. In truth, this masterpiece of pop culture and cinematography leaves only one thing left to say: Avengers Assemble!"

","The Avengers was a movie I have wanted to see since I was a little kid. I have dreamed of seeing Captain America, Thor and the Hulk on the same screen doing what they do best and the The Avengers didn't let me down. It is by far the most well made super hero movie I have been able to watch. First don't get me wrong I like the Dark Knight series but with the mixture of CG animation and live action flowing so well together I had a hard time figuring out what wasn't real in the scene. That's what I want to see, a movie where I can't see exactly what is real and what's fake. The Avengers lived up to it's hype.<br/><br/>The acting within the Avengers was couldn't have been called anything but perfect. With the great one liners and the impressive skill each line is delivered I couldn't have expected it to be better. I even enjoyed watching Samuel L. Jackson in this film and that is something very rare for me. With the acting my biggest fear was each character fighting for the screen time and I didn't get that from any of them. They molded themselves into one unit that rocked the audience."

"davideo-2","9","1","5","30 June 2013"," Flashy, extravagant uniting of the comic book heavyweights
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), head of defence agency S.H.E.I.L.D., is thrown into action when a powerful device called The Tesseract is stolen by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the renegade son of Odin and a wicked God banished for his nature. He calls all the superheroes together from around the globe to unite as one to save the Earth. But upon Loki's capture, they start to question their assignment and whether they're being told the whole truth.<br/><br/>Superhero movies seem to be the in thing at the moment, the big studios still requiring a guaranteed fan base and surefire box office return in these recessionary times. And so some bright spark in the marketing department had the foresight to imagine them all coming together as one, supposing the ardent fans would go crazy and flock in droves to the theatres to catch it. While personally I prefer the action films more grounded in reality, there is still a young boy in me who can still find an appeal in the flashy suits and fantasy adventure. It says a lot that Avengers Assemble, where all the big Marvel comics names (with the exception, sadly, of The Punisher whose antics would probably have been too violent for a family film) manages to be more of an exhilarating thrill ride than all the films from recent times that inspired it.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has crafted a colourful, flashy sensory extravaganza that brings the characters to life in ways none of their first recent outings could and never manages to drag at quite a bit over two hours. Working together as one, the gang manage to be more effective than they ever could on their lonesomes, forging an unwitting chemistry together as events roll on, while you can never shake the feeling there's a part of them that would still like to rip each other's throats out. Luckily, Whedon never forgets to inject the script with flashes of humour at regular intervals, resulting in material that never takes itself too seriously (unlike maybe some of the original films), which sets it on the right track.<br/><br/>While the all star cast all manage to bring their respective characters to life in their own way, it's probably Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man who steals the show, firing off a wise cracking charisma through out that makes him stand out, while Scarlett Johansson is an alluring femme fatale, and Hiddleston is a hissable villain. Meanwhile, other big name stars like Jeremy Renner and Mark Ruffalo are pushed further back and occupy less screen time. But casting aside, the main thing here, the action and special effects, are appropriately spectacular and round off probably the most satisfying film I've seen in this series. ****"
"mattematask-495-772462","9","1","5","8 May 2013"," Unoriginal, clich√©d, silly... and I loved it to bits.
","As you probably will notice from reading the reviews here on IMDb, this movie is quite the hit or miss.<br/><br/>I don't read the Marvel comics, but I have always been interested in the Marvel universe, the heroes, the foes etc. I actually like most of the movie adaptations, even if they're silly, predictable and poorly written sometimes.<br/><br/>But this one, this one became my favorite Marvel movie to this date. Why? It gave me the exact thing I wanted, heroes interacting with each other, LOTS of action and an epic finale.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of superhero movies, hate action and can't watch an old concept without whining about it being an old concept, you will most likely not be entertained by this.<br/><br/>My only complain with this movie is that it should have had at least one more non-S.H.I.E.L.D. hero. It was kinda awkward with the whole superhero group-thing with just Iron Man and Captain America sitting there in one scene. Hopefully our team gets expanded in the follow-up!"
"ImSpidey2","10","1","5","25 April 2013"," The cinematic equivalent of Heaven.
","The Avengers is unbelievable. Not only is this the best comic book movie ever made, but this is the best movie I have ever seen, period, in my opinion. <br/><br/>The Avengers was a masterpiece put together film by film, starting with Iron Man. It slowly continued to assemble as The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger came(with all of them being great movies). The first hint appeared after Iron Man 1's credits. It showed Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, speaking to Tony Stark about joining Avengers Initiative. In that one short scene, an masterpiece was dramatically building.<br/><br/>Director Joss Whedon, known for Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and brought forth the Avengers themselves: Iron Man/Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America/Steve Rogers(Chris Evans), Thor Odinson(Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce Banner(Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff(Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye/Clint Barton(Jeremy Renner), as assembled by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery, and The Avengers is no exception. Whedon has an extreme love for comic books, and he proves it in this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is spectacular. They literally bring the characters to life! Robert Downey Jr. does Iron Man almost effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his charisma, charm and smugness to glow through; Downey IS the definitive real-life Iron Man. Chris Evans does a great Captain America. Chris Hemsworth as the God of Thunder has some awesome battle scenes and delivers the funniest moments. Scarlett's Black Widow has a backstory, and she's far more than a pretty face; she's twice as deadly as a real black widow. She also plays her character very well. Although Jeremy's Hawkeye has the least depth, he also did a great performance. Now to the 'jolly' green giant, Mark Ruffalo. By far, he's the best Hulk actor, more so than Eric Bana and Edward Norton. He does both characters perfectly, and he's the actor that stands out. Samuel also did a fantastic job on Fury. Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson comes back(sadly for the last time), and Codie Smulders makes her debut as Maria Hill(and she's a welcome addition). The villain is Loki Laufeyson(Tom Hiddleston). Tom plays the God of Mischief masterfully, and he gets the most fanbase, too. <br/><br/>The story is also really well-done(sorry if this spoils it for you!). It shows Loki trying to get the Cosmic Cube(or the Tesseract in this universe), so that he can have a Chitauri army as promised by The Other, so he can invade Earth. In response to this, Nick Fury assembles the Avengers to save the world. Exciting, isn't it?<br/><br/>The Avengers is also well-paced, at a running time of 2+ hours. The acting is perfect, the effects are perfect, and the script is especially perfect. For those that haven't any of the other films(You need to before you get to this), we've provided you just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without feeling overdone. Mr. Whedon provides far, FAR more than just a standard comic book film, but a story with extreme reason that's teamed up with incredible action and humor. Although the film is filled with larger than God characters, none are short-changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work with, and the opportunities stay fresh. The film's finale provides a amazingly deafening crescendo of action that is beyond breathtaking. Like the other films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence, which provides a surprising reveal. So don't walk out!<br/><br/>I went into The Avengers with quite high expectations, since there's a lot of hype and the films before this were great. After viewing the initial trailers and felt interested(and slightly blown away), this would be like the others. It was only a matter of minutes after the film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when the film CRUSHED my expectations into the roof(to death, by the way). I never would've imagined that it was possible to put this kind of magic onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm so happy that Marvel had the sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with these characters in the manner in which they did proudly. Marvel Studios and Disney truly deserves the film's praise and the 1 billion that this masterpiece made. This is THE movie. The ultimate feature. It can't get better than this. See this on theaters on every showing; buy this on DVD; buy this on Blu-Ray, do all this with every chance you got. It will be entirely worth the money.<br/><br/>Rating: Infinity/10"

","This film is not only spectacular but its an ""historic"" superhero feature film at its best. This is worth the wait. Hell, this was worth the wait many years ago when it was first developed. This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.<br/><br/>After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse. Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.<br/><br/>But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next. Now if DC & Warner Bros. can step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen."

However, the movie did have one or two scenes hear and their that were not so great, but later would insert scenes that made the watchers of the movie jump out of their seat at the movie theater. Nevertheless, you can not forget the actors who did an outstanding job to.<br/><br/>Initially, the Movie Avengers has some outrageous special effects just like for example, the scene where hulk smashes the huge snake with ugly creatures ready to fight inside of it. Nevertheless, the scene were that me my laugh a whole lot was the scene were one of the gods from another dimension was trying to explain to hulk, that he was a god and that gods should not be beaten, hulk just grabbed him and slammed him on the ground a numerous amount of times. Additionally, another special affect was where iron man shot captain America with one of his lasers that caused captain America to fly back; and hit the ground in an instant.Significantly, I personally liked the special effect where one of the people at the god and the ballet came back and him them in the face.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the producer did an outstanding job producing the movie and adding the special effects needed at the time needed.For example the scene where the god was talking to hulk he added the special effect that allowed hulk to slam the god on the god the hard ground.Moreover,the scene where Thor was falling out of the sky because he was trapped in a huge glass container, the producer Joss Whedon allowed him to break the glass on the cotainer an escape right before hitting the ground. Henceforth, the movie director also did a great job on the scene where one of the cops would not listen to captain America; so captain America destroyed a few of the creatures right in front of his eyes that made him listen to captain America.<br/><br/>However, some people might get get some despite from the scenes were the creatures keep coming in and the avengers keep destroying them.Specifically, when right after hulk destroyed one of the huge snakes with creatures in because whoever it is that is watching the movie could basically predict what is going to occur next. Essentially, some people do like to predict what is going to occur next.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, you can not forget the actors who also did an outstanding job. Additionally, like for example Chris Evans who played captain America who did an excellent job acting. In addition, Chris Hemsworth did a great job playing Thor and destroying creatures.<br/><br/>Finally, as the reader can see the movie is on of the best movies ever made. Additionally, you should watch this movie because it will blow you away and will make not want to watch any other movie.Lastly,you will not regret watching this movie because it is an action packed adventure."

To have so many powerful richly developed characters come together into a single movie with a story line that gives each a fair chance to shine is an amazing achievement. Given that these characters first formed in my imagination as a kid when I was buying the comic books, and developed over the years in various movies, seeing this all come together in such a great presentation was entertainment at its best. Should you take your kids? There was no Transformer g-string / bathroom stall moments thank God! There was a lot of violence, but it was presented in a Star Wars like fashion that did the best job possible at reducing the goriness factor. Our kids absolutely loved this movie.

The graphics are exceptional and in 3D was truly brilliant.<br/><br/>The one character I though might look a bit ropey was the Hulk as in other films he has never looked right, but here I would have to say he was probably my favorite character, player very well by Mark Ruffalo.<br/><br/>If you love this kind of film then you won't be disappointed.

","Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings the Avengers together to locate and obtain the Tesseract, a cube of untold power that could possibly power the whole world, but it is also needed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to open a portal for his army to come through and subjugate the people of earth to his will. The Avengers have their work cut out for them once they stop fighting with each other and learn to get along. <br/><br/>This is, perhaps, the best CGI I have ever seen along with fantastic editing. I know in the past we had very good CGI with Beowulf, Live Free or Die Hard, Transformers and 2012 among some others, but a true salute should go to Director Joss Whedon and maybe an Oscar as well. This was truly well organized, and seamless throughout. The story was plausible without getting into silliness and unbelievable cartoon animation effects. And, effective dialogues helped make this as real as possible. Kudos. <br/><br/>Who are the Avengers? Ironman (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). I was not familiar with The Black Widow and Hawkeye. I was looking for Billy Batson (Captain Marvel) but he was from an older time and that is the only explanation I could think of. Poor Billy Batson was probably in a old-age home, and he was never referenced in this. So,¬Ö.. no ""Shazzam"" for us. Pity. <br/><br/>The thing I noticed is the storyline kind of continued a slender thread from previous Ironman, and Thor movies. Thor was assured that his love interest, Jane (Natalie Portman) was safe from what was going to happen in this Manhattan, NY location. I am pretty sure we saw Scarlett Johansson in one of the previous Ironman movies, but not as the Black Widow and am not sure what role she did play. And, of course, there was Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) Tony Stark's (Ironman) love interest. Yes, she still looks very good, but, at first I thought someone else played Pepper as the actress didn't, at first, look like Paltrow. But it was her. Maybe getting a little long in the tooth does that. Go figure. Hey, it will happen to all of us. Bummer. <br/><br/>Also, we noticed that Tom Hiddleston also played Loki in the movie THOR. So this was like old home week for some of this cast and for us as well. Very good. I don't like giving Oscars to bad guys or in this case, bad gods, but I must say Hiddleston's Loki was very good and may get one. He was almost likable at times. Did I really say that? <br/><br/>All in all this is one terrific movie and the pacing is excellent; and you will forget all about the snacks you brought in to see this movie as your eyes never leave the screen. It's mesmerizing. <br/><br/>There may be some confusion for a while when you do not understand why The Avengers are at each other's throats for the longest time. And, you cannot figure out why Hawkeye is working for Loki (the bad god and stepbrother of Thor). But, stay with it and it will all work out and you will understand. <br/><br/>The acting performances all around are first rate. And, again, not enough can be said about the CGI, the editing, the fights and battle scenes and the cinematography as well. All were terrific. Kudos. (10/10) <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"Tolbert","10","1","5","12 September 2012"," Great Film, THE quintessential Superhero flick!
","There are nothing but good things I can say about The Avengers. This has got to be the first superhero film that really gave audiences everything they wanted and more.<br/><br/>The character development was done prior to this film, so they don't need to waste time with that. They just get right to it and it works! Fortunately we already got to know Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America and (to a smaller extent) Agent Phil Colson, Black Widow, Hawk-Eye and of course Nick Fury.<br/><br/>The story is excellent, it moves forward at a very even pace, the characters play off of each other and even have a few chicken fights here and there but not so much as to drag the story down. There are enough funny parts to keep it from being too serious and it really gives each member of the team something to do. This is everything I've desperately wanted for the Justice League to be for years now. Admittedly I'm more of a DC man, and the JLA is always gonna be my favorite team. It's a real bummer to me that audiences who aren't familiar with the comics are seeing Hawk-Eye before The Green Arrow, who has been around for a few decades prior. Oh well, you can't win them all.<br/><br/>There are just so many great moments in the film to look forward to. If you are viewing it for the first time, watch it until the VERY END of the credits, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>I can't wait to buy this when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon delivers the goods in every sense of the word!"

"alexblume","7","1","5","19 July 2012"," Perfect at what it's trying to be.
","The Avengers finally assembled this year and I believe as everybody does that it is awesome. It in a sense is a flawless because it does everything that it is trying to and does it well. It's just as good as it needed to be and more. However, is it cinematic genius and one of the greatest films of all time? No. It's loads and loads of fun, the action scenes are great, the dialog is very witty, and the acting is good. But that's pretty much it. I'm not downgrading the movie at all. Everyone should see it and it is great, but it doesn't take any risks. It's a safe film, with nothing really unexpected. Asides from The Dark Knight, it is the best superhero movie thus far(still waiting for Dark Knight Rises), but it's the basic ""take over the world"" plot and there's just nothing that isn't surprising in the movie. Is it a good film? Yes. It's even a great film and does what it's trying to do perfectly. But is it the 49th best movie ever? Far far from it. Good, even great, but not cinematic history."

","Well what I found so humorous was one of my female cousin text and said ""Did you see The Avengers?"". Mind you she's not into Marvel movies at all and thought that was an excellent movie. You know I had to go see it even more. What's great about The Avengers, you don't have to see the other Marvel movies to follow the plot. However, it would be helpful to have a vague knowledge on each superhero. The Avengers makes me want to go back to my library to review the other Marvel movies I saw to put the puzzle together. I was rattling my brain when I saw Samuel Jackson and couldn't recall which Marvel flicks he was in. All the superheros got a fair amount of spot light, unpredictable plot, tones of actions, over 2 hours, and excellent visual effects. This will be a great introduction to Marvel characters to those who aren't accustomed to such genre and a great way for the ladies to impress their mates."
"tdkrbatmanfan","7","1","5","22 June 2012"," Ehhh... It's special to get all the heroes together, but besides that, there isn't anything special about it.
","7/10 A tremendous amount of hype had been built up for this film, and in Mid-April, the reviews started pouring in. There was so much raving over it saying that it was the best comic book movie ever made. They even said it was better than The Dark Knight. After I viewed it for the first time, I called shenanigans on this film.<br/><br/>It is very slow to start. I felt very sleepy at times because things just seemed to drag on and on. The first hour is just tedious. On top of that, it's very clich√©. These guys get together, but they don't get along at all. Who could've seen it coming? Another issue is the villain. Loki just is plain uninteresting to me. He did fine in Thor, but I'm just not feeling his character in this movie. I think that Thanos is the best possible choice for a villain, and I'm pretty sure he'll be in the sequel.<br/><br/>Now the good thing about this is that it accomplishes something never before done outside of the animated Marvel universe. The Avengers have assembled. It is great to finally see the best heroes Marvel has to offer being showcased together on the big screen. Very nice. However, you would think with the complexity it took to get these fellas together, the plot would have complexity. No, the idea behind the film is all too simple. Just another alien invasion.<br/><br/>On the whole, it really isn't bad at all. It just isn't anything excellent. The fact that this gets compared to The Dark Knight is really upsetting. This to me, is just another average team-up flick."
"solanki17","7","1","5","13 June 2012"," Amazing it ain't but good it is - finally Marvel assembles those avengers !
","OK where do I begin with this. Well firstly for those of you that don't know me personally I am a massive geek fanboy of comics, namely Marvel. I have anticipated a Marvel mash up of characters ever since the first Xmen movie hit our screen's in the late 90's. To have that dream finally come true with some of my favourite comic characters (Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man) I was wetting myself just watching the promo's and the lack lustre build up movies (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America & the really dire Incredible Hulk). Not since 1999 and the release of the first X-Men movie had I anticipated a Super Hero movie so much, so obviously the hype and level of expectation I had was very high. All the positive reviews & ground breaking box office takings were pointing at this movie being GREAT.<br/><br/>Good it is, Great it isn't quite there. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, easily one of the best super hero movies since X-Men First Class, X2 & The Dark Knight, but is it really better than these??? In fact is it even better than The Punisher (which I loved by the way). Well I ain't so sure. To begin with the movie brings the ensemble cast together really nicely, they all are fighting towards a common enemy. There isn't much need for a backstory to any of the audience as you are assumed to have watched the individual films before watching Avengers but even if you haven't it's not exactly rocket science (we all know Bruce Banner was hit with Gamma rays and turns green when he's mad). The story is pretty simple. The earth is threatened by another world forces led by Thor's half-brother , Loki and back on Earth, Nick Fury leader of Shield assembles the rag tagged bunch of super heroes we all know as The Avengers. Each Avenger gets good equal screen time which is another plus of the movie, even the not so super heroes like Hawkeye & Black Widow who are just glorified normal humans get a good amount of screen time, I'd say Hawkeye more than Black widow actually. But the whole movie is rather predictable. Now I know I shouldn't complain about this and it shouldn't really count as a negative towards this movie. 10 times out of 10 if you go to watch a super hero movie you know the good guys are going to prevail over the dark forces. It's just the route taken to defeat the enemies that got me a little annoyed. First the mind control of Hawkeye to trying to get the Bruce to turn into the Hulk on the Shield sky ship. All of it you could see coming a mile off and were kind of just waiting for these bits to end. When would the avengers rescue Hawkeye from his mental capture? When would Bruce turn green? If they kind of just sprung it on us instead of building up to it and spoon feeding us it could've been better All in all an enjoyable action movie with surprisingly funny bits mainly thanks to Downey Junior delivering his lines to aplomb Still looking forward to the sequel which should be better"

"jack_face","Null","1","5","23 May 2012"," A mix of the Ultimates 2 comic and Transformers: Dark of the Moon.
","I saw it in 2D. It's a combination of The Ultimates 2 comic book and the second half of Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The concept is almost right out of the comic (the comic is far superior) and just like the Transformers movie, the second half is all action with otherworldly technological beings destroying the city in a battle against heroes trying to protect people and ward off the baddies at the same time.<br/><br/>Remember that scene where Sam Witwicky was running through all the destruction and he was jumping over cars and stuff like you've never seen him do before and wouldn't expect him to do in the first place? There was a damn near identical scene with Captain America doing the same damn things but you expect him to be able to do what they were showing. Remember how Shockwave and his Driller were plowing through buildings and causing total destruction? The Asgardian ships from Loki's army did the same thing. Remember how Starscream got damaged by Sam and they made him look like a total wuss during his death scene? Loki got his ass handed to him and totally embarrassed by the Hulk. Remember how they opened a portal to Cybertron and things didn't quite work out? Same damn thing happened here with Asgard.<br/><br/>The big secret of the movie that was on my mind the whole time was who was Loki getting help from. After the first credits, that was revealed and it's a pretty big deal for long-time Marvel comic readers. It's equivalent to the last scene in the last episode of the Wolverine & The X-Men cartoon. Unlike that, where we'll never get a second season to continue that story, Avenger's 2 has the potential to be an even bigger, better movie if they do it right. The whole Asgard/Earth thing has played itself out in the animated Marvelverse movies and cartoons to the point of them needing to do something new and move on. I never saw Iron Man 2 and don't ever plan on seeing it but it does help to have seen the Marvel movies to have a better understanding of what's going on in this one because there are references and flashbacks. The scene after the full credits is short and only meant to be humorous.<br/><br/>Unlike someone I know who said to not pay for this movie, I'd say it's definitely worth paying for. It's a popcorn flick and high on entertainment. There were only a few cuss words so kiddies might enjoy it if they have the attention span (and most don't) to handle the pacing of the movie in the second half. There aren't any over-extravagant Mark Millar stunts and it's not too technical. It's a fairly simple movie that's easy to follow as one can expect from a Marvel comic book movie. If there are any comparisons of this to The Dark Knight because of its box office take, squash that out of your mind. There's absolutely no comparison of any kind to the DC movie other than the fact that they're both based on comic book material.<br/><br/>I give the movie 8 out of 10 stars and I rate it that high for its entertainment value. You get your money's worth from this flick and it's deserving of all of its success. One thing I noticed that most people probably haven't is the title. When it opens and even during the rolling credits, it's called ""Marvel's The Avengers."" They've clearly got Tyler Perry syndrome; as if anyone is gonna mistake this for the British TV show or its film adaptation. I guess they gotta cover their bases."

"thedarkwolfe-1","8","1","5","15 May 2012"," A Great Film. But....
","A valiant effort. I liked it. It hit a lot of great notes.<br/><br/>But something was missing.<br/><br/>I agree, movies can (and should be) about fun.<br/><br/>I'm having fun when I'm swept away by a compelling story--not when I'm bombarded with visuals and the former is lacking.<br/><br/>So MUCH of The Avengers is done well--casting, performances, dialog, certainly visuals.<br/><br/>The only thing that might have done more for me is (once again) a plot that is executed a little better. I had a hard time feeling the stakes. Loki is a great character--I felt his rage, angst and bitterness in Thor driving the antagonism thus the story.<br/><br/>A story has to *sell* the villain's goal, or we don't feel the stakes and thus don't really care about what's going on...unless we're so excited to see characters in live action, we'd be just as thrilled with seeing a 2 hr slide show of stills.<br/><br/>I'll give you a perfect example: Batman (1989) and Dark Knight, are essentially the same plot. Joker causing mayhem for kicks. No specific goal, no dollar amount he wants to make, no prize he wants to acquire.<br/><br/>But unlike many, I did *not* like Batman in '89. I don't like or appreciate visuals apart from a well-executed story, I'm sorry. It's not snobbery, or failure to lighten up and have fun, I just *don't have fun* when I'm not watching a well-executed story. Dark Knight sells it, Batman didn't. How? *Execution*-- <br/><br/>--Compare Alfred's searing line, ""Some men aren't looking for anything logical. They can't be bought, bargained or reasoned with. Some men...just want to watch the world burn."" <br/><br/>--With the Joker in '89: ""So gentleman, that's how it is. Until Vinnie resurfaces, I'm the acting President. And I say that starting with this 200 year festival, we run the city into the ground."" --ZZzzzzzzzzzzz.........<br/><br/>There's more to it than this...the whole film (Dark Knight) is presented in a way that *sells* The Joker's goal(s).<br/><br/>But in Avengers? 'Bow, yield, kneel.' Loki's speech, 'You Were Meant To Be Ruled' was good...I almost bought it.<br/><br/>--Superman II sold this type of antagonism. A) Dick Donner treated Zod and the villains with an almost Shakespearian reverence. It sold. And B), by the end, we felt the stakes as people were actually seen getting *hurt*. Remember the woman holding her arm? ""Superman...help us!"" <br/><br/>By the end of Avengers, my adrenaline should have been pumping as the city was being destroyed and I just wasn't feeling it. Even with it's PG13 rating, Avengers could have gotten away with a woman cradling her husband killed by debris. Imagine what someone of Downey Jr.'s talent could have done with a scene like that: the rage building in his face as he looks up at the onslaught, the mask closes, and he rockets up toward the heavens to take on Loki's assault force.<br/><br/>--Too stereotypical? In the hands of a good director, I think not. Nothing that you and I see is wholly new anymore--it's all in the execution. Excellence is more important than imagined originality.<br/><br/>An example of a superhero ensemble piece that did it just a little better: X-Men. Magneto's reasons for his war on humanity were solid, sold, and *felt* from the opening scenes, up through his chilling line to Professor X: ""And I will bring (you hope) my old friend. I only ask one thing in return. Don't get in my way."" <br/><br/>Joss Whedon is to be commended. It's hard to make a superhero piece, much less an ensemble superhero piece, much less one that's any good. Hollywood has wholly botched a good number of superhero films and with all the resources at its disposal, there is really no excuse. <br/><br/>Avengers was really, really good and I liked it. It missed some opportunities for me.<br/><br/>Just a few."
"Asmith580","8","1","5","10 May 2012"," I think I know the problem.
","Before I review this title, I want to explain why there are so many bad reviews about this film. A lot of people don't know the back story of any of these superheroes, hydra, the tesseract (also known as the cosmic cube), Loki, or the avengers themselves. Joss did not have the time to explain all of this in pretty much expected people to already know about these things. That being said, for the people who are avid fans and know the story, you will love this movie. It is obvious that Joss is a fan of this series and loved making this movie. Everything in it screamed comic book Avengers. Even the Stan Lee inspired underlying theme of what it means to be a hero is prevalent when Iron Man learns that suits and power aren't what makes you a hero, but the willingness to act and sacrifice for others is what truly makes you a hero. I think a lot of people missed this, but this is what comic books are all about and that is why this film is magical. As for the CGI it was amazing and necessary in order to make this film. Wires would not have cut it in this case, no pun intended. This is the movie all of us geeks have been waiting for. Every character was spot on except for maybe Hawkeye and Fury, but I can overlook that. The small details were amazing, for example, the Hulk cannot lift Thor's hammer and Captain America never kills anyone with a gun (although he will use one to keep people at bay until he gets his shield back). This movie is important to comic book aficionados everywhere because we finally have one that was done right. Thanks Joss, screw the mainstream, this one is for us!"
"nujuv","8","1","5","6 May 2012"," Blockbuster tosh from mega nerd Whedon...
","****SMALL SPOILERS**** I'm simplifying, but only a little bit.<br/><br/>This guy - on track record - should not be able to make films like this.<br/><br/>He seems to fly in the face of convention - a man who appears to have an absolute passion for comic book nonsense, yet still comes up with twists of character AND manages to squeeze several massive egos (in terms of character and I dare say actors) onto the same film AND ALSO gets Disney to pony up a mega budget to do so.<br/><br/>This just does not happen.<br/><br/>And just to give two fingers to movie execs and critics alike - it is well written, chock full of jaw dropping set pieces and well acted.<br/><br/>Please note some of the best performances are from people in tin suits and glittery Halloween costumes. That's how good it is.<br/><br/>It makes you suspend your disbelief and get drawn in to a very strong parallel to modern politics - who exactly are the 'villians' anyway? - whilst managing to keep cringing moments of sentiment - see any Michael Bay flick - pretty much at arms length.<br/><br/>Most notable are moments of the Whedon trade mark - from Firefly in particular - where he totally goes against viewer expectations with regard to conflict outcomes.<br/><br/>Loki vs the Hulk is particularly brilliant on that front.<br/><br/>It's a big movie. It's completely over the top comic book action and a small miracle it is as good as it is.<br/><br/>My only gripe would be a few cheesy lines and the old US clich√© of 'English accent = skinny villain' thing, but this is one hell of an action movie and a pretty good film in it's own right.<br/><br/>AND I don't even worship Marvel stuff. Horay for fat nerds everywhere."
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","5","5 May 2012"," I actually quite enjoyed this movie
","Well, I actually quite enjoyed this film, but it is not exactly the type of film that one would go and watch to learn anything too deep. It is sort of one of those films that has been a long time coming and quite anticipated, and what is quite unusual for a film like this is that when I did get to see it I did actually quite enjoy it. The movie itself is quite long, and I must admit, dominated a bit too much by Robert Downey Jnr (who plays Iron Man), though the length of the movie didn't really put me off too much.<br/><br/>I am not too sure on the workings behind the scenes, but my understanding is that Marvel and Paramount have decided that they will become more consistent with their Marvel based movies so that there is some consistency between them. This is probably more important now in that they are bringing a number of superheroes from separate movies together, so I guess consistency is important. However, one thing that I have noticed is that it appears that they have rushed a number of movies together, such as Captain America and Thor, so that they can have some more background for the major characters in this movie. I do note though, that while Black Widow makes an appearance in Iron Man II, Hawkeye seems to be a new character for this particular film.<br/><br/>The Avengers pretty much takes off where Iron Man II, Captain America, and Thor leave off. Iron Man II introduce Nick Fury as a major character (who is the head of the Avengers initiative), Thor introduced Loki as an antagonist, and Captain America introduces the Tesserach, the alien device that ends up causing all of the problems for Earth, and in particular, bring Loki across so that he might cause his mischief. Now, I am not familiar with any of the comics, or how Loki is portrayed in the comics, but with Norse mythology, I did not necessarily consider that Loki was actually a bad guy, just an annoying trickster. However, this film is not based on Norse mythology, but rather upon a series of comics based upon Norse mythology.<br/><br/>I guess one of the big problems with trying to do a film like this is working with a number of actors and deciding who is going to take the title role. However I do note that the only real big name actors in this film would be RDJ, Scarlett Johanson, and Samual L Jackson. The others, while they have movies to their name, and do take the lead role in those movies, in my mind at least, do not have the huge name that the others do. However, I suspect it would not have been easy relegating RDJ to a supporting role."
"KnightsofNi11","7","1","5","5 May 2012"," Tons of fun
","This is it. This is what the nerd world has been waiting for for so long. Almost every Marvel movie since Iron Man has been alluding to this film and we've all been so anxiously awaiting the first assembly of the Avengers, Marvel's ultimate superhero alliance. The Avengers unites Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, and Hawkeye, making them a superhero team of epic proportions all brought together by Nick Fury. The film tells the story of the forming of the Avengers as they are forced together in order to stop Loki, Thor's mischievous brother, from waging an intergalactic war on Earth. The ensuing battle is one that strives to be of epic proportions.<br/><br/>To say that The Avengers lived up to its hype would be giving it too much credit. To say it is a letdown would be too harsh. With the recent quality of superhero movies The Avengers was about as good as you could expect. It's a little simplistic, doesn't go too deep, yet it stands to be a hell of a lot of fun, and there's nothing wrong with that. After watching the slew of superhero movies that have come out in the last 3 or 4 years this is what we have been waiting for, and it essentially doesn't let us down. It's what we want to see when watching all these great superheroes come together to fight the forces of evil. The action is great and they dynamics between our diverse cast of heroes are excellent.<br/><br/>It is almost a requirement that you watch the previous Marvel movies to fully understand the relationships developing here, such as Loki's significance and why exactly he is after the Tesserac, an artifact that can open portals to different worlds. Yet, at the same time, there is a lot of undeveloped story for some of the other characters. Black Widow and Hawkeye are the two that most come to mind. Black Widow appeared multiple times in the Iron Man films and we got a feel for her there, but Hawkeye was only treated to about 30 seconds of screen time in Thor. Yet in The Avengers we have to assume a lot of information about his character, as we don't get to learn much about him. It almost feels as if there should have been a Hawkeye movie released before this one.<br/><br/>However, this Hawkeye dilemma highlights one aspect of the film that can be good for some and bad for others. There is a lot going on in this film and it has to move very fast, even for a two and a half hour film. This is the reason the story is kept fairly simple and the bulk of the film focuses on bringing together the film's ensemble and, of course, the action, which is nothing short of awesome. You can expect great explosions, awesome fights, and breathtaking CGI throughout the whole film and, while it is nothing exceptional, it makes The Avengers what it is, a summer blockbuster. The Avengers isn't the superhero film to end all superhero films, but it is certainly a lot of fun. There's no reason you shouldn't enjoy the film if you sit back and relax and watch the excitement unfold."
"JoeB131","10","1","5","5 May 2012"," definitely worth the watching.
","Marvel has been spending no less than five movies setting up this movie. I had my doubts, but I see the payoff. Since they've already established the main characters, there was no need to do so again. We could get right into the meat of the plot.<br/><br/>Loki pops in from another dimension and is plotting to open a doorway that will let in a nasty bunch of aliens. BUt what really works is the chemistry between the characters here. Nick Fury breaks out his rolodex and calls the Avengers. Well, except for Thor, he just kind of shows up.<br/><br/>What we get are some fairly effective character interaction scenes and a lot of CGI action goodness that didn't look too fake and was fairly exciting.<br/><br/>Morton Downey Jr. is the heart of this movie, and he gets all the best lines. Tim Middelton is effective as Loki matching wits with the various characters. The other actors are good enough in their roles. Again, a movie with no less than seven superheroes was more likely to be a mess and this wasn't, so I give them their props."
"seka-gaula","8","1","5","5 May 2012"," A perfect action-filled adventure
","I watched this movie at the cinema and I have no reason not to corroborate the great reviews it has generated. That said, Joss Wheldon showed a perfect understanding of each of those superheroes as he was able to find space to depict each of their individual characters.But what made this movie a blockbuster winner in my perspective are the mesmerizing action sequences, the stunning computer generated scenes and of course, the plethora of an ensemble cast, that is Robert Downey jr (Iron Man), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Chris Evans (Captain America), Samuel L.Jackson (Nick Fury), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts), Stellan Skarsgaard (Dr Erik Selvig), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye).<br/><br/>Mark Rufallo was ordinarily effective as Bruce Banner albeit he will never surpass Edward Norton for the same role. However, there are some things I would've loved to see in the movie that I believe would've complemented this great flick very well. I felt that the presence of Jane Foster was of crucial essence since Loki threatened Thor that he would pay her a visit. Hulk's new face didn't dwell well with me as it looked more animated compared to the fierce looking one of the Hulk re-boot. I so wish there were also some enchanting melancholic scenes, which could have added nicely to the entertainment this movie offered.<br/><br/>And how can Bruce Banner concede so easily to joining a S.H.I.E.L.D. led operation, after the gamma radiation feud he had with General Thunderbolt Ross? And Phil Coulson's death (if he is dead) was also untimely, if not needless as he was a marvellous complement to the S.H.I.E.L.D. as an underground operator.<br/><br/>But despite my remarks, this is an awesome blockbuster. So if you're looking for a great, entertaining flick which is not in the realms of extra-ordinary, this one's for you. My rating is 8.8/10.<br/><br/>Seka Samuel Gaula South Africa"

","WOW--just WOW!!! Superhero movies have come and gone and not too many are very well made. Hollywood eventually takes a good concept and then they add multiple villains or partners to the main hero and things do not work out. Was this going to happen with the Avengers? How would you get multiple heroes in one movie and tell a good story? What would Josh Whedon bring to the movie? Is this movie going to have the golden Whedon touch that was shown in Firefly or the horrible disaster known as Dollhouse? Let's start with the story: the script was well written about how the team was assembled and how they went from individuals to a team, the foe was well created and produced a nice adversary for the team, and the dialog was above the norm that you see in superhero movies.<br/><br/>Characters: whether you are a fan of the Hulk, Captain America, Thor or Iron Man--you will not be disappointed. Each of them have adequate screen time and all of them have wonderful action sequences. Though Black Widow and Hawkeye are not from the original Avengers team (they became Avengers much later), they fit into the movie well and add to the dimension that Loki brings to the story.<br/><br/>Everything is great about this movie. The film was well paced, the direction was great, the acting was super for a comic book adaptation and the action was out-of-this-world.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best, if not the best, superhero movie to date. Highly highly highly recommended. I would suggest 3D since there are many scenes that are dazzling in the 3D format."

","With the disappointment of Thor and the only average Hulk films I wasn't expecting much to come from this film. Was i Wrong! The Work of Josh Whedon and his crew is truly admirable as the film not only had a great story, it was also directed so perfectly. Having so many superheroes in the film i doubted whether there would be too much going on but it was just right, every hero had a vital role. Robert Downey Jr was once again superb in his witty but sensational role as iron man. the film incorporated humour at just the right times and did not go overboard and make the film a joke. Mark Ruffalo done a great job as the Hulk and completely changed my opinion of the Hulk. The Hulk in this film was a million times better than the others, he was more like the comics where he is not humongous like in the past films (incredible Hulk, in this film he was Awesome! Hulk Smash! This film Kept me gripped and Laughing. i could not close my eyes for one second.

","This was my favorite one out of all of them so far out of all the marvel movies. I've seen it twice already (Midnight showing then the first one in the morning) And both time's i jumped, laughed, and had a fantastic time watching it. I have a few tips before you check it out Tip one is is wait for after all the credits, there will be less then a minute of them then something then there will be like 5 minutes of them then something again. Tip two. Make sure you either know the comics or have seen all the movies of marvel because if not you will most likely get lost. Only thing is i wish they would have had is spiderman in the movie (not a huge deal) but still who does not love him? Overall i would give it 10 out of 10 stars because of the action, laughter, and everything else that comes along with it."

But it was worth every penny spent, and for the coca-cola and popcorn I would say I have spent about $55 only on the avengers! But I am guessing for a The Avenger II and III etc. Because with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man it is a must see. And waiting for the wolverine to come into The Avengers, I saw Iron Man/Tony Stark in the wolverine movie, so there must be another coming with the wolverine also joining the avengers. And is the biggest villain we see in the end Thanos? it must be... It is for me only Thanos and Loki that are the interesting villains. It was also a time where JLA and Avengers met together and fought villains. But not all JLA and Avengers characters are great. The best ones we would as audience see together in a battle for good I feel is: Superman, Batman, Spiderman, The Wolverine, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor and the Daredevil. Of the villains there are only some I can think of that would be supercool in a fight against evil, the evilest of them all: Doomsday, Thanos, Loki, Luthor and Zod.<br/><br/>I am waiting and looking forward to the next round!<br/><br/>10/10 on IMDb.com - this movie is one of the greatest action/adventure movies I ever seen.

","Look I'm never one for analyzing superhero movies too much. They usually fail to impress although the last 2 featuring the individual Avengers namely Thor and Captain America were definitely cause to be hopeful. Then comes along a trailer of ""Avengers"" containing an impressive ensemble of superheroes Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow and most importantly The Hulk.<br/><br/>OK, so it can either be something or nonsense, thought I.<br/><br/>But I seriously never thought that I would come out of the theater with a smile saying that it was totally worth it. I repeat the summary statement, Avengers is probably the best superhero movie ever made. It has the story, which is although not unlike many other such movies, but is treated and presented very very well. Well, I don't know about you, but at least me and a sizable few million other people loved it. The action does not disappoint in the least but instead of making the audience run headlong into it, it is built up slowly but surely. The dialogs, the pace, the visuals and the story overall make this one hell of a watch.<br/><br/>Seriously, you will not be disappointed."
"devarsh85","10","1","5","4 May 2012"," The Avengers : The Best SuperHero Movie!Need i say more!?
","""Spolier Alert"". Don't read further if you feel you don't wanna get your hopes too high. Trust me guys the movie is so freaking awesome any superhero movie fan would be in for a treat! But the least you expect from it, the more you would enjoy and savor each and every 150 minute of this flick!<br/><br/>My hands have been itching to write this review from the moment the end credits rolled on the screen.<br/><br/>To start off, Take a Bow and Applaud Mr Joss Whedon, the Director and Writer of this movie. He has done what countless movie makers couldn't achieve when they attempted to make a super hero movie with the same set of characters and actors. His ensemble of superheroes has more character depth, more action, more story and some effervescently witty dialogues than any of the other solo movies based on the characters of this film. Whedon has come up with a script that's cheeky and breezy, full of witty banter and sly pop-culture shout-outs as well as self-referential humor, one that moves with an infectious energy that (almost) makes you lose track of its two-and-a-half-hour running time.<br/><br/>The hype has been building for years and it couldn't possibly be more deafening at this point. Four years ago around the same time, ""Iron Man"" arrived in theaters and kicked off a bold, long-term plan (by Hollywood standards, at least) that would see four different Marvel superheroes appear in their own solo movies, then unite in a single film featuring not just all of the previous films' stars, but many of their supporting cast, too.<br/><br/>What's unbelievable, though, is that despite all of the odds against it and the stratospheric expectations heaped upon it, ""The Avengers"" still manages to not only live up to those expectations, but to exceed them with an epic adventure that's just as impressive as its larger-than-life characters.<br/><br/>For a film that required so many prologues to get to this point, it's surprising how little up-front exposition is required to bring newcomers up to speed with ""The Avengers"" universe. While the film clearly assumes some familiarity with the main characters and a few basic plot points of the preceding films (""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man 2,"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger""), co-writers Joss Whedon and Zak Penn have done a great job of weaving any necessary information into the early portions of the film and making the exposition feel organic.<br/><br/>The premise of ""The Avengers"" is this: Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned, and he plans to use the Tesseract (the powerful, glowing blue cube last seen in ""Captain America"") to take over Earth. When Loki proves too powerful for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. to take down on their own, all of the characters from the previous Marvel Studios films team up to defeat Loki and the alien horde helping him.<br/><br/>To be honest on the face of it, the plot does seem to be taken straight out of a comic book, and is laughably old-school in its simplicity, but its genius lies in how this bare-bones narrative foundation allows the film's talented cast and creative team the room to do what they do best.<br/><br/>It's the sort of adventure that comic fans are accustomed to seeing in print, but just like the best comics, ""The Avengers"" truly shines in how it fills out its narrative skeleton and the area around these tropes with vibrant storytelling, compelling character development, and moments filled with so much heart ‚Äì and humor ‚Äì that the entire package stands on its own.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has pulled off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast and giving everyone a chance to shine, of balancing splashy set pieces with substantive ideology. Stuff gets blown up real good in beautifully detailed 3-D in ""The Avengers"" ‚Äî the area in and around Grand Central Terminal, for example, gets obliterated beyond recognition in an exhausting, climactic battle ‚Äî but the film as a whole is never a mess from a narrative perspective.<br/><br/>Read more at : http://devlifeintechnicolor.com/2012/05/01/the-avengers- the-best-superhero-movieneed-i-say-more/"

","I am an unapologetic fan girl. The very idea of Avengers with Joss directing was enough to send me to happy land and I am happy to say he lived up to it! <br/><br/>First and foremost, Mark Ruffalo as Hulk owns that part. Hands down the only portrayal that has clicked on every single level. All talk of Norton should be left behind once and for all because as far as casting goes third time was a charm. The story moves fast without sacrificing the story lines or character development. Loki is an awesome awesome villain in this, and both Black Widow and Hawkeye's characters were really well fleshed out. And Joss Whedon was born to write for RDJ. Stay for the TWO post credit scenes. I can sum this movie up short and sweet. God bless you, Joss Whedon!"

It did not fail to deliver. Packs an epic punch when you watch this.

You watch the Hulk in this film and your like ""Whoa!"" Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk was just pure genius. Each superhero gets equal screen time. No one is above anyone and I actually preferred that. This film is full of star power and I'm glad everyone got their share. I am a visual effects artist and the effects for this film was just pure bred artistic masterpiece.

","First, I need to say I really like this type of movies, super heroes, sci-fi, fantasy stuff, for me, this is entertainment. Not everyone fills the same, so it's important to consider this point before you can think I can be over-reacting. <br/><br/>Now the movie, from all I've seen, this was the one that really made it full, you laugh, you get angry, and you even get sad, but it's only because the movie ended! Spider-Man is also one of my favorites, just now surpassed by this one. The story from Spider-Man is more linear, so here it might get a point, but the thing is, this is fantasy from the comics coming true on the screen, like back then we were a child, I couldn't have all the numbers so, I'm not much into the accuracy. I only hope this is a good start for a sequel.<br/><br/>Have fun watching this one, you won't regret it, if you are on the same page regarding my first statement.<br/><br/>Regards,"

","This movie was absolutely a masterpiece of direction. Josh Whedon literally knocks them out of the park again and again. This movie has an opinion, a vision and a determination to deliver on them in spades. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!<br/><br/>It's to Marvel's credit that they managed to pulled off the long windup of movies presenting each of the individual characters as well as they did (even if it's taken them a few tries on the Hulk...). There choices of directors has been relatively spot on both for pulling off the individual movies, but also to deliver enough stylistic continuity across all the movies such that they could eventually all come together in the The Avengers. <br/><br/>Joe Johnston, Ang Lee, Louis Leterrier, Jon Favreau, and even Kenneth Branagh (almost unbelievably) all did stand-up work setting the stage for this film. Of the bunch, I personally think Jon Favreau really hit the nail on the head and set the tone for this movie with his stellar work on Iron Man and Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>Kudos to the Marvel Team for sticking with it all and delivering a home run at the end of the series.<br/><br/>[ Sidebar: Oh, and Hunger Games was a complete and utter creative failure in both vision and execution compared to this movie.

"kgbzero6","10","1","5","2 May 2012"," Simply Outstanding A New Bench mark in action Movies
","While there's already literally hundreds on reviews of Marvel's The Avengers available on the web here's a Spoiler Free review for the thousands of US viewers yet to see the movie.<br/><br/>For me, May is Avengers Month. I bought my first Marvel comic, Avengers #76, in May 1970 and it was May 2010 that I was lucky enough to get my photo in Avengers #1 so although the movie opened here in New Zealand on April 25 I waited until May 1 before seeing the movie with most of my family. (I tried to get in with my Avengers ID. The cashier thought it was cool but I still had to pay. And I don't begrudge a single cent of the $10.50 entry fee.)<br/><br/>The premise of The Avengers as a team of fictional heroes is that the team is greater than the sum of its parts and this movie is a rare example where the same is true of the cast and crew. With this movie everyone, the director, writers, actors, special effects, designers, have all hit their mark with Hawkeye precision producing a new bench-mark in action and comic book based entertainment.<br/><br/>Kevin Fiege, Joss Whedon and the rest of the crew have expertly delivered an Avengers tale for today that still respectfully pays homage to the 1960 comic-book origins of Earth's Mightiest Heroes while mixing with the best elements of the Ultimate Universe version of the heroes.<br/><br/>For those who think they know the story from all trailers and T.V. spots, think again. There are still surprises aplenty from the very first scene through to the end and there is not a single wasted line of dialog in the whole 142 minutes. <br/><br/>Contrary to the speculation that there would be no room for character development with so many big name stars and characters in the room at the same time there are many introspective conversations that progress the story and the characters. Reprising his Tony Stark / Iron Man character Robert Downey Jr is clearly steals the show and his interactions with Pepper, Cap, Thor, Loki and Bruce Banner include many laugh-out-loud moments. Tim Hiddleston's Loki is even more likable as a villain than he was in Thor. <br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson gets the opportunity for more on-screen time and we learn more about his motivations and methods. It was very pleasing to see Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Chris Evans (Cap), Clarke Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Stellan Skarsgard (Erik Selvig) all behave in-character with their earlier appearances in the cannon of movies that culminates in The Avengers and it was like picking up the next issue of an epic limited series. <br/><br/>As an aside Marvel has released a limited series Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big week that helps tie the movies together and provides some background information.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffulo's portrayal of Bruce Banner differs from Eric Bana and Edward Norton but it is in a way that adds to the dynamics. Newcomer Agent Maria Hill played by Cobie Smulders has a bigger role than expected and again adds to the contemporary relationship with the Avengers in the printed medium. <br/><br/>The battle scenes are well choreographed with a sense of panel-by-panel progress and the Thor / Iron Man / Captain America conflict pays obvious homage to ""The Big Three"" and elicit memories of Stand-Off and Avengers: Prime.<br/><br/>In fact every character has their chance to shine in solo action, pitted against each other, and eventually against the common foe that no single super-hero could withstand. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow character comes out from the shadow of the big-guns and she and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye earn their place on the team. <br/><br/>There's plenty of visual humor too especially from the Hulk and the collective gasp from the audience at the unexpected death scene is evidence of the emotional bond between characters and viewers. <br/><br/>I'm sure there some die-hard fans that are lamenting the lack of Hank Pym but I cannot honestly think of anything that would have made this movie better than what it was. <br/><br/>In short, this is the movie equivalent of The Kree-Skrull War that no Marvel or Avengers fan should miss. Truly outstanding - cannot wait for the Blu-ray for Christmas.<br/><br/>And then there's the mid-credit trailer ¬Ö roll on Avengers 2!"

One thing is for sure: the film has visual effects. Quite a lot of them. And by 'a lot' i mean A LOT. In almost every scene there's some CGI, whether it's a gigantic Hulk or a flying Iron-Man. Two and a half hours of thrilling action, stunts, huge floating ships, creatures from another world, and more. So I think I speak for everyone who has seen this movie that visually this is one of the best movies ever made. It's a great movie to watch on the big screen in 3D, with a bag of popcorn on you side. The people who created the world of The Avengers have done an outstanding job, it's really overwhelming.<br/><br/>But there's so many. So many fights, so many stunts, so many creatures. Al packed into one movie. If you erase all the effects and the action, there's nothing left. The dialog is lame and cheesy, the characters are flat and boring. The plot is simple and predictable, it doesn't leave you thinking and it's certainly not surprising and intuitive. I only cared about the characters because I knew them from previous movies, there's no real character development because the action is the most important aspect of the movie. Yes, the movie has it's funny and shocking moments, but really emotional or deep it never goes. It remains flat and focused on events and action until the (by the way, epic) conclusion.<br/><br/>Everything considered, I would say that if you loved the previous superhero movies, and want to see how they come together, and love visual effects, you certainly don't want to skip this one. But don't except a masterpiece, smart dialog and deep emotional scenes. Just lean back, and maybe get another drink."
"Mindu15","6","2","18","8 July 2012"," a better name would be Average Assemble
","This film is one of the most distinctly average film I have seen in a number of years. The action and comedy, good as it was, was there to simply gloss over a basic strong line. Normally I like my simple action films, but Avengers just lacked a little something.<br/><br/>*spoilers* <br/><br/>What I Liked. - The comedy throughout the film was pretty good, myself and the audience laughed throughout. - The opening, might have gone on a little too long, but it did well to set up the film. - Action sequences, apart from the end which I will go into further details next.<br/><br/>What I Didn't Like - Story should have been better, a bit more depth was needed in the whole story and characters. Bruce Banner (Hulk) was reluctant to join the mission, but there was nothing that really showed it effecting him - Last action sequence lacked magic, I never felt myself really caring about the Avengers or what happened. Also the end when Iron Man was hurt, all Hulk had to do was make him jump. I felt Thor shocking him again would have been better.<br/><br/>It is a decent film for a Sunday evening, but as an actual spectacle it was a small let down."

","The Avengers unites Iron Man (Downey Jr.) Thor (Hemsworth) Cap. America (Evans) and Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Ruffalo) along with Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Renner) to stop Loki (Hiddleston).<br/><br/>The Good: Effects are good, there are a couple of actually funny jokes.
The Bad: Characters are flat and just spend time joking or arguing rather then actually developing.
Action sequences are tedious, monotonous and unexciting.
Most jokes are cringe-worthy, one even made me consider walking out. I didn't but I wish I had.
By the end it feels like it didn't really do much of anything.<br/><br/>I don't understand how The Avengers has such high ratings.

"mynameisibrahim","10","1","6","16 July 2014"," Best Movie Ever!
","The Avengers serves as an introduction to one of the most iconic teams in comic book folklore. An alien invasion compels all superheroes to coalesce and tend to the extraterrestrial threat.<br/><br/>Marvel's ambitious venture works wonders and reaches a gratifying conclusion. Fan favorite director Joss Whedon is able to merge several story lines into a seamless unitary one. He injects humor to proceedings and creates a spectacle tantamount to a comic book in motion. Also, he embraces the roots of all characters at his disposal, such as their text book costumes.<br/><br/>Vibrant, fun and overwhelmingly entertaining, Avengers fulfills all prerequisites of a quintessential summer blockbuster. The alien assault is the crux of a sensational climactic battle, which features various 'money shots' and retains immense repeat value.<br/><br/>An epic and novel experience, Avengers is the envy of major studios now scurrying to emulate Marvel's flawless triumph. Despite a protracted build up and extraordinary expectations, the movie is a resounding success. It is honestly the most enthralling experience I have ever had in a cinema."
"Hitchcoc","8","1","6","3 July 2013"," I'm Too Old for This!
","I'm swearing off super-hero movies. I've become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can't wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines."

"DanLives1980","7","1","6","19 March 2013"," It CAN be done!
","I want to try to keep this brief because I feel there is need for three separate reviews for this movie, so without further ado;<br/><br/>Kids - you'll love it!<br/><br/>Now leave the room and let me talk to the adults...<br/><br/>Next, comic book geeks - why am I even sharing this with you? You saw the movie over half a year before I did. But then what if you were like me and wanted the hype to die down first or your expectations were feeling a little... strained?<br/><br/>Well in case you haven't seen this movie, The Avengers dances provocatively between two different Marvel Universe molds, namely 616 and the Ultimate Universe. No reason, just because somebody said 'Sam Jackson could totally be the black Nick Fury!'<br/><br/>In all, without having everybody dressed as they should be - in their original respective battle uniforms - everybody pretty much is as they should be. But the three characters you're going to appreciate the most are Iron Man, Thor and Hulk/Banner. They're just so much better portrayed and their parts are so much more intriguing than Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye (who in recent years has actually been one of the more interesting characters, no matter what universe we're talking!<br/><br/>You will get to see your favourite characters kick ass and interact the way they most likely would and there are a hell of a lot of in-jokes and references to appreciate.<br/><br/>Now please leave the room...<br/><br/>Okay movie fans and fellow snobs, if you're anything like me, too much noise and activity makes you sleepy rather than lively, especially when they try to make superheroes act and fight as humanly realistically as possible before just deciding 'aaah feck it' and turning them into Mortal Kombat character animations.<br/><br/>In fact you know what? Feck it!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1.) Joss Whedon directed marvellously and gave us his best 2.) Character interplay is at many times very fun to watch 3.) The film does not rush from scene to scene like Phantom Menace trying to pretend right in front of your eyes that it is not in fact happening 4.) The backing cast is superb 5.) There is a hell of a lot of bang for your buck and it is mostly excellently executed<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1.) Hawkeye, Fury and Black Widow seem largely useless 2.) You can tell the actors know it 3.) Captain America comes across as a bloody weakling and spends more time doing acrobatics and being depressed than he does take charge and kick ass 4.) The population of New York City are mindless sheep with no presence, heart or meaning and therefore have no reason for us to care that the Avengers are rescuing them from an alien invasion 5.) The alien invaders didn't have enough time to prove how big a threat they really were before Avengers started stomping them wholesale. This kind of defeats the object of them being a threat.<br/><br/>This film however has the potential and I know that Joss Whedon is a perfectionist that will improve with every sequel. I look forward to the next film!<br/><br/>P.s - Mark Ruffalo; best actor and best portrayal of Banner there has ever been!"
"vidaShay","10","1","6","10 March 2013"," It's almost Illigal to Not watch this movie !!!
","like allot of people in the world, and i mean allot, Disney\Marvel did a great prequel for this movie, with the movies, ""hulk"", ""Thor"", ""iron man"", ""iron man 2"", ""Captain America"" so off cures everyone wanted to see them all in one movie, even it thoughts characters would just stand in 1 frame holding carrots it would be an awesome movie, but this movie doesn't stay there it really is an amazing movie by itself. loki, Thor brother is leading an army of really bad alien creature thingys .. i don't know exactly who are they o.k ? .. against earth and then all of earth mightiest heroes suppose to work together to fight them . OK so it's not the best story they could think of, i'll give them that. but i mean , each and every charechter in this movie is interesting enough to hold a movie by itself, and seeing them all together is brilliant, the soundtrack is fantastic, it's not just another soundtrack but a real afford was put into it to be focused for this movie. if it wasn't clear by now, the acting is really cool, i personally think Thor is really convincing as .. well as Thor from the comics, but really they're all great there was allot of Acton as expected from this movie, maybe i would take the movie a bit more seriously i mean doing more epic things in it but really it's just a tiny thing in a great movie by far the best movie i saw in 2012... (yea even better then batman...) i could talk about it for days but really if you still didn't watch it then run to the cinema and see it it's a must !"
"thesar-2","8","1","6","3 March 2013"," Avengers United
","Take that, Transformers! THAT'S how you show a city under attack with heart, action, pacing, special effects, fun, excitement, characters to root for, humans to empathize with and most of all, legitimate comprehensiveness.<br/><br/>Cross-over films are rare, but I'm a fan of them. Freddy Vs. Jason did a great job of bringing two of my childhood favorites together in 2003. Nine years later, The Avengers didn't really bring together my favorites, but it sure as hell put very good characters in a fantastic action/adventure superhero film.<br/><br/>Aside from some second-act pacing problems and an insipid villain with extremely questionable and blurry motives, the movie worked extremely well with huge, unique and deafening explosions, some of the best 3-D I've seen ‚Äì and I'm hugely critical of that format, large action sets, fairly good score and cinematography, deep characters and a whole lot of humor. Further everyone with the exception of Hulk, had equal sharing time on screen. (Sadly, Hulk had only two scenes, albeit THEY WERE WORTH IT. They blew whatever the previous two entire movies based on his character out of the water.)<br/><br/>Very nicely, you wouldn't have had to see the previous six or so Marvel/Avenger movies ‚Äì they were extremely crafty re-introducing them and their individual backdrops with swiftness. But, if you had see the other films, like I have, they included everyone you loved from before, including a cameo from someone I prayed would be in this. Hint: Initials PP.<br/><br/>During a secret-agency S.H.I.E.L.D experiment with a mysterious blue box of the gods, evil and jealous brother of god Thor, Loki strolls into our realm and is hell-bent on ruling Earth. I guess it's time to assemble Earth's Mightiest Heroes for the Avenger initiative.<br/><br/>Of course, like creator Stan Lee's brilliance displayed over the decades, these aren't your normal super-heroes; they have depth and typically are individuals not playing well with others. Hence, a good portion of this film is a boxing match. Naturally, there are reasons behind this as well furthering the overall depth of the epic.<br/><br/>Will the Avengers avenge Earth? I don't want to spoil it, but you'd really have to be blind not to know. I can definitely say they each uniquely KICK ASS in their respect roles.<br/><br/>Probably thanks to, or in conjunction with good direction, these actors KNEW their roles and had them down pat. With the exception of new-(to the series)-Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner, each one of them, again with 80% equal sharing time, were pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>I always love Robert Downey Jr and especially in his Iron Man role, and if you did, too, you'll be laughing and marveling at his performance all over again. Same with Chris Evans who was GREAT as Captain America and really had his character pegged. Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury were good and even though Jackson had to tone down to the PG-13, he was still badass. Scarlett Johansson was awesome and still gorgeous and Jeremy Renner was a lot of fun to watch again. (Recently he was wonderful in Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol and hopefully he'll continue the trend in the fourth Bourne film later this summer.)<br/><br/>Finally, Mark Ruffalo has always been an actor I've admired and I think he did fine here and oodles better than Edward Norton, the last Dr. Bruce Banner actor. But, I still think, movie-wise, that is, Eric Bana has been my favorite Bruce. (Note: I said Bruce, because Bill Bixby will always be the best Dr. Banner ever.)<br/><br/>Excluding Loki's horned and silly god-outfit, I actually bought their costumes. And this is saying a lot for a movie that I previously scuffed at the sight of the funny blue Captain America uniform and when he donned them in the film, I feel right into it. I believe that's thanks to Evans who was so great that it never occurred to me for him to have anything else on.<br/><br/>I believe the overall movie elevated itself higher than what could've happened with a premise of assembling multiple superheroes and story lines. That said, the special effects were about 90% fantastic with the remaining percentage devoted to the awful out-of-world and in space aliens surrounding the ho-hum and dull villain. They had the same problem with the original Thor movie and (on the DC-side) Green Lantern.<br/><br/>I wanted to rank and rate this movie higher, especially since I had an absolute blast laughing my ass off and was captivated with the action fun, but in addition to what I previously wrote: second act pacing problems, laughable aliens and bad villain, it also had the clich√©d go-to ""idiotic idea"" in the very climax, I downgraded it a bit. Still, I awarded it 4/5 stars and cannot wait to see it again. Preferably on IMAX again.<br/><br/>SEE IT ‚Äì even if you're not a fan of the superhero franchises.<br/><br/>Now¬Ö BRING ON WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SEE: the Justice League movie!!"

"ryansadler","8","1","6","11 February 2013"," Unprecedented piece of cinematography. Made my inner geek very happy.
","The Avengers (Avengers Assemble in UK and Ireland) pits together the protagonists of Marvel's properties Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Captain America (Evans), Thor (Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Ruffalo) in an optimistic, never-before-seen (or attempted) ensemble. The reasoning behind this get together? The god of mischief (Hiddleston) has set his sights on Earth with an extraterrestrial army at his disposal and Earth's peacekeeping organisation S.H.I.E.L.D simply can't contain the situation without major help. Why did it take 50 years for this film to be made?<br/><br/>The film starts with the threat, Loki gathering his army from an unknown benefactor and readying himself to once and for all take his brother down, oh and to conquer our little blue planet. Nick Fury (Jackson) doesn't like this, not one bit. *Important side note* The interesting thing about The Avengers, and part of the reason it's so successful, is that it's part of a much bigger story, this is correctly referred to as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has five (yes five!) prequels that lead up to The Avengers. This has made us love the characters before we've even seen the in a group dynamic. *Back on track* Being the director of the world's most secretive and powerful organisation, he has contacts. Each of these being super-powered (well not all of them) heroes that come in all shapes and sizes. Being a huge comic book fan, just seeing these guys in the same room gave me goose bumps. S.H.I.E.L.D's top agents Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Renner)come along to join the fight to (only for one of them to be turned into a bad guy, kill loads of his colleagues and give the bad guy the object he was earlier hiding from the forces of evil). <br/><br/>Delaying the 'assembley' Stark's selfishness and arrogance annoys and pushes apart everyone, maybe even more than Loki does? Cap's goody goody old-fashioned-ness doesn't impress anyone except Coulson (Gregg). Thor's sleeveless, point-break appearance is nowhere near as impressive as it is in his own film. Black Widow and Hawkeye's vague yet uninteresting relationship bores the hell out of you. And The Hulk? The Hulk is the best thing about this film. When I heard that Mark Ruffalo was cast as Bruce Banner I was a little skeptical to say the least. The Incredible Hulk was okay and I do quite like Edward Norton however I seemed to like Norton a lot more when I heard Ruffalo got the hand-me-down part. Let's just say I was prepared for the worst, another re-casting. However, his performance was absolutely perfect as the nervous (as for a good reason) brilliant scientist, Bruce Banner. You can see that the Hulk has turned him into a ever so slightly bitter man, especially when you have Tony Stark poking you with sharp objects, trying to get you to hulk-out! As Banner you can't help but feel for him but as the Hulk you can't help but laugh at his humour. Other actors whose performance deserves a mention: Tom Hiddleston, a cold, calculating and interesting villain, Clark Gregg, fan favourite Coulson, Robert Downey Jr. oh, he does play well with others! Who knew? <br/><br/>The chemistry of these fine actors is bliss to watch when they finally come together. The story is great. The vision of geek-favourite director Joss Whedon is a pleasure to witness. This is what I say to those who said this film is too overcrowded..it's not crowded enough. <br/><br/>With 6 future films announced and well under-way, this optimistic yet fascinating story is no where near ending and being a comic book fan, I'm hugely proud to be a part of it. The Avengers is a brilliant flick for everyone. Now, I'm off to watch it again. <br/><br/>Pros The Tony/Bruce bromance The natural feel of the group dynamic The little easter eggs for those who were really watching 'Hulk...smash'<br/><br/>Cons Not once did anyone say 'Avengers Assemble!'!!!!!! Thor's helmet looked awesome in his solo movie, where is it?! Same for Cap's uniform. The First Avenger's combat-influenced outfit is miles better The way all the Chitauri died Phantom Menace style Banner's sudden control over his anger (although it was a sweet scene)<br/><br/>Recommendations for further enjoyment Watch all of the MCU films in order, research all of their easter eggs if you can't find the all. And then finally, watch Avengers again, I guarantee you'll enjoy it even more the second time."

It will not be wrong if people call it the best super hero movie of the recent time. Featuring all the marvel comic heroes, this one is a marvel in itself!<br/><br/>Captain America and Stark (Iron Man) look amazing in their suits while Hulk is much more balanced and Thor is his usual self.

","Not since the original Superman in 1978 or even Batman in 1990 or Spiderman in 2000 has there been a comic book movie that so exploded like this one. Maybe it takes ten-year interims to produce blockbuster superhero movies; I don't know. There has never been a movie that picked up on the characters of several movies at once, least of all from the comic book/superhero genre. Loki ends up on Earth after ""Thor"" and discovers the tesseract (""cosmic cube"") from ""Captain America."" He decides to uses it to conquer the planet, but Nick Fury from ""Iron Man"" uses it to rally ""The Hulk"" and the rest of Earth's Mightiest Heroes into protecting the planet. It has more violence than ""The Dirty Dozen,"" more wrecked cars than ""The Blues Brothers"" and more damage than any of the James Bond films. (Insurance rates in the comic book universe must be astronomical on Manhattan.) It's exactly like watching what you would expect from a comic book brought to life or of you could get into the world of the Marvel Universe (except without the expanded universe characters like the She-Hulk and Ant-Man). The movie never gave me a moment to catch my breath or tear myself away. It is just that compelling. Filled with numerous memorable scenes (Thor battling Iron Man, Hulk batting Thor, Tony getting his suit in mid-air, Hulk smacking Loki around¬Ö) and numerous quotes (""I've got an army."" ‚Äì ""Yeah, well, we've got a Hulk.""), the movie and plot charge forward and never slows down. It's augmented by numerous strong performances given by an obscenely talented and gifted cast. Downey's swagger and gift for wry humor carries the incredible film as does Tom Hiddleston's Machiavellian role as Loki, one of the most complicated personalities of the Marvel Universe. Mark Ruffalo succeeds as Bruce Banner (and the Hulk!) where his predecessors could not. There is not a bad performance in the entire movie, not even from Stan Lee in his Hitchcockian traditional cameo or Jeremy Renner in this his first comic book film. (It's had to believe he's the same guy who played a slacker obsessed with drugs and alcohol in ""National Lampoon's Senior Trip."") ""The Avengers"" really deserves to be called ""the greatest comic book movie ever."" The only thing that could possibly have made this movie anymore awesome would be including cameos of the cast of the ""Fantastic Four"" (although Justin Timberlake would have to be the new Johnny Storm), Tobey McGuire as Spiderman, Ben Affleck as Daredevil and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. (And maybe Dean Cain, Michael Keaton and Charisma Carpenter as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman.) The only bad thing about the movie is that the DVD is totally lacking in decent bonus features, all of which are unfortunately held hostage on the Blu-Ray. What's up with that? Why am I being coerced to buy stuff I don't want?"
"dorta-1421819","8","1","6","22 June 2012"," Simply great!
","I usually try not to read or hear too many reviews about a movie before I actually get to see it on screen, but I must admit that it was really hard for me not to sneak a peek in advance at a few comments, both on this website and on magazines. Most comments went from good to excellent. In my opinion, this movie IS excellent. The most commendable achievement is the fluid way the cast of superheroes were assembled:the way they were first individually introduced into the plot, and then the (funny) dynamics they were eventually thrown into. Each character kept their peculiar aspects, but at the same time none of them ended up prevailing on the others. Take Stark, witty fellow who cracks jokes every now and then; add Rogers,law- abiding soldier; Thor, the god of thunder who is thorn between his will to protect the Earth and his affection to brother Loki, who is plotting more than ever a way to enslave our planet; take also a new version of Banner/Hulk, brilliantly played by Mark Ruffalo,and two characters- Black Widow and Hawkeye-who, although only superficially introduced in the previous chapters of the franchise, manage to add freshness and continuity at the same time to the original group: the result is an absorbing and entertaining piece of work. Another aspect worth mentioning is the fact that the main focus on this movie were neither the CGI, nor the sentimental statuses of the characters, but the heroes themselves and the story involving them. Everything was clear-cut and incisive; 2 hours and a half just flew by, and in the end I felt like I could have watched even more. The acting in my opinion was great- except for mediocre Johansson, IMO. Worth mentioning are Ruffalo's and Hiddleston's performances: the first one because he managed to be a ""new"" Banner/Hulk by keeping the character's main aspects on focus; the second one because, well, Hiddleston is just a great actor! Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Renner, were also great. In conclusion, I vividly suggest watching this movie. Your money will not go wasted!"

It's a movie where you can see some of the finest, and most popular superheroes of American comic packed together in action-heavy sequences for more than 2 hours.<br/><br/>But, just like the other Marvel Studio's movies, The Avengers is simply a sci-fi action that purpose only to entertain the watchers with its flashy special effect and outrageous action.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer) did a good job directing this movie, every superhero get the same amount of role and enough background story (although it might not necessary since 4 of 'em have their own movie) so no one feel left behind. The story is pretty standard with Thor brother, Loki try to rule the earth by borrowing Chitauri's Army which he'll bring to earth using the power of Tesseract, hidden in earth. The Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury decide to run the Avengers Initiative to collect the earth's mightiest soldiers including Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Black Widow to fight against the global threat. Of course, Thor join the force later because, you know, he have responsibility for his naughty little brother.<br/><br/>Most of the movie contain heavy action sequences but one thing that i really like is the filmmaker try to show us that collecting these superheroes and force them to fight together is not always gonna work right. They are, however, just humans with their own personality and ego. The problem is, when they finally settle their problems, nothing more interesting happens in the movie. I like action movie but maybe because there's too many superheroes movie out there and every one of 'em always using heavy special effects (to destroy a major city of USA), the action become bland and sometimes boring. There's no jaw-dropping moments, no tense, no thrill, it's just the same 'America getting' attack by the alien again' movie.<br/><br/>Robert Downy Jr. of course steal most of the attention here (he's the freakin' Tony Stark!). Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner also act remarkably. The rest of the cast is pretty standard, yep, including the badass Academy Awward winner, Samuel L. Jackson. Tom Hiddleton as Loki is good but seriously, why the writers decide to make Loki look very, very weak? he's far from threatening, he can be easily defeated, he's the main bad guy but he post no serious threat to the Avengers (he even become part of the joke in many sequence).<br/><br/>It's hard not to compare Marvel's The Avengers with another big superhero movie coming out this year, The Dark Knight Rises but looking at how The Avengers come out, i have no doubt that Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises will kick The Avengers ass."

","Well the movie was as i expected full of ACTION !!!! i found this movie much entertaining when i put this movie in Action movie categories of the movies i've seen..<br/><br/>But when it comes where you expect the complete movie with a good script nice direction nice action and everything a good movie needs...<br/><br/>At somewhere in the movie you will feel like something like this was seen in some old movies.. and that's what i hate about this movie i.e. The SCRIPT of this movie is not feels like a freshly new written script...<br/><br/>I am giving it 7/10 just because of Mind Blowing Action !!! and for the Punch that Hulk hits to Thor.. :)"
"moviewizguy","7","1","6","4 May 2012"," Some assembly required.
","When an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, Director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D., finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe, a daring recruitment effort begins. -- (C) Marvel<br/><br/>THE AVENGERS is good, not great. The film does its job in entertaining the audience but not much more. It has some great action scenes, some truly funny moments, and some drama, but overall, it cannot be compared to the top superhero films, which includes THE INCREDIBLES, THE DARK KNIGHT, and SPIDER-MAN 2 for me. It's a popcorn flick, and if that's what you're expecting, then you'll be satisfied. As a Joss Whedon fan, I expected much more from the film than it just being entertaining.<br/><br/>I felt the whole dysfunctional family aspect could have been executed better and expanded to be a more significant portion in the film. There was only one scene where the tension between the superheros can be felt, but that's about it. The film also could have used a bit more heart as I felt the whole team working aspect to be lacking in the emotion area. Additionally, the story seems to be overdone by now: Villain wants power and tries to take over the world. Maybe something different would have been more engaging.<br/><br/>However, apart from those flaws, THE AVENGERS is a good film. The key success is due to the superheros themselves and how effectively Whedon manages to balance each of the characters without having one overshadow the other. Out of all of them, the Hulk, played by the talented Mark Ruffalo, is my favorite. He seriously has some of the most memorable moments in the film. Robert Downey Jr. is great as well. As of now, Downey pretty much nails his role as the egotistical yet charming Tony Stark. Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson, also gets some great moments in here which is good since she's the standout female character in the film. However, I felt they could have done more with Captain America and Thor. Additionally, although he's utilized better in this film than in THOR, I wanted a different villain than Loki.<br/><br/>Overall, THE AVENGERS is a fun popcorn flick that starts the summer season but not with a big bang as I hoped for. The film could have used a bit more external conflict between the superheros, as well as more emotion. However, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and the 2.5 hour running time really flies past you before you know it. Think of it like a better version of TRANSFORMERS 3."
"MLewis8","9","1","6","4 May 2012"," Avengers is an Ant; Batman is a Boot.
","This film is overrated. Critics are calling this the best comic book based movie ever and I'm just not feeling it. To use an analogy from the film, Avengers is an Ant, Batman (Nolan's version) is a Boot.<br/><br/>The positives of the movie are the humor (lots of LMAO moments), the action scenes and I just love seeing these heroes on screen.<br/><br/>The big negative was the plot, particularly the plan and motives of the antagonist. It didn't make sense why Loki needed an army from another realm to conquer earth, when he seemed to be doing fine on his own with that staff of his and manipulating people. While Loki seems to have no problem traveling back and forth to earth and other realms, why can't the space army use the same worm hole he uses? <br/><br/>The rules of the game are unclear. Why is it that Loki can blast Captain America's shield and knock him off his can, but when Thor strikes Cap's shield it seems to have less impact on Cap than Loki's blast? How is Thor's hammer able to hold down the Hulk, but when the hammer is laying inside SHIELD's ship, it doesn't drag the whole ship down or fall through the ship? When Thor is trapped inside that room falling toward earth, why can't he use lightening to open it up? How does Thor, when he is supposed to be cut off from earth after the events in ""Thor"", know that Loki took the cube and just happens to drop in on the ship where Loki's held captive? How is it that Nick Fury can touch the cube in the beginning of the film, yet we see in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" the Red Skull opens up the cube by touching it? In fact, why is Loki going through all this trouble to open up the cube when Skull seemed to do it effortlessly? While the rag doll scene was funny, how is it that a god with all these magical powers can be slammed around by an earthly creature and affected by Iron Man's blast? Yeah, the government has this brilliant idea of using nukes to protect the rest of the world without even thinking about firing nukes inside the worm hole where the threat is coming from.<br/><br/>This film is good if you turn your brain off. I found it funny, enjoyable and exciting to watch. Although I was glued to my seat and will probably get it when it comes out on BluRay, I am not eager to see this movie in a theater again.<br/><br/>So this is far from the best comic book movie ever made (I saw Nolan's movies multiple times in theaters). It lacks any depth and originality to claim that title. Maybe it would at least be arguable had they plugged all the plot holes in the script. Batman is the boot that steps on the Avenger ant. <br/><br/>There's The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and then everything else."
"jdesando","Null","1","6","4 May 2012"," Outstanding Sci-Fi
","""There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could."" Nick Fury<br/><br/>With all the blasts and bullets of The Avengers, there's enough humanity and humor to win over even this jaded film critic. Although I'm tired of American cinema's pervasive graphics and violence, six heroes saving the world from an alien invasion in this outstanding sci-fi are as satisfactorily flawed in character as they are superior in strength.<br/><br/>Director Joss Whedon masterfully balances the egos, not least of which is Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, the S.H.E.I.L.D. leader whose long leather coat is second only to his awkward eye patch. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns from Asgard to fight his half brother, Viking god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) of the lightening and hammer, and five other super heroes for control of earth. Everyone is smart in a way and weak in another. For example, if genius scientist Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) gets angry enough, he becomes a giant green monster, Hulk (and a swell job Ruffalo does at that); Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) with the very metal suit is dangerously loose with his toys and his women. But his banter is first-rate.<br/><br/>Martial-arts maven, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), joins as well as Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), whose archery skill is matched only by Katniss in The Hunger Games. Black Widow and Hawkeye probably were added to the group for sex appeal and comic-book accuracy, They all end up fighting for the freedom Loki denigrates in the beginning of the film. The battle of the box office they already won with almost $200 million in European receipts before opening in the states. Who said crime doesn't pay?<br/><br/>""There is no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top! Maybe your army will come, maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you! Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it."" Tony Stark to Loki"

But the perfect point that I love is the battle between Thor and Iron Man , Hulk and Thor and Captain , ... and the final battle with full team .

","the avengers is a brilliant take on the marvel comic series that were made in 1964. the avengers is worth watching i can say money well spent.A war breaks out on earth and its good vs evil as the avengers battle for the fate of the earth.The avengers is a epic film which is one of the if not the best comic book movie.it made records taking in $623,279,547 beating harry potter and the deathly hallows.it was shocking that the avengers did so well as it was partly a Disney film and people thought it wouldn't do well.the avengers was one of the blockbusters of 2012 beating others like the dark knight rises and the amazing spider- man.the avengers is overall a brilliant film and i recommend that everyone should watch it."
"filmbaker","Null","1","7","2 March 2013"," Avengers = bad reviews = what?
","Many people give the Avengers bad reviews because it has too many superheroes. But here's what they need to realize = you don't walk into a theater to watch ""The Avengers"", a movie that's SUPPOSED to have multiple superheroes, without realizing it's supposed to anyway.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot of action, good humor, and great acting. What are people thinking giving this movie bad reviews just because one thing was hokey = how Loki got out of that place he was stuck in. Maybe if they saw the post-credits scene to Thor, they wouldn't mind as much.<br/><br/>Whatever is running through the heads of the people who rant on this one, I can think of something that will turn their argument around. If not turn it around, at least make the argument a tie. Avengers was a great movie. Bottom line."
"jaypoe_0505","10","1","7","12 February 2013"," The best movie ever.
","On May 4, 2012 many Marvel fans were on the edge of their seats, and I was one of those fans. I can say that our expectancy for the new movie ""The Avengers"" was through the roof, and we would not be happy with anything under five stars. Marvel had promised the Avengers Initiative would return, and from that point on it had been a waiting game. However, combining all of the super heroes into one great team, yet each holding their old attitudes had to take time. The wait was well worth it though; Marvel really dished it out. They produced a movie that I could watch over and over again, and never be bored. The cast was wonderful, and I can't say that there was a single actor that did not play their part perfectly. The movie was full of action, and there was never a dull moment in the humor. However, if you have not seen the other movies leading up to it, you may find yourself lost in some parts. The plot was phenomenal, and was accompanied by visual effects that put you inside the movie itself. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, it is entertaining, humorous, and overall a blast to watch. Some of the characters showed their true colors in this movie more than in their own productions. One of my favorite quotes in the movie being Captain America's thoughts on Thor, when he says ""There is only one God, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."" Aside from my thoughts, one actor that really deserves a round of applause is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. Through the movie he acts seamlessly from the doctor straight into the Hulk, and back. If you want an action packed movie with an all around amazing experience, I would definitely recommend The Avengers to you."
"jrmoviemaniac","10","1","7","30 January 2013"," One of the best of the best superheroes of all time
","I'm gonna say this to every hater and naysayer who calls this film overrated:I love this movie.Nothing will ever change that:Everything in this film worked for me the characters are all great,love the visuals (the best I've seen since the original Star Wars films),A solid story,great villain,and the best experience I've had in the theater in a long time.I literally jumped out of my seat with every action sequence in this movie.When the avengers finally assembled I geeked out:It was a great moment.Hulk definitely steals the show at the end.I enjoyed the Dark knight rises but it can't compare to this film:A fast pace and well worth the wait.My 4th favorite movie of all time.By the way Iron Man is my favorite Avenger.An excellent superhero movie with so much rewatchability."
"evas428","9","1","7","23 January 2013"," Great
","The best comic book movie yet. Very well done in linking the single hero story lines together for this ensemble. Even at a run time of over two hours, I felt there was no down time in story progression or action. The characters are well layered and performed, and their interactions are greatly displayed.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr by far carries this film with great sarcasm and intelligence. His inner conflicts would make him a great anti-hero but the character relies on his logic to see the greater good. One of my favorite events is the death of Agent Coulson. Only because you can feel the loss from all characters, and Nick Fury being the opportunistic leader he is, uses that hurt to motivate a team that might not have exited without the tragedy.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is very well done and lived up to all my expectations.<br/><br/>Look forward to the sequel."

","Simple eye candy where all matters of CGI are displayed on film? Sure, it is. The difference this time is that there is a real story, albeit far-fetched. This film has the distinction to bring together many Super-heroes that have graced the big screen in recent years to pool their resources and talents to save the World from a terrifying menace that would reduce humanity to nothing more than an ant hill. It's the classic good vs. evil battle. Guess who wins? To its merit, the film underlines the character flaws of these larger than life beings. Can one be complete sane when omnipotent? The question had to be raised. Not my usual kind of film, but effective. It is noteworthy that Robert Downey Jr.'s usual amusing presence raises the quality of the whole."
"smoore-39","7","1","7","21 May 2012"," Just another superhero movie
","I had expected more from Joss Whedan, but The Avengers (a.k.a Marvel's Avengers, a.k.a Marvel Avengers Assemble and various other permutations of this terrible title) is just another superhero movie: dull and hackneyed plot, poor characterisation, lots of fighting. It provides plenty for its pre-teen/early-teenage male target audience - great special effects, no romance and a very lengthy battle sequence at the end - but doesn't offer enough to adults to sustain interest for its 140-minute length. It is only saved from mediocrity by two factors: the humour in the script and Robert Downey's performance. I also credit Tom Hiddleston's performance as Loki, but the of the cast generally fail to shine. Even Samuel L. Jackson cannot make a real character out of the bizarre administrator/soldier hybrid that is Nick Fury."
"ArtandJoyofMovies","7","1","7","20 May 2012"," Saturday morning cartoon fare at best.
","7.0 you say? Yep, at best this was decent Saturday morning cartoon fare. High schoolers and college kids will love it...and have in huge numbers. But as a guy frozen in a 60's time warp much like Austin Powers, I can simply say ""It's just not my thing, baby.""<br/><br/>The movie is carried by the personality of Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark aka The Iron Man. This is no surprise. Downey is naturally funny and amazingly quirky while still being attractive. By contrast, Chris Evans comes off a bit like Chris Mintz-Plasse showing up at your fraternity rugby party.<br/><br/>The best acting award goes to Powers Boothe. (He has done other notable work but I always harken way back to 1980 and The Guyana tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones). No one else in this film acted much in the real sense of the concept. They more or less played themselves.<br/><br/>If you saw Thor (2011), Iron Man II (2010) or Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) you have pretty much already seen The Avengers. It was all the film they had left on the cutting room floor just taped back together along with some elements of the Incredible Hulk (2008) reincarnated Ruffalonian style. That is pretty much it. This film is a bit like going back through your favorite scrapbooks. It is nice to reminisce and relive the past, but you are not going to see anything new."
"Vivekmaru45","10","1","8","12 January 2013"," My Vote: Best Action Film Of 2012. Eat Sh*t Chris Nolan.
","For fans of the comic books, it's a dream come true. For die-hard action fans it something you have never been prepared for.... <br/><br/>The sheer special-effects and solid script work effortlessly and make this film work. Two characters I feel carry this film: Iron Man & Captain America. The two have male ego problems, conflict of moralities and this can be seen in the film.<br/><br/>I have given a rating of 10 for Special Effects and Script. There are some actors that would have sunk this film, if not for the majority of decent acting by both Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Samuel Jackson. For once in his life Chris Hemsworth does not f*ck it up.<br/><br/>The liabilities in this film are: Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo. But they just merely cause a dent in the armour, nothing more.<br/><br/>Before you see this film you should already have seen: Iron Man 1 & 2, The Hulk & The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor. This will give you a background into these characters.<br/><br/>Plot: Nick Fury is director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The agency is a who's who of Marvel Super Heroes, with Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. When global security is threatened by Loki and his cohorts, Nick Fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster. <br/><br/>Other Superhero Theme Movies: The Flash, The Flash II: Revenge of the Trickster, The Meteor Man (1993), I-Man (1986), Robocop Trilogy, The Vindicator, Revenge Of The Radioactive Reporter."

","So if your wanting an awesome movie for the summer this is so far the number one to go see. It starts off with a bang and doesn't ever leave you wanting much more. Even if you have never seen any of the Solo Avenger(Superhero films in the past 2 years)movies it doesn't matter. Starts off with awesome plot and builds the entire time until the climax of the film happens and you will not even know when it's going to start or finish. If you like the other super hero movies this one will not let you down unless of course you see it after you watch the only other movie worth seeing this summer, ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Only seen teasers for it but know it will be the number one movie, because easily topping it's predecessor, The Dark Knight. I suggest only two movies to watch in theaters this summer are The Avengers, and The Dark Knight Rises. Mr Nolan will absolutely kill the competition with the best Batman movies to date.......(except Jack Nickolson as the joker) Strong 8 out of 10 just because it's a must see film this summer!!! (Only film I have ever given a 10 out of 10 is True Romance because it gives you exactly what you want from a film in every way you could think of)"

","The Avengers unite to save the day in Marvel's newest action adventure film ""The Avengers"". This superhero group is made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) puts all of these super humans together when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's brother, tries to take over Earth. <br/><br/>Loki plans on achieving this goal by using the Tesseract, an energy-filled cube, which was discovered in the ocean in ""Captain America"", to bring alien invaders to Earth in order to destroy the planet. Loki even casts a spell on one of the Avengers, making him assist Loki in any way possible.<br/><br/>All of the unique superheroes are supposed to work together, however many of their egos clash, leading to several disagreements that hinder their progress with the task at hand. It is especially difficult for Bruce Banner under these circumstances to keep calm and not transform into a giant, green monster.<br/><br/>The special affects are quite impressive, but the main plot is non-creative. It was clever to incorporate Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, etc. into one movie, yet why would their job be to protect Manhattan from an alien invasion like in so many other contemporary movies? In addition, even thought the script has classic superhero clich√©s, it gets to be extremely cheesy. I found myself laughing at many of the foolish lines.<br/><br/>My initial reaction to this film was not a good one. I actually couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I was so bored and unimpressed after hearing all the hype about this ""epic"" movie and being let down. After asking around, I've heard mixed reactions. I've done some research and reevaluating and now I give ""The Avengers"" a 7 out of 10."

","The movie was such a huge box office success that I tried really hard to like it. I just couldn't. Just to be certain, I gave it a second viewing, and disliked it just as much the second time around.<br/><br/>Firstly, if you haven't seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America or The Incredible Hulk, you'll have no idea who the characters are and what they're all about. There haven't been films about Black Widow or Hawkeye, so they don't really matter anyway. The film played like a medley of all of these super hero movies and didn't really offer anything we haven't seen in these movies. Also, due to way too many protagonists for one film, none of them were given the opportunity to develop. In fact, I found all the characters incredibly shallow, and didn't like any of them. My favorite character in the film is probably Hulk.<br/><br/>Everything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable - within the context of the genre, off course. 'The Avengers' was so CGI heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it. The film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues. Everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot. Iron Man is just as annoying as in his own franchise (although he is the deepest character of all). So, a mere mortal in a suit Tony Stark (Iron Man) can actually outwit a god like Thor??? Wow, not much hope for gods... The same goes for the powerful god Loki, who is outwitted and outsmarted so easily.<br/><br/>The action in 'Dragon Wars' and 'Transformers' was a lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this. I've seen it twice and that's more than enough, thanks."

Thought Sam Jackson was a really good character. Loki honestly wasn't the best villain and it felt like either Thor, Iron Man, or the Hulk could beat him alone.

Loki's plan revolves around possession of the Tesseract, the same glowing blue MacGuffin that plagued Captain America in his debut solo film ('Captain America: The First Avenger', 2001). The disparate team of egos and alter egos meets, squabbles, reconciles, and finally cooperates as the skies open and Loki's Chitauri army attacks the Big Apple. All of the heroes (super and otherwise) are well played and fun, and Tom Hiddleston is excellent as the conniving Loki.

","A repost from an old IMDB review.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.<br/><br/>Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","7","0","3","18 November 2018"," This is an Okay but overrated movie.
","I like the movie, okay and I thought I'd review it since I will be reviewing Avengers Infinity war later. The first Avengers movie had its moments but I do have some issues with the movie. The main problem I have with the movie is the beginning. The beginning of the movie is VERY slow and very boring in my opinion. There is a lot of talking about things that don't interest me. I did not care about the scenes with Loki showing up on earth and attacking security guards and mind controlling people. I honestly found that lame and uninteresting. This movie just seemed to have no impact when it came to the action, except near the end. The movie does have some good action near the end during the last 45 minutes which I enjoyed, however, I was so bored with the first one hour and fifteen minutes of the movie, that the last half barely makes up for it. In other words, if the action at the end had not been so good I probably would have not liked the movie. If none of that Great action had been in the movie then I definitely wouldn't have liked it.<br/><br/>So yes I think it's an Okay movie but it could have been so much better if the first hour and fifteen minutes of the movie had not been so boring and slow. To be honest I didn't even care about black widow meeting the hulk scene. I thought I would like that scene but I really didn't. I'm not saying there is no action near the start of the film, There is but they are small bits that last maybe two minutes tops and I'm sorry but that's not nearly enough action, considering this movie's status. I expected a lot more than a couple of lame two-minute fights with black widow and these men who I don't remember!. That just goes to show you how impressive those villains were, I don't even remember them!. I'm guessing I'm alone in that of course. People probably love that scene, I'm sorry but I definitely didn't. I'm surprised that this movie gets a higher score than Avengers Age of Ultron, which is the superior movie in my opinion. I'm sorry folks but more things happen in Age of Ultron. That movie has a better story and better effects and better Action scenes. Even the fight scenes with the smaller Robots were great. That movie was shot very well and everything worked perfectly for me with that movie, even the ending was better and far more entertaining.<br/><br/>The first Avengers movie, on the other hand, was not as good as the second. The first one suffers from very bad pacing and uninteresting character moments that could have been better. Don't get me wrong I liked all of the characters. I thought the six heroes were very likeable which is one of the positives of the movie. They also make a great team and work well together. The only problem I had with them was their humour, I did not find them that funny. They had a couple of funny moments but most of their jokes were hit or miss for me.<br/><br/>Most people seem to like the scene on the shield ship when all the characters were standing around talking. I'm sorry but I didn't like that scene. I thought that was one of the most boring parts of the movie, in fact, I remember watching that scene and feeling very bored and tired, I nearly fell asleep too. In fact, I feel tired just writing this review because it was definitely boring at times. Loki being on the shield ship did not make the movie more interesting either. The man who plays Loki is a Great actor and his performance in the movie was very good, however even his good acting didn't stop me from being bored, and that's mainly because by this part of the movie, one hour has gone by with nothing happening. The two-minute fight with black widow doesn't count, that was nothing. Also, The start of the film with the agents chasing Loki was nothing either. It was a lame three-minute scene that went nowhere and ended in a crappy way.<br/><br/>The only other action scene I can think of that happened before the boring ship scene would be Loki's lame speech at the party scene. After giving a long-winded and boring speech about wanting to rule the humans, he gets into a lame scuffle with Captain America which was nothing special either. Captain America got his ass kicked and had to be saved by Iron man who shoots a laser beam at him, which leads to Loki surrendering and the Avengers taking him to their Ship. Which then leads to more scenes of nothing special. If people think the Avengers standing around arguing on the ship is entertaining they can be my guest, I just disagree. I would rather watch Age of Ultron instead which has 100 times more Action than This movie. Ultron is also a better Villain than Loki in my opinion.<br/><br/>There is a scene on the ship where Captain America walks off by himself and tries to fix the ship, and I must say that scene is VERY BORING. That scene goes on way too long and it was totally pointless and a waste of running time. If you took that scene out of the movie, it would be ten minutes shorter and faster paced and more fun because of it. You also have a lame scene where this guy or guys, (I don't remember because it was so boring) were firing bullets at Captain America, and he hardly even puts up a fight!! He just hides around a corner and uses a piece of metal to try and block the bullets. That scene was laughable and very lame!. Captain America pretty much spends that whole scene hiding! And everyone is okay with that for some reason!!??. SIGH and people call Ultron lame?? I'm sorry but Ultron is not lame. Captain America, on the other hand, was very Lame in that scene.<br/><br/>Yes I know I have probably pi##ed people off by saying that, but I'm sorry it's TRUE. There was nothing special about that scene. Captain America put up a better fight against Ultron then he did against this nobody guy who I don't remember And Ultron was a Machine. Captain America put up a Great fight against Ultron But for some reason, he struggles to fight a nobody guy that is 100 times weaker than him?? Why? I have no idea. Once again SIGH and Ultron is supposedly lame???. I think the people that call him that must be high on Crack or something because they make absolutely no sense. Ultron was a great villain that the Avengers struggled to fight against, and they only managed to beat him in the end because they all fought him together, It was about 10 against 1 which isn't exactly fair! So, of course, they are going to beat him! That does NOT make him lame!. I think people are forgetting he nearly destroyed the WORLD.<br/><br/>Getting back to this movie which is the weaker movie, it's a very slow one that did not impress me that much. Most of the movie is all talk and no action. When we finally get to the fight scene with Thor VS the Hulk, about an hour had gone by which is way too long. Don't get me wrong I liked the fight. I thought Thor VS Hulk was entertaining, and the fight was pretty evenly matched. The scene was also well shot with good effects. So yes the movie does have action, I'm not saying it doesn't have action, but the problem is it just takes TOO LONG to get to the action pieces. That's one of the many reasons why Avengers 2 is miles better because that movie moves faster, and it is not sluggish like the first movie.<br/><br/>Now getting to the good points of the first Avengers movie. 1 The acting. The acting is very good and everyone gives good performances especially Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki. He does a Great job not only acting but playing a good and believable villain. I can totally understand why people like him, I like him too! I just don't think he's the number one villain that's all.<br/><br/>My personal top three best Marvel movie villains would be 1. Thanos 2. Ultron 3. Loki. That's just my opinion and I know I'm probably alone in that. Sorry, but I had to be honest. Getting back to what I was saying, the acting was Great by Tom and There were a few times that his acting was so good he came across as intimidating, especially during the scene where he talks with black widow.<br/><br/>2. Another thing I liked were the effects. Now I'm not saying they were all great. Some were just okay but others were very good and I was impressed, I personally liked the CGI that was used for the Aliens, they looked pretty real to me.<br/><br/>3. The characters. Yes despite my moaning earlier about the boring scenes, the movie does have a lot of likeable characters, the main ones being our heroes. I just wished our heroes could have done more at the beginning of the movie instead of standing around talking or arguing with each other. However when they are not arguing and they are getting along they are actually very likeable people, and I grew to like them pretty fast. I also liked their teamwork and how they worked together at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>4. Now getting to the best point for ME personally, The Action during the last 45 minutes of the movie. The last part of the movie was very good!. The moment Loki and his army of Aliens come along and start attacking the city that's when it gets very fun and entertaining. There is a lot of action and a lot of chaos, buildings fall people run away screaming, and we get to see our heroes kick the Aliens asses, we even get to see Thor fight Loki again which was cool. The entire last part of the movie is good! My main issue with this movie is the first hour and fifteen minutes being boring and slow!<br/><br/>If people praised this movie ONLY for the last 45 minutes then I could understand the praise it gets, but I don't understand the praise for the WHOLE movie. I did not enjoy the whole movie but I did like some short moments near the beginning. Those moments being too short was the problem. I also enjoyed Thor VS Hulk, and the best part of the movie: The Avengers fighting an Alien army, which I enjoyed the most.<br/><br/>Overall The movie is just Okay to me. I have seen many other Marvel movies that I have enjoyed more. I only liked the movie, Okay, and it's worth one watch for the action at the end, but this is not a movie that I would watch many times considering the pacing problems it has."

They had to prove this massive gamble they took with a connected universe was worth it. And they did.<br/><br/>The cast played a big part in this. Seeing Iron Man meet the Hulk and Thor fight Captain America was awesome. Their personalities all played off each other excellently, with RDJ leading the charisma meter. Hulk was recast for this movie with Mark Ruffalo, a worthy replacement for Norton. He makes the character his own. This is the first movie I really started liking Black Widow. Johansson gives a great performance and her writing is great. Jermey Renner does good for what he's given, which isn't little, but he shines in the next movie. Tom Hiddleston does great as Loki, with his few comedic moments being highlights. Samuel L. Jackson is great as Fury, and Clark Gregg really shines as Coulson. The cast is great, not a single person is miscast.<br/><br/>The writing is good, with quips galore. It sets up the epic battle at the end excellently, and the character interactions make the movie. A few characters feel wasted though. Evans and Hemsworth both do amazing, but they feel underused. Hawkeye is famously shoved to the side, and that's a real shame. The opening twenty minutes are pretty boring, but the movie picks up after that. But I think it's still very well written.<br/><br/>The effects are all great. They finally got the Hulk right. He looks like Banner, just ripped and green. Cap's suit sucks though. Iron Man's suit looks life like. The alien army looks good, everything looks great.<br/><br/>I love this movie. I'll never forget watching this movie for the first time and being utterly astounded. Marvel had crafted a masterpiece in my opinion, and I thought this was it.

","The main thing to say about the film is that it is its light-hearted touch and Robert Downey Jr and others delivering fast-talking one liners which break just at the right time. Some of the humour comes from the battle for screen supremacy among the Avengers.
That said, while the visual effects and stunts keep up viewer engagement, imagination does tend to lag behind - the fighting is repetitive. CGI is used well but some of the cartoonish manouevres made by the Hulk character in a film trying to keep some semblance of scientific plausibility are frankly implausible compared to the other Avengers. Tom Hiddlestone gives good menace with wide, piercing eyes and an almost sibilant line delivery, but he plays second fiddle to the prime villainy who are featureless."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","2","20 July 2018"," Aside from a slightly baggy middle section, this is a very entertaining and enjoyable film (very minor spoilers)
","In order to appease the gods from his planet, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals something known as Tessercat from a company called S.H.I.E.L.D. In the right hands, Tessercat can be used in a good way for the good of mankind, but Loki's plans are much more sinister and he intends to create a gateway from another dimension to Earth and plans to take over the world. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is the director of S.H.I.E.L.D who finds himself having to call upon the best superheroes in the business (collectively known as The Avengers) to put a stop to Loki and his devastating plan...<br/><br/>As someone who is a general fan of superhero films The Avengers Assemble was always something that appealed to me (and gods knows why it's taken me so long to get round to seeing it). I have to admit that with a 5 star rating and the big draw of seeing several superheroes together my expectations were high and whilst the film didn't quite deliver as I expected it to it is still a very good film...<br/><br/>It cuts to the chase very quickly and wastes precious little time before it gets to the high octane action sequences (which is fine by me) and carries on in this manner for a good 45 minutes or so. The initial set-up shows us being introduced to the characters, but the introductions are generally met with either frantic fight sequences or cheeky banter - sometimes superhero films can introduce characters in a lengthy and dull way, but it doesn't play out in this manner here and for the most part the film is often exciting, fun and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Where the film does suffer slightly is in the middle of the picture; specifically where Loki is caught and imprisoned. Whilst I get that this section of the story ultimately served a purpose it does feel like it has been tortuously stretched out and feels out of place with what was otherwise a fast-paced and exciting film.<br/><br/>As is to be expected in a big film with lots of superhero characters the acting performances prove to be rather mixed; Tom Hiddleston does a reasonably good job, but I didn't find him all that intimating and his attempts at being threatening were at times somewhat laughable. Hemsworth is a good physical presence, but doesn't give much of an acting performance (I haven't seen any of the Thor films yet so will reserve my judgement on him till I seen those films). Johansson is OK, but doesn't have a lot to work with. Evans acting is generally OK, but he finds himself playing the straight-man to Downey Jr which doesn't really work that well; I much preferred Evans as the goofball character in The Fantastic Four. The true stand-out performance for me was Mark Ruffalo; he managed to give Banner a real human quality and sold it so well that I still saw a human being beneath the gruff green exterior - I thought that the Hulk was actually the best superhero character here, but his introduction is laborious and as a result of this he is a little underused.<br/><br/>Despite some of my objections, I have to give credit to Joss Whedon because to all intents and purposes the film has plenty of fight sequences, occasional moments of amusing banter and for the most part it is lively and fast-paced. Yes it isn't perfect and it's 5 star rating on Sky Movies and it's current 8.1 rating on IMDB seem a little out of kilter with reality, but The Avengers Assemble did entertain me big time and that's what truly matters when all is said and done."

The Russo brothers decided to split the superhero into a series of small groups that made the plot fragment and destroy all previous products.<br/><br/>Why? Not just last year, Marvel spent 130 minutes and $ 180 million for Thor: Ragnarok so that Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) can control the power without hammer? Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also asked a sarcastic comment: ""Are you Thor Boy or Thor Thunder?"" that? Thor then spent more than half the amount of time in the Avengers: Infinity War just to find the new hammer and never use lightning once. And Groot (Vin Diesel) hugged the phone boringly throughout the movie just to make a hammer for the audience to shout and forget that the storyline (or even this character) is no problem. nothing."

","The Avengers is an entertaining and satisfying film. I was worried that, with so many characters, the story would be messy or rushed, but everyone seemed to get equal time and the plot flowed smoothly.

","I'd watched some of the films preceding this one and enjoyed most of them (Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and even Hulk) and was curious about the next installment. Plus, Joss Whedon (of Firefly) was directing. This is easily my favorite of the Avengers films and it's one of the best superhero films on the Marvel side. The X-Men films were decent but they couldn't come close to this. I'd say the Avengers are my favorite superhero alliance when it comes to Marvel Comics. Iron Man and Captain America really stole the show, with Iron Man being the most realistic superhero since Batman/Bruce Wayne.

","The Avengers: Movie Review.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a beautifully made fantastic film with great direction, writing, solid acting and performances. The film is an epic masterpiece in the genre of comic book superhero films. The visual cinematic style of the film is absorbing and the story telling is top notch. The film immerses the movie goer in the adventures of The Avengers. And it captures superheros in all of its glory.<br/><br/>The tone and style of the movie is intense, gripping, futuristic and imaginative. The visual effects of the film are spectacular and dazzling. Action Sequences are highly creative, artistic and breathtaking. The humour and emotions in the film feels compelling, convincing and genuinely realistic. There are some very interesting character moments. The character designs of the film are very fascinating and quiet innovative. The star cast is great and the performance are strong. The characters are very well developed and have emotional depth and intensity. The musical score of the film is amazing.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo totally nailed it as Hulk. He is freaking awesome as Hulk. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is amazing and charismatic as always and Tom Hiddleston as villainous Loki is fantastic and outstanding.Some of the best dialogues of the film is delivered by Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. Sometimes films lacks proper pacing and feels little rushed at certain points and looses momentum in some sequences, but all over, its one hell of a superhero ride. <br/><br/>I had watched The Avengers in Cinemas and had a great experience. For Me, Watching The Avengers, all our favourite superheroes, get together for first time on screen is a an unique and very memorable emotional moment. The Avengers is one of the great superhero film by Marvel and a fine addition to already growing Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Avengers is definitely one of my most favourite superhero film of all time.<br/><br/>(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

","When a revolutionary power source, known as the Tesseract, is brought into operation something goes wrong; it is meant to bring unlimited energy from outer space but instead it is used by the evil Loki to teleport himself to Earth. Using his powers he steals the Tesseract and takes control of scientist Dr Erik Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton. He intends to give the Tesseract to The Other in exchange for an army to conquer Earth. First he will have to gain certain items to open a large enough portal for his army. Meanwhile SHIELD director Nick Fury assembles the world's superheroes to battle Loki. They aren't natural team players and are soon bickering and fighting amongst themselves. Loki is captured with surprising ease√Ç‚Ä¶ almost as if being captured was part of his plan.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the superhero genre then I'm sure this will be a must see; if like me you aren't exactly a fan of the genre but do enjoy the occasional superhero film then this is one that is worth watching. The fact that it includes several varied superheroes is rather fun. Having only seen the 'Iron Man' films and the old '70s Hulk TV series I wasn't familiar with most of them but that didn't really matter as it soon becomes apparent what powers each of them have and the reason for those powers isn't really important. There is lots of action throughout this is all pretty exciting and the technology they use looks great; I particularly liked the Helicarrier, a flying aircraft character reminiscent of the 'Cloud Base' in 'Captain Scarlet' only this one is introduced to us when it is in the water. Even on a fairly small scene the climactic scenes look good but would recommend watching on the largest screen you can to get the full effect. The cast does a fine job making their unbelievable characters believable. Overall I'd say this is a fine example of the genre that is suitable for all but younger children."
"leegato","6","0","1","11 May 2017"," Epic, But Certainly Not The Best Marvel Film (For Its Time)
","Everything that the Marvel Cinematic Universe was culminating to leads up to this. And it certainly doesn't disappoint. Except story-wise.<br/><br/>What made the previous Marvel films compelling was how they managed to write a unique and realistic story that became the primary focus of the films rather than the overused hero-villain structure. Watching Tony Stark grow from arrogant billionaire to humbled hero, torn by war. Watching Bruce Banner suffer with his internal Jekyll-Hyde in a modern society. Watching Thor Odinson learn from Earth and become humbled. And finally seeing Captain America use his sense of duty to the US to cope with his new superhuman powers. The MCU films' most attractive feature, in my opinion, was the storyline.<br/><br/>I felt Marvel's The Avengers strayed from the character-driven storyline. The main conflict and growth in the film is getting the heroes to adjust their agendas as a team. But a majority of the film is also dedicated to the action, the one-line jokes, and the special effects spectacles that take up at least a third of the film. With The Avengers, we get a fun movie that diminishes the realistic take on heroes that the previous MCU films employed and puts more emphasis on the comedy and epic spectacle that is the film. There's much less room for the typical character development and storyline that we came to love through the MCU. While it's amazing to see these heroes finally come together on the same screen and work as a beautiful team, the story falls flat to a basic heroes-fight-villain structure."

","One of the most entertaining blockbusters of all time, The Avengers may not have the perfection of the holy grail of comic-book adaptations, i.e. The Dark Knight trilogy or Logan, but its significant emphasis on perfect balance of humour & action throughout its runtime makes up for a highly rewarding experience that is far greater than what most films of its genre ever manage to come close to.<br/><br/>Six Marvel superheroes in one movie, same save-the-world bullshit that we have seen & been disappointed with countless number of times and yet, The Avengers works in an unexpected but very effective manner and is bigger, better & far more amusing plus enjoyable than all the previous films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe combined, and succeeds in surpassing all hype & expectations with surprising but stunning ease.<br/><br/>As for the plot summary, when the tesseract suddenly activates at the S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility and opens up a portal, allowing Loki, brother of Thor, to reach the Earth & begin his mission of enslaving the whole planet, Nick Fury (director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) reactivates the Avengers initiative, thus bringing Natasha Romanoff, Dr. Bruce Banner, Tony Stark & Steve Rogers together, who are later joined by Thor & Clint Barton, to stop Loki from succeeding with his plan.<br/><br/>The direction is extremely good as Joss Whedon has crafted an impressive piece of eye-popping action extravaganza and, to make sure that the film is not overloaded & tiring, filled it up with loads of humour. The screenplay is witty plus the comic timing is brilliantly executed. Cinematography & Editing is carried out amazingly well. And the original score by Alan Silvestri is a major plus as it strikes the right chord from start to finish, thus enriching the whole experience.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, it's Robert Downey Jr. who delivers the strongest performance amongst all as Tony Stark/Iron Man and thanks to the amazing wit, charisma & charm this amazing actor always brings to the screen with finesse, it's almost impossible to not like him. Yet the one who manages to steal the show in the end is none other than Mark Ruffalo's terrific rendition of The Hulk for he was absolutely merciless & unstoppable and even Tom Hiddleston as Loki manage to impress with his chilling performance.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Avengers is an ambitious adventure for the masses containing all the right ingredients of a genuine blockbuster material and the best thing about it is that nothing gets overdone as every element is present in its right dose, be it action, humour, drama etc. An astonishingly great initiative that will satisfy the majority of its viewers with its wildly entertaining, fun-filled, roller- coaster ride, this is the perfect popcorn entertainer for all ages."

Every character had been fleshed out already (save for the fact that Hawkeye and Black Widow were only supporting characters in some of the films and the Hulk had been recast) and the stage had been set.<br/><br/>The Tesseract from the first Captain America film is the McGuffin of the film, desired by Loki, who is portrayed brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston once again.<br/><br/>In terms of the story, it's nothing groundbreaking or original, but it's still entertaining. This rag-tag group of heroes must band together and save the world from extraterrestrial threat, while trying to remain civil with one another.<br/><br/>For the most part, this film is an absolute spectacle. Comic book fans had been dreaming for a film like this where these iconic heroes team up and save the day.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon succeeds in giving us a memorable superhero film. Of course there are references in the film that will inevitably build up to future sequels, which in a sense gets a little tiring.<br/><br/>Other than that, this film really is a testament to the effort of those involved in the MCU."

(an agency aiming at Earth protection) envisages is to put together a team of legendary heroes to fight that threat. But these heroes (Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and The Iron Man) are not exactly at the beginning very friendly to each other so their conflicts must be first appeased before they enter in action as The Avengers to fight Earth's enemy. Then the action develops itself in overwhelming fights, collective and individual of astonishing and appalling quality until the final defeat of the bad ones. Chiefly the final scenes are excellent indeed. This is one of the best movies of this kind ever made."
"fernandoschiavi","9","0","3","5 October 2016"," The merge with uniformity plenty of action, humor through dialogues fast and truly entertaining, and manages very well a huge amount of characters in the scene simultaneously
","There are movies that surprise the audience and get a smashing success so unexpected even up to its makers, especially the budget not so generous studio and names in the cast who supposedly would not be able to attract a large audience. There are, however, cases of productions that since there is the news that will come out of the role of expectation are surrounded by everything around him: big stars, big budget, and with an almost certain success at the box office. It is this second option that fits the Avengers, a complex project that had the responsibility to unite all the worlds' own superheroes of Marvel gathered at the same time and same place, making the characters interact with all their differences and similarities.<br/><br/>Whedon and Zak Penn may perhaps be placed as the true heroes of this great gathering of superheroes. The script is developed in exact measure, knowing incorporate various elements, references, characteristics and situations of comic characters as antagonistic, in a precise dose of action, humor and technology. If you think about it, the task of the writers was nothing simple: gather all the big superhero films presented in their soil in previous years to fight a villain with potential to wipe out life on Earth. Would even join a Norse god who lives in another dimension, a monster irrational and powerful, a billionaire egomaniac, a super soldier dormant for decades, a skilled archer, and a spy fatal and deadly. All these characters living in the same space and time, having to deal with different personalities, motivations and skills towards a greater good. As if that were not enough, the villain would have to represent a real threat, large scale and immediate to justify the gathering of notable fighters.<br/><br/>One of the factors that help in the design of the plot is that there is no need to introduce the characters, since the task of establishing the characters in the films was made of individual heroes. Thus, the action is played on the screen directly from the first minutes, divided into several large sequences of all kinds (heroes vs villains, heroes v heroes, heroes vs Chitauri). <br/><br/>In addition to the struggles between the components of the Avengers, the Joss Whedon film has great action sequence blocks, idealized in different places. In the first few minutes, we see Loki coming to Earth and a large following of escape from the labs of SHIELD entitled to chase through the streets, through a tunnel and a helicopter, and culminating in a huge explosion at the base of the agency in the soil. Soon later, we have to pass in Germany, and even a huge sequence that goes on in the SHIELD ship occupies large space in the film, forcing the heroes to understand after a discussion, to save everyone on the ship of a large and devastating onslaught of enemies led by Loki. Until finally the worst happens and the Avengers must face the Chitauri to invade Earth after a portal is opened in space. Just this last sequence occupied almost the last 40 minutes of the film. The best is the domain Whedon conducting the action scenes, while maintaining the interaction and dynamics between all the heroes, making the story move forward. As the action scenes were being shown, everything was getting bigger and better, both in the duration of the fights, and in its technical complexity.<br/><br/>In a film of such monumental scale, is essential in the preparation of flawless harmony effects made by Industrial Light & Magic, which earned the film a well deserved nominee on the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. With an estimated budget is $ 150 million and filmed almost entire green screen, highlight the meticulous construction of the nave of SHIELD and the other ships that attacked her in airspace, creating impressive 3D features and more human than Hulk; the creation of Stark Tower, the construction of an entire city with hundreds of buildings, skyscrapers and moving cars, which incidentally is also all created by computer, creating detailed Chitauri and giant space monsters that also pass the portal; plus countless explosions, shattered glass, dust and objects flying through space. The Avengers certainly used what is most modern in the area of visual effects in a complex in the extreme. Importantly, working together with the formidable team of sound mixing. We can hear the sound of arrows, explosions, glass shattering and the impacts of the objects on the floor with a clarity and realism detachable.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon manages to merge with uniformity plenty of action, humor through dialogues fast and truly entertaining, and manages very well a huge amount of characters in the scene simultaneously. The director, with his influence television, planning frameworks with very many close-ups and planes closed, open but knowing the right moments with beautiful and exciting plans long sequence (especially in the final battle against the Chitauri). He also looks for references in movies soil of the protagonists. <br/><br/>The Avengers is without a doubt one undisputed success of critically and commercially, becoming the third highest grossing film of all time, surpassed only by Titanic (1997) and Avatar (2009), both by James Cameron. The production received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93% with an average rating of 8.1/10 based on an aggregation of 267 opinions. On Metacritic, the film got an average rating of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, signifying ""generally favorable reviews"". An adventure filled with elements of the essence of the comics without worrying too much about the realism presented, focusing on a simple plot and the best a popcorn movie has to offer."

","Back in 2008, before Nick Fury told Tony Stark that he wanted to talk about the 'Avengers Initiative' during the post-credits scene in 'Iron Man', no one had ever expected that Marvel Studios would be able to do a film adaptation of 'The Avengers'. Nothing like it had ever been done before... and yet, they made it work. They took their time, establishing its heroes in solo films in order for them to become endearing characters. And then, they came together for a superhero epic unlike any other at the time... Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers'.<br/><br/>Whedon, known for his snappy dialogue and credibility in geek culture, gives this film so much in terms of humor and epic character moments that feel like they came straight out of the comics. It may be a large cast but Whedon gives each member of the main team (yes, even Hawkeye) enough to do within the context of the story. They work off each other extremely well, which results in some truly epic and in some cases hilarious moments (e.g. when Hulk completely decimates Loki).<br/><br/>Now sure, admittedly the plot for this film is pretty darn basic; a bad guy tries to take over the world and the Avengers team up to stop him. It really isn't much more than that. And yet in this case, that's not that big of an issue. 'The Avengers' still stands as one of the most important films in the superhero genre. Not only was it a film that very much lived up to the hype that came from all of the build-up in previous films but it was pretty much the one that truly established Marvel Studios as the kings of the superhero genre."
"tjsdomer2","10","0","3","9 August 2016"," Why So Serious?
","Marvel's The Avengers flat out brings the fun back into comic book films. Don't get me wrong, I love the Nolan-verse's darkness and depth and Iron Man's introspection, but those movies aren't fun in the basic sense of the word. The beauty of the Avengers, in contrast, is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and despite the large cast the characters, somehow gives them their due individual justice.<br/><br/>In this league of heroes seeking justice (poor choice of words?), I want to highlight Captain America and Black Widow in particular. The latter fits surprisingly well in the 21st century and cracks quite a few good jokes as any 90 year old would. Black Widow, with her increased screen time compared to Iron Man 2, comes across with more agency of her own instead of pure sex appeal, though that is surely there too. I can also note that while I enjoyed Edward Norton as the Incredible Hulk, I prefer Mark Ruffalo's humor and think he deserves an film of his own.<br/><br/>Loki, in his first appearance since his debut in Thor, provides a well-balanced and somewhat empathetic villain who I think he will be a mainstay in the MCU for as long as it continues. Finally, you can see some of the real-life issues of accountability that become the basis for future films in the series.<br/><br/>The Avengers deserves 4 out of 4 shawarmas."
"archop","9","0","2","7 August 2016"," Avengers is an amazing movie
","So Marvel finally decided to bring all its superheroes together. Something that I had been waiting for from a long time. Until now there were only independent stories for each of the superheroes.<br/><br/>The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, is the very first movie from Marvel that unites all the heroes into one great action packed movie. The movie brings Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr. Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) together to save the Earth from the actions of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The story is similar to other superhero movies with the general ""save the earth from danger"" plot. Even though it may have a simple plot however it does have some amazing action sequences and impressive special effects like the much more realistic Hulk, who (through motion capture technology) finally looks like the actor playing him. The interaction between the superheroes as the movie progressed was also something to watch out for. It had great performances by all the actors, good humor, and many others which I will leave as a mystery. Avengers is a general sci-fi, superhero movie, but it sets the stage for more eye-catching sequels to follow.<br/><br/>According to me what Whedon and Marvel have created here is one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet. This movie is a must watch for the Marvel fans out there. I would give it a rating of 9/10."
"barbagvido","8","0","1","29 June 2016"," Nice, but not THAT good.
","This was a long anticipated movie that teams up multiple superheroes for the first time and confirms MCU completely. The last five MCU movies have all be leading up to this. And it's here now. So, is it good?<br/><br/>I like it that they tried making a comic book cinematic universe and teaming up all those superheroes. In fact, I love that idea. And it got very good ratings and I liked the movie. It was fun, it was well done, the dialogues were well written and it was so cool to see all these heroes working together. And also, Alan Silvestri's score is very good and it's one of the best superhero movie themes I've ever heard. But the story, the similar problem I had before, just wasn't big or epic enough. It felt like a special longer TV episode with huge budget. The plot was just too simple for such an epic idea and most of the main plot happens in one day. It's not messy at all but that's because of the thin plot. And even when there are in danger there are still humorous parts, so when there are some emotional moments, they don't really fit in. There is a death of a side character somewhere in the middle and everyone is so sad about it, but I could barely remember his name, so it did nothing for me. But it's not about the actors. The acting is great and everyone shines in their roles, but I still liked Tom Hiddleston as Loki the most. Also there is a recast of one character, Hulk. He's played by Mark Ruffalo and I think he's also pretty good in his own way. Ruffalo is closer to the comics, but Norton's grounded approach was very good and it shows us how badly affected he is with his ""gift"". And one more flaw, enemies were to easily defeated in my opinion. Aside from Loki's plan and all the fights between them in the first half, The Avengers never really faced anything that was a really big threat and they got out of every danger too easily.<br/><br/>Very fun, very well done movie and the first superhero team up movie and that's way it gets so much points from me, but I was just slightly disappointed because of the lack of challenge to the heroes and the weak plot."

The movie is really action-packed and very cool to watch. What makes the movie even better is probably the fantastic cast. I was happy to see that most of the heroes were played by the same actors, it was a kind of old boys reunion. The characters were true to themselves, it was easy to recognize them, and they also kept their sense of humor. The acting was totally convincing. The action scenes and the visual effects were absolutely mind-blowing. I've never thought that it was digital characters for one second, even if I knew it. All the digital tricks don't look obvious if you're absorbed by the movie, you forget them very fast. So, to conclude, the movie is worth seeing and if you love super-heroes, you'll never be bored."

","Words can not describe how much I love this movie. Over the course of his career, Joss has always exceeded my expect ions. From Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Dollhouse and Cabin in the Woods, each of these films and TV shows carry so much depth. The Avengers was nothing less then that. It had comedy (loki and the hulk) it had tender moments (the death of one of their own) a little mystery, but most of all it had a compelling story line. One that never was dull or over the top. You really wanted these heroes to succeed. You felt for them, which if so difficult to accomplish with so many big named stars with big named characters are all in a movie together. Yet I always felt that each person got the right amount of equal screen time. (Except Ironman he had the most time, but he is also the greatest comic character of all time.)

","The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.<br/><br/>The Avengers project began over 10 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humour and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.<br/><br/>The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be ""hilariously out gunned"" and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. <br/><br/>The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist""- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humour to an ""oh so serious"" group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. <br/><br/>However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humour. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.<br/><br/>You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- ""hold on"", he seems to say, ""the solution is just round the corner""- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. <br/><br/>To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colourfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. Geeking out has never been so much fun."

","After a superhero Thors evil brother Loki gains control of the tesseract, he becomes a threat to earth. The director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, organizes the superhero group known as the avengers to stop him.<br/><br/>The avengers was produced by Joss Whedon. The movie came out in 2012. The avengers is a very exciting movie with really good fighting scenes in it. The avengers movie is about Loki and his army fighting against the Avengers for the tesseract in new York city. The tesseract is an unlimited energy power source. S.H.I.E.L.D. found the tesseract deep in the ocean at the same time when they found Captain America in the ocean. Loki having the tesseract would be very dangerous to earth so nick fury got the avengers together to stop him. The avengers consist of iron man, captain America, hulk, thor, black widow, and hulk eye.<br/><br/>In the movie, I liked all of the special effects. The backgrounds music and sound effects were also good. The graphics in the movie were also very good and made the movie better.<br/><br/>A major theme in this movie is heroism. Through out the movie, the avengers members were trying to protect every one on earth. Since the movie takes place in new York city, there were many people who lived in new York city who could have been hurt but many of them weren't injured at all because the avengers protected them. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is very good. I've seen this movie many of times and I never get tired of watching it. If you like action movies, then I suggest you watch this movie. You will love the avengers. <br/><br/>9/10"

Why not just open the hole and surprise everyone? Would be a much better plan. I give this a 1.4p<br/><br/>Entertainment-wise this is one of the best made in recent memory. There is always something going on,usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. A 2p<br/><br/>In total a strong 7 or a week 8.

","This film bought together some really good actors who really played their characters and got each ones message across. Although one issue that did seem to be apparent was the over all story arc.<br/><br/>It still followed the tried and tested method of villain comes in, hatches an evil plan, causes chaos that puts the heroes into disarray and just when it seems like all is lost the heroes manage to pull them selves together just in time to ruin the evil plans and save the world (not really a spoiler but does kind of give you the theme of things).<br/><br/>Credit should also be given to those that created the VFX, for those familiar with how iron man gets in and out of his suit the on screen animation is amazing to watch and undoubtedly took ages to work out."
"taggard-98527","10","0","1","16 April 2016"," The MCU truly takes flight.
","The good - One of my favorite comic book movies of all time. It has amazing action scenes (the ""one take"" shot that shows what each hero is doing during the Battle of New York still makes me want to cheer), great ensemble chemistry, and a sense of fun that is supported by some dramatic tension. It captures the spirit perfectly and builds upon characters that were introduced in the previous MCU movies. Hard to believe that the only major character that was given any kind of introduction in this movie was Maria Hill.<br/><br/>The great - Ruffalo pulls off the best Bruce Banner ever to hit the screen. Perfect blend of smart ass, smart scientist, and asshole. And the Hulk was wildly fun as well.<br/><br/>The surprising - Of all the movies I have re-watched in this series, this one seems to have been most impacted (negatively) by the future MCU stories. (*MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*) The death of a major figure loses some of its impact, as you know he will be coming back and it undercuts some of the darkness and drama that my original watchings conveyed.<br/><br/>Summary - Still amazingly fun, and, by far, the best live-action comic book ensemble movie ever made and worth watching again and again., The Avengers has DC desperate to catch up and create their own DCCU, but I am not convinced Batman vs Superman will ever live up to this. Joss Whedon created an experience that was an amazing way to end Phase 1 and set us up for Phase 2!"
"danielrivasss","9","0","1","8 April 2016"," Great movie
","At first I was very surprised at how they made all the characters intertwine. I really enjoyed it from start to finish, leaving you with wanting to see more. I believe this set the film and the following self titled films for success. The CGI was right on top, as I would expect from a film like this, that relies heavily on it. Since going on DVD it was nice to re-watch it over and over to see things i missed the first time around. The cast is spot on for each of the characters and makes me want more. I really like the dialogue between the characters since this is the first time meeting them all at once. I think it was well written introducing each and their roles. A nice set up for the sequel."
"duncanbourne","9","0","1","3 April 2016"," The perfect superhero film
","This is the perfect superhero film. You will not find much in the way of social comment (one bit about Loki & Nazis is a bit clunky), you will not find a great deal back-story or exploration of the depths of the characters. But this film doesn't need those it is awesome and it is fun! Striking the perfect balance between dark and light (in the pain vs fun sense) no time is wasted on introducing the heroes or the villains (it is assumed you know them already and of course you do)and the pacing is perfect. The action sequences are well done and pure comic book, there is no slacking in the pacing but you do not get a lot of the ""what-the-hell-jst-happened"" too fast to follow action . That is the essence of it, a comic brought to life in a way that you don't question. The balance of the characters is right too. Stark's smartass humour counterpoints Captain America's straight guy perfectly and the swaggering Thor goes well sided with the mild Banner and brutal Hulk. Hulk especially is someone who worries everyone in this, unpredictable yet necessary, he is a presence even when he isn't big and green. Sure there are some unbelievable bits, if I had taken even a fraction of the punishment Black Widow does whilst fighting the bad guys I would wind up dead or very injured at best and the consequence of actions taken is not always carried through but Hey! This is Marvel not Tolstoy and it delivers the goods as they fit within that universe."

","I watch this film multiply times since it came out. I couldn't stop watching it and I kept watching over and over again. When I see this film today. I just realized it has some good moments and very well acted action scenes. I felt at the second act of the film slowed down the whole film, and I felt there was a rock on top of the Avengers and they are all just dragging it as it slowly goes on because has good scenes but the film goes from action and back to drama and goes right back to the action. With no sudden reasons that once it goes back to the drama scenes it really does really drags on until the next action scene happens. Has good and funny moments between the characters. I just feel that the pacing is very slow when transition to the next action scene to the next. Lucky Age of Ultron done the pacing a bit better but still has some scenes that drags the movie from continuing forward."
"nmholland","10","0","1","27 January 2016"," One of the Best Superhero Movies Ever
","The Avengers is easily the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date. I would even go as far as to say that it is the best Marvel film to date. It was an amazing movie, filled with great special effects, and an AMAZING cast.<br/><br/>The movie opens, and a voice is describing a powerful object known as the Tesseract. We later learn that this is an Infinity Stone, one of the most powerful items in the universe. We then see Nick Fury and Dr. Erik Selvig talking about how the Tesseract is ""misbehaving,"" which is not a good sign. They believe that it is a portal to the other side of space, and think that someone is messing with the portal on the other end, which was suggested by Hawkeye, a SHIELD agent. Out of nowhere, the notorious Loki appears through the portal, and kills multiple agents. He then takes Selvig and Hawkeye as mind slaves, and escapes with the Tesseract. A few people try to stop him, but they are unsuccessful. He escapes, and the title of the movie is announced. After this sequence, the movie goes on to Nick Fury assembling a team entitled The Avengers, and they must learn a way to work together in order to thwart Loki's scheme and save the world from an alien race called the Chitauri.<br/><br/>This movie is AMAZING. It includes one of the biggest casts in cinematic history, and mind blowing visuals. Just to give an idea of how big the cast is, let me give you a list: Robert Downey, Jr. (as Iron Man) Chris Evans (as Captain America) Mark Ruffalo (as Hulk) Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) Chris Hemsworth (as Thor) Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) Tom Hiddleston (as Loki) Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper) Stellan Skarsgard (as Dr. Erik Selvig) and Samuel L. Jackson (as Nick Fury)<br/><br/>Yeah, that's a lot. Now anyways, this movie has many ups, and few downs. To start, the visuals are amazing in the film. There isn't a moment where you might say ""fake."" All of it looks completely real. These visuals are at their peak in the final battle, known as the ""Battle of New York."" In said scene, Earth is being attacked by a species of alien called the Chitauri through a portal. The portal is positioned in the sky, directly above Stark Tower. There are giant monsters flying out of the portal, and superheroes clashing with them. This scene looks completely real. I felt as if I was in New York and was being attacked by aliens. That's just how good and immersive the film was.<br/><br/>The second topic I'd like to hit would be the cast/acting. The acting was amazing. As listed above, the movie has a huge star cast; all of them being great actors/actresses. The script also allowed for the characters to act different than from what they normally do (i.e., Captain America antagonizes others, Hulk doesn't like to get involved in fights, etc.). These varieties of personalities are executed perfectly by the cast.<br/><br/>Now that I have covered the main positives, let's go over some negatives. The main problem I had with this movie is the time spent getting the Avengers to be...well...The Avengers. I feel that if Marvel wanted a more accurate title, they should have called it ""Assembling the Avengers."" Throughout most of the film, Nick Fury and Phil Coulson are trying to get the Avengers to work together as a team. They finally do agree to work together, but only after Phil Coulson, also know as the ""glue of the MCU,"" gets killed by Loki before the final battle goes down. At that point, we are an hour and thirty minutes into the movie, and have been ready for some good action for awhile, despite there have already been an epic fight between Iron Man and Thor.<br/><br/>Other than that, however, there weren't any negatives. This movie obviously has more yes's than no's. Overall, I would give this movie an A+, or a 10 out of 10."
"willcundallreview","8","0","2","3 January 2016"," A very fun ride
","Now this is how you do a summer blockbuster, the Avengers is a movie that not only throws you full blown special effects action and laughter, but actually a little emotion too and that makes all the difference. The story see's well the Avengers Assemble, bad things are coming toward the security of the globe and so S.H.I.E.L.D gather together superheroes and the like to come to try and come to the rescue. It may not sound like the best film through my explanation but believe me this is pretty epic as movies like this go, the film only goes to show that superhero movies can be great and that special effects don't always ruin a movie every time.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon directs this and writes this and hey does he do a good job, not only does he make it thrilling and fast, he also manages to let the movie never take itself completely seriously, the jokes here and there and fantastic. Whedon also manages as mentioned to create a film that has these impossible things on show and yet they don't just look stupid, I felt at first glance that this would look too over the top in the Sci-fi department but really they actually work very well all the gadgets etc. The action quota is thoroughly taken care of as well and yet again the fighting scenes have a little tinge of humour in there making this movie a whole host of things.<br/><br/>Of course with such a big film comes a big cast and this movie throws stars at you left right and centre including such names as Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson. To any person who has seen Marvel movies beforehand then you will know a lot of the cast, this movie is of course many other movies meeting on the same path. As the acting goes it is hard to really spot who stands out above the rest, everyone does a good job and no one lets the team down, I particularly liked Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man as he just breathes a lot of humour into this. I was never overly sure on the role of S.H.I.E.L.D in this and some of the cast who are in the organisation don't get the best lines exactly, Whedon does though manage to get Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to be pretty cool at times.<br/><br/>I think the special effects here are pretty nice, I mean come on the film's budget is huge but it's the way in which it looks that makes it feel different to other big blockbusters. Not only do we have movies coming together as one but we also see a film that uses effects on a huge scale and then also although having to use them a hell of a lot, still the movies does not suffer so badly. Films will never look quite right using effects but the Avengers goes a long way in making a movie that is huge on them and yet does not make it look ugly or something to condone as bad.<br/><br/>All in all the film is great, and I mean it, great fun, great acting and just some great thrills to be had. Marvel do seem to pump out movies everywhere and I am glad that the Avengers has not been lost in the massive whirlpool that is Marvel movies, it stands out because it's so big and epic and is definitely a memorable one. I would say this is one for the fans but I have no idea in truth, although I will say that I don't think many people can find a whole host of problems with this, it's a film that has been cared for and made in a way that is not just a little escapism and that is it, it's something you can watch again."
"lisafordeay","7","0","1","1 January 2016"," Surprisingly it was very good
","I seen this a few days ago on TV and I have never seen it before as I have the sequel on DVD so I said I might as well see what the original was all about. The film is about a group of superheros that are Hulk(Mark Ruffalo from 13 Going On 30),Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr from Only You),Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson from We Bought A Zoo),Captian America(Chris Evans who was the human torch in the original Fantastic Four films),Thor(Home & Away's Chris Hemsworth)and of course Hawkeye(played by Jeremy Renner)who are brought together to try and defeat Loki(Tom Hiddleston)who happens to be the god of mischief(yeah you know he was banished inside a Mask that was made into a film years ago with Jim Carrey yup thats Loki alright)and he of course is the brother of Thor(Hemsworth). So will our heroes save mankind and defeat Loki?<br/><br/>Bottom line I enjoyed this film,I liked how there was a cameo with Gwyneth Paltrow as Poppy Potts (the love interest of Iron Man Tony Stark),and Samuel L Jackson as the leader who is over The Avengers.The action sequences were great and my favourite characters have to be Iron Man and Hulk if there was a separate movie about these two characters I would definitely be watching it.As for the rest of the movie and cast its all pretty good too. Also watch out for the end of the post credits as the same guy who was in Age Of Ultron at the end of that movie also makes a cameo in this in the end(his a purple faced guy).

","I did like the idea of a movie that brought a bunch of familiar superheroes together, and to be fair they did a pretty good job of this.<br/><br/>Iron Man, Hawkeye, the Hulk, Thor, Loki, Captain America and Black Widow all get their fair share of screen time and they're all excellent. And there's some great moments of interaction. The fight between Thor and the Hulk was my personal favourite.<br/><br/>But unfortunately the story was second- rate: a bad guy brings an army to destroy the earth and the avengers can only stop him if they (wait for it)... work as a team.<br/><br/>Boring.<br/><br/>Worst of all, Loki was the bad guy. This is the 'trickster' of the Norse gods, a character who is just perfect for a complex, which-side-is-he-on storyline packed with plot twists, and instead they just make him head of an army of demons. It's a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Avengers Assemble is plenty of fun to watch but it's not the great movie it might have been."
"hawaiipierson","10","0","2","17 December 2015"," We're not a team. We're a time bomb.
","To describe this in one word it would be incredibly difficult, but if I had to I would choose superb. The acting in this movie is phenomenal, the characters are amazing and full of depth, and this is absolutely stunning. In addition to that the story progression is amazing, from seeing all of the heroes in disagreement in the beginning to bringing them all together in an epic conclusion to save the world from Loki, I just am without words. It is everything you could ever want from a super hero movie. From the perfect blend of screen time for every character to so many great on liners and humorous moments, I left the theater jumping with joy. And the puny god moment had everyone in the theaters rolling; along with just about every time Robert Downey Jr. opened his mouth. This is just gold. Oh, and back to the alien fight at the end. Joss Whedon's choice of slowly panning around the battlefield showing every single hero fighting through the seemingly unbeatable threat, made me feel like I was truly watching a comic book. From the interactions to the CGI love I give this a 10 out o 10. ""There is no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top! Maybe your army will come, maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it!"" ‚ÄìTony Stark"
"C22Man","5","0","2","23 November 2015"," Succeeds on star power alone
","In a way it felt like most of Marvel's superhero films up until 2012, with the exception of Iron Man, were in part a build-up to an eventual Avengers film. This mainly being down to little details or minor plot points spread throughout the films, so with all this build-up a lot was riding on Avengers Assemble providing what was expected. I'd say that Avengers Assemble succeeds on star power alone. When you've waited for so long to see so many icon heroes all on screen together and when you have such an entertaining cast pulling the strings it's hard not to get carried away with enjoyment. It certainly has its problems, but as far as sheer entertainment is concerned it prospers.<br/><br/>Story: Norse God Loki returns to Earth and steals a tesseract from Shield, which he plans to use to open a portal and bring an alien army to take over the world. Head of Shield Nick Fury initiates a plan to form a superhero team made up of those he's previously contacted and they become the only hope in stopping the invasion. As far as the plot is concerned it is equally absurd and predictable, there's no big twists and a lot of it does stick to some already well-worn clich√©s. With that said it is a blast to see all the heroes together at last, there squabbles are frequently very funny and seeing them fighting side by side always is exciting.<br/><br/>Heroes: The film manages to balance out all the big personalities rather well, yet there are two standouts. Robert Downey Jr. is once again a magnetic and hilarious screen presence, offering many brilliant lines and that well placed sardonic attitude. Mark Ruffalo is simply fantastic as an awkward and edgy Bruce Banner, balancing out all aspects of the character excellently and as the Hulk he manages to get some unexpected laughs. Though both underused, Chris Evans is solid as the stern Captain America and Chris Hemsworth gets enough to do as a slightly more conflicted Thor.<br/><br/>Villains: Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and brings more energy to the role than previously. Loki certainly seems more weary and ruthless than before which works well in making him seem like a major threat, while Hiddleston manages to makes the character even more volatile and his delivery makes each line imposing.<br/><br/>Support: Black Widow and Hawkeye act more as back-up to the team, with both being decent enough. Scarlett Johansson looks fantastic in the part and convinces as an all action heroine, but she struggles with some of the weightier dialogue. Jeremy Renner is simply okay as expert archer Hawkeye and he does look the part, but he is given little development and comes off as a bit boring. Samuel L. Jackson is great as usual with more to do this time around as Fury, always believable as a commanding presence and giving the dialogue a spark.<br/><br/>Action: The action sequences are all very entertaining in a larger than life kind of way. The Avengers physically fight amongst themselves with the fights between the Hulk and Thor being as well as the Hulk and Iron Man being a lot of fun. The large scale fight on the aircraft carrier is exciting as well as varied and it's nice to see all the Avengers in battle. The climax is as extravagant as you would expect with lots of immense action set pieces and it is thrilling to see all the characters work together, though it definitely drags on a little too much and at times feels like action overload.<br/><br/>Music: Alan Silvestri provides an effective and suitably upbeat score. The main theme itself is simply superb in managing to create a sense of importance and excitement. Elsewhere Silvestri gives the action scenes a pounding backdrop and crafts some good melodies.<br/><br/>Production: On a certain level Joss Whedon does a successful job given the amount of work he had to do fitting in all the characters and making it work. He knows how to keep the action gripping and when to simply give the actors some room to breathe, while the visuals are injected with enough style and energy to make it work. On the other hand I don't think the dialogue is that great unless its Downey Jr. saying it or it's used for comedic purposes. Most of the important lines feel forced, simplified or just clich√©d which is credit to the actors for making it plausible. I think that most of the problems lie with the story, in that it's too straight-forward as to what's going to happen and how thing will pan out. Of course this lets the characters drive the plot a bit more, yet many of them just aren't given sufficient things to do. There is definitely an over-reliance on CGI here as well. Though you'd expect that given the massive action scenes and most of it looks good, it does take you out of the film and that is very apparent during the climax. <br/><br/>Conclusion: On a purely entertainment based scale Avengers Assemble succeeds thanks to sheer excitement, big thrills and funny interactions between our heroes. The lighter tone works greatly in the films favour, while we also have plenty of cool fight scenes, an enjoyable villain and good performances, especially those of Downey Jr. and Ruffalo. However once you start thinking about the plot it's the predictability that harms the film and I'd have enjoyed more risks even if they weren't fully realised, whilst there is too much action on the whole. So at a surface level Avengers Assemble is easy to enjoy and have fun watching, just don't think about it for too long."

This movie is a lot of fun, especially if you like action. It's a roller-coaster from beginning till the end, and the story is not too shabby, either.

","Like a true Avenger, this movie's greatest strength is also its weakness: its light-hearted and playful tone makes for some fun moments, but they also rob this film of any real depth, emotion or suspense. While Marvel movies are good at being fun to watch with their bright action sequences and lively banter between characters (even during what is supposed to be heated battle), at a certain point it gets old. Throughout the film there is no doubt the Avengers will defeat Ultron, so the interest then lies in how they will defeat him, and the answer is a disappointing ""they simply over power him."" If you enjoy this Marvel series where the villains emerge with no real interesting motive and are beaten at the drop of a hat, then of course this movie is a must see. I'm just holding out hope that Marvel takes more risks in their future films."

It develops a nice sense of fun and excitement.<br/><br/>Average: 1. The acting and music were fine but nothing special.<br/><br/>Cons: 1. Loki is an underwhelming villain (although often amusing). 2. The movie starts slow. 3. Some of the dialogue is pretty hokey (especially Fury's). 4. It lacks emotional impact or deeper meaning. 5. There are some dodgy plot holes. 6. It's not very original.<br/><br/>Similarities to Transformers 3 (speaking of ""not very original""): 1. There are giant alien metal monsters smashing through buildings. 2. A portal is opened to another world from a tall building. 3. An alien army swarms in through this portal. 4. The good guys desperately try to close this portal. 5. There are evil flying, shooting, futuristic things. 6. A good guy steals one of these evil flying, shooting, futuristic things and uses it for good. 7. We see New York in a mess (cars upside down or on fire, dust and shrapnel everywhere, people screaming and running).<br/><br/>In summary: The Avengers is impressive in the way it manages to hold itself together. Usually this many characters would be a guarantee of an awful movie. But here, somehow, all the heroes are given their chance to shine and it works pretty well. But far out, Michael Bay should probably be filing a lawsuit..."

","Director Fury pulled finally together some heroic egos to face the threat of alien invasion. There were a lot of high octane scenes. The legendary Avengers had to fight themselves before defeating the enemy. Inter-Avenger fights resolved into mutual respect. New York City got destructively made over during the final scene. Agent Romanov and Iron Man made the most consistent protagonists. Captain America was torn between taking orders and trusting his Avengers. Thor played along, after some physical persuasion from Iron Man and Captain America, to deliver Asgardian justice against the evil Loki. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner started becoming a good team though Thor had to save Agent Romanov from the Hulk's confused rage. Persistence and selflessness finally prevailed over alien corruption and paralytic human fear."

","What can be said about the Avengers that can't be summed up by the poster? In case you've been living in another dimension, the past, or with the gods, you must have noticed that all the most recent Marvel films have been running side by side, setting the scene from something bigger. And this is it.<br/><br/>The Avengers sees superheroes: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Nick Fury come together to fight Thor's nasty brother - fellow God Loki.<br/><br/>Just check the poster and promotional art out to see whether you think you'll like it. It's big, it's bold, it's explosive, it's special effects-laden and everything you've come to expect from a summer blockbuster. Apart from the fact that most summer blockbusters are simply special effects and a costly cinema admission. The Avengers is actually pretty damn good.<br/><br/>The Avengers was released in the same years as Batman: The Dark Knight Rises and many people wondered whether there would be enough room for two such giant superhero movies. I would say yes, largely down to them being such different types of film. The Dark Knight is...well, much darker. It's not so brash and loud as the Avengers. Perhaps The Dark Knight is 'the thinking man's superhero movie?' Either way, if you want dark, moody and deep, Christopher Nolen's Batman will probably fit the bill. However, if you just want some pretty wicked action, great set-pieces and a bunch of people with superpowers knocking lumps out of each other in silly suits then delivering a witty quip or two, then The Avengers should keep you entertained for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>People have argued that the superheroes don't receive equal screen time. Well, they nearly do, but you have to expect that Robert Downey Jr gets a little more screen time than his counterparts due to him being the biggest star in the film. But that should be a minor gripe.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you liked any of the previous Marvel superhero movies that this film is based on, then you will probably like this one.<br/><br/>But, like I mentioned in the title, I'm guessing it will appeal mainly to young boys (or men like me who are still young boys at heart - and it has nothing to do with Scarlett Johannson in her catsuit... honest)."

All characters are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lot, prone to an almost genetically determined urge to mess things up. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or playing by the rules (talking about you, Thor!). The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

"schmolly94","7","0","1","17 February 2014"," The new team of Avengers are assembled in order to defeat the villain Loki so he does not destroy the planet.
","Marvels The Avengers, or commonly known as The Avengers is an action packed film based on a combination of a series of superhero movies that were all produced by Marvels. The Avengers are an assembly of heroes including Ironman played by Robert Downey Jr., Thor played by Chris Hemsworth, The Incredible Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, and Captain America played by Chris Evans. After an unexpected enemy begins to threaten the security of the world, Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, and his partner, played by Scarlett Johansson, gathers these heroes in order to try to provide peace from the enemy and save the world from crumbling. Though this movie was slow to develop and seemed to drag on at parts through the introduction, the action picks up as the movie proceeds with a well-developed cohesion of parts by the conclusion of the film.<br/><br/>The introduction to this movie developed at a seemingly never ending pace. I did not agree with how it seemed to drag out but I sympathize with the director. This had to be done though in order to portray the plot of uniting these heroes and showing the initial skirmishes of the heroes as they met each other. <br/><br/>As the heroes began to get along and unite as a team, the development of the film began to become more tightly knit. The characters grew together, starting as people who barely knew each other to fighting side by side against their enemy. With the combination of all the well-known actors in this movie, no one seemed to steal the show or become power hungry for the leading role in the movie. As the film developed, all of the actors sunk into their roles and adapted to their part and the other parts around them gracefully. <br/><br/>The cohesion of the film was as well-developed and original as it could be. The Ironman series, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor have already been produced as films by Marvel and in comic books in previous years. This led to a unique and different production by taking all those different films and seamlessly integrated them into one piece. This made for an action based film with the right amount of humor to make it amusing and appealing to the audience.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the setting in the film also added to the cohesion of the piece as a whole. The setting was based out of Cleveland but was made to represent New York, with Stark's tower set up to be in the center of the New York City skyline. The real credit should be given to the cinematography of the film which made the film come alive. We as the audience feel like we are right there fighting side by side with the heroes, helping to take down the enemy at hand. <br/><br/>In its entirety this piece really captured my attention and left me waiting for more after every scene. Although this film seemed to drag on at the beginning, it ended up being well developed and action packed which kept me wanting more. Along with the cohesion of this piece came a quite original development as the director meshed the different parts and characters together. This allowed them to fight alongside each other to try to save the world from destruction. You will have to watch to find out what happens as the fate of the world is left up to the new team of Avengers."

","Its rare that a movie is able to not only live up to it's hype but actually exceed it.Avengers matches the hype surrounded by it and then blows it away. This huge scale superhero movie set the bar astronomically high for all other action movies, none of which have come close to attaining that height since.<br/><br/>The Avengers pulled together arguably the greatest cast ever to share the screen. Not only was this an incredible feat based on the actors and actresses, but the characters themselves. Many worried how the movie would stay balanced and give each character their dues but director Joss Whedon proved it was possible.<br/><br/>I wont get into the plot much as it's been explained numerous times, and honestly you should watch regardless of what the plot is. But with that said, the movie centers around a group of superheros brought together to stop an evil force, Loki, and his evil plans. The movie explores the dynamics of all the characters working as a team and how they pull together to extinguish Loki's catastrophic plan.<br/><br/>The most intriguing part of the movie, aside from the fight scenes, are the character dynamics. Joss Whedon does such a good job making the banter and interactions between these superheros feel real. The snide remarks and off comments felt genuine. Complement to all the actors involved who took this dialog and delivered. The movie is endlessly quotable and everyone will find a character than can truly enjoy.<br/><br/>Speaking of the fight scenes, they were absolutely fantastic. The battles were large scale fought between numerous superheros and army's of bad guys. There was carnage throughout and it was a sight to behold. There are even times when there is a little in fighting amongst the Avengers and it's quite a treat.<br/><br/>The Avengers was a case of every single person doing their job and doing it at the highest standard. Whedon with his direction, Downey Jr. with his cocky demeanor, and Hemmsworth with his Goldiness. Even Mark Ruffalo stepped in a filled in the Hulk's shoes nicely. I could go on and on about each actor's brilliance but just trust me when I say, EVERYONE was excellent.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the Avenegers, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!"

"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","0","4","26 June 2013"," A delightfully enthralling blockbuster that beats all the Marvel films put together so far. It's unfortunate that it doesn't work on rewatch.
","Now, the problem with a film such as The Avengers aka Avengers Assemble aka Marvel's Spectacular Avengers Spectacle! is that it can only be compared to its predecessors and can not be a pure fresh story. It does indeed, have cracks in its foundations, with the decent Iron Man and Captain America and mediocre Iron Man 2 and Thor. But The Avengers is as great as it could be. The main factors that makes it stand above those rushed charmless creations is its genuine heart pumped in by Joss Whedon.<br/><br/>It has a genuine tension, something that was dramatically lacking in the other films based on the mere concept that they were setup films for this blockbuster, therefore the protagonists nor throwaway side characters simply could not be in any meaningful peril, despite that being what the action films were about. In The Avengers, the characters (or egos) can barely stand to be in the same room with each other for too long without the chemistry exploding. As it has multi- protagonist stories, it opens the opportunity for there to be a real chance of one of the characters being in mortal danger without being contrived, and that is pretty much expected from Whedon's trademarks.<br/><br/>The heart of the film lies mostly in Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, as it develops Stark as a human being in very brief sequences, though of course his classic punchlines are a particular highlight, but The Avengers paints the Hulk as the secret ultimate weapon, which is a difficult task as the terrible Hulk (2003) and equally awful The Incredible Hulk (2008) struggled to portray the scale of his power. He certainly steals the scenes that Stark doesn't. I saw in in 3D so it was a particularly intimate experience - there are some amazing goose-bump worthy shots of the superheroes all together - but it made it sometimes confusing as the effect doesn't work well with closeups of action, especially as it distracted from the science jargon thrown around by Stark and Banner, rendering some of the scenes hard to follow, but it didn't matter in the end.<br/><br/>It's still astounding in how Whedon crammed everything in, despite the 142 minute running time, of which it had a comparable pace to The Dark Knight in the scale of the sequences. It was incredibly satisfying and creative by the end. However, the series may struggle as they don't have the benefit of having equally famous villains as Batman and Spiderman have. I don't think I have the patience to watch the sequels to the rest of the Avenger films just to keep up with the characters, but it really does depend on the writer and director, as I didn't like Thor and Loki in their own films but enjoyed their relationship here. Nevertheless, The Avengers is the perfect summer blockbuster; intelligent, witty and action-packed. And I wanna see it again already.<br/><br/>Update: I did. And it lost most of the shine that charmed me. Still entertaining but just not the same.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I'm a long time Marvel comic reader and know the superheroes in the Avengers quite extensively. Hulk being my number one read and the Avengers in my top 10. <br/><br/>This movie was well made with loads of entertainment possibly to capture all audience members who have very little to no knowledge of Marvel comics. If I was to walk into this movie without knowing anything about Marvel comics, I would have been thoroughly entertained. <br/><br/>The computer generation was fantastic. Visual effects were stunning.

These light moments were well placed at the proper scenes. <br/><br/>That being said, to add just a couple complaints as a die hard Marvel fan, here is how Marvel could have made this a better movie and future movies. <br/><br/>1. Loki, there could have been a more original villain. Regurgitating an old foe from the Thor <br/><br/>film was lame. There is so many choices that could have been used. <br/><br/>2. Thus speaking of Thor, this is not the real Thor. I didn't like the Thor film and I certainly <br/><br/>would not give it the votes I give the Avengers. Thor in the comic book was much bigger <br/><br/>and possessed more power and abilities. I think Marvel should have used CGI technology<br/><br/>with Thor's character instead of using a real life actor. They did a great job with Hulk, so <br/><br/>why not make Thor with a awesome physique and structure? <br/><br/>Another little thing to notice, actually my wife did, is Scarlett Johansson. The scenes where she is running is hilarious. I think she should have practised those scenes better, because she looks like she just discovered her legs and their movement. <br/><br/>Other than that, it was an excellent movie. Since I am a huge Hulk fan, I'm glad they gave the spotlight to him with a multitude of scenes."

","There is plenty of action to be seen when you watch The Avengers. After watching all the stories of how the other comic book heroes became who they are, it is unbelievable to see that they all came together to become a team, even though they did not agree with each other at first. It is like a dream come true to all those people that had high hopes of all the characters combining their powers to stop one great, yet evil mind, Loki, the tall thin and brunette Tom Hiddleston, also brother of Thor, the brute blonde played by Chris Hemsworth. Joss Whedon did a great job directing the movie, and even though I did not read the comics, the storyline was spot on, showing that there is no I in team¬Ö or Avengers.<br/><br/>It was pretty interesting watching all the heroes clash before they became a team, because it reminded me of a fighting game, where you pick your fighters and choose the map they battle on. While time was wasting, they finally became a team. Tony Stark, or Ironman, played by none other than Robert Downey Jr., and Doctor Bruce Banner, or Incredible Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, which could have been played better by the original Edward Norton or Lou Ferrigno, have to locate the Tesseract, the crystal Loki needed to get revenge on Thor by letting the Chitauri distract the Avengers so he could take over Asgard. I thought it was interesting how they used the different characters to acquire different information. I believe this was showing that even though you have your differences, there are other things out there to worry about than seeing who is better.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon gave all the characters a specific role in the movie, which was good because nobody was really left out. Of course Ironman thought he was better than everyone else, and believed that everything revolved around his smarts and his work. He smartly remarked to Captain America in the previews that even without the suit, he was a Billionaire Philanthropist, and that Chris Evans was just an old experiment, that was frozen for 70 years. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to me were like spies in the movie, even though Hawkeye was ""possessed"" half the film. The roles played out great, and the movie had its dramatic moments.<br/><br/>I was hoping that this movie was going to better than what I was imagining, which it was. I figured maybe it was going to be cheesy, even though the previews had me chuckling, but at the same time I was left with suspense. I really hate when they leave hints throughout the movie as to what to look forward to in the sequels, but that is how media makes their money. The Avengers was a great movie."

","Team of a Lifetime The Avengers is not just a film- it is a well thought out story. However, the background of Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man 2, are almost mandatory prior to watching, or The Avengers will make no sense, and possibly bore you to death. The combination of five different films, introducing us to different characters and stories, turns this movie into reality. Throughout the different Marvel films, there was question to whether the writer/director, Joss Whedon, was going to follow through with his previous productions and deliver a film that lives up to the fans' expectations.<br/><br/>The Avengers is, without a doubt, classified as a science fiction movie filled with countless amounts of action and comic book references. The Avengers is made up of an assortment of intense music, ambitious characters, fast-paced plotting, special effects, rivalry between the hero and villain, and suspense. According to Marvel fans, this movie, by far, sky rockets their expectations.<br/><br/>The complex movie begins with Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, all teaming up and creating the Super Hero team of a lifetime. When an unexpected enemy emerges and threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, the director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D, finds himself in need of a phenomenal team to save the world from disaster. Therefore, a daring span of recruitment begins. However, once brought together, the Avengers struggle to trust each other and work as a team. Meanwhile, in previous movies the super heroes were forced to work individually. Therefore, the film's theme arises when the outsiders start to realize that by using their outstanding super powers and working as a team, they are capable of becoming something great, and in this case capable of saving the world from Thor's adopted brother, Loki. Loki has characterizes of each superhero he is facing; therefore, it takes the teamwork of each superhero to defeat the Loki.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to focus solely on the positives when negatives do exist in The Avengers. It seems as though Joss Whedon focused more on the battles and special effects in the movie, then on the actual background and explanation of defining the characters. Without the additional background of the prior films, The Avengers seems to be confusing. The two and a half hour movie almost needed to be stretched out to a three hour movie in order to include all of the important background information to get the movie off to a better start, and to make more sense to viewers who have not seen the background films. Besides, with the lack of character explanation, the film has a rushed feeling, and can become rather confusing."

","Getting to Know The Avengers<br/><br/>Marvel's Avengers brings together many big names in the comic book world. Six gifted protagonists ‚Äì Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Dr. Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), set out to battle one sole antagonist, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army. The movie gives each character their shining moments, keeping it from focusing solely on a certain character. It is your typical action packed family movie that everyone can enjoy.<br/><br/>For someone who hasn't seen every Marvel movie that has come out in the last couple years, the movie makes it a little difficult to recognize all of the characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye. However, without knowing all of the characters the plot remains easy to follow. Loki is the villain and S.H.E.I.L.D. isn't going down without a fight. S.H.E.I.L.D is briefly mentioned in some of the previous movies and is usually denied by the heroes. Each of heroes has to fight internal battles. They each have to get over working alone and try to work together. It's a very typical of the characters to not get along at first and then come together as a great team.<br/><br/>For almost the whole movie, the heroes keep you laughing like a typical family movie. Keeping the humor even in some of the more action packed parts of the movie can keep many of the non-comic fans interested in the movie. However, one huge weakness that the movie Avengers had was the comment that Thor made about Loki being adopted. It sets a negative light on adopted children, labeling him a tyrant because of it. <br/><br/>Another weakness I felt the movie has is that The Avengers were so easily manipulated by Loki. In their team they have two of the greatest minds of their generation working together, and they still didn't get that Loki was using them for his personal gain. How does one villain manage to overtake six, highly talented and well trained ""super heroes""?<br/><br/>I hadn't seen Thor or The Hulk when I first watched The Avengers. I had no clue what I was really going to be stepping into when I purchased my movie ticket. I was worried I wouldn't know half the heroes and I definitely didn't know the villain. Thankfully the plot was easy to follow and light was shined enough on each of the characters to give me, at least, a light grasp on who the heroes were.<br/><br/>This movie was really fun to watch for the first time. It was a little long but it kept my attention throughout the whole film. I feel like more of the heroes personalities could have been shown more, but in that case the movie would have been too long. Iron Mans witty banter was hilarious as always as well as Loki's. The Avengers is a film worth watching at least once, as long as you have seen the other marvel movies."

","I do not follow the Marvel comic empire's characters all that much but I really enjoyed this movie. It seemed a little over the top until I remembered it is all nothing but movie make believe. The stealth cloaked, VTOL air ship was kind of cool and the special effects were, what can I say, special. I was a little put off with the Samuel Jackson portrayal of Nick Fury. His character was cold, standoffish, and a using, manipulative boss. The manipulation he used to bring the Avengers together with the death of the nerd was necessary but theatrical. Of course it would work because it was in the script:) :) The over all acting was very good if basic. I tend to think we see a large part of the real Robert Downey Jr. in his role of Ironman. While he is a gifted actor when he tries I do think he is a bit of an egomaniac and the Stark character fits him well."

","I know that the one Billion Dollar and a half income causes dizziness, even for me! But who said that the highest-grossing movies of all times should be the best movies ever made?!<br/><br/>No doubt that Marvel Studios has done it, with the right ambition, order and budget. In 5 years plan, the release of 5 movies; The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and a calculated connection between all of them; they made a good foreword for this dramatic climax, which turned into a financial climax for Marvel itself, their plan, and the superhero movie in general. But, was it that good?!<br/><br/>It's good as a huge sci-fi action. Joss Whedon's love for the Marvel world did marvel! As a scriptwriter / director, he interweaved the heroes' story lines well, filled the movie with the ultimate action he could get, and made fair time on screen. Actually, the movie is made of fun.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron man stole the show, not merely because his power as an actor, but originally because his star-power which guaranteed him the bigger role, the best one-liners, and the heroic situation at the climax. Captain America was the weakest in powers amongst the rest, but that was compensated finely by making him the planner wise brain of the bunch.<br/><br/>I loved the formula of hot action always followed by funny one-liner. What I loved more was writing a motive for the movie's evil guy. Loki's speech about wanting desperately to be a king did satisfy something I used, since my childhood, to not see it satisfied in 99, 999 % of the American action movies!<br/><br/>The visual / sonic extravaganza was well-made. All the explosions, sound effects, etc.. dazzled perfectly. However, what merits the real praise should be the editing. Kudos to the editors of this movie, they managed brilliantly to cut the material reasonably and enjoyably. The movie didn't turn into crazy hurly-burly at any time. That's a big victory to be proud of, putting in mind the majority of the action flicks we get from Hollywood lately.<br/><br/>And the cameo of Stan Lee is welcomed as ever. For one reason he's funny and ironically used, and for another it's loyal and honorary to have him around. Age lengthened with the 90 year old Marvel Comics writer to witness his creation as movies, and yet be part of it too.<br/><br/>But, on the other hand, certain characters weren't up to the rest, and yes, I mean Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye. They could have been fit for another movie instead (a regular spy movie for the first). Still the shot in which the camera rolls around all The Avengers while the end's fight makes me laugh, especially when I see Natasha holding her little gun as if a peer to the superpowers and super dangers around her!!<br/><br/>The plot permits some bugging questions to be asked. For instance; what was Loki's plan while being on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier? He didn't use the Hulk's anger as he intended to do! The problem of the Hulk wasn't clearly explored. I couldn't understand what was the matter of ""the point is, I'm always angry""!! And why he got blindly furious on the carrier, then ""Hello"", he's fighting for the good side at the end!? Loki's army wasn't that threatening, only some bizarre enough goons to be killed later without any particularity. The way Dr. Erik Selvig and Hawkeye awake of Loki's charm is truly laughable (just a good hit on the head!!).<br/><br/>Pace-wise, I thought that between the end of the second act (Loki's escape from S.H.I.E.L.D) and the start of the third act (Loki's attack on New York City) there was something missing; like some events were rushed. Yet, the main shortcoming has to be the matter of lacking the inner motives. I know that Earth is at risk, and Agent Phil Coulson is killed, but the lead characters didn't have personal issues to overstep, which didn't add any ""dramatic deepness"" to the mix.<br/><br/>This is Marvell's promised ritzy festival, and it works, gathering all the audiences of the previous 5 movies, and the readers of the original comics behind them. I love it as fun summer blockbuster, with no thoughts allowed. I even long for part 2 and 3. But, to tell you the truth, while movies like Avatar, Titanic, The Avengers, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon are on the top of the highest-grossing movies of all time right now, I long to the day where not a ""summer blockbuster"" will join the list, and - why not - be its number 1. I believe that someday the people will get enough of the summer blockbusters, and go on a pilgrimage to something else, something more serious and less flawed, something that talks to the mind and the heart, more than the ear and the eye. Ahh, when will the ordinary people become better than the superheroes?!"

","Josh Whedon's The Avengers is by far, the best super hero movie ever. Two and a half hours of this action packed thriller will leave you wanting even more. The hero's need no build up they have all been introduced in the previous marvel films and we are able to jump right into the main story. Personally the part that makes this film the best of its genre is that unlike all the movies that came before, it takes place during the day in bright and vibrant locations. The Cgi does an amazing job and we are no longer stuck in night time brawls.<br/><br/>We are thrust right into the action with Thor's brother Loki in a strange realm hosted by the dark leader of the Chitauri who promises him the aid of an alien army in exchange for securing the Tesseract. Armed with a new weapon that can fire energy and take over your mind, Loki heads to earth. With earth helpless the avengers must be formed, a team of super hero's ready to save the day. It's great that all the heroes have been introduced and we are left wondering how all these huge personalities will mesh together. We've gotten to know Tony Stark, the outdated Captain America, mighty Thor, provoking Black Widow, the perfectionist Hawk eye and the whole monstrosity that is the Hulk. Avenger's does a great job in showing how all these heroes befriend one another because of their interactions. But before earth's new team of heroes can find their balance, Loki is in their heads causing anger and conflicts.<br/><br/>For all of the crazy battles and action, the best moments are the slower scenes that develop the characters bonds. From the Hulk giving a ""pat"" on the back of Thor or Tony Stark and Dr. Banner talking in scientific terms that nobody else understands. It gives this sense that the interactions are true and lets us relate to them even if or not a fan of the series. Not to mention the unexpected humor in the best of times giving us as viewers a kind of relief from the non-stop action.<br/><br/>Now for the downsides, though only few the story is very predictable in terms of its plot and you're really never left wondering ""what's next?"" but, just whens the next explosion. Also the film seems like more of a TV show then a movie. But overall this movie is the best of the best when it comes to super hero movies."

","Now, I'm no expert on criticizing the film industry but if I do say so myself, The Avengers was an excellent movie. I have not been one known to read comic books, so I have no experience to judge whether the film stays true to the graphic novels. There are many factors that I consider when reviewing a movie. I look at the acting quality, how it compares to similar movies in the same genre, the plot line, and also the special effects quality. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the acting quality was superb. Each character had their own unique qualities about them and I believe that the actors portrayed those characteristics to the best of their abilities. Robert Downy Jr. played Tony Stark/Iron Man and his character was very intelligent, but also very conceited and egotistical. Robert Downy Jr. gave his character a sense of humor which kept our hearts at ease at the most dramatic moments. I believe Mr. Stark was the comic relief in this movie and kept the movie alive with comedy. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers/Captain America, who is a man from a different era. His confusion but loyalty to America reminds us of the patriotism we should feel as Americans. Although his confusion is a fault for himself, it always is another comic relief for the audience. Mark Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner/the Hulk. His ability to stay calm and relaxed is inspiring to the viewers but when he loses the ability, it creates an intense moment that keeps the audience members on the edge of their seats. There are many other characters in the movie but that was just to name a few. <br/><br/>Next, I would like to take a look at how this film compares to the other films in this genre. In comparison to the other Marvel movies I do believe this was the best. Not only was it jam-packed with action and thrills, but it also included many other the other Marvel characters. I like how this movie intertwined the characters from the different movies and formed them into one. The way the director, Joss Whedon, explained how important teamwork is and how it's valued is inspiring to people of all ages. Also, in comparison to other movies outside of the Marvel Company, Star Trek might have some competition when it comes to The Avengers. Although, the two films have similar qualities I feel that The Avengers takes the cake on this one. In favor of Star Trek, the film had a romance aspect that is more appealing to the female population and The Avenger did not entirely portray a love plot line in the film. <br/><br/>I was very impressed with the special effects quality of The Avengers. The way they presented the superpowers of each hero was unbelievable. Also, the fight scene towards the end of the movie and how the aliens were entering the portal through the sky was astonishing. The special effects in this film looked and felt so real to the audience, which makes this film more enjoyable because it showed something that we could imagine being real. All in all, this film had excellent qualities that defined is as a must see! I am anxiously and impatiently waiting for the sequel!"

","Since Iron Man and the post-credits scene of The Incredible Hulk, we were infatuated with the idea of Earth's Mightiest Hero's assembling onto the big screen. As more Marvel movies featuring the members of The Avengers as main characters in their own self-titled movies were released, more hints towards an Avengers movie came out. Foreshadowing events such as Agent Phil Coulsen talking to Pepper Potts about S.H.I.E.L.D., or Captain America being found in the ice after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger. Such hints kept people in suspense until it was finally announced that there would be a Marvel's The Avengers movie.<br/><br/>The choice of Joss Whedon as director could not have been a better fit. Half of this movie is centered on the character interaction, and anybody who has followed shows such as Firefly or Buffy the Vampire Slayer knows that Whedon can exploit the dynamics of a team, as well as the volatile components that come with putting a group of people together with different attitudes and viewpoints. Scenes such as the arguments that members of The Avengers get into aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier are just as entertaining as when they are on the streets of New York fighting Loki and the Chitauri.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I feel that this movie was so successful is that Joss Whedon did not try and tie a stupid love story into it. Other than the established relationship between Black Widow and Hawkeye, there is no mushy love dynamic to the plot. This helps give more screen-time for things such as inter-colleague fighting, like that of Thor vs. The Hulk. The only flaws with this movie is the inevitable under use of a character, in this case, it is Hawkeye. With a film like this, the only way to keep it from being four hours long is to cut out some scenes with some characters. Looks like Jeremy Renner drew the short straw on this one, after only making a cameo appearance in Thor. Also, the plot of the movie is pretty cut-and-dry. Loki wants to take over Earth and The Avengers must stop him. There isn't really much else to it.<br/><br/>However, I find that the amount of awesomeness packed into the battle scenes of this movie more than make up for this. From the two on one fight of Captain America and Iron Man vs. Thor, which levels part of a forest, to the Hulk thrashing Loki around the room, the action in this movie keeps a grin on your face. Whedon knew which fights could be epic, and he made them epic. He also demonstrates some of the more subtle abilities of The Avengers such as Hulk catching the pilot trying to bail out of his jet (a nod to the Hulk's super reflexes) or Captain America using his gymnastic skills to move across the damaged helicarrier.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has set the standard for the following Marvel movies, and the sequel hinted to at post-credits with Thanos and his evil grin. The bar is set high, and with movies such as Ant-Man and Captain America 2 coming out, it will be interesting to see where they take each members stories and set them up for the following Avengers movie."
"chloe-hanely","10","0","3","18 November 2012"," The Avengers Review
","Joss Whedon's ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a wonderfully crafted and delightfully surprising detour from the prevalent ""Super Hero blockbuster"" film formula. There has been constant chatter about an Avengers film for years among super hero fans, even long before the film was announced. Ever since Spiderman opened the door for film adaptations of the sizeable Marvel super hero roster. If the Marvel universe was going to be put to the screen, an Avengers film was an obvious choice for a finale (of sorts, there will almost certainly be sequels to ""The Avengers""). Film buffs and comic book gurus alike expressed growing uncertainty at the prospect somewhere around the time of the disappointing Spiderman 3 and Thor films, though Captain America and the Iron Man movies were almost unanimously well received. The hesitation was mostly due to the way recent super hero movies have been produced. Too often we were forced to acknowledge awkward pacing, convoluted and ineffective plot lines, excessive reliance on special effects, flat dialogue, and questionable camera work, to name a few complaints from a very long list. When it was announced that Whedon would be at the helm, many were reassured and anticipation grew.<br/><br/>It would seem Whedon was the perfect choice for this film. It's easy to see how poorly it could have been executed by a more pedestrian writer and director. The film plays to expectations and winks to fandom without being exhausting or pandering, while avoiding the clich√©s that drain the energy from other Marvel film outings. Whedon expertly avoids the ""grim"" trend yet does not venture into camp or goofiness, his tightrope act between genres and conventions is equally impressive as it is beneficial to the film. In a vague way he seems to capture the spirit of the comic book story arcs themselves, this is certainly not super heroes shoehorned into an action flick.<br/><br/>The large cast of characters is executed about as perfectly as possible. There is a fantastic on screen chemistry, particularly throughout the childish feuds between Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. The sharp contrasts in their personal beliefs about their powers and society are highlighted and displayed in a thought-provoking manner. Whedon's experience is evident, with the plot driving the characters rather than a mechanical rationing of camera time between each hero. A great example of this is how he utilizes the Incredible Hulk, a character that has been the bane of more than one director. Knowing we haven't seen the Hulk in action in a few years, and that we would be eager to see how he is managed in this new and more mature setting, Whedon doesn't reveal Bruce's maniacal alter-ego until roughly two-thirds into the film. And when he does, the pay off makes the buildup strategy a clearly superior choice. The villainous Loki is a fine nemesis in concept and is rendered successfully as dastardly and detestable. Whedon opted for a more light hearted and entertaining overall feel with none of the heavy handed forced philosophy, though there is a well-played theme of the need for cooperation. The theme carries over well and does justice to the concept of the Avengers: America's greatest minds and forces, with vastly different abilities and personalities, setting aside their differences and squabbles to save the world."

","Marvel has taken over the movie industry with their movies: the Hulk, Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America, Thor, and its most recent and greatest film, the Avengers. Despite the Avengers being one of the greatest films I have ever seen, it fails to establish a sense of character development. On the other hand, the Avengers has the greatest special effects of the century and does a great job of capturing a comic book feel while implementing real world issues.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the prior Marvel movies, you are a bit behind. In the Avengers, Joss Whedon expects you to know who the characters are. Its as if he expected comic book junkies to be the only ones watching this movie. Granted, the Avengers is a sequel to the prior movies but that is no excuse for having certain characters appear in prior Marvel movies and this one and not telling us anything about them. If you haven't seen the prior movies, you would know more about the disappearance of Natalie Holloway then you would the characters in this movie. I have seen the prior movies and I would have just as good a chance at passing a foreign language exam as I would at telling you three or more facts about the Black Widow and Hawkeye. If you do know the characters, or you can get over not knowing them, The Avengers is a very good movie. The special effects in the Avengers are the best of the century. Director Joss Whedon took all of the available technology and used it to his advantage. All of the effects are completely believable, which is tough to do considering they had to be able to do special effects for multiple characters. A prime example of special effects is the Hulk and his ability to smash things and kill people. If you have seen the prior Hulk movies you realize that they found the special effects to be very difficult. In the prior movie, made in the early 2000s, the special effects look as if they were from the early 90s. The special effects weren't the only way that The Avengers managed to recreate the comic book feel. Most of the dialog and actions of the characters were very comic book like. By this, I mean short and straight to the point. This is good for the movie because it brings it back to its original roots, the comic book. And if you're not a comic book fan, The Avengers is full of real world issues that provide a sense of connectivity to the people who aren't avid comic book fans. First, we see the issue of the military constantly trying to upgrade their weapons system. The American Military thought the Tesseract could help them upgrade their systems, which is why they had it in the first place. Second, the battle, a foreign war, takes place in New York. This seems to be a common battleground in movies and in real life. In the movie they are not fighting Iraq or Korea, they are fighting foreign creatures from another realm. Despite them not fighting another country, the idea of foreign war is still there. To build on this, we see the destruction of New York, which also happens to be the last city destroyed in real life. Last, but not least, is the idea of superheroes winning a war. In the movie (and every other superhero movie for that matter), we see the superheroes solve the minor problems, such as war. We never see superheroes solve the big picture problems, such as world hunger. Overall, The Avengers is a must see. Try to get past the poor character development and see that the special effects are amazing and that the movie, although not directly, relates to real world issues. If you do this, you will be thoroughly impressed with Whedon's work."
"j-andorka","Null","0","2","17 November 2012"," The Avengers is a well made movie for superhero fans.
","""The Avengers"" is an action packed film that was well made and has wonderful graphics and special effects. The plot was easy to follow and the story was not too complex. It was a very easy movie to relax and watch. Along with all the action in this film, there was also a sense of humor in the way of the interactions between characters. However, I was not personally a fan of this film. In order to understand the characters and relations among characters, the viewer has to have background knowledge of superheroes, and past superhero films. I have never seen any sort of superhero movie before so watching this film was not an enjoyable experience. While I enjoyed the graphics and action in this movie, it was very hard to follow and understand.<br/><br/>The main goal in this film was to protect and keep the Tesseract, a main source of power, safe. Near the beginning of the film, the Tessearct was taken by a villain named Loki and his army. Throughout the film the team of superheroes comprised of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow work together to get the Tesseract back in their hands to prevent a disaster. If the Tesseract fell into the wrong hands, it could cause great damage because of the amount of power it holds involving global security. The main plot of the story revolves around the superheroes working to get the Tesseract back from Loki. Loki and his army came from a different world in order to retrieve the Tesseract from the Avengers. The Avengers knew how important it was to keep the Tesseract in this world because of its immense power. Various conflicts occur throughout the film between the Avengers and Loki and his army. As the story comes to an end there is a very large battle between Loki's army and the Avengers. At the end of the film one of the sides ends up defeating the other and earns the Tesseract. <br/><br/>It was very hard to understand the relations among these characters and how they worked together based on their past because of the lack of character development. Without knowledge of these superheroes and their relationships, it was near to impossible to understand how they interacted with each other. I was very confused during one of the conflicts because Thor and the Hulk began to fight each other. I did not know that these two superheroes do not get along, so I was very confused as to why they were fighting each other instead of trying to win the Tesseract back. If the characters were more developed and explained in the rising action of the movie, I believe I would have enjoyed it much more. This movie is a wonderful choice for a viewer that is keen on their knowledge of different superheroes, but if the viewer does not know much about superheroes I would not recommend this movie."

","""The Avengers"" was a highly anticipated film. Something as epic as an ""all-star"" team of superheroes would be nothing less. Many, including myself, were doubtful that it could ever meet the high expectations. Still, millions of people perched in front of the big screen to watch it for the first time, and to many viewers' surprise, it surpassed expectations.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" is a glance in the bright direction that Marvel is walking. This film strings ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and ""Iron Man,"" together, along with several sequels. A fresh breathe from generic remakes and love stories. This film includes several witty remarks by self-acclaimed ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,"" Tony Stark, and the occasional physical humor that so many films attempt to do, but ""The Avengers"" blows out of the water.<br/><br/>Marvel's wide array of characters makes it hard not to relate to one. They range from the egotistical genius and the modest genius with a serious anger issue, to the old-fashioned war hero and god-alien, although the last one may not quite fall into the category ""relatable,"" it displays the creativity and thought put into these characters.<br/><br/>The casting in this movie simply couldn't have been done better. One may think that Robert Downey Jr. was made to play Iron Man, but many will say Iron Man was made to play Robert Downey Jr. If that doesn't say enough itself, the hard headed Nick Fury is played by the always brilliant Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans may make you believe he is actually a WWII veteran, Mark Ruffalo plays a mean Hulk even in comparison to Edward Norton, and that's only three. The list certainly goes on.<br/><br/>The storyline is hard to complain about. A battle between some of our favorite superheroes and an army of aliens is pretty exciting to say the least. Selfish intentions and lack of teamwork override the team until they are provided motivation through a though loss and they rally together. The seemingly perfect squad reveals it's insecurities throughout the film, making them all the more relatable to the audience. The ending battle is incredible. First time watchers are probably going to be wide-eyed for the entire scene. A heated battle with flickers of comedy and adrenaline pumping fight scenes could not have been made any more awesome.<br/><br/>If I had to make one complaint of this film, I would have to say the lines from the films are hits and misses, meaning sometimes they can be quite cheesy. It is a superhero movie and that may be expected, but ""We need a plan of attack"" ""I have a plan: attack"" made me chuckle and not necessarily in a good way. Another example resides in the same scene, where Captain America says ""There's only one God ma'am and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."" An additional complaint that can be made is the astonishing way that The Black Widow, who has no super powers, can jump off a spacecraft flying at high speeds and land safely, while stopping in a space of maybe 5 feet. But I suppose realism is not really the most desirable factor in a movie regarding a superhero-alien battle with gods and a flying aircraft carrier.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" is a classic film. I would never think ""The Dark Knight"" would have a film of its genre even come close for quite some time. For some, this film may surpass it. ""The Avengers"" promises to keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline and laughter flowing through your body."
"unit370","Null","0","2","16 November 2012"," How the new movie relates to the comic
","Avengers: Marvel At It's Best<br/><br/>The Avengers movie that came out this past summer was one of the best movies that has come out in the past few years. It was the much awaited superhero movie that would combine the movies of: Iron Man, Hulk, Captain American, and Thor. Although the Avengers was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time it was not perfect. The problem with most, if not all superhero movies is that there are so many different stories or universes; it is hard to pick which one to make the movie about. The Avengers movie proves this point by having different characters other than the ones that were in the original Avengers comic, which this movie is suppose to be about. The first team members of the Avengers consisted of the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and one that was not in the movie, Ant Man. The first Avengers comic was issued on September 10, 1963. Captain America does not even join the Avengers until the comic ""Avengers #4"" issued in March of 1964. The plot of the Avengers movie was great; it does a good job of blending the new age of comics with the old. The movie kept the same plot as the first comic book, with Loki being the main villain. The one difference is the time period of which the battle takes place. In the comic it takes place in the 1960's, which makes sense since that was the time period it was written in, while the movie took place in modern time. Joss Whedon did a great job in converting the old out dated form of the Avengers into the new time period. He did this by adding modern military weapons like the F-35, as well as adapting the whole story to modern times by adding in space travel, GPS, and better computers, just to name a few. The actors that played in the Avengers movie by Joss Whedon each played their character very well. The one actor that really played his part well was Robert Downey Jr. He played the part of Tony Stark extremely well. His character is self centered, has an extremely large ego, and to top it off, he looks almost exactly like the comic book character. Another character that I thought did great job in this movie was Mark Ruffalo, who played the Hulk as well as Bruce Banner. The Hulk has been in two other movies other than the Avengers, and both movies have had different actor's portray the Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one in the Avengers was by far the best one they have had. The way Ruffalo played Banner was extremely close to way he is portrayed in the comic books. Banner is a confident scientist who is not only looking for a cure, but is also using his knowledge to help society. Unlike the other movies that portrayed Banner as being a scared, and work obsessed scientist who is only focused on curing himself. In conclusion The Avengers movie was an amazing culmination of all of the Marvel movies they have made up to this point. The way the director interlocked the stories and different movies gave everyone who watched them background information on the various heroes as well as the villains. Although the time period that the movie took place was different than the comics, the director did a great job in carrying over the key aspects of the comic. I would by far recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies, superheroes movies, as well as comics."

","Joss Wheldon's ""The Avengers"" is a fusion of recent Marvel movies like Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and Captain America. Whether or not you have seen the movies parts wont make sense unless you're a Marvel fanatic. It's an action, comedy, sci-fi movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat but laughing at the same time. If you're anything like me, the movie will irritate you throughout. Knowing that it's a bunch of movies mixed in, I began to question myself if some characters I didn't recognize are in other movies like the black guy with the eye patch or the girl spy that seemed a little to porn star and her partner. If you were comic book reader you would know they were Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nick Fury. Loki is Thor's adopted brother who tries to take over the world and become the leader. I feel like Loki's thought that we have to much freedom is inaccurate. In America we are lucky but a lot of the world isn't as fortunate. Loki's idea to rule the world because of this is not thought through. The Avengers are sent out to stop him and his invading army. The production quality was successful. After watching the movie I was curious as to what was actually real in the movie and what was special affects. The distinction was seamless, unlike the production of Alien, which is what these aliens remind me of. I would recommend watching it at night because it is so dark at times it's almost impossible to see. On the other hand the acting in this movie was outstanding. When it comes to the plot, the creativity was good. The characters have the same personality as in their own movies but are mixed in with jointly in such a way that the characters play off each other. It involves examples of real life human emotions, rationality and faults but is done in a premature way. I feel like the conflicts between the team are silly and felt unreal. This movie has many clich√©s in it. For example, why does the epidemic always seem to happen in NYC? Why do our leaders feel the need to bomb every place that they can't deal with? Why do the characters always have to argue and then make up at the end? Why does the Hulk never talk until the end? In conclusion the Movie was an overall success. The production quality was amazing along with the acting. The movie was very entertaining and well done. Along with almost every movie there is something that everyone doesn't like."

","Third highest grossing movie of all-time is none other than the avengers. Now The Avengers is the ultimate popcorn, get all your buddies, Friday night kind of movie. Each character had a distinctive personality and I liked seeing them clash with one another. You're not going to see this as, ""Oh I'm Captain America. Oh I'm the Incredible Hulk. I'm Thor. Hey we just met each other let's go fight evil together."" No, their personalities clash and you really see the characters building relations, arguing, and overall interactions amongst each other.<br/><br/>The Avengers is a great adaption of marvel's famous comic books. Starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers/Captain America, Mark Garofolo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlet Johansson as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as agent Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick fury, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Colston, Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Erick Selvic, and I think I've hit all of the high notes, those are the most important people in the movie, at any rate. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), you knew exactly what to expect from him and his character due to his starring roles in the two previous Iron Man movies, he still delivers. Captain America/Tony Stark/Chris Evans, again you can kind of know what to expect from his previous film, but there are some changes to his character, because he is now a man 70 years out of his time, this dude is suffering from the worst case of culture shock ever, and he manages to get that across. I was actually fairly impressed with that. He is moodier than he was from the first captain America movie, which is to be expected because everything he knows is just gone. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, again you kind of know what to expect as there has been a Thor movie. He did manage to portray the changes in Thor's character because honestly this guy has suffered some pretty hard blows in the last couple years, and he's more thoughtful more introspective, not nearly as arrogant, just as reckless; still just goes charging in with the hammer. With that said, they didn't do a complete rewrite of Thor, which is good. All in all he did a good job, as expected, which is great. It's what you want anyways. Same goes to say for all the other characters, they deliver.<br/><br/>I actually didn't care for the opening sequence too much. Loki showing up, and having the scene devolve to a car chase, felt odd to me. Throughout the film everyone is a smart ass at the expense of genuine dialogue. It's funny the first couple of times but really grates on repeat viewings. Another thing is, if you haven't sat down and watched the previous marvel movies such as: Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America, you will not enjoy the movie anywhere near as much as the contrary. That is not to the detriment of The Avengers though, really it's what allows the avengers to be as good as it is, as it can get right into the action. All of the character development, the other stuff that has taken place, origin stories, explanations of characters, who's doing what to whom, back story, and all of that stuff, has already been taken of prior to The Avengers, so you can come into this as a viewer and see these heroes doing what they do best frequently throughout the duration of the film.<br/><br/>Great actor portrayals and staying true to the franchise is what makes this film such a hit. The Avengers is that kind of big Hollywood blockbuster that you don't get to often. The Avengers gets a high score in my book, and it is probably one of the best movies marvel has ever made."

","The Avengers is the story of a group of superheroes who are forced to come together to save the planet from the God of mischief Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Who happens to be the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). The team made up of Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), The Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and directed by Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson). <br/><br/>Loki has come to earth seeking to control the human race with the help of an object known as the Tesseract and is not to be taken likely. Not even his brother Thor can stop his madness. The Avengers must defend the world from Loki's reign and despite their differences and pent up tension towards each other, come together to make sure that the world stays safe.<br/><br/>The movie pretty much goes along with the comic books throughout the entire thing. However, I wish that Loki would have been portrayed just a little bit differently. In the comics, he's a crazy God obsessed with his power and causing absolute chaos and ruin. Tom Hiddleston makes a good Loki, but I feel as though if he had made him just a tad more crazy, he would have made a better Loki. Because really, he's the God of mischief. Asgard's own trickster. Not the God of pity or self-loathing.<br/><br/>The graphics are really eye popping and keep the movie more real feeling. There is a part where Thor, Captain America, and Black Widow are all on the streets and this explosion happens directly behind them. The color of the flames made your eyes immediately go to the explosion, then the movement in Black Widow's hair draws your eyes from the flame to her, and from there out to the other characters surrounding her.<br/><br/>The storyline flows really nice as well. Going from one point to the next without making you wonder what the heck is going on. There may be one or two points that may becoming confusing for someone who hasn't read the comics or seen the previous Marvel movies, but overall the story is pretty easy to follow.<br/><br/>The Avengers to me is a must see movie even if you aren't a huge super hero fan. It's filled with a suspenseful story line, eye pleasing graphics,an excellent cast of actors, and lives up to its hype."
"grendelkhan","8","0","5","28 September 2012"," A fine film for the faithful and the casual.
","The story goes that back in 1961, Martin Goodman, the owner of a struggling comic book company, played a round of golf with one of the owners of DC Comics. The man was doing a bit of boasting of their recent success with their Justice League comic, a revival of the all-star team concept of the Justice Society of the 40s. Goodman went back to his editor and asked for something like it. That editor (Stan Lee)put his head together with the company's best artist (Jack Kirby) and they conceived the Fantastic Four. The stakes were high, as the company was close to going under. It paid off and the Marvel Age of Comics, as Lee liked to call it, had arrived. This hit would spawn more, eventually leading to a true rival for the concept of the Justice League, a team of Marvel all-stars; and the Avengers were born. Throughout the years, the Avengers would be a book of visual flair, action and epic tales. In various hands, the book would feature not just a group of stars, but a real team.<br/><br/>Now, almost 50 years later, Marvel Studios has done the same. Frustrated with the lack of control over their cinematic adaptations, even when things worked out well, Marvel formed their own production company. They did not have an easy job, as their biggest name characters had long ago been sewn up by Fox and Sony. They would have to start with characters who weren't as well known, outside of the comic world. They began with Iron Man. The film proved a hit, both with the casual audience and the fans who followed the comic over the years. It was well written, well cast, well acted, and well executed. Marvel didn't rest and progressed with their plan to introduce a new movie in close succession to the previous one. Much like the comics, paths crossed and old heroes welcomed new. One by one, the members of the Avengers came forward. It all came to a head with the Avengers movie.<br/><br/>The film is first rate, with a great cast and excellent visuals. The previous films established the characters, so time didn't need to be wasted reintroducing the characters. Much like James Bond, we start with action and stop only to plan for the next event. The scope is epic enough to warrant a team of people, rather than an episode any single member could handle (a common fault in many Justice League stories, where Superman dominated all). Joss Whedon, a fan with strong credentials in the comic world, hits the notes right. He introduces the threat, then begins assembling the team. However, teams in the Marvel world rarely work harmoniously at the beginning. They test each other, argue, trade barbs; but, when it counts they get down to business. This truly felt like the comic brought to life, much as Richard Donner's Superman had before, and Christopher Nolan's Batman had more recently.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film, though. There are a few to many convenient moments, like the scientist unconsciously building a failsafe into the dimensional gateway. Hawkeye and Black Widow are still underdeveloped, as they had little more than cameos in the previous films. Dialogue suggests a history, but they are still mostly cyphers to non-fans. Many character moments ended up on the cutting room floor, due to time constraints, so we don't really get to experience Captain America struggling with an unfamiliar world. In a related note, Cap never really sounds like someone from the 40s. Hopefully, sequels will be able to explore these things more and the film series can mature beyond just an action spectacle, as the comics did. Whedon and the cast & crew certainly gave a foundation on which to build.<br/><br/>There are many moments to enjoy, from Whedon's trademark wisecracking dialogue, to Tom Hiddleston's layered villain, to the revelation of SHIELD as more than just a glorified Marvel FBI. There are some excellent quiet moments in all of the thunder and we see the human costs of the battle, which is too often missing from these things. In the end, the film earns its success. Here's hoping that Marvel won't rest on that success and try to venture into some of their other books, especially those that don't revolve around superheroes. The company produced some fine western and sci-fi characters, not to mention someone needs to do a Howard the Duck film that is as good as the comic was."
"tomgillespie2002","8","0","2","25 August 2012"," A very funny and effortlessly entertaining alternative to The Dark Knight Rises
","So here it arrives, at last, after five films, four years, and many an explosion, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are brought together (with the addition of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)) to become the third highest-grossing movie of all time (so far). While the individual films vary in quality, it is Joss Whedon who was chosen to handle such an big-name ensemble. The Avengers is hardly a masterpiece, but is one of the most effortlessly entertaining films I've ever seen, with a witty script, an extremely talented cast, and Scarlett Johansson's arse back in spandex.<br/><br/>Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's Asgardi brother, arrives on Earth via a portal created by the Tesseract cube, and destroys the headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D., an espionage agency ran by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Fury calls on Steve Rogers (Evans) to help against Loki, who is busy causing a distraction as a Loki-possessed Hawkeye steals iridium needed to stabilise the Tesseract's power, and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) calls on Tony Stark's (Downey Jr.) expertise in understanding the power that Loki may now wield. Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) is sent to Calcutta to round-up Bruce Banner, while Thor moves in after Rogers and Stark capture Loki. Soon enough, the group are bickering on board S.H.I.E.L.D.'s giant Helicarrier, while's Loki's grand plan comes to fruition.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon clearly loves his comic-books. While the film in absolutely no way isolate's newcomers, this is a film for the geeks. Ever wanted to see the Incredible Hulk fight Iron Man? Or the Hulk punching Thor thity feet through the air? Iron Man mocking Thor with Shakespearian venom? What about the Hulk repeatedly smashing Loki against the floor (in possibly the most inspired moment of the film) by his legs? Well, nerds, you better start thinking about your gran before you spray your pants as The Avengers has them all and then some. It's a true indication of how the balance of power in Hollywood has shifted of late, with Internet chat-rooms providing a medium for many an uber-nerd to vent their opinions and approvals/disapprovals. With directors like Peter Jackson, Edgar Wright and Zack Snyder (as well as Whedon) amongst the directorial A-list, films no longer need to be bogged down with added romance or morality lessons to please the 'wider audience' producers thought existed, but instead go back to the source of what made the subject so beloved in the first place.<br/><br/>But the film is far more than great special-effects and action scenes (though they are here in abundance), and shows that a film doesn't have to simply ejaculate in your face a la Michael Bay to make mega-bucks. Whedon's screenplay is the key to the film and the scenes in which the group verbally interact (especially in the early scenes where they despise each other) provides plenty of wit and genuine heart. No character is forgotten either - Whedon has experience handling an ensemble with the tragically cancelled Firefly series, which led to the terrific film adaptation Serenity (2005) - and The Avengers' 140+ running time allows them all to breathe, without anyone being lost amongst the enormous personalities and emotional complexities.<br/><br/>Although it's not the best superhero film ever made, it's certainly the most fun. And with the darkness and psychological menace of The Dark Knight Rises still lingering in my mind, The Avengers offers a funnier, more care-free alternative in the genre (although The Avengers does have its share of genuine shocks). If there were any concerns about the film living up to its hype, they have been well and truly laid to rest, with Ruffalo's Bruce Banner providing yet another casting masterstroke after negotiations between Marvel and Edward Norton broke down (they can stop changing him now after three Hulk's in as many movies). Even though it does move a bit too frantically for its own good sometimes, Downey Jr. and co are just too magnetic for this to become a problem. The film offers yet another post-credits nipple-erecter, opening Marvel's universe even more, so hopefully there will be more of the same to come with The Avengers 2 (due 2015 according to IMDb) and Edgar Wright's Ant- Man (probably out next year)."

","The midnight premiere of ""The Avengers"" in Doha filled every seat in the theatre. One ticket for six heroes¬Ö deals like this don't come very often.<br/><br/>Co-writer and director Joss Whedon delivers one of this year's most highly anticipated films, Marvel's ""The Avengers."" By bringing together the cream of ""The Avengers"" crop, including the mighty ""Incredible Hulk,"" the cool-as-steel ""Iron Man,"" dashing ""Captain America,"" ""Thor"" and his magic hammer, slick ""Black Widow"" and master archer ""Hawkeye,"" has met all expectations in combining the real world with Marvel-style myth.<br/><br/>An opened space portal, a la ""Thor,"" launches us into this new adventure. It is the bridge between the two worlds from which the exiled semi-God Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steps through. His mission is to conquer the Earth with the support of the dark alien army of the Chitauri, in exchange of the Tesseract, a powerful energy source. His abilities, to control minds and use his evil power to slaughter with ease, have made him a ferocious enemy. If you're familiar with Loki's evil charms or have seen ""Thor"" ‚Äì to whom he is an adopted brother ‚Äì then you are fully aware of his frightening desire to prove his capacity to rule. Loki's failure to reign in space further fuels his desire to be King ‚Äì but on Earth. By demeaning the powers of humans and taking advantage of their inability to unite, his true motives and means are revealed, ""It's the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power. For identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."" Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D, reactivates The Avengers Initiative which, in other words, consists of joining the power of superheroes. The first to be recruited are Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) and Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) now with new and improved anger management skills! Mind you, all it takes is for the deliciously provocative Tony Stark/ Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) to let rip and, well¬Ö we all know what happens when The Hulk gets mad! Thor's intervention is mainly due to his attachment to our mortal specie. Remember when he fell in love with one? The result at first is a chaos of people with weird outfits, the egos of superheroes and a tremendously dissimilar ensemble. It seems like each has been evacuated from their respective film sets after a fire alarm and ended up in the same room. It is hilarious as they ridicule each other's guise but mostly, they prove their inability to compromise and unite which is exactly what Loki was hedging his bets on.<br/><br/>After a power display of muscles and skills ‚Äì with a number of injuries along the way ‚Äì Fury interferes within his capacity (not physical of course) to motivate them and direct their attention to the one antagonist instead of each other.<br/><br/>I don't remember having enjoyed any of the individual films starring our aforementioned heroes therefore I was skeptical about this collective initiative. To my delight though, I spent those two cinematic hours laughing out loud to an unexpected, incredibly well-written script, combined with an aesthetically intoxicating action, sci-fi, adventure and the magic of comics. Watching the film in the cinema was a fantastic experience all round.<br/><br/>An elite cast for the genre, the most pleasant surprise of them all is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk (previously performed by Edward Norton) in a first with such a role, polished with craft. The epic dialogue is unforgettable, with key quotes that are sure to continue ringing out in the DFI offices and with Marvel/The Avengers lovers around the world.

"japamo","8","0","2","26 June 2012"," I love it when a superhero group (and a juggling act) come together
","Personally, I prefer superhero soloists to superhero teams, perhaps because it is easier to delve into and devote more time to a single superhero's characteristics, psychological motivations, and objectives. Also, I think, by their very nature, superheroes tend to be defiant, isolated loners - they are different from, and surpass the abilities of, common people. Therefore, I was particularly pleased by director Joss Whedon's triple accomplishment in ""The Avengers"". He faced the challenge of plausibly uniting, and coalescing several different actors with different acting qualities - especially when only one of them, Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, has any national recognizability (no knock against the rest of the ensemble group, of course). Whedon faced the challenge of combining and meshing several wildly disparate superheroes resolutely used to being ""lone wolves"" and functioning solo. Finally, Whedon faced the challenge of giving each hero equal substantial time to strut their stuff in the spotlight, even the deceptively ordinary, non-superpowered Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). I think Whedon admirably succeeds on all three counts.<br/><br/>I also admire Whedon's deliberate, deft restraint in plotting ""The Avengers"". Much as it might chafe adrenaline addicts impatiently waiting for the cataclysmic New York smackdown, the movie takes its time to establish the god of mischief and evil Loki's (Tom Hiddleston') nefarious partnership with the Predator-like aliens the Chitari and their unholy contract (Chitauri, in exchange for the Tesseract's (or Cosmic Cube's) improbably infinite power, send an endless horde of warriors through a space portal to help Loki conquer Earth). There's a lot of necessary exposition in this first half of the movie. ""The Avengers"" not only has to gradually reveal Loki's ultimate motives and introduce (and reintroduce) each superhero's personality and conflicts. The movie must also surmount various obstacles (including slam-bang infighting and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s latent exploitation of the Tesseract to develop extraterrestrial pre-emptive strike weaponry) to the Avengers becoming a cohesive fighting unit. With the commanding, no-nonsense guidance of unflappable S.H.I.E.L.D. commander Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), the Avengers grudgingly but steadily get their act together. They realize that saving the Earth takes priority over petty squabbles, disagreements, and even betrayals (including the one Black Widow uses to bring and unleash Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) into the fold). Yes, that's a lot of exposition to keep straight, but Whedon handles this mammoth task well.<br/><br/>Eventually, we get to the global battle, and what a colossal battle royale it is! Again, Whedon displays his juggling skills as all the Avengers make their unique contributions towards fighting the Chitauri threat. The director modulates the rousing fight scenes well enough so you don't eventually feel overwhelmed and worn out. The only three critical observations I have about the conflict are these: 1) the Chitauri, gliding in on their aerial cycles, seemed to serve the same purpose as the battle droids in the ""Star Wars"" prequels: gun fodder. In other words, they seemed to go down much too easily. Their only advantage was sheer weight of numbers, 2) it's a major miracle no citizens get killed, and 3) who's going to pay for the clean-up afterwards? Wait, there may be a fourth, shouldn't it occurred to the Avengers earlier that closing the portal was the solution? Ahh, whatever! It's a stupendous spectacle! Beside's the spectacle, there's much to savor in ""The Avengers"". Whedon, especially through the smartaleck banter of the self-absorbed Iron Man/Tony Stark, provides several hilarious one-liners and dialogue that keep this enterprise from sinking into ponderous self-importance. However, ironically, the wrathful Hulk provides the movie's three funniest scenes, especially when he confronts the vainglorious Loki at Stark's phallic tower and dismisses him as a ""Puny god!"" Downey and Ruffalo engage in inspired techno-speak when attempting to locate the Tesseract. Even the ""non-superheroes"", especially Fury's self-sacrificing man Friday Phil Coulson, demonstrate their heroism. Of course, the CGI special effects, including the way the Hulk resembles a pumped-up Mark Ruffalo and the undulating Chitauri spaceships resembling ancient whale skeletons, are mind-boggling but convincing.<br/><br/>I could ramble on and not begin to cover all the facets of this successful production. If you like Marvel, the Avengers, balanced ensemble work, and/or full-throated action thrillers, I think you'll love this movie. If you prefer cerebral, contemplative movies, I think you may find something to like about ""The Avengers"". The Dark Knight and any future adaptation of The Justice League of America should tremble at the high standard they have to reach. So be it! P.S.: If you have the patience to wade through the end credits, you will see a post-scene midway which sets up the sequel, where the Avengers will encounter the embodiment of death itself. At the very end, you will see our beloved superheroes enjoying shawarma in a deli. I looked up ""shawarma"" on Wikipedia - think shiskebob or gyro."

"basilisksamuk","8","0","5","21 May 2012"," True to its Origins
","It almost seems superfluous to add more to the mountain of reviews for this movie but that never stopped me before.<br/><br/>When I was a boy I used to go to market stalls and buy Marvel comics (if only I'd kept them I could retire a rich man). So far so normal but this was in the UK where comics meant the Beano and Dandy. You couldn't rely on collecting a whole series of a particular title in the 1960s ‚Äì it was just a matter of luck what had been imported and was up for sale. It was pretty much a minority interest in the UK. I say this much just to make the point that I have been a fan of Marvel characters for more years then I would like to admit to and so I fit that dreadful fan boy demographic from an earlier generation. I feel I know the characters and I know how they should be treated.<br/><br/>Avengers Assemble, as it is known in the UK to distinguish it from a beloved TV series of a different nature, is a film that I was able to enjoy as a fan. The characters were well developed and the interaction between them was particularly well handled and affectionate. The action scenes were well handled, though I have some reservations about the not-always impressive CGI that slipped through in places. I thought it would be too long at 143 minutes but I was never aware of the passing of time whilst watching it and it did not feel like the marathon that some 90 minute movies can sometimes be.<br/><br/>Some people have criticised it on the grounds that the plot is too simple and obvious or that the dialogue is too jokey but it fits the requirements for this type of film based on this type of material and what a joy it is to have Whedon's turn of phrase and playfulness. If you want to look at the underlying machinery, then it follows the hero's journey template like many (most?) other successful movies, except it has to fit all the characters into the journey.<br/><br/>It's not the world's greatest movie and it's not art house but then it was never intended to be. It's good fun and delivers as much as a fan could want. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk was a stand out for me. The two previous Hulk outings have been pretty awful in my estimation but this was pitch perfect and the Hulk delivered the best laughs in the movie.<br/><br/>I don't really know how you compare an art-house movie with a blockbuster fun movie. It probably can't be done. This was great entertainment and I'd sooner have that any day than worthy but dull."

"jyeung-pfl-95","8","0","4","13 May 2012"," a FUN movie but not perfect
","This is one of the best action films I have ever seen. But it's not the best superhero or comic book movie ever. Bests are TDK, Sin City, and History of Violence (to me anyways). <br/><br/>I'm being very nitpicky here, so when I say some things, I'm not saying it's a bad movie. I loved it. It's just that it could have been better. And speaking ""being better"" the film could have done more on Thor and Loki's relationship. Thor is very underplayed here as a character. He is wiser and cooler than the last film but he has no character or chemistry between others. Sure, there are some scenes where Loki and Thor are doing ""Shakespeare in the park"" but it could have gotten a lot somber-er or emotional to us. Plus Loki was very one dimensional here, his goal is very stupid and I am actually glad that Whedon took note of that but he could have at least try to make Loki interesting. He is cool and all but his objectives are so pointless, he's basically a joke in this film. Whedon could have made him a lot more terrifying and less cheesy (although Whedon's goal probably was cheesy for this film). The scene where Black Widow is interrogating Loki is awesome, he should have been more like that. He's really threatening but he's also an indirect comic relief. Another problem I had with this film was the dialog, there were a lot of funny lines but Whedon could have done sooo much better. The dialog for Cabin in the Woods was just fantastic! It could've been like that here but it just became corny. All the ""serious"" lines are sooo corny and sometimes unbearable. And although there are some negatives, Whedon does do a great job at sometimes making some corny scenes pretty funny.<br/><br/>And those are my negatives about this movie. I'm not going to write a lot about the awesome things about this movie because I'll be repeating what everyone has said. Yes, this film is beautiful. Yes, it is action packed fun. Yes, it is funny... But if I had to add anything else, Whedon did terrifically by making this film feel right. It's a movie for everyone. I definitely recommend everyone to see it. It's a wonderful film.

","The Avengers is the long awaited superhero blockbuster that has become a living wet dream for all the Marvel fanboys (and fangirls). Now basically Hollywood made this movie for two reasons which goes as follows: 1) To have a mesmerizing and memorable set piece at the end, capitalizing on the latest special effects and bring all the comic book characters to life And.. 2)To make a godly amount of money And they've succeeded on both levels, breaking box office records and creating a finale so engrossing and entertaining it was nothing short of awesome. To see Iron Man fighting alongside Captain America while the camera pans to The Hulk raising hell, I could feel the hair on my arms raising. On this level, the film worked really well. But the first half..ehh¬Öfelt a little shaky. Now I should note that I have not ready any of the comics, nor do I know much about the Marvel universe, so I'll try my best to not seem completely ignorant. The first half was decent enough, but it definitely could have been improved (or made more exciting). All the stuff about getting the team together maybe dragged on a bit too much, and the movie didn't explain itself very well from the get go. Now maybe that's because I haven't read any of the comics, but I really think that they should have explained things a little more clearer. But this is a superhero movie, so it honestly doesn't really matter. In fact, I predicted how this movie would end before I sat down in the theater. But that doesn't matter either, the only thing that does matter is that it has the comic book characters that everyone has grown to know (and possibly love?) and that it has a lot of incredibly cool action scenes. But more on that later. The film was really good on an acting level. Some of my favorite scenes in the movie were just the characters interacting with one another. Robert Downey Jr played Robert Downey Jr and plays it perfectly. Chris Evans did well as the patriotic, out of time Captain America. Mark Ruffalo was particularly good as Bruce Banner/Hulk, although he didn't get nearly as much screen time as I would have liked. Samuel L Jackson played Rick Fury, and he definitely wasn't as Samuel L Jackson as he should have been, with the exception being his line, ""Well it's a stupid ass decision."" Jeremy Renner played Hawkeye, and I'm pretty sure that the screenwriters forgot about this character completely, and wrote him in at the last minute because Hawkeye really doesn't do anything. I like Jeremey Renner, but I feel like his was awfully miscasted in this movie. Scarlett Johansson was there to look super sexy in that black leather, but I'm still wondering why a vulnerable, attractive Russian spy is doing in a superhero team, when she doesn't have superpowers. But once again, what do I know? Tom Hiddleston plays the main villain Loki, and is without a doubt the standout role, with an amazing performance and a memorable character design, he's an actor that I'm looking forward to see in the future. And then there's Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Now I don't like this actor. I don't like Thor's character. I have no interest to see his movie and I have so many questions that I won't even bother starting. So on to the next topic, which would be the script. It's a fine script. Joss Whedon is a fine screenwriter. But if there was one thing that I had to (and will) comment on, it would be that there were FAR too many corny one liners. Some of them were funny. Most of them were stupid. The end result is that I can't even bring up any examples of the good jokes because they were buried under all the bad ones. The only person who needs to be making snappy one liners is Tony Stark, because he's an arrogant smart ass. But that's just my opinion. The script did make me laugh more times that I would have thought. And then there's the music. It was..music. Nothing standout here. I guess the other thing that I'd have to mention is the way that it's shot and edited. Sometimes it was a little jarring, it felt like they took and mashed techniques from Iron Man and Thor and Captain America, and it just ends up looking a little wonky. It never took me out of my movie experience, but every now and then the camera would tilt or reverse or the dreaded shaky cam techniques would be used, and I feel (much like the story) that it could have been a little cleaner and fluid. And now I'm done complaining. None of these things matter. Like I said, the only thing that matters is the action. And the action looks great and it's a lot of fun to watch. I barely felt it's two and a half hour running time, it was enjoyable and entertaining and even made me laugh a few times. The reveal shot of Loki in the beginning was particularly funny (although I seemed to be the only person in the theater who laughed). It even has Stan Lee in a little guest appearance towards the end. So the movie wasn't perfect, but nowadays what is? If you expect it to live up to the hype then you're going to be disappointed. But if you're looking to watch some good special effects, good fighting evil, snappy one liners and something to just turn your brain off to and shovel popcorn into your face, then this is the perfect movie. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it highly."

"chaz-28","7","0","5","11 May 2012"," The superheroes have the right script and the right director, but the villain does not pack the punch they need to truly become The Avengers
","After setting it up with multiple films about how the individual characters gained their super powers, The Avengers finally brings together all of the heroes in one story to either work together as team to defend Earth or fight amongst each other aided by their massive egos and verbal bravado. Perhaps never before in cinema history have there been so many movies released as prequels to set up the eventual crown jewel. Batman and Superman only met in the comics, not on the big screen. The Avengers appears to be sort of a test case to see if so many leading superheroes can all share the same screen.<br/><br/>While all six characters each receive a certain amount of on screen time and side story, some are pushed more into the foreground than others. As Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is a fan favorite and is always handy with a funny quip, he is front and center along with Captain America (Chris Evans) who even though does not have much of a super power, places himself in a sort of leadership role within the group. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and the two characters that did not get their own films, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all fight for the leftover screen time in the background. The puppet master is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who spends most of his effort in sheep dog mode herding these guys from their billion dollar towers or their self-imposed exile.<br/><br/>So what possible threat is great enough to require the efforts of six superheroes? Eh, it's just Loki (Tom HIddleston); Thor's adopted brother who has a chip on his shoulder. He zooms down to Earth with greasy hair, a ridiculous hat, and the backing of a large and formidable alien Army known as The Chitauri. Countering Loki would seem like a job for just Thor or just Iron Man, not the catalyst for The Avengers to finally come together as a team. Ah, but here is where the film really takes off. Most of these super beings are not team players. Iron Man's ego is way too big to share space with somebody else, the Hulk does not trust himself to walk down the street, and Captain America can't believe these prima donnas represent the future America which remains quite strange to him. <br/><br/>Entrusted with helming this new and star-studded film is Joss Whedon, the brains behind Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Angel. He has only directed one movie before this, the wonderful Serenity. I would have guessed the studio would go with a more experienced director; however, Whedon has proved before he is more than capable with this type of material. I'm not talking about action movies, but the verbal sparring, witty conversational scenes, and complicated story which must make a lot of room for almost too many characters. Whedon brings his trademark strengths with him including humor. When you think of The Hulk, the words humor and ironic laughter do not pop up in the first 20 adjectives to describe him, but in The Avengers, The Hulk becomes the most amusing character to watch which is all due to Whedon's skill. <br/><br/>There are a few details which do not work as well as others which hurt the film's appeal a little bit. To bring The Avengers together and mold them as a team requires a tremendous villain; however, Loki is not that guy. He is more of a villain's sidekick or henchman rather than the main baddie. Then there is Nick Fury's helicarrier which can also cloak itself and appears to be an upgrade, but direct rip-off of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Oh, and Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill was the absolute wrong casting choice for her role. An unknown actress is always better for a supporting role because every time she was on screen, all I could see was Robin from How I Met Your Mother. <br/><br/>Those are just details though. Whedon shows he was able to weave together a complex sextet of superheroes and take them through the difficult process of becoming a team. For simplicity's sake, some heroes are featured much more than others, but any other script and director would have made the same choices. The Avengers is very good during its climactic fight scene where all of the plot threads come together, but Loki as the villain is just not up to the challenge. Hopefully, whatever sequels come down the line are able to up the ante a little bit."
"akira36","7","0","5","7 May 2012"," Review in 3 parts
","This is a review is in 3 parts: The movie, The message, The future.<br/><br/>First the movie is the sum of its parts. They are done well which seems undisputed from movie making, acting, special effects....etc...POV. However it ISN'T MORE than the sum of its parts which we consider the classics to be. It's like addition, but NO multiplication. It is so segmented and connected by convenient superficial ways. As far as box office records, it should make this much money given the awareness of this movie since IRon MAn, 6 individual movies and the increase in ticket prices. If it didn't then it would be an unmitigated disaster.<br/><br/>Secondly the Message, it is a war mongering movie. It declares that we have to fight whoever to the death and we will be victorious. Contrast that with the message of the Dark Knight, which tries to say we can overcome this violence some other way and sometimes to do that, there is no clear victory or nor should there be. That ultimately too much war or too much peace is too imbalanced to survive or thrive. So you see the different styles serve their messages where Avengers tries to not go too deep and NOT show much of the ugliness while Dark Knight shows it all.<br/><br/>Finally, the future. There is tug of war between people who think we are doomed to fight it out or we can find another way. The END DAYS vs. the beginning of new era. What we believe is what will happen because actions will be driven by them. If the Avengers approaches the Dark KNight or surpasses it. Then we are Doomed :(. To show we aren't doomed, go see it once, but no more to show you are open :).<br/><br/>We need a landmark movie to bridge these two sides. I just hope it's not too late."
"cmichaelo","7","0","5","7 May 2012"," Very good...as good as Iron Man 1 and Captain America.
","This is a very good movie. But 8.8 stars good? Not even close... and the main reason is the story which isn't that compelling. Rather it's pretty standard ""superhero has to save the world from an evil force"". The storyline has few surprises and is predictable.<br/><br/>What brings this movie up to 7 stars on my meter is the execution of it, the dialogs, the acting, the jokes, and particularly the special effects. It's just outstanding.<br/><br/>What is not so outstanding is that Scarlett Johansen and other non-super heroes are hiding behind yellow cabs with tiny guns. Their enemy? Monstrous Godzilla-like flying snake creatures that can knock over the Empire State building in a matter of seconds and which throws cars 100s of feet in the air and which couldn't care less about bullets. These non-super heroes magically survive and even contribute significantly to beat the monsters from outer space... without any injury whatsoever.<br/><br/>It's kind of disappointing that so many reviewers, so far, are so emotional about this movie. It kind of reminds me about Dark Knight, another very good but way overrated movie.<br/><br/>Who can honestly say that this movie is even in the same category as Shawshank, Godfather and Goodfellas and such. The story simply isn't there. There's nothing memorable about this movie, or Dark Knight for that matter. I wouldn't see it again."

"afh179","7","0","5","6 May 2012"," Summer's approaching, here's the season's first real blockbuster
","So, every few years we get an obligatory Hollywood presentation of a comic book story. These films can be either really really good (films like The Dark Knight, Iron Man,) or really really bad (films like last year's Captain America). Personally, I'm a fan of movies in general. I'm no comic book freak, and before seeing this film I really couldn't tell you the first thing about the Avengers. But I was told this was gonna be the one, the superhero movie that I would love more than any of them. This was hyped up to be the best yet. It has all our favorite heroes, plenty of crazy action and breathtaking special effects, and a star- studded cast. So, I had high hopes and was excited to see this movie, which is rare for me when a new superhero movie comes out.<br/><br/>From beginning to end there is no denying that this is the year's first blockbuster. I'm not going to waste time describing the movie though, as honestly, we have seen it all before. Basic save the world plot, but with a medley of all the most famous and powerful superheros. What this movie does do is take special effects to new heights. This is by no means a thinking mans film, but it is not supposed to be. This ones about getting the bad guy, and causing a whole lot of explosions and plenty of adrenaline-pumping battles. Robert Downey Jr. shines as usual as Tony Stark, and his performance is the showstopper and shining moment of this movie. <br/><br/>All in all, there is something for every kind of movie fan here. It does what a blockbuster should do, entertain us and captivate us for a few hours with it's big-budget effects and simple story line. This is nothing we haven't seen before though, and while it is worth a second viewing (especially for the die-hards), it is nothing that I will spend my time raving on and on about.<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"
"carrollc221","9","0","2","6 May 2012"," A Superhero Film You Must Watch!
","I have watched several films that span across many different categories and time-frames (everything from the absolute greatest to the all-time worst rated films). In my honest opinion, I believe that the movie is far from perfection, but definitely in the 9 range.<br/><br/>A superhero film like this calls for tons of action and excitement and this movie delivers on every level and then some. A wonderful cast made it seem believably true - a rock-hard culmination of protagonists and antagonists in cooperation to fight the good fight against an unruly evil. Even if you were attending just to see one superhero, you would still get a kick from the others in the bunch. They were all at the top of their game in this film and there was not a single head in the audience that was not sitting at the edge of their seat in amazement.<br/><br/>Excellent cast, great dialogue, wonderful camera shots for the action scenes and trust me, there were plenty of action scenes to go around. Several fights going on at the same time, so if you were disappointed with one fight, you can eagerly await as the camera approached another fight scene and it was constant battle to the very end! If there is one superhero film you should watch, it's this one - and if you don't feel like watching it in the theatres now, at least be open-minded to pick a copy up when it releases on Blu-ray & DVD."

","""Marvel's The Avengers"" is the eagerly awaited convergence of the Marvel Studios superhero films, starting in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ending last summer with ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" While it may not be appreciated or understood by those who have not seen the earlier films, and although it relies more on spectacle and less on plot, it's nevertheless a fun and exciting action extravaganza ‚Äì a comic book film in every sense. Having recently co-written and produced the highly overrated horror spoof ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" writer/director Joss Whedon delivers an entertaining escapist fantasy that's just as funny as it is pulse-pounding. He also gives us plenty of eye candy, only some of which is enhanced by the film's presentation in post-conversion 3D.<br/><br/>I have no baggage attached to the various characters or the comic books from which they came, so any potential observations or complaints that this movie is not faithful to its source material will fall on deaf ears. All I can respond to are the stories as they appeared on the big screen. Despite various writers, directors, and stylistic approaches, I've been pleased with the results. Even ""Thor,"" generally the least liked of the intertwined series, had just enough to earn my seal of approval. The standard was set with ""Iron Man,"" which remains the best of the Marvel series and still ranks as one of the greatest superhero films ever made. I think I was right in not expecting ""The Avengers"" to top it; it allowed me to enjoy the film for what it is and not for what it should be.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the teaming of Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), a recently unfrozen Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Dr. Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, the third actor to assume the role in the last ten years), the thunder god Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and the skilled archer Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of a covert government organization known as S.H.I.E.L.D. Essentially, the must save the world from Thor's evil adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who plots to subjugate humanity by opening a wormhole and unleashing ruthless alien warriors. To achieve this goal, he must recapture a glowing blue cube known as the Tesseract, a powerful but potentially deadly energy source.<br/><br/>The rest is pretty much just window dressing. We have plenty comic book peril and violence; there's hand-to-hand combat and laser blasts, exploding air freighters and smashing Hulks, hammering Thors and the devastation of Manhattan, which is essentially the go-to city for glorious destruction. We have floating monstrosities that look like giant eels clad in armor. We have numerous references to the previous Marvel films, including appearances by Gwyneth Paltrow, Clark Gregg, and Stellan Skarsg√•rd (alas, Natalie Portman makes it in only as a portrait on a computer screen). We have mutual distrust amongst the Avengers and Fury's hidden agenda. We have Loki acting like an arrogant dictator, forcing a large crowd of people to kneel before him. And yes, we even have a cameo appearance by Stan Lee.<br/><br/>Whedon has never been a master of dialogue, although his flippant style is perfectly suited for the Tony Stark character, who has always possessed a biting wit and a natural superiority complex. The rest of the characters sound a bit goofy, although I guess that was the intention. Consider Gregg's character, Agent Phil Coulson; when he finally meets Steve Rogers in person, he drops his aloof mystique and becomes an excited fanboy eager to have his collection of Captain America trading cards autographed. This movie proves that visuals have always been Whedon's strong suit. In the case of ""The Avengers,"" he uses them to evoke not only excitement but also a sense of humor; some of the funniest sight gags are reserved for the Incredible Hulk, who truly is only good for smashing things.<br/><br/>Movies like ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are a unique marketing opportunity ‚Äì a franchise assembled from other franchises that will itself inevitably spawn a new franchise. This is not a criticism, merely an observation. As long as I'm being entertained, it doesn't matter to me how much a product is packaged, even if it comes within an inch of its life. I was very much entertained. Having said that, I can't help but wonder how much mileage this series has left. Can five separate films and one convergence adequately serve as the basis for an ""Avengers"" sequel? Will the original five inspire any sequels of their own? Story wise, I find myself growing wary. The last thing I want is for all the fun to stop. One of the quickest ways to make that happen is to allow franchises to overstay their welcome.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","After some right duds in the comic franchises lately - eg the latest 'dark' duff knight rubbish and 'Iron Man2'- it is refreshing to see an adventure that keeps you entertained almost throughout. The film revolves around the character Loki partnering some vicious aliens to take over Earth - cue get a group of superheroes together who have starred in their own films to row and fall out, but finally come together to take on the enemy. The action moves along at a pace, the script has some witty moments (the best being the screen operator who turns on his 'Space Invaders' while the Earth is under attack!), Ms Paltrow provides some fleeting eye candy, the CGI is well handled and not too overbearing, and the acting appropriate, eg Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johannson (one note actors) provide the well tuned one note performances required of them. And The Hulk comes out well after two appalling films! Not having seen 'Captain America' and 'Thor' the so-called tessaract did not mean a lot more than the wonder cube does in any other film, eg Transformers, the Fifth Dimension (that dreadful camp Bruce Willis scifi movie). But it provides continuity for teen boys who swallow up every blockbusting comic-based film that comes out, and the movie dashes along to its inevitable conclusion - a huge fight in the middle of New York as the aliens pour out of a black hole!!!! OK but let's not get carried away as if 'Citizen Kane' is about to get a reboot with CGI!!!"

The acting was pretty good also, it was the same old characters we learned to love and adore. But the thing that stuck out the most to me was Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. He brought the character to life and to be quite honest, I didn't really care much for the Hulk until this movie.<br/><br/>Now on the other hand, there was a down side to this movie. The movie just seemed to drag on. Almost as if they were building up the characters all over again, but they already had their own movie, so why? Also, and I know I wasn't the only one on this, but the whole story line was to clich√©. <br/><br/>Bottom line, it was a really good movie, top ten no, top 50 yes.

I'm not saying this to anger the Nolan nation or egg on the Distinguished Competition but I'd have to rate Marvel's Avengers a true 10/10 masterpiece and THE best comic book movie ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get regardless of the genre. I've noted before that Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws. Spider-Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. TDK has generally held the title as most technically sound and highly rated superhero movie. Iron Man has generally held the title as best all-around superhero film. Thor and Captain America jumped in last year and added their own unique flavor but I can honestly say that Avengers tops them all in every single category. It is IMO shear perfection on every level.

","Finally caught the Avengers. My thoughts... Overall, a good movie. Whedon made good use of every character, even the minor ones no one cares about (Black Widow, Nick Fury, Hawkeye). Action scenes were top-notch, especially those that involved Hulk. Amazingly prior to this, Whedon had not directed any blockbusters to speak of. Yet they chose him to handle a film of this magnitude, and fortunately the producers' confidence in him paid off because this movie was a home run. My only complaint was Capt. America and how useless he seemed, being overshadowed by the others. Just give Black Widow the shield, otherwise, having both on the same team was redundant. Anyway, I don't know who wouldn't be entertained by this film. Movies like this are the reason why we go to the cinema, so we have something to talk about afterward."
"trantor2nd","9","0","5","3 May 2012"," Over-hyped
","I'd give it an 8.5, perhaps because all the hype is really difficult to live up to. Except for one scene, everyone but me seems to enjoy the humor. I disliked the Iron Man movies for the same reason and would prefer a more serious tone. The choice was however financially smart. Contrary to popular opinion, I also prefer the old Nick Fury from the original Marvel continuity. The action becomes a little repetitive towards the end since suspending disbelief that any of the heroes could ever seriously get hurt or die is impossible. Yes, all the characters are given time to shine and I've always trusted the director's name. He takes pains to explain everything, including why most of the heroes who are supposed to be masked are out strutting their actor's faces around the whole movie (which they wouldn't do in the comics). In spite of watching this expensive spectacle on 2D, I was surprised to notice a few background scenes that looked fake. I hope they make JLA darker, but given the success template of the Avengers and the greater prevalence of humor in JLA comics, that would be unlikely. I bet DC is crying over spilled milk for not letting Josh Whedon do the Wonder Woman he wanted."

Jackson), a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.

While certainly powerful and god-like, Loki has incurred not only the wrath of his adopted brother (Chris Hemsworth, ""Cabin In the Woods""), but the smarmy Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr., ""Sherlock Holmes""), as well.<br/><br/>Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans, ""Captain America"") and Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, Academy Award nominated for ""The Kids Are All Right"") soon join the fight. All of these characters have some kind of machine-based, godly or genetically-mutated super power. Hawkeye and Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, ""We Bought a Zoo"") are just athletically-gifted spies/assassins.<br/><br/>And while Loki is captured and imprisoned in a huge, floating aircraft carrier, his plan to divide and conquer begins to take effect as each member of the squad not only has a super power, but a super ego, to boot. Inter-team conflicts break out all over as Captain American battles Iron Man who battles Thor who battles the Hulk who battles Black Widow who battles Hawkeye, etc., etc., etc.<br/><br/>Here, the movie takes a bit of a pause for exposition, but (thankfully) it got over itself and gets down to the concluding conflict featuring scaly, lizard aliens and large, snakelike robots which wreak havoc and destruction upon New York City (just think of what the Deceptacons did to Chicago in the last edition of ""Transformers"").<br/><br/>In fact, these scenes seem to point out in no uncertain terms that his henchmen are actually much more frightening and threatening than Loki, himself. There is even a most hilarious sequence when he shouts arrogantly at the Hulk, ""I am a god!"" (you will have to see for yourself what happens after that).<br/><br/>Finally putting their differences aside, the Avengers realize they have to work together or earth will indeed fall under the reign of a madman (or worse). The CGI and other special effects in these scenes (and throughout most of the film) are seamless and close to amazing.<br/><br/>In his directorial debut, Joss Whedon (who wrote ""Cabin In the Woods""), uses a deft hand and just the right touch in combining fast-paced, spirited action with the sharp one-liners and snappy rejoinders we've come to expect from movies like this. <br/><br/>The best lines are naturally gotten off by Stark, but Banner (and even his alter ego) fire off a few great shots, as well. This, of course, is in no small thanks to writers Wheldon and Zak Penn (""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""The Grand"").<br/><br/>It's loud, funny, thrilling and leaves no doubt as to the inclusion of a part two (look for a nice little surprise midway through the credits). Also, as usual, creator Stan Lee makes another Hitchcock-like appearance, which hardcore and casual fans alike will appreciate.<br/><br/>And while the movie is shot in 3D, it is not really necessary, considering there are only a few scenes late in the film which actually accentuates the technology and some patrons may not want to pay the extra fee for it.<br/><br/>So, as summer ""blockbuster"" pictures move further away from the actual season, ""The Avengers"" is nevertheless a great way to kick off the advent of what Hollywood hopes (and prays, no doubt) will be a record-setting four months at the box office."

","I was thinking all the way as to why this movie was named Avengers and Not Iron Man 3. It was Iron Man all the way, the main hero. Others were simply there (guess to be there)!! I would have surely mistaken this for Iron Man 3 if I had seen trailer without any mention of the name Avengers.<br/><br/>That said, it was indeed fun to watch, I liked it better than other such movies like transformers (referring to alien invasion and action sequences).<br/><br/>Having said that I loved the movie, no doubt fantastic entertainment. Go ahead (especially you like Iron Man), you will not regret it.<br/><br/>Thumbs up!!"

","OK.! i rushed into the afternoon show with my brother at the cinema. i didn't expect much, because i thought to many cooks may spoil the broth... but as the movie began... awesome...!! superb action.. last one hour was terrific. Hulk rocked in the movie. all were great. the best cgi i have ever seen.. i recommend its a must watch. i have seen it 3 times in theaters. the story lacks something.. but everything is covered up by the humor, action, and lots and lots of cgi graphics.. the movie rocks. waiting for avengers 2. and as per 3d... i recommend u wont miss anything much in 2d..the best scene in the movie was when Bruce banner turns into hulk and punches into the alien."

","*When: 2012/4/28 20:00<br/><br/>*Where: Dream Mall, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.<br/><br/>*How: Driving to theater.<br/><br/>*Why: My cellphone company Taiwan Mobile invite me, a member of VIP, with two free tickets to see this movie.<br/><br/>*Whom: went with my friend PingZong. Originally, I'm not that kind of big fan for the comic books and want to yield to another friend, however, he's busy that day, so i just went with the other one.<br/><br/>*What: despite of some irrationality of the movie, what it inspires me is the idea of making an elaborate story with diversely sub-stories and some hints in them and converge later into a cohesive one. The idea should be huge with key features across the sub-stories so that a major one can subsequently consolidate them. Some idea of scene doesn't fall into the traditional and surprise and impress you then.<br/><br/>Conclusion: a good one for recreation."

","I am a huge fan of superhero movies, so I had to see this one in the cinema. I had my doubts about this one though. A group of individual superheroes who don't know how to work together and have to work together as a team. And yes, it was just this way how the movie started. The first half was boring. I don't like Jeremy Renner as an actor and this movie didn't change that feeling for a bit. I just don't like ""hawkeye"".<br/><br/>The Hulk (and of course Mark Ruffalo) was just... incredible. Yes, he is the best Hulk ever, but to be honest, it is Bill Bixby who has put Banner on the screen in the first place. We are now in 2012 and now Mark is the Bruce, who will be the next Bruce Banner? The Hulk was funny, surprisingly good, entertaining.<br/><br/>That the movie was about Thor and his half brother was disappointing. I thought we had that fight one year ago.<br/><br/>Now there is one thing that is bugging me. This year is all about competition between the avengers and the dark knight rising. I don't think the new Spiderman will be in the same race, but I like to be surprised. After seen this movie, I hope I will be satisfied in July with The dark knight rising. The Avengers just didn't entertain me the whole time. Some parts it was just boring.<br/><br/>The movie had action, a lot of jokes. The second half was great, but I still don't rate a whole movie on the second half."
