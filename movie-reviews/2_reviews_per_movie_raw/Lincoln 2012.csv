","I remember fondly, Henry Fonda and Raymond Massey as Lincolns in ""Young Mr.Lincoln"" and ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" They gave remarkable performances. But, here and now in this extraordinary Steven Spielberg/Tony Kushner version, the illusion is complete. I was watching the president and not for a moment thought of the actor. That in itself is close to unique. I left the theater with the feeling I've just had an out of body experience. Everything around the central performance - and I call it a performance because I don't know what else to call it - falls into place in a miraculous way. The photography, the production design, the wardrobe made it possible to actually smell the period. Congratulations and thank you."
"LloydBayer","8","38","49","30 May 2014"," By its very making, director Steven Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world.
","The very mention of a Steven Spielberg project and everyone goes bug-eyed in excitement and curiosity; everyone from casual movie goers to mainstream critics to cinema house managers. Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, throw in a multi-award winning star cast lead by Daniel Day-Lewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above, or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take, Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking — an amalgamation of art, literature, politics, society, history, and most importantly, humanism.<br/><br/>Here's a brief re-cap to get you up to speed on the relevance of the American Civil War (1861 to 1865) as depicted in the film. The United States of America is divided as cotton rich states of the South refuse to phase out slavery. After Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln secures the Presidency, almost a dozen states in the South pull out of the 'Union' and become the Confederate States of America. As a bloody civil war rages between North and South, the film's story begins with President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This is the Commander and Chief of the armed forces calling for slavery to be abolished in all states by seeking a landmark constitutional amendment. For this to happen, Lincoln must procure enough votes through Congress for a stay order on making slavery illegal anywhere in America. Challenged with factions within his Republican party, Lincoln becomes his own worst enemy in a daunting personal crisis: save thousands of lives by ending the war or prolong the war in favour of ending slavery.<br/><br/>Running at 150 minutes, this film is a slow burner with extensive dialogues and frequent courthouse debates; but like the trudging power of a steam locomotive, Lincoln pushes forward with remarkable pace while never losing sight of its destination. Piloting this powerhouse of a film is Daniel Day-Lewis in easily his finest hour as a method actor. His Lincoln is tall and bent over with war-stressed fatigue and a shrill voice, but armed with a quiver full of wisdom and remedial anecdotes for when push comes to shove. Throughout the narrative Lincoln is torn within as he manages his duties as the President of a nation, as a father who has lost a son, and as a husband who must confide in his wife when decisions become complex. This is also when I must mention Sally Field in another fine delivery as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and the epitome of the phrase 'Behind every great man is a woman'. Field's Mary is a tragic character whose depiction of a bleeding heart is memorable in a scene where she confronts Lincoln as the father of their children, not a man with immense power. With strong characterisation forming the flesh and blood of the film, you can also expect riveting roles from Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn, besides a multitude of top actors.<br/><br/>This is one of the most important films of the year and perhaps even the times we live in. By its very making, Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world. Lincoln is to Steven Spielberg what Gandhi is to Richard Attenborough; the commonality being crucial moments in history, rather than a history lesson per se. If I have to nit-pick, I suspect there could be historical anomalies in the narrative if this film is solely considered a biopic. This is why I strongly recommend the film as a political drama rather than a componential biography. Is it safe to say that President Abraham Lincoln was a self-made man? That he was extremely intelligent despite dropping out of school? That he changed the future of an entire nation? That Barak Obama is the current President of the United States of America because Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery? If you said 'yes' to any of these questions then Lincoln is more than just an Academy Award magnet—it is a landmark film made by people reiterating that freedom is a birth right for people everywhere."
"StevePulaski","9","253","378","17 November 2012"," A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity
","Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.<br/><br/>Spielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.<br/><br/>While titled ""Lincoln,"" we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.<br/><br/>One requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.<br/><br/>With this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.<br/><br/>But that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.<br/><br/>Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley. Directed by: Steven Spielberg."
"ketztx","10","151","224","29 December 2012"," Sigh. Daniel does it again
","I'm prepared to admit at this point that Daniel Day Lewis has succeeded to the title of most brilliant actor of his generation--and I do not say that lightly. But when I consider what he has done here--imbued the most sacred president in our history with such aching, gorgeous, complex humanity--seemingly without conscious effort on his part--I say give it to him.<br/><br/>His Lincoln is at once ordinary and divine, passionate and all too earthy...and he inhabits the role so fully that not beyond the first minute do you think to yourself that you are watching an actor and not the man himself. I admit, at the first speech, I rather expected the voice to be deeper and more commanding, but that wore off instantly, and Spielberg to his credit gets every scene note-perfect. The scene where soldiers on the field were quoting back to him the Gettysburg Address was heartbreaking--The big guns, to be sure, but everyone in the theater stopped breathing. Spielberg has the mood and light fine-tuned to the point that when the characters are donning shawls against the cold--this in the white house--you shiver. I can'think of a single actor who was not up to snuff, but James Spader as a rascally vote procurer stands out. Sally Field as the troubled Mary Todd Lincoln is a sympathetic gem, and her portrayal should go a long way towards explaining and perhaps inviting history's revision of that unhappy woman. The film focuses most on the nuts and bolts of legislative and presidential processes, and while that may be boring for some,it has such a ring of authenticity and research that it had me scrambling for the history books to check on things I hadn't known. This is the most difficult of all subjects to film, a dense scholarly work translated to popular culture, but it succeeds on all counts. See it, make your children go with you. You won't regret it."
"kentuckybob","10","292","488","30 October 2012"," I walked out of the theater wanting to go back in and see it again.
","It's seldom that I leave a movie knowing that I absolutely will go back to a theater to see that movie again rather than wait for distribution. As I walked out, I absolutely knew that I would be back. There are so many amazing actors in this movie that I need to go back to fully appreciate the story.<br/><br/>In my estimation, Spielberg's Lincoln will become the definitive movie on Abraham Lincoln. Daniel Day Lewis absolutely disappeared into this character and out gallumped Honest Abe - country lawyer, gifted orator and a man born more fully suited to the desperate needs of a nation than possibly any other man in history. This movie is not the shiny myth, but a portrait of an amazing man who inspired, cajoled and even bribed the Representatives of the People into representing ALL of the people. <br/><br/>If you go, and I hope that you do, go with ears ready to hear voices speaking out to us from our violent past, telling us that we can be better than we are, that some things should be done because they must be done and that we can sometimes accomplish the impossible."
"secondtake","7","62","97","3 January 2013"," Moving and important...with a mind-blowing performance by Day-Lewis
","Lincoln (2012) <br/><br/>A highly polished, restrained, important movie.<br/><br/>That doesn't make this an exciting movie. The acting is terrific, and filming excellent (including a color saturation pulled back to give it an old look without seeming affected). It is clearly expert in the way we expect from Steven Spielberg above perhaps anyone, at least in the mainstream conventional sense.<br/><br/>But there are two things that make this movie a must see. One is the content. It's about one of the two or three most important things ever to happen in this country--the fight to end slavery during the Civil War. This is such powerful stuff it will make you weep. (If it doesn't, you'll have to ask why.) It's laid out as clearly and emphatically as possible while still keeping accurate.<br/><br/>The second thing is simply the overwhelming performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It is so good you forget it's a performance (unlike, for example, his intensity in ""There Will Be Blood"" which stood out as a work of acting above the movie). Here he is so woven into the fabric of things he is indistinguishable from the historic truth, somehow. It's really the magic of the transparency of movie-making of this kind. Amazing performance.<br/><br/>It seems sacrilege to say this but the movie isn't perfect. Because of its material--getting the anti-slavery amendment through Congress--it involves a lot of talk, and a lot of people that you have to keep track of. I think Spielberg did this as good as it could be done, so no criticism there, but it does mean a lack of physical and even emotional drama through much of the film. I don't mean it's dull, just that it's conversational. I also found shreds of Spielberg's Frank Capra quality of making the movies--and his subjects--a little simplified. He ties up loose ends. He makes it all a fine package, very fine. Maybe too fine for what I would call high art. At times.<br/><br/>I think we'll have an easier time judging it in six months, or six years. Also the subject matter makes it almost unassailable, since clearly most of us are all for the passing of any anti-slavery legislation.<br/><br/>See this for all the reasons you have heard. Don't miss it. Maybe down a coffee before you go, but see it no matter what. As I say, it's important. It reminds you of greatness, and that's not something to miss.<br/><br/>UPDATE over one year later: I see that I accepted a lot of decisions by the writer and director as their prerogative, like focussing on one issue and narrowing to a short period of time. I had no bones with the scope of the movie. But in retrospect I see how the limitations of time and scope and background also create a sense of mis-information. That is, if you want a bigger picture of Lincoln, this movie is not quite right. Its aggrandizement is also not unavoidable, like the somewhat insipid (and yet moving) recital of the Gettysburg Address at the beginning by soldiers. Overall, though, I stick to my main thought--see it, and soak up what you can, without expecting perfection. Yes, see it for what it is, nothing less."
"kmarlow-483-702066","10","173","298","17 November 2012"," ""Lincoln"" & Daniel Day Lewis Incredible.. Warning:not an action film
","Just read some of the ""bad"" reviews & simply just don't get how you can't like this GREAT MOVIE. Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" was AWESOME. The Director was able to take you ""Back In Time"" when things were much simpler & primitive, way back in the 1860's. And Daniel Day Lewis moved me in this film like no other actor has ever done. Mr. Lewis' performance was mesmerizing and spellbinding. He was ""Abraham Lincoln."" His acting in this movie is definitely ""Best Actor/Academy Award Worthy.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" was not directed or produced with the main intention to deliver an Action ""Civil"" War Movie concentrating on horrific action battle scenes. If you want mainly entertaining action scenes then James Bond & ""Skyfall"" should be your pick. I'm sure it is also an awesome film. I want to see ""Skyfall"" also. But ""Lincoln"" was my first pick of the holiday blockbuster season.<br/><br/>Stephen Spielberg, designed this Movie to specifically concentrate on ""The Man"" Abraham Lincoln: Our 16th President of the United States. And how Mr. Lincoln helped end the CIVIL WAR and at the same time Abolish Slavery in our United States of America in the last few but Very Important months of this Great Man's Life. Daniel Day-Lewis helped show the truly human sides of Abraham Lincoln. <br/><br/>I Admire and Honor Abraham Lincoln even more so after viewing this Film."
"thepepperlanders","4","164","282","9 February 2013"," History written by Steven Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg visuals are excellent in movies and this one is no exception. He does a wonderful job recreating the time period that Lincoln was a part of. The difficulty I have is in believing some of the dialogue and the revisionist history that takes place in this movie. The opening scene is a bloody battle and it appears realistic. Unfortunately the following scene has two black soldiers chatting with Lincoln outside in a makeshift camp. He's sitting at a table while they discuss their observations with him. Listening to them you'd think they all grew up on the same block together. One soldier lectures Lincoln and interrupts him during their conversation, while the other is Lincolns best buddy. A soldier wouldn't ever talk to a president in 2012 in this manner. In 1865 if two black soldiers acted this way they would have been immediately been put in irons. Blacks had to be extremely deferential interacting with whites during that century because the law looked the other way when they were murdered by whites. The scene is ridiculous. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie Spielberg emphasizes slavery as Lincolns motivation for engaging with the South. Fact check: Lincoln goal was to preserve the union. He did not remotely believe in equality of the races. Like most whites at that time, he considered blacks inferior. He stated that he would free some of the slaves, or all of the slaves, or none of the slaves if it would preserve the union. The movie is sort of a Disney version of Lincoln and loose on the facts.<br/><br/>This movie is over rated (probably because Spielberg is so powerful in Hollywood) and if you know any civil war history you will be disappointed. Lincoln, like all presidents, was a mixed bag. He believed in that it was acceptable to pay $300 to buy your way out of the war (the Irish didn't like that idea). Lincoln seriously considered deporting blacks to central America or Africa after the war. There was a great deal of corruption during his administration. Like most elites he believed the war should be fought by others(he wouldn't allow his son to put on a uniform until the war was over). Spielberg paints Lincoln as a saint and it would have been better (and far more realistic) if he had been portrayed a man with faults. The movie is a disappointment, if you want real history, read a book. This movie is a fable for children."
"frezeframe","2","349","621","21 November 2012"," Should be Titled ""13""
","So what happened? <br/><br/>1. The first problem with this film is the script. The writer Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer winning theater writer, but other than ""Munich"" he hasn't done any motion pictures. The long drawn out dialogue between Lincoln's cabinet and the lengthy parliamentary congress sessions might play well on Broadway, but they linger on screen. It wasn't just Kushner's fault. Spielberg is one of the few directors who has final cut on anything he does, so ultimately it's yet another vast mis-judgment by the best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He's currently slated to direct Indiana Jones 5, so I guess that tells you where his judgment is. We're all waiting patiently for him to retire with some dignity, but he's just Brett Favre'n it all the way. <br/><br/>It was a huge mistake for Dreamworks when deciding on the story, not to include Lincoln's childhood, his struggle with schooling, the severe poverty he faced growing up on the western frontier, and how he had to teach himself how to be a lawyer, family roots, his political career, and ultimately, his assassination. It's very clear from the beginning, that this film is not about Lincoln's life, but a very specific part of his presidency,(The Emancipation Proclamation). <br/><br/>90 minutes of this 150 minute film was spent on the 13th Amendment. So much so, that every single member of congress when voting, had their own screen time to voice that vote. It should have been called, ""Emancipation"" or ""ep13"", but not ""Lincoln."" Do not go into this movie expecting to learn about Abraham Lincoln's life. You will be hugely disappointed.<br/><br/>2. There was no sense of space. No aerial shots of Washington DC in the 1860s... no city shots showing how life was back then... just interior scenes, a few battlefield scenes, and a few outdoor speeches. And this coming from one of the greatest special effects pioneers of the medium- lame.<br/><br/>3. No secret service. The Secret Service was created by President Lincoln on April 14, 1865, the day of his assassination. Don't you think that would be an interesting thing to showcase in a movie titled ""Lincoln?"" One third of the US currency in circulation was counterfeit at the time. There was no mention of it. And also, at no point did you see ANY security around the president except for a few soldiers around him in wide shots. It just made it seem even more like a filmmaker trying to tell his own pretentious tale of history instead of what really happened.<br/><br/>4. To much cabinet delegation and congress discussion; not enough ""Lincoln."" Sure, the film made an attempt to show his affection for his son Todd, and you did see some private moments with his wife Mary, but it was all put there in a disingenuous way because the story wasn't about his family. It was hammering the 13th Amendment down our throats the whole film. Did the NAACP make this film? Lol. <br/><br/>5. The cast was too big. There's over 120 speaking roles in this film. 120! That's insane. Daniel Day Lewis was dazzling- his eyes just penetrated you, as usual. He projected the essence of Lincoln (at least from what legend suggests) through an indirect manner that can only be witnessed to understand. He will get the Oscar nomination for this, no question. My prediction- he will win the best actor Academy Award. Everyone else was very good, a few were great- Holbrook and Stratharin especially. Sally Field was good, but not great- and Tommy Lee was his old self- always brilliant, but never stretching beyond his usual.<br/><br/>6. The ending. Instead of showing the horror of what happened the night of April 14, 1865, Spielberg decided to leave out the Ford Theater altogether and instead show another theater during another play, in which a man comes on stage and makes an announcement that Lincoln was shot. Then Lincoln's youngest son Todd, who happens to be attending this ""other"" play, looses it. And that's it. Not only do you have to sit through 2.5 hours of boring film, but there is no pay off at the end (because we KNEW this ending was coming). To show it like they did was almost as tragic as the event itself. I'm not saying show the bullet rip through his skull, but show us the event as it unfolded- don't deny the audience of that emotion.<br/><br/>I understand not wanting to glorify Booth. I get that. But this is history now. It happened almost 150 years ago. And Spielberg didn't think twice to show civil war soldiers being brutally murdered in the beginning of the film, why not show the murder at the end and DE-mystify it for all of us? And if his argument is that this film isn't about that, then why even show that part of his presidency at all??? Why not end the film with Lincoln still living... insinuating that his efforts and spirit still live on? This Jewish filmmaker can make a film about Oscar Schindler and show atrocities of monumental proportion... he can make a film called Saving Private Ryan and re define brutality, but he can't show the death of our most beloved President from Lincoln's perspective? - there may not have even been a holocaust if Lincoln had survived. So Steven, please don't give me the ""we can't show that"" line because you showed it a hundred times in Schindler's list and you won an Oscar for it.<br/><br/>It saddens me a great deal to write this review. I never would have dreamed that I would be giving Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" a 2 out of 10. My advice: Watch this film for a clinic on acting and cinematography- but wait for it on video. I might buy the DVD as a cure for insomnia."
"treeline1","Null","263","471","30 November 2012"," Boring
","The movie examines Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) efforts to pass the 13th Amendment in the last few months of his life. It is a detailed account of his strategy and the negotiations of the members of his cabinet, especially his Secretary of State, William Seward (David Strathairn). <br/><br/>The story deals with the minute details involved in making slavery illegal; conversations between pompous politicians are endless and dry and I found it boring. I would have preferred a biography of Lincoln's life; the nonstop speechifying was tedious in the extreme. None of the dialogue sounded spontaneous; each line sounded well-rehearsed with the result that it looks like a filmed play.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis certainly looks the part, but his Lincoln isn't very interesting or charismatic. His soft, high voice is particularly unengaging. I expected his voice to sound like Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. <br/><br/>For me, the movie was too long and a crashing bore."

You will procure me those votes!""<br/><br/>'As the Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.'<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has done it again! It seems like the older he gets, the better his films are! I was very satisfied with his efforts, particularly the set designs and tone. It was a joy to watch. I was not impressed with the cinematography efforts. It was well done but nothing stood out for me. For instance, Scorsese seems to bring a new camera angle/shot/position in every one of his films. I was expecting more.<br/><br/>The acting was this film's strongest aspect. Daniel Day Lewis brings an historic performance to the screen except I didn't see him in this picture. I saw Abraham Lincoln. He was so driven into the character, at times it was scary. Lewis' vision of Lincoln is self confident, calm and patient. It was in my favorite scene that his patience finally wore thin on his colleagues about the negativity in the 13th amendment. The mannerisms were spot on. His efforts match my personal favored work of his in 'My Left Foot'. His best contribution to the picture was consistency. Throughout, he never faltered. His accent never trailed off and his actions were always precise. He is fully deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field also gave great performances. They brought character and charisma to the picture. I particularly enjoyed the Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field combination. They compliment each other very well. My only criticism of the cast is that there were too many actors. At times, the characters were defined with a tag on the bottom of the screen. I don't enjoy being told in letters who the characters are. I want the character to show me in action who they are.<br/><br/>The Score is very well done in this movie. The team of Spielberg and Williams never fails. The music brings just as much emotion to the screen as the actors do. It helps bring the vision and atmosphere to life. <br/><br/>This film isn't what I would call a 'masterpiece' but it was a joy to watch. A must see and one of the best films of 2012."
"dromasca","6","79","138","3 February 2013"," Abraham Lincoln deserved a better film
","'Lincoln' is one of the bigger favorites for Oscar Awards this year and will certainly be one of the heroes of the evening in Hollywood a few weeks from now. It is made by one of the greatest directors of our time, it tells a big American story and features a big American hero, it enjoys some fine acting and is very accurate in searching into history and retrieving a moment and a story that continues to impact the American social and political fabric until today. And yet, 'Lincoln' did not turn to me into a cinema experience to enjoy. Actually something interesting happens with my relation with Steven Spielberg. The film I liked most is one of his first – the very little known Duel, a minimalistic masterpiece, followed by the wonderful Close Encounters  and E.T. I enjoyed the Indiana Jones and The Jurassic Park series for what they are meant to be – great entertainment. However my personal experience with his 'serious stuff' is mixed. While Saving Private Ryan is for me the best war film ever made, and Schindler's List is one of the best in the Holocaust genre, other stuff looks sometimes pretentious, sometimes too naive. As much as he tries to prove, Spielberg cannot do films about any subject, I mean he certainly can, but not all are that good.<br/><br/>Most of the action in 'Lincoln' takes place during the month of January of 1865. After four years of Civil War victory is quite close for the North, but the ending would have been meaningful only if the 13th Amendment making slavery illegal was adopted, making the reason of going to war and the temporary judicial war decisions part of the Constitution. Timing is critical, as the nation is tired and aspires for peace and recovery, and without the adoption of the amendment the end of the war may mean a compromise that leaves slavery in place. Abraham Lincoln will make all possible political maneuvering in order to have the amendment pass, in a Congress where he did not have the required majority. There is an interesting dilemma here about using 'unclean' political means in order to achieve a just cause and this is one of the principal themes. There are two problems here however in my opinion. One is that the political intrigues occupy a good half if not more of the film, and what we get on the screen is a painfully long succession of bearded gentlemen under top hats arguing and bribing for the good cause. I guess some of the American audiences are more familiar with the historical characters, but even so this is a long and repetitive succession of more of the same, and even the climax scene of the voting in the House misses some of the thrill I have expected. The other problem is the political speak which is attributed to almost all characters in the film. Maybe the script writers used fragments from speeches, I do not know, but there is too much rhetoric, too many historical sentences are being said by many characters (not only by Lincoln) and even in what should have been day-to-day situations. The overall result seemed to me tiring and emphatic. It is actually the non-political secondary threads that seemed more interesting – for example the agonizing decision of the parents Lincoln not allowing their elder son to fight in the war. This dilemma would have deserved a film by itself, a smaller but maybe better one.<br/><br/>Much was said and written (even a cover story in TIME Magazine) about Daniel Day-Lewis's impersonation of Lincoln. He is good but far in my opinion from his own creation in 'My Left Foot' or from Joaquin Phoenix's act in 'The Master' (best acting of the year in my view). The way he is filmed does not help, too many frames are looking towards catching his silhouette or making his profile look like the pictures which represent Lincoln in his time. Again, when he is human, when his words are not taken from speeches he looks and sounds better, but this is only for part of the time. Rhetoric prevailed in the building of this role, and Spielberg's scope looks like creating as many scenes to quote, but less to link them in a fluent story as he knows to do that well. I liked much more the supporting roles of Sally Field as a Lincoln's wife, or maybe the wife of all presidents or great men who sacrifice their personal lives for the greater causes, and of Tommy Lee Jones as the radical pro-abolitionist politician Thaddeus Stevens, a man whose life was dedicated to the fight against slavery, but who knows to make the right political move at the critical moment to achieve the legal confirmation of the dream, at a tough personal price with respect to his own ideals. In a movie where so many characters including the one that gives the name of the film are no more than rhetoric symbols, these two living heroes played by the two great actors make a refreshing difference."

","After reading approximately 200 books on the subject, Steven Spielberg's politically correct screenwriter, playwright Tony Kushner, decided it would be best to focus on the last four months of President Lincoln's presidency and the fight over the 13th Amendment, rather than covering Lincoln's entire term in office. Apparently, Spielberg concurred, concluding that a full-blown rendering of Lincoln's presidency would be unwieldy and the more narrow focus would perhaps be more dramatically effective. He could have proffered up a three and a half hour spectacle, covering many of the significant bases of Lincoln's political and personal life, beginning with the first Inauguration, with full knowledge that it's been done before quite effectively (Sam Waterston's and Mary Tyler Moore's magisterial performances in the 1988 TV movie adaptation of 'Gore Vidal's Lincoln' come to mind).<br/><br/>First and foremost, what's missing here is little sense of Lincoln's brilliance as a master politician. Since most of the movie focuses on the machinations in the House of Representatives, focusing on the fight over the passage of the 13th Amendment, Lincoln's input is minimal. Tommy Lee Jones, as Radical Republican, Thaddeus Stevens, steals the show with his brilliant performance as the fiery abolitionist representative, who ends up giving up his quest for equal rights for blacks in order to have slavery abolished, with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Spielberg's opus is supposed to be based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, 'Team of Rivals'--but where is the 'team'? <br/><br/>All the fascinating characters from Lincoln's cabinet are missing interacting with one another. In the Gore Vidal movie, both Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Chase's political ambitions are dissected and we actually get a sense of what their personalities are like. Here, David Strathairn as Seward, stands around with nothing much to do as Lincoln's adviser. Lincoln actually had to balance the conflicting positions and personalities of the members of his cabinet. This is effectively conveyed in both Gore Vidal's novel and TV adaptation but not at all in Spielberg's 'Lincoln'.<br/><br/>Wonderful peripheral figures who are an integral part of the Lincoln story are lost due to Spielberg and Kushner's onerous decision to ignore the earlier history. The 1988 biopic includes them: Kate Chase, Salmon Chases' daughter, who married the ""boy governor"" of Rhode Island; millionaire businessman turned General, William Sprague; Senator Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's debate rival; Billy Herndon, Lincoln's former law partner and McClellan, Lincoln's failed first general, who later opposed him in the Election of 1864.<br/><br/>Spielberg is more interested in the arcane: focusing on the minor figures from the House of Representatives--now lost to history. Spielberg and Kushner spend so much time on the vote in the House of Representatives, as if this is the defining moment of Lincoln's presidency. Perhaps from a modern perspective, yes! But I found it hard to believe that the bells were chiming and there were was a giant parade in pro-rebel Washington, D.C., on the day the 13th Amendment was passed. The real cheering was on April 9, 1865, when the South surrendered. The end of the war was of course the main concern of the people of the time, not necessarily the abolition of slavery.<br/><br/>Watching Spielberg's 'Lincoln', one can hardly realize that there was indeed a dark side to our 16th President. The suspension of Habeas Corpus and Lincoln's prosecution of political enemies without due process of law, is an aspect of the Lincoln presidency hardly addressed in Spielberg's flattering hagiography. Lincoln's view of African-Americans was decidedly less progressive than Spielberg lets on here. Even shortly before the end of the Civil War, Lincoln was still entertaining schemes of colonization for blacks in South America and Africa.<br/><br/>And what of Mary Todd Lincoln? Sally Field looks a lot more like Mary Todd than Mary Tyler Moore did in the 1988 mini-series, but Moore truly turns the President's wife into a fully-realized character. With Kushner's sketchy script, Field only is able to touch upon a few of the major points of Mary Todd's life in the White House. In the Gore Vidal movie, we actually get to see and FEEL the devastating effect son Willie's death had upon her, as it occurs in real time. Here (like so many of the earlier events during the Lincoln Presidency), it is only alluded to. What's more, Mary Todd's meltdowns (probably today characterized as 'bipolar') are only tangentially dealt with, as opposed to the earlier TV movie, where they are an integral part of the story.<br/><br/>Kushner creates a non-part for the character of Elizabeth Keckley, the African-American dressmaker turned servant to Mary Todd Lincoln. In the 1988 biopic, there's actually a relationship shown between the two women, with Keckley morphing into a confidante, in effect acting as a sounding board for Mary Todd Lincoln's actual views on slavery. In Spielberg's 'Lincoln', there's an unlikely scene where Keckley confronts Lincoln on the front porch of the White House, musing about the future fate of African Americans in the U.S.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is as good as Sam Waterston but unfortunately he just doesn't have a good script to work with. Probably the best scene in the film is the confrontation between Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens in the White House pantry. But because none of the other 'team of rivals' is developed, Lincoln has hardly anyone to play off of here. Spielberg's attempt to examine Lincoln's personal life also falls flat. The melodramatic scene where he slaps son Robert, feels completely out of character! <br/><br/>Before you praise Spielberg's 'Lincoln' to the hilt, go out and purchase Gore Vidal's Lincoln. It's only $4.89 at deepdiscountdvd.com and Sam Waterston is simply excellent as the politician and the man, warts and all! As usual, Spielberg's production values far outshine the low budget efforts on television. Ultimately, one should expect more from the famed director instead of his narrow focus on such an iconic figure."
"minerva1961","1","171","326","24 January 2013"," Unbelievably awful waste of time and money
","Spoiler Alert - specific spoilers in here.<br/><br/>This is the most ridiculous movie I've watched in a long time. A wasted effort.<br/><br/>I understand this is not an action movie - so why start with a war scene straight out of Saving Private Ryan, play that for ten minutes and then spend the rest of the movie exploring the political machinations of Washington and trying to get around 20 votes to pass slaving reforms. Spoiler alert, it was passed. Oh and right at the start the two black soldiers were able to quote a previous Lincoln speech word perfect, thanks Mr Spielberg, completely believable.. I'm sure that really happened.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis spends WAY too much time talking to the floor, there's absolutely and completely no passion from him, he wanders off into little stories that have little relevance to the topic and at one point even one of the senators buggers off because he can't be arsed listening to yet another boring story.<br/><br/>His son wants to join the Army and Lincoln does his level best to stop him, even taking him to a hospital where he witnesses cartloads of limbs being thrown into a pit but STILL the son signs up BUT Mrs Lincoln completely illogically spends a entire scene berating Lincoln for letting their son sign up - that scene was just put in there so she could show her acting chops, it lost all of it's dramatic effect because Lincoln DID try everything in his power to stop his son signing up, no wonder he spends the entire time looking down and talking to the floor, it's because he gets blamed for everything..<br/><br/>The amendment gets passed (hurrah!) but the reasons for each senator changing from a no to a yes isn't fully explored, it seems almost random, THEN it gets REALLY disjointed and amateurish - Lincoln gets shot, Spielberg spends A LOT of time showing Lincoln leaving the house for the last time and next scene it's some guy in the theater shouting the Presidents been shot, next scene its a doctor declaring him dead at home and then some fantasy sequence with Lincoln giving what I can only imagine is meant to be a soaring speech to a large crowd but it was the dullest speech in the whole movie and should have been moved to DVD extras.<br/><br/>If it's not a Lincoln bio-op then why do the shooting, it was meant to be about the 13th Amendment but why add 30 minutes extra about the assassination. This movie was a wasted opportunity, a confused mess which doesn't know what it wants to be, and just because DDL is in it and it's about abolishing slavery everyone is applauding it but even 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' was better than this pile of dog pooh and that's saying something!"
"ellisonhorne","1","145","283","24 October 2012"," Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" Makes Short Shrift of American Slavery
","Last night we saw a screening of Steven Spielberg's film LINCOLN. I do not plan to see this film again; however I would not discourage anyone from seeing it. As I see it, this film is more of a tribute to Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"", rather than the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. <br/><br/>In LINCOLN, Spielberg, with his retinue of John Williams (film score), Janusz Kaminski (cinematography) and David Crank (art direction), gives us an alchemy of film making that simply weakens as we're made to plow through the awkwardness of Tony Kushner's wordy screenplay. Too often I had overlooked the challenges several key actors had in delivering their lines—text written more for reading rather than oral delivery. Odd that Kushner didn't do a better job of translating Goodwin's book, often criticized for being heavily researched yet depth-less in its treatment of that period.<br/><br/>There are numerous artistic missteps that, for me, kept bringing the film down to tawdry and even boring at times. And certainly having John Williams compose a piano solo in the middle of a scene symbolizing the end of the Civil War was utterly distracting, where using a chorus softly humming could have made the same scene compelling and powerful. (He does use a chorus humming in another scene, again a misstep.)<br/><br/>As to the acting, well, other than having to chew with overly huge mouthfuls of dialogue, I enjoyed the range of thespian theatrics. Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln gives a good yet measured performance, hampered at times by the ""Jesus"" lighting Spielberg insists is necessary. When you see the film you'll know what I mean. Actually, several actors get that treatment. To me, it's almost laughable. <br/><br/>Sally Field as Mary Lincoln is good too, but it's the same wonderful Sally Field ""acting"" we see in so many of her films. Tommy Jones, as a powerful Pennsylvania Republican leader, gives another great Tommy Lee Jones performance, and for many, it will be a highlight of the film. <br/><br/>However, for me, it's Jared Harris (Mad Men) who really shines as Ulysses S. Grant. It took me a while to see him through the make-up—which is also a star of the film—but I never got over how remarkably he brought Grant to life, and as close as the person sitting next to you in the theater. Indeed, an award-worthy performance! <br/><br/>Having said all this, among my greatest concerns about Spielberg's LINCOLN are that it overly emphasizes the passing of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitutionto free the slaves. Yet in spite of itself, in a rather disturbing way, the film promotes the idea that slavery ended in the 19th Century. And because of Douglas Blackmon's Pulitzer Prize book,""Slavery by Another Name"", we now know that slavery in the U.S. continued far into the 20th Century. In fact, Blackmon details it through World War II. For me, the film loses power with its short shrift of slavery and its narrow, uninspired focus on Washington politics as usual.<br/><br/>Finally, the most glaring flaw in my view is that Spielberg, in his seemingly obsessive zeal to further sanitize the Lincoln legend, glosses over the fact that Lincoln, aside from his reported hatred of slavery, was definitely not an abolitionist. In truth, he felt that freed Blacks should be sent back to Africa, or Central America. And he was clear that he did not want to interfere with slavery in places where it already existed.<br/><br/>This quote is damning to the Spielberg whitewash of Lincoln: ""I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races--that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race."" - Abraham Lincoln, from a speech he delivered in 1858 in Charleston, Ill.<br/><br/>In LINCOLN, it's as if Spielberg has resurrected the old Selznick touch, but in this case it's in such a heavy-handed way, we nearly lose our passion to care. It's certainly not worthy of seeing again by this African American reviewer. Nevertheless, see it for yourself and report back. We'd like to know what you think!"

","When i knew sometime ago that Spielberg was making a film about Lincoln i thought that it would be great to watch a film of one of the best filmmakers about one of the greatest men in history. <br/><br/>I was totally wrong. <br/><br/>This is not a film about Lincoln, this is a film about the 13th amendment of the constitution of USA, and everything in it is dull and slow. <br/><br/>It is very painful to be watching 2 and a half hour of something that it could be told maybe in 1 just hour or less in a documentary, and for people interested in the 13th amendment of the USA constitution not in Lincoln itself."
"tiagopm93","10","94","183","19 October 2012"," Daniel DL + Spielberg = reach perfection !
","This is my first review of a film. I had to do this, because of the effect it had on me. I went to see a screening of ""Lincoln"" last week, and i was wondering if Spielberg could have done it again, like he did years ago with ""Schindler's List"", for example. And he did it, that's for sure. That's not ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", not even close, but this film captures wonderfully the way the director looks at that piece of history, and though it's probably not the more realistic film ever made about Lincoln (and i don't know if there will ever be one really realistic..), the movie offers tremendous performances (DDL will certainly be honored), a tremendous production design and, not less important,a great score by John Williams, once again! So,basically, i was, still, very surprised by the way Spielberg did it, because it shows a very intimate portrait of Lincoln's personality. And i warn you, this is film is for grown ups, not for teenagers looking for some kind of action war movie about leadership and honor in civil war. That's Spielberg in a kind of different but always faith full way, and i hope it earns lot of nominations in the Oscars this year, and i will not be surprised if Lincoln wins Best Picture in January.<br/><br/>A 10/10, without any doubt ! :)"
"ortonius","2","83","162","21 November 2012"," Do you have to like this movie???
","I rarely review movies but this one is the epitome of one that you are supposed to ""like"" so everyone says they ""like"" it and the honest truth is (I know I'm the exception)this is a terrible movie. Starting with the most glaring problem, it's boring beyond tears with stilted and rambling dialogue which, if it weren't so boring would be laughable. Acting: it's obvious that Daniel Day-Lewis had no interest in doing this role. His squeaky voice and mannerisms made me think of high school plays I attended when my kids were in school. Sally Field looks and acts like an old and wrinkled Gidget and overacts in her highlight scenes. But, the winner of the most horrible acting in the film goes to Tommy Lee Jones as a Pennsylvania Senator who is nothing more or less than a caricature of Tommy Lee Jones. Historically it's semi-accurate and many people will be surprised to learn that ""Honest Abe"" was anything but. His obsession with getting his way in passing the thirteenth amendment led to his violation of the Constitution, breaking of federal laws and bribing of members of Congress. Hmm, a lot like today though. The saving grace of the film and the only reason I would give it two stars is the outstanding costumes and relative lack of special effects that are usually so obvious and glaring in today's pathetic movies which are designed to make money from our sinking IQs in this country. I wonder if anyone will even try again to make a movie that provokes thought and discussion. Sorry Spielburg, but this is a turkey that arrived just in time for Thanksgiving."
"bob the moo","Null","13","20","23 February 2013"," Patient and engaging while mostly avoiding sentimentality
","I approached this film with caution and did so for several reasons. First and foremost, this is Oscars season and this type of film is just what one expects to come out and be showered with Oscar buzz – and quite often these films are found to be lacking once they are out of this period and on their own. The second reason was related and it was that I didn't for a second think that this film would be able to go for more than two minutes without the heroic music coming up, a soft focus being slapped on the lens and someone giving a great speech about the morality of everything while the camera cuts to those around looking teary eyed and yet full of admiration. In other words I worried that this would simply be a more expensive version of The West Wing season 1.<br/><br/>Although the film does rather fall into these traps occasionally, it is by no means seriously flawed since the majority of the film is patience and very well delivered. We focus on the final few years of Lincoln's life, specifically the period towards the end of the war where slavery was abolished by Constitutional amendment. As such the film is about political wrangling and the determination to stay the course with the goal even though it would be difficult and smart politics suggested to not risk the bigger prize (peace) at the expense of an aspiration. The film shows this very well and it manages to be patient without being slow – which is quite the achievement considering that the film is essentially men in rooms talking. The politicking was well delivered so that it wasn't dull but wasn't falsely sped up. The sentimentality is kept to a surprisingly low. It is still there of course and the camera frequently looks for a heroic frame and the music often reminds us the grandeur of what we are seeing, but it doesn't overdo it too much and certainly nowhere near the levels I feared.<br/><br/>Day Lewis is perhaps a given for the Oscar. His Lincoln is certainly a spot on creation – he comes over as heroic and steadfast without being mythicalised by his own performance. He really gives an impression of the man's spirit throughout the film. The supporting cast is so deep in names and faces that it is hard to know where to start; being honest, at times I did find it a little distracting as a parade came across the screen – seemingly all from TV shows I watch or films I had seen, I suspect I could be quite far down the cast list before I found someone I couldn't place. Aside from this distracting a little, it does mean the cast is deep in talent and everyone does well. Tommy Lee Jones in particular adds passion and color to all his scenes and the film benefits from his performance. Field is perhaps not as good – although in fairness I didn't think the personal side to the story worked as well as the rest – and since this is her parts, maybe that is why I didn't like her performance as much. Spielberg's direction is very well paced; shots are very well picked and the camera is very patient in its movement.<br/><br/>Lincoln didn't blow me away but it did quietly impress me. Part of the reason for this is that the film doesn't go all out for emotion or history or sentimentality, it simply lets it happen in the main and manages to keep these traps to a comparative minimum that really helps the film. It is long but never boring, respectful but never overly so."
"Skullbussa","3","52","98","12 March 2013"," Is this Spielberg's worst movie?
","Make no mistake, this is not art nor is it even a movie: in fact it is nothing more than a recording of a play thats only aspirations is to be shown in high school classes across the United States for many years to come.<br/><br/>My faults with the film:<br/><br/>-Spielberg's Lincoln speaks only through tedious, predictable allegories. These speeches are so boring that more than one character simply walks away during it's interminable running. I wish I could have walked away too.<br/><br/>-Black people are treated as oracles and not human beings. The black characters in this film exhibit no manner of humanity and are reduced to simple plot devices. We don't care about their plight because they're not like us. They're heartless machines.<br/><br/>-Relations between races in this film are portrayed in a dishonest way. Black soldiers and servants openly challenge and speak to Lincoln as if he's a fellow black man. This isn't the way things were and pretending that it was (from the very first scene!) simply disallows the film from building any heart, any credibility, any weight or substance. We learn quickly this is not a film about an important American historical figure, it is a (very) liberal interpretation. Since we do not see how poorly black people were treated we do not care about Lincoln's ultimate success with his proposed 13th Amendment.<br/><br/>-Characters do not develop, character arcs fizzle, conflicts left unresolved. What of Mary Todd Lincoln's impassioned speech to Lincoln regarding the enlistment of their son? She demands to be locked up in a crazy house if the senior Lincoln permits his son to join Grant's side. Well, Robert joined the army and Mary Todd is still in Washington. What was the point of that scene other than to give Sally Field something to do? Why are Sally Field and Joseph Gordon-Levitt even in this film? They have no bearing on the narrative this film attempts to tell!<br/><br/>Look, I did not expect this film to give an accurate representation of Lincoln's life. What I did expect is that I would get a tight, entertaining 2 hour slice of our greatest President's most critical hour. Instead I got a pandering, meandering, vapid, and vacuous play- on-celluloid treatment from one of the former cinema greats. This preachy, hunky-dory disease has plagued Spielberg since we were treated to those awful Present Day scenes in Private Ryan. Here it culminates into a suffocating veil which absolutely ruins any hope of this film being a success.<br/><br/>Thoughtless, generic, boring drivel."

","I went in with high expectations; after all this movie has a top notch director, an all-star cast, and monumental subject matter. I came out wondering if I could get my money back, as this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Well, what I saw of it. Fortunately, the theater was nearly empty, so I did not disturb other viewers with my snoring as this disaster bored me to sleep. Twice.<br/><br/>After the shock of wasting that much of my life on this flop, I realized my anger was not directed at what a bad movie it was (and it was a truly bad movie), but what I later realized was it was such a colossal waste of time and talent. It could have been a very good movie, a spectacular movie for all time, but it never even got started on getting close to that level.<br/><br/>As a movie about Lincoln, it devoted very little of the movie to the subject, spending over half of it recreating the machinations of the House of Representatives debating the 13th Amendment. There was some new insight into Lincoln himself, for which Mr. Day-Lewis should be well credited, but taken as a whole, this was a monumental flop.<br/><br/>Mr. Day-Lewis was, by all accounts, able to recreate some of the physical characteristics of the late President, most notably his awkward gait. Several scenes depicted Mr. Day-Lewis plodding away down a hall in a perfect analogy for the movie - a slow, ponderous, heavy, dull and boring. <br/><br/>Added to the bad acting, bad directing, and bad writing were the bad visual effects - the CGI additions to buildings that didn't quite fit- plus all the little things that will appear as ""goofs"" in the pages of IMDb.com as others watch this monstrosity on DVD later."
"baltopro","5","15","24","8 February 2013"," A Huge Disappointment
","After much chomping at the bit, I finally got to see Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"". I'm surprised to say that my initial reaction, overall, is disappointment. It fell far short of my expectations.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie does look and sound great, with good casting and acting. But the experience as a whole fell flat for me.<br/><br/>Why? The movie's PLOT. The whole plot concept was wrong before the script was even started - misguided and inappropriate to what this film could have been, and should have been.<br/><br/>As the title implies, this promised to be the definitive movie on Abraham Lincoln. It was not. Rather than being a biopic, it's a political thriller about passing the 13th Amendment. Why didn't they give the movie an accurate title, like ""The 13th"", or ""Lincoln's 13th"", or something? The movie spans only about one month of Abe's life. It pretends the president had little else to attend to at that time (like, um, the Civil War). And it somehow still manages to run 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I'm a history buff. Getting the 13th Amendment passed was a foregone conclusion. There was never any doubt about it at that point. It was done when it was done to seal the Confederacy's fate and to rub their collective nose in it.<br/><br/>And the single action scene - the opening hand-to-hand battle sequence - didn't feel real at all. Maybe Spielberg intended it to be ""surreal"", but it just seemed plain unrealistic. From Spielberg, no less.<br/><br/>They got the world's most famous director, a massive budget, and the best of everything else to make this movie, and wasted it on a script I could have cranked-out for homework in the 6th grade.<br/><br/>Spielberg missed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expertly retell Lincoln's life, or at least his presidency. D-Day-Lewis' curious portrayal of Lincoln is certainly worth a DVD rental, but this film is not really worth buying or seeing at the theater. Damn shame.<br/><br/>I'm glad a lot of people apparently think it's fantastic. I wish I did."

","Recently I had the opportunity to watch Lincoln, or the more aptly named Lincolon. Two hours of horrendous script and fiction woven by a zealot with a thesaurus who believed that replacing words such as 'empty' with 'vacus' turned his sup-par script into a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The film started with good old honest Abe 'relaxing' or should that be 'tranquilize thy consciousness' on a military camp site with the men but not just men, black men! The mood and tone of the film has been set, Lincolon is grounded and relaxed when surrounded by the people. He's one of you. Isn't he wonderful! Made ever so much harder to believe when we can quote Licolon from his debates with Douglas in 1858:<br/><br/>""I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, — that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, not to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.""<br/><br/>The great political insights I gathered from this film was that 19th century American politics consisted of politicians calling each other farty pants and vacus nincompoops. It was the equivalent of watching 'Dude where's my car' set in the 19th Century. If that wasn't bad enough good old honest Abe was there to make sure we suffered. <br/><br/>Every ten minutes good old lovely Abe would tell the out of depth mere mortals a story that would give us great depth and insight into a situation that would, within a few seconds change that persons entire outlook on life. Half way through the film I began to believe I had walked into a movie about the second coming of Christ. At one point, even the script writer had become so tired of writing Abe's story's that he added himself into the script via a character with the lines 'I know what you're going to do! You're going to tell one of your story's again! I'm not staying around for this!'. A thought probably shared by millions who've watched this film. <br/><br/>As for Daniel Day Lewis's Oscar winning performance. I can recreate the performance right here in text. <br/><br/>""Would you like some tea Abe?"" "".........................................yes, i.... think I.... will""<br/><br/>""What do we do Abe?"" ""..................................This reminds me.........of a time...""<br/><br/>The common people of America with a child like grasp on history and inability to read a book that doesn't have pictures will declare this as one of the greatest films ever made. The historical accuracy of this film rivals that of 'Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter' It's a pure work of fiction and anybody who believes the civil war was about abolishing slavery needs to spend only ten minutes with their head in a history book to know the truth.<br/><br/>I will end this review with a final quote from the white messiah Abe Lincolon.<br/><br/>""If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union."""

You expectantly gaze at the artists work and suddenly realize that you don't get it. The paintings are devoid of meaning. That's how I felt entering the theatre to view this film.

"RaphaelSemmes","2","76","154","10 December 2012"," Lincoln... As Seen Through The Rosy Spectacles of Steven Spielberg
","Spielberg's Lincoln is subtly inaccurate, and for that reason it is insidious and dangerous. There are also glaring omissions in the story line which serve as a detraction. To John Q. Public, who probably has a cursory knowledge concerning Lincoln and the Civil War, this film will reinforce the biased Union perspective that is generally taught in secondary education. The skewed prism that Spielberg looks through in making this film is an anathema to any historian who has done a scintilla of research concerning the war.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of Spielberg's Lincoln involves the political machinations concerning the passage of the 13th Amendment of the Constitution. To Spielberg's credit he paints William Seward and Lincoln as the conniving politicians they both were. Their ""ends justify the means"" approach to the passage of the amendment is depicted without any remorse concerning the morality of buying off potential undecided votes. It is Seward who conspires with Lincoln suggesting that they employ the services of W.N. Bilbo, and others, to corrupt the process and pass the amendment. Basically, Lincoln finds himself twenty votes short for passage of the amendment. Through the auspices of Bilbo and his band of rogues, they systematically bribe each undecided Congressman before finally obtaining the requisite number required for passage.<br/><br/>Spielberg's Lincoln is very passionate about the 13th Amendment. But does this passion actually jibe with what transpired during the war? Lincoln's famous quotation to the New York Tribune on August 22, 1862 would seem to contradict Spielberg's curious passion of 1865. In 1862 Lincoln stated, ""I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be ""the Union as it was."" If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union<br/><br/>Should we believe the Lincoln of 1862, or the Lincoln of 1865? Lincoln cultists would argue that Lincoln simply evolved to this more ""enlightened"" position concerning slavery. However, it's my belief that's much too easy a jump to make.<br/><br/>In Spielberg's Lincoln no mention is ever made of Lincoln's plan to repatriate slaves, and other blacks, to Liberia. In 1862 Lincoln invited a group of free black men into the White House and requested that they lead by example and leave the country. The men were greeted by the Federal Commissioner of Emigration J. Mitchell, who explained that a sum of money had been apportioned by Congress ""for the purpose of aiding the colonization in some country of the people, or potion of them African decent"". Lincoln is quoted as asserting, "" You and we are of different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. This physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both and affords a reason at least why we should be separated. It is better for us both, therefore, to be separate"". That assertion is a decidedly different tenor than the movie attempts to convey. <br/><br/>Another highly debatable, accuracy challenged segment in the film is the final meeting (in early 1865) between the Confederate Peace Commissioners and Lincoln. At the meeting Spielberg's Lincoln asserts slavery is dead. The Confederate commissioners, led by Vice President Alexander Stephens, break off the negotiations ostensibly based on Lincoln's comments. Stephens subsequently replies that the South's agrarian economy is based on slavery, and that abolishing slavery would have a crippling effect on its existence. In actuality, that meeting was much different than what occurred in the film. What did occur, and is verifiable, was that Stephens asked: ""Is there no way of putting an end to the present trouble, and bringing about a restoration of general good will and harmony?"" Lincoln replied, "" There is but one way... for those who are resisting the laws of the union to cease that resistance"". He offered 400 million compensation for the freed slaves, but emphasized: The restoration of the Union is a ""sine qua non"" with me.<br/><br/>Spielberg's Lincoln, portrayed in the film by Daniel Day Lewis, attempts to depict Lincoln in a folksy, homespun manner. Lincoln uses his charm with friends and detractors invoking whimsical yarns at every opportunity. In reality, the stories are used to obfuscate the real issues at hand. At one point in the film one of Lincoln's own cabinet members, Edwin Stanton, becomes so frustrated with the incessant ""yarns"" he abruptly leaves Lincoln's presence. Of course Spielberg's motivation in spotlighting the yarns is to create a more sympathetic character in Lincoln. Spielberg's Lincoln also elicits sympathy through glimpses into his dysfunctional marriage to Mary Todd Lincoln, portrayed by Sally Field. Spielberg's mining for sympathy is a disservice to anyone who has done any real historical research and is aware that the war, which killed over 600,000 of his fellow American citizens, could have been potentially avoided by Lincoln."
"donnielee46","5","29","53","28 January 2013"," A Film for Historians...Plodding and Slow
","If you go to see this film expecting another trite and mundane rendition of the life of President Abraham Lincoln, you will be sorely disappointed. ""Lincoln"" is a plodding account of the 16th President's efforts to pass the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery, which, coincidentally, mirror the final months of his life. Spielberg's effort to lend humanity to another episode of history falls short of the mark. During the initial 10 minutes my wife and I looked at each other as if to say, ""I hope the next two hours and twenty minutes don't move as painfully as this."" Everything ""Lincolnese"" eventually gets trotted out, from two enlisted men reciting the Gettysburg Address (shades of the MGM short of the 1930's where the blind soldier does the same, not realizing that he is speaking to Lincoln himself), to every ""Lincolism"" that can possibly be squeezed into the script. SPOILER ALERT: Eventually, we come to understand how a presidentially approved conspiracy leads to the amendment's passage, but we get there much in the way that we would get from Philadelphia to New York by way of London. Daniel Day Lewis, Hal Holbrook, and Tommy Lee Jones are magnificent actors, and do yeoman's jobs supporting a script that is, at times, laughable. The film could very well have ended with Lincoln leaving the White House for Ford's Theatre, but it still moves on. If the anti-climax of showing Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address was an absolute necessity, I personally would have faded to black with highlights on the faces of Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth, who, in reality was standing only feet from the President as he delivered his speech."
"TheHighVoltageMessiah","9","36","68","17 November 2012"," A Film to be Seen
","One of the things I love about Daniel Day Lewis is his ability to totally transform into his roles. Here is no exception. Stepping into the shoes of the sixteenth president of the United States, Lewis almost seems to become him, body and soul. By the end of the film, although you can still sense something of Lewis about the eyes and mouth, you feel you are in the presence of Abraham Lincoln. You feel the man on screen is a man of flesh and blood rather than another representation of an iconic figure. Watching Lewis walk, thin shoulders stooped in weariness, it seems as though the actor is living what he enacts. He is Lincoln the father, Lincoln the husband, Lincoln the storyteller, Lincoln the statesman. He catches all of Lincoln's political keenness, his idealism, his contradictions, his grief, regrets, and woes in a complex and masterful performance.<br/><br/>Great as Day Lewis is, he does not overwhelm the picture. Sally Field holds her own with Lewis as the anguished Mary Todd Lincoln, heartbroken and haunted by the memory of the death her son Willie. Likewise, Tommy Lee Jones is stunning as the passionate abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens. There is a moment in the film where Jones's character, who has spent the better part of his life in a crusade against slavery, realizes he must compromise his principles so that the 13th Amendment might have a chance to pass. All it takes is one single shot of Jones's craggy face to fully reveal the maelstrom whirling in Stevens's soul.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is just as excellent. Even smaller roles (like James Spader as a greasy, underhanded cohort of Lincoln's or Hal Holbrook as a more conservative member of the Republican Party) are infused with color and life. In particular, I was impressed by David Strathairn's compelling performance as secretary of state William Seward. Seward is presented as a close confidante of Lincoln's, although the events surrounding the passage of the 13th Amendment put a strain on their relationship. You can tell in many scenes that he is caught between two conflicting emotions, his admiration for Lincoln's ideals and his utter frustration with the measures Lincoln takes to make those ideals a reality. Strathairn brings out this inner turmoil – the exasperation mixed with respect, the complicity in actions with which a part of him disapproves – with sensitivity and honesty. It is a true gem of a performance.<br/><br/>Of course, all these performances would come to nothing without being backed up by fine writing. Tony Kushner's screenplay is richly literary and it is a pleasure to hear his words ring out. The film's dialogue crackles with intensity as it is spoken; it can be witty, humorous, perceptive, and sometimes it flows from the actors' lips like poetry. The film is also beautifully photographed. The cinematography has a quiet grandeur, not unlike Day Lewis's interpretation of Lincoln. It isn't overly ostentatious. It doesn't go out of its way to be visually striking and yet images from the film linger in my mind – for example, that shot of Lincoln and his son by the window as the Amendment is passed.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" is a lovingly made and well-written film with outstanding performances. The sets, costuming, and cinematography are great. This is a film to be seen."

I just got back from watching this movie and I had high hopes due to the 8.3 rating it was receiving on this website, however I was sorely disappointed to find that the movie was simply put an overall awful experience. I believe that the high rating is coming from the fact that people are essentially being guilted into saying they liked the movie since it is about a sensitive issue. <br/><br/>This movie simply put should not have been made, there just isn't enough content in the story to justify making a movie out of it, every scene seemed to be just a bunch of old codgers discussing the impact of the 13th amendment.

","The consensus on performance is ""spot on""--there is not a bad performance in ""Lincoln."" In fact, they are stellar. DD Lewis can, on occasion, come off as a bit too studied and slightly transparent, but not often enough for it to matter. All the other roles are just spectacularly played.<br/><br/>However, and it is a big however, this film is often dull, insipid, and overly florid. I have several advanced degrees and can handle didactic films, however, Lincoln stalls quite often with verbosity that fails to entertain and drama that seems, well, a bit stagy. That is my take--there is a lot of room for disagreement here. But I think the bandwagon effect is propelling this film toward awards which from the vantage of performance are probably justified, but from the vantage of all other technical areas, is hardly justifiable at all. Journeyman work,yes, but inspired? Not at all. Despite my reservations, this is still a movie that most people will enjoy.

"s_campanale","7","15","25","13 February 2013"," Political portrait that walk a strange line between hard fact and romantic sentiment
","Abraham Lincoln is one of those mythic figures, like Gandhi, El Cid, Che Guevara, Garibaldi, Churchill, Nelson, Washington, Richard the Lionheart, Princess Diana, who have become legends of folklore, legends which usually hide decidedly grubbier and less pleasant realities. However, because of our Human need for heroes to look up to and inspire us, we usually ""print the legend"" rather than the truth.<br/><br/>Most media representations of ""honest Abe"" falls into this latter category, as best exemplified in the literal cartoon that was last year's ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" which brought things into sharper relief by playing it all in deadly earnest. Of course Lincoln lived only a couple of lifetimes at remove from us, so the truth is there, but we choose to ignore it because we want to believe in this great noble hero who ""freed the black man"" from the sadistic, demonic evil deformed Southerners, as simple a battle between ""Good"" and ""Evil"" as the equally misrepresented WWII, a man driven by an all-conquering desire for equality so strong it even has its own stirring accompaniment of tear jerking violins and moving horns wherever it goes! It's a pleasing fantasy, especially for rich white people who like to pat themselves on the back for how noble and good they are, even though it relegates Black people to simpletons, smiling happy children free of any adult sin or virtue, perpetual victims who need nice enlightened white folk to make their destinies for them.<br/><br/>I approached this film with some trepidation; sure that Spielberg the great romantic would give us more of the same and then some. However the film walks a very strange tightrope indeed. Taken from D K Godwin's dry text, it spends a lot of time looking at the political machinations and double dealing that got the 13th amendment (banning slavery) passed, and is a highly instructive lesson about how government and democracy actually works, including bribery corruption and outright lies. In turn it has been adapted by playwright Tony Kusher into what is really a filmed play with little real action and everything confined to a few room like sets where dialogue carries everything. This is all then filmed by Spielberg, who injects the admittedly very restrained production with jarring and intrusive stabs of pure schmaltz, usually whenever the evil of slavery is brought up, or one of the many prominently (and highly anachronistically) positioned Black faces steps to make some clichéd speech. These Spielbergian moments can be easily identified because whenever they appear in between the political machinations and congressional double dealings, John Williams stirring flag waving music strikes up to pull those old heartstrings! (You could almost invent a drinking game around them, one that would probably get you very drunk indeed) So really, it's two very separate movies, the Godwin/Kusher political lesson being the biggest, with the Spielberg schmaltz in support.<br/><br/>To its credit the film looks authentic, including the dim candle and gaslight level lighting which bathes everything in semi darkness, and most of the characters act, speak and think like people from the 1860s rather than people from 2012 in costume (Save for the aforementioned anachronistic Spielbergian romance moments) both of which are very rare in historical film.<br/><br/>This being a stage play in all but name, it is the actors who dominate, and here we have some of the best. Daniel Day Lewis gives us a powerful version of the mythical Lincoln we know and love (rather than the less pleasant real one) with his homespun tales and folksy charm, stirring passion and quiet determination, and he is gifted by an existing physical resemblance. Sally Field creates a powerful character our of Mary Lincoln, the only character to shine a less than positive light on her famous husband, strong willed and frustrated, all too aware of her position as the wife of a legend, a woman who pushes for the 13th largely because it will end the war and keep her son from harm. Tommy Lee Jones incarnates radical abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, a man too extreme for his time, with the fire of the old TLJ we haven't seen in a while, the brutish, frightening thug like alpha male who can intimidate and crush those beneath him like bugs, the man with the lashing wit and grandiose gestures, and it's nice to see him back again. David Straithern, another powerful presence, plays Lincoln's fixer William Seward. His character is very similar to the one he plays in the ""Bourne"" series, the intelligent committed patriotic manipulator who uses downright shady and suspect methods for 'the greater good', expect here we are expected to side with him. His chief agent is played with amoral glee by an almost unrecognisable James Spader, bribing dead duck Democrats with lucrative posts for the 'yes' vote in a series of light hearted vignettes. Jason Gordon Levitt appears as Abe's eldest son Robert, determined to enlist against his father's wishes, whom even a gruesome pit full of severed limbs can't fully dissuade. Legendary Hal Holbrook lends gravitas as voice of reason Preston Blair while Jared Harris effectively incarnates another legend, General Ulysses S. Grant for a few vital scenes.<br/><br/>For a Spielberg film about war, there is virtually no action, and those expecting a big spectacular will leave disappointed. This is a history lesson starring famous names written by a playwright adapting a political analyst's dissertation on Congressional politics, directed by the master of romanticism and sentimentality, with a lot of unpleasant truth's airbrushed out and replaced by the legends we would like to believe are actually true in their place. It won't be for all tastes, but it is worth a look for those with a little patience."

I wanted to be enchanted by America's past but the only thing to marvel at in this movie is everyone's splendid teeth. It seems even impoverished 19th century slaves could access modern Hollywood dentistry. The only distraction from the turgid plot was the numerous cute views of iconic Washington buildings, with only the Lincoln memorial being conspicuous by its absence. Half way through it occurred to me that only a director of Spielberg's calibre could inject a bit of magic and rescue this movie. Perhaps he might get DDL to pull a rabbit out from under that stovepipe hat. Then I remembered it is actually a Spielberg movie and I felt somewhat cheated. The various political machinations of the ruling classes are very interesting and well portrayed but one gets the feeling the director overruled his natural instincts to wow an audience and was overburdened by the need to ensure the film carried enough gravitas. Pompous, boring, overblown, tedious and long winded, this film nearly had me petitioning for the restoration of John Wilkes Booth's reputation on the grounds of justifiable homicide.

Walt Whitman<br/><br/>A story about Abraham Lincoln's 13th Amendment fight could be a snoozer in the hands of anyone else except director Steven Spielberg and actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Together they bring alive the passage of one of the nineteenth century's greatest pieces of legislation, freeing slaves for all time.<br/><br/>While the Civil War was coming to a close after 4 bloody years in 1865, Lincoln politicked for the amendment's passage, knowing full well that if peace were obtained, the impetus for the amendment would vanish. So politics and war are inextricably tied together, and arguably the most noble American president bartered and lied his way to passage. <br/><br/>Spielberg makes clear that sequestering the South's negotiating team until passage was crucial, if not impeachable. The drama as votes are bought or cajoled is an apt companion to the catastrophic war that cost over a half million lives. Less rewarding as drama is Lincoln's relationship with his wife, Mary (Sally Field), whose depression over the loss of her first child stalks here her lifetime and makes for some less than sweet moments on screen.<br/><br/>But this film belongs to Lincoln, who, as memorably portrayed by Day-Lewis, is a leader of strong will peppered by a sense of humor and a relentless penchant for tales: The story of George Washington's portrait in a British water closet is a hoot. Tommy Lee Jones' Thaddeus Stevens is essential Jones: gruff, blunt, ugly, and charismatic with a dollop of kindness no better exemplified than in his final scene in his bedroom.<br/><br/>Although this is occasionally a heavy-handed history lesson, it is my preferred way to learn. I know now what the 13th Amendment is, and I am aware in our own time of the severity of politics-- that great leaders must also be great politicians, with all the pejorative connotations our recent presidential election can conjure. Steven Spielberg brilliantly shows us that the process can be for the people and by the people and may not perish."

Lewis not only delivers a flawless performance, he  is the President during a time when rivers of blood flow upon America's  own soil. Throughout this movie, Lincoln's 6 foot 4 frame bends beneath  the weight of the obstacles he faces: a Democratic Party firmly against  his Emancipation Proclamation, a Republican Party seeking peace, and  his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln who is still mourning the death of her son.  Madame President, as she reminds Thaddeus Stevens, is an opinionated  woman with a keen eye for the back-door deals and party politics on  both sides of the issues facing her husband. No wonder Madame President  is cursed with headaches. She is morning the loss of her son and aware  of the stakes facing the nation, her husband, and her own children.  Lincoln offers a glimpse into her life and the struggles she personally  faced. Inside chambers, the war between the parties escalates. After  filling the chambers with newspaper reporters, the Democratic Party  challenges Alexander Stephens, played by Jackie Earle Haley, to taunt  Thaddeus Stevens into saying that all men are equal. Stephens, who  believes that the Negro is not equal, challenges the usually outspoken,  Stevens. Warning that should the Proclamation pass the Negro would  demand representation in the House, the right to vote, or could  possibly even hold public office. Democrats warned the Proclamation  would open the door to women voting as well. As a woman I wanted to  stand up in the middle of the movie and shout. With regard to the  actual vote on the Amendment, Spielberg leaves little room to argue the  historical facts. Announcing each Democrat who voted either for or  against the proclamation, moviegoers need only do a little research to  confirm their accuracy. Lincoln not only recounts the facts leading up  to the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, it offers a glimpse  into the life of President Abraham Lincoln, and the struggles he faced  both personally and politically. The actors in Lincoln deliver a  flawless performance. The storyline leaves viewers wanting to know more  about these men who shaped our history. 10 stars for a brilliant must-  see movie."

","First off, LINCOLN is more about the passage of the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery in the U.S. and all the haggling that took place in the House of Representatives beforehand than it is about Abe Lincoln personally. The entire story takes place in the early months of 1865 as the Civil War is winding down.<br/><br/>Lincoln does, of course, play a pivotal role as the central character in his proposal and backing of the Amendment (yet still, kind of not wanting the war to end before it was voted upon in order to keep the Southern delegations out of the vote). There is also a fine subplot concerning Lincoln's life with his wife and sons, all of whom are admirably played. Day-Lewis really shines in his role as a Lincoln who is neither saint nor sinner, with a smooth, velvety, and vaguely southern(!) accent. Many of the supporting cast--most particularly, Jared Harris as Ulysses Grant--are also memorably portrayed.<br/><br/>This may not sound terribly exciting to some, but the acting, storyline, scenery and everything else are so arresting that those people are likely to forget not being all that interested. Along with the vital ingredient of plot, some other best things about ""Lincoln"" are its setting and costume design: This film probably conveys the Civil War period better than any that I've seen. There isn't much actual showing of the war, but a couple of very brief but vivid and ultra-realistic battleground scenes really spice things up. Both in Washington and in the brief scenes elsewhere, the cinematography takes you there in a powerful way.<br/><br/>Finally, this film is very revealing about the ""buying"" of votes in Congress and effectively shows how political processes worked and continue to work. A fascinating bit of historical and political intrigue.<br/><br/>A couple of tips: <br/><br/>--Younger audiences, unless they happen to have an unusual interest in political processes, are likely to be bored with LINCOLN.<br/><br/>--If you aren't all that up on Secretary of State William Seward, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, and some of the various other players, it might be helpful to read-up a little on them before watching this."

","I was so looking forward to this film, but felt let down watching it.<br/><br/>1. Many of the best bits were revealed in the previews.<br/><br/>2. While DDL (and Jared Harris) disappeared into their characters, I was distracted by the familiarity of other actors... Here was Sally Field being herself. Here was James Spader, doing James Spader with a mustache. I didn't find any of the other characters very interesting either, except for TLJ, who was just as recognizable, but he was surprisingly powerful in his range of energies.<br/><br/>3. I was expecting a film that showed how Lincoln skillfully navigated political processes and used his eloquence and intelligence to change minds. Instead, the majority of his fight was outsourced. In other words, he bribed others via proxy.<br/><br/>4. The arguments in the House were nothing but insult trading. No exploration of ideas. No honest debate. And to be fair, this might have been the reality. <br/><br/>5. A lot of scenes simply felt disjointed. Example: the ""I am the President, clothed in"" speech. It was a powerful moment but wasted on a cabinet already behind him. They know he's both President and powerful. That's a line he should deliver to the opposition... but doesn't. <br/><br/>Again I loved the acting by some and appreciated the film work, sets, etc. And I appreciate that it's more of a drama than an action film. Still, a good drama needs to be clicking in terms of energy."
"MartinHafer","9","8","13","22 July 2013"," Perhaps the film should have been called ""Abe Lincoln and the 13th Amendment"".
","When ""Lincoln"" began, I was very, very surprised. I had assumed the film was a traditional biography of the man, but instead it started late in the Civil War--only months before Abe Lincoln's assassination. That's because despite the title, the film really is about Lincoln and his attempts to push the 13th Amendment through the House of Representatives. Apparently, its passage was very, very difficult--even with a Congress made up exclusively of states that were not part of the Confederacy. The film shows, step-by-step, how the behind the scenes machinations (some of which were of dubious legality--such as offering bribes) led to its passage.<br/><br/>So is this a good film and who is the audience? Well, it's actually an exceptional film in many ways. The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful but more wonderful is the care to historical details. The film shows, for the first time, that Lincoln was a very human man--very astute and tricky in politics, prone to depression and anger and not the saint-like guy you usually see in films. It also shows that, at least for the North, that the war was NOT about slavery--and even when the war was all but won, many still would have had no problem allowing slavery to continue. These are very important as they help give a truer picture of the man and the times. The only thing that didn't ring particularly true was the little speech Mary Todd Lincoln made late in the film. The comment about how the future will view her seems ridiculous, as people just don't talk that way. And, whether she was clinically insane or not, she did have serious problems with depression, erratic behavior and all around nastiness! I don't know why the film tried so hard to clean up her image. Still, from the standpoint of an ex-American history teacher, it was a delight. Unfortunately, I really am not sure how much the average non-history buff would view the film--as it is slow and lacks a lot of action. Still, it is a really exceptional film.<br/><br/>By the way, I really loved seeing Secretary Stanton freak out when Lincoln was about to tell another one of his stories! Watch the film--you'll see what I mean."

I managed to stick it out and watch it through to the end probably because I wanted my monies worth. In my and certainly my friends opinion the trailer left us with completely the wrong idea about the content of this film. Neither of us are naive, biased or have the attention span of a goldfish but the film just didn't do it for us although the one and only good aspect for me was the performance of Daniel Day Lewis.

","After all the hype, I had expected something pretty special, but was hugely disappointed.<br/><br/>For me, any film about historical events needs to engage my interest either through bringing the characters to life in a sympathetic way, or by creating a web of suspense, despite my knowledge of the final outcome.<br/><br/>Sadly, Lincoln does not come close on either of these points. I found the characters lacking in any human appeal - I really had no sense of caring about the fate of any of them, and got no real insight into their characters. The dialogue was extraordinarily dull, and the acting was, frankly, very ordinary. On many occasions I felt as if I was watching a stage play from the local rep, with the actors hamming it up as much as possible.<br/><br/>It is as if there is a catalogue of events which needs to be included, and then a bit of dialogue has been added around that. At no stage did I feel any sense of excitement around how the (already known) outcome would be. I contrast that to a movie like ""All the President's Men"", which managed to develop fantastic suspense despite a well known result! <br/><br/>To me the most shocking thing is the way in which a poor move has, with the inclusion of some big names, a big budget an massive hype, been passed off as a great one. It is nothing of the sort!"
"regahsof","5","24","50","23 November 2012"," Very mediocre
","This was a wholly mediocre film. Neither tremendously gripping nor completely boring, it ranged somewhere in between. I did not come away from the movie with a better feeling for the true Lincoln in the final months of his life, and the movie itself was not anything to behold. Of course, trying to capture the essential Lincoln is certainly not an easy task, but this characterization came across as somewhat aloof, with the President frequently telling his unique stories to his own amusement and sometimes without a recognizable context. The historical events were poorly integrated into a larger context, and the way the last four months were focused was too myopic in my view. I imagine this film to be the sort that an AP U.S. history teacher shows when he or she is off of work for a couple days, but probably only because that person teaches in Illinois and showing this film is proverbial in the ""Land of Lincoln."" Although most of the other people I went with seemed to enjoy this work, I left the theater still in search of an accurate and rich film portrayal of one of the greatest U.S. Presidents."

Yes siree.<br/><br/>I have to confess, I haven't seen all of Lincoln. First time I fell asleep after about an hour, the second time I tried but just couldn't persevere with this boring hagiography. I've got better things to do with my life, like wash my hair. It was the scene where Lincoln chats to the troops that forced me to switch off. Spielberg never was an intellectual but, really, this is just jingoistic, dumbed-down historical camp for high school study groups.<br/><br/>I don't expect complete historical veracity, but in this scene Lincoln chats to a couple of black troops, one of whom eloquently puts the case for racial equality, though given the way he spoke, he'd already received an education at Princeton. But then it gets truly nauseating, when another couple of troops come along and begin reciting the Gettysburg address word for word, because apparently everyone had heard it and knew it by heart back then. Of course, the black troop knows it as well, and recites it over his shoulder as he slowly heads back to battlefield, to finish off this drawnout, overwordy, cornball scene, which pretty much sums up the movie for me."
"filmprofessor54","2","24","51","21 December 2012"," The Worst Film Spielberg has ever made
","Wow, what a bad film. This is a two and a half hour long colossal bore that reeks of self-importance, but comes off as indulgent and lacking the gravitas it so obviously aspires to. I can't remember when I've ever seen a film when I felt so aware of the well-known actors playing the roles  look, there's Tommy Lee Jones in a wig, and there's James Spader playing a rascal, Daniel Day-Lewis as the big man, and OMG, Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln (look at those wrinkles!). There's David Straithairn, and that's old Hal Holbrook --- guess he actually still is alive and working after all. It's a reunion of many of my favorite actors from the 70's and 80's. And I'm bored, really bored; how long is this film again? I noticed that this film was nominated for multiple Golden Globe Awards, including the awful, verbose screenplay by Tony Kushner, and the virtually non-existent musical score from John Williams, as well as Spielberg for Best Director, Day-Lewis for Best Actor, and Field and Jones for Best Supporting Actress and Actor. Are you kidding me? Did any of the voters actually sit through this film? All of these people have done some incredible work over the years, but no, not in this film. The best of the performances is from Day-Lewis, but even he can't completely pull off bringing the mythical Lincoln alive for those of us who grew up relating to the man as the face on our pennies, five dollar bills, and Mount Rushmore. This is no biography of Lincoln; this is a short snippet of time in the waning days of the Civil War, when Lincoln was using every political dirty trick in the book to advance the noble cause of the passage of the 13th Amendment in the House of Representatives, the amendment that abolished slavery once and for all. The House of Representatives was every bit as dysfunctional in 1865 as it still is in 2012, an interesting facet of history that frankly comes off as depressing. The most amusing character in the film is the one played by James Spader, the Machiavellian vote buyer who promises defeated Congressmen future jobs as Postmasters and Revenue Collectors in exchange for their votes to pass the Amendment. Jared Harris is also amusing as Ulysses S. Grant, who wants to seize all Southern farms from their traitorous owners and turn the farms over to the newly freed slaves. Ultimately, I think what Spielberg needs to realize is that a documentary filmmaker like Ken Burns can and does make better films about major historical figures like Lincoln, who are so much larger than life that no actor in a historical drama could ever adequately portray them on screen in a believable way."

","The makeup and period hairstyles, mustaches, and beards on the countless male actors in Steven Spielberg's two-and-a-half hour ""Lincoln"" are so meticulous that the characters seem to step from 19th-century daguerreotypes. However, what is high praise for the legions of hairdressers and makeup artists that labored on the film, the comment underscores a wandering interest from the slow, often ponderous proceedings on screen. The film's technical aspects are beyond reproach; from Janusz Kaminiski's atmospheric cinematography that evokes the gaslight era to Rick Carter's detailed production design of Civil War Washington, ""Lincoln"" has been crafted with care and skill.<br/><br/>The large cast of veteran actors equals the film's physical accomplishments. Led and perhaps inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis, who inhabits the role of Lincoln as no one has done before, the performers are credible and often outstanding. Not since ""Forrest Gump"" has Sally Field had a role like Mary Lincoln; although excellent throughout, Field has one spectacular scene that could clinch her a third Oscar and further proof ""that we really like her."" Playing congressmen, politicians, cabinet members, and generals, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, John Hawkes, Jackie Earle Haley, Tim Blake Nelson and others ably fill the outstanding cast. Strangely though for a film about emancipation, few African-Americans have important roles.<br/><br/>However, despite superb technical credits and an inspired cast that boasts Oscar-worthy performances, ""Lincoln"" plods on with words, words, words, and little action beyond afternoon sunlight filtering through lace curtains. While the film recovers afterward, an opening scene that features soldiers reciting the Gettysburg Address to Lincoln is corny and unconvincing, and a number of scenes have ""important"" rubber-stamped all over them. Perhaps die-hard Civil War buffs will relish the verbal sparring, but a lame attempt to create suspense during voting on the 13th amendment fails, largely because the outcome was revealed in elementary school American History texts. However, Spielberg often creates memorable images: Grant tipping his hat to Lee at the Appomattox surrender, amputated limbs tossed into a muddy pit, a clean new Stars and Stripes passing a soiled tattered Stars and Bars that flutters over a quiet battlefield littered with thousands of dead soldiers. ""Lincoln"" is a film of countless elegiac moments, faultless technical credits, and award-worthy performances; unfortunately, an old adage applies, and the whole is less than the sum of its parts."

And, sometimes it's good to seek the advice of others no matter how in love you are with certain scenes and dialogue. The drama picks up in the last 1/3 of this 2.5 hour tour-de-force of pedantry, but that can't save it. You begin to feel Lincoln's pain and fatigue of this nation's Civil War sitting through the drudgery of this basically flat screenplay.<br/><br/>It's becoming a cliché with Spielberg, who gets green-lighted on one epic after another, will probably get lots of Oscar Nominations, but in the end is simply not producing the cohesive dramatic work of his earlier days."

I don't see why this film has so many Academy Award nominations. Sure, Day-Lewis was very, very good, but you may as well have not even included him!. Lincoln had ZERO character development; you get the same old story- telling old man until the last ten minutes, when he just becomes an old man. Tommy Lee, on the other hand, had TONNES of development. Being conflicted about whether or not he should be who he is expected to, pursuing a dream and watching it nearly fail before his very eyes, and critically being in a relationship with a black women which would have previously been shunned. The relief on his face as she reads the amendment is unforgettably intense. Day Lewis' performance was, however, forgettable and sometime quite pretentious IMO.<br/><br/>The cinematography was undoubtedly good. Nothing really special. It compliments the superb set and costume design brilliantly (the sets and costumes deserve a plethora of awards, definitely), but that isn't enough to save this film.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, you just keep getting weaker. It started with WOTW, and then War Horse, and now Lincoln, your demise. I hope you do take Robopocalypse up again, as sci-fi and action are your best genres.<br/><br/>So, overall; A boring film which I couldn't care less about. I wanted to leave, and only enjoyed the bits where Tommy Lee played out some truly hilarious and marvellously powerful lines. HE should have been the focus, not Lincoln. Tommy's character, with his 30 years of torment previously, were far more interesting than Lincoln's (the 30 years is only hinted at, not shown.) In a similar way to Prometheus, this film had its priorities totally wrong. Prometheus, however, didn't have me bored to tears. I give this film 2 ratings; 5/10 for the actual film, and 8.5/10 for Tommy Lee Jones' acting and the Set+Costume design. Overall, 6/10"
"dalydj-918-255175","10","18","38","13 December 2012"," Lincoln is another Spielberg classic for the ages
","""Including Powerful performances from Day-Lewis, Field and Jones, Lincoln is a Spielberg classic of high drama that never fails to impress with such long scenes of political conversation of the time""<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has been one of our greatest directors over the years but lately people have started to be harsh on his directing style and overly emotional instincts, but with Lincoln he has received the critical praise he has not received in such a long time. The film tells a time in Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) life when he wanted to pass the 13th Amendment to end slavery before the civil war was to end. At the same time we see the democrats at the time trying to fight back against him and his goals. In his personal life we see his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) in her deep depression after losing her son also going up against her husband who keeps threatening to throw her in the madhouse which comes out in one of their main fights.<br/><br/>The film does very well at presenting Lincoln not as the statue that we all can see in Washington but as a real man who questions his actions leading to advice being given to him by people who confides in. The realness of the approach to the characters worked so well that even when I was not understanding some of the dialogue because how heavy it felt I was able to understand it by the emotions presented by the actors. All the craft in the film feels perfect down to the smallest detail in the costumes worn by the women of the time. The film does feel dark especially when most of the film is held inside in dark rooms with just one burst of light coming through a window. I believe that these dark rooms were a symbol for the depression that Lincoln went through at the time with the light being the force pushing him forward to achieving this amendment.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis I have always thought was our greatest actor ever for his big loud performances (e.g. There Will Be Blood) but with his performance as Lincoln he has showed he has the range to give a subtle performance and it surely is a stunning performance to his filmography that cannot be forgotten. The character of Lincoln does get to boil over in some scenes with his wife and also in the cabinet. Day-Lewis gets to be funny as this character which is something that I haven't seen him do in so long which was also a highlight. Sally Field plays his wife Mary Todd and she may be in the film less then Mr. Lewis but she makes the best of her time as a depression ridden women who has to deal with life in the public as the president's wife. She gets to break down in some scenes which of course is greatly acted by her but also she provides some comedy especially when she shares a scene with Thaddeus Stevens. Speaking of Thaddeus Stevens, Tommy Lee Jones was a surprise in the film playing this man I've never heard of but playing him so well I just felt for this man because of the performance given by Jones. The cast brought in for this film is too much people to talk about but some other highlights include David Strathairn, James Spader, Gloria Reuben, Lee Pace and many more people.<br/><br/>The film is just about perfect with perfect performances from it's main leads. Written by Tony Kushner the film has some scenes that feel like they are set on stage but either way his written dialogue is special as the politics of the time try to make a statement about modern times. The craft is perfect and Spielberg has done a great job with the film but he is not the main thing about the film because he takes his style out allowing the words and actors to take over which makes me give him such more respect.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: A+ (MVP: Daniel Day-Lewis)"

I have never seen history displayed more accurate in any other film.<br/><br/>The story of Lincoln, you expect him growing up, becoming president, leading up to his assassination. Nope, this is the story of what made Lincoln a legend, as it displays the last few months of his life as he attempts to allow the 13th amendment to abolish slavery. That's the entire focus on the film. It's during the civil war, but that's not the war going on in the film. The war going on is in a room of politicians talking over it, that's the true war in this film, and it is display perfectly.<br/><br/>Everybody grand slammed their roles. Tommy Lee Jones as Stephens, Sally Field as Lincoln's wife, even the two sons of Lincoln. History has been recreated by Spielberg with cameras, and we have the honor of reliving it.<br/><br/>So much goes on in the film, leading up to the vote, and even though you know exactly what's going to happen, it still manages to grab you in desperation. I love history films, I loved how real they made it, and I always did. But compared to this, all of those others are children's books, this is the real deal.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his performance as Lincoln, (according to the papers). The truth is Lincoln won an Oscar for portraying himself. Daniel Day Lewis was born for this role, and nobody could have pulled it off better. This character will be remembered forever, as well as the performer. I am proud to call Daniel Day Lewis one of my favorite actors of all time. As for the directing, Spielberg never fails to amuse me, he always knows what is good to show in history. <br/><br/>One thing I will say is, don't watch this movie if you don't understand politics, it is very heavy on politics. That being said, not all scenes are about politics, but most of it is. But trust me, if you need to take a government class to understand this film, then it's worth it.<br/><br/>As much as I did like the film Argo, I was very disappointed that this didn't win best picture. This is ultimately the better film, very unsure what was going on. But I know what the better film is. No exception, probably the best and most accurate history film out there."

","Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show as the title character in LINCOLN, but by all rights, the film itself could have been named ""AMENDMENT XIII"" as the second act's energy, as well as most of the third, is focused on the debate in the House to abolish slavery nearly leaving Lincoln himself as just a witness to history while a cast of character actors from screens both big and small pound tables and chests alike in a grandiose fashion.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg, and his long-time cinematic director of photography Janusz Kaminski, created a gorgeous movie where they carefully and beautifully frame each shot allowing the audience to play historical witness. Similar to Spielberg's work in MUNICH, the camera is expertly placed, rarely moving, allowing for a perfect spectacle of a scene: be it the aftermath of a bloody battle, the always-smoky rooms where speech itself has somewhere to hide, a rocking chair on a rickety floor that looks ancient even for 1865, or the bright, winter sunlight filtered through the gauze of a window furnishing or a washed-out flag. Likewise, Day-Lewis himself is always framed, the camera accenting on his height, catching the lines in the gray of his face as he bears the weight of a nation divided playing equal parts father, preacher, lawyer and, most of all, grand storyteller.<br/><br/>The film, however, keenly focuses on those individual glances but the overall story itself is not as put-together. A series of poignant, incredibly-acted, well-constructed scenes are displayed; each scene a marvelous production complete with conflict, character exposition and beautiful dialogue. Yet these scenes are nearly staged as free-standing productions by themselves and, other than the overarching story detailing the end of Civil War and the proposition of Amendment XIII, miss any flow connecting them and strengthening that overall narrative. <br/><br/>Again, it is the presence of Day-Lewis who provides the human touch to the drama of politics. Amidst the yelling and the smoke and the death that incorporates nearly every scene, Day-Lewis' Abraham Lincoln has the ability to smile and, in a move completely foreign to modern-day presidents, sit and speak with the everyday man. He knows this is who is fighting his war and also knows that these very same people will find their own strength to rebuild America. Like a grandfather, he has stories to tell bringing relevance and peace to the chaos of the day, just not his with own family where a slightly-miscast Sally Field, playing Mrs. Lincoln, adds embarrassment and strife while Joseph Gordon- Levitt, as Lincoln's eldest, wants to be the attention-grabbing rebellious son but at least maintains his nobility, even when being ignored. <br/><br/>Spielberg elevates the spirit of the man, in a similar manner to what he accomplished with Oskar Schindler, by bringing relevance and importance to that man's place in history. Spielberg shows a man who was able to work both with and around Congress, wanted peace badly enough to fight for it and was taken much too abruptly leaving any future potential into the smoke of history."

","An aw-inspiring political drama, a talented ensemble and a rigid example of consistent greatness through 250 minutes of playing! Set in the 1860s; thus is Lincoln. Centered on President Abraham Lincoln's, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, trial to pass the thirteenth amendment to put a halt to slavery and a nudge up in Negroes rights! Supported by his wife Mary Todd Lincoln, played by the returning Sally Field, and another fierce opponent of slavery Thaddeus Stevens played by Tommy Lee Jones.<br/><br/>Time! I have waited countless years, for a movie of such a caliber and where my efforts of digging up a lope hole would be literally useless! A flawless movie? Strictly and undeniably impossible, But a movie lacking a significant mistake conspiring against its claim for an automatic Oscar win! A screenplay well portraying its characters; profiling them to perfection; there's something in script-writing called ""respect your characters"" where the screenwriter give every character the respect to play a certain role in the development of the chain of events, to be understood and given the screening he deserves; in the end the character is a part of the movie rather than concentrating on one character. Some critics have criticized the movie as too much concentration on Lincoln neglecting the other characters, those critics should first criticize their reviews then upgrade himself to a ""movie critic"". This movie is indeed called after president Lincoln but the screenwriter; Tony Kushner coherently showed the movie from different character's perspectives. Thaddeus Stevens' family, Robert Lincoln struggling with life decisions, Preston Blair's support and his daughter taking care of him, all that portrayed to the viewers. Frankly, This movie had moments where the camera concerted on Lincoln, moments where we'll forget others existed and focus on the remarkable acting and the firmness yet easy going personality of Lincoln; however, That balance of Lincoln and other characters was well exhibited; after all you should expect Lincoln to have a bigger role than the rest, but the trick is to respect other's role no matter it's size; that's the screenwriter's role.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg added his touches that iced the cake, well decorated it and properly presented for the Oscar consideration. His decision for this kind of camera movement is well associated with a movie concentrating on history's political life. A scene where Lincoln; a giant that he is; emerges from the camera or a camera positioned on the soldier and Lincoln's legendary facial structures positioned on the bottom corner of the camera acting like a shadow and then suddenly shifting it's angles; facing Lincoln showing his size sitting talking to his understudies with a smile on his face kicking off the movie with a blink from the future; a future he desires to be an era of equality. Thus is portrayed with a simple yet difficult concept of camera movement! Lincoln to be effectively presented to the viewers must consist of contributions from a diverse four fields of movie production: directing, writing, makeup and finally acting. Steven Spielberg played his part well and well, deserved the nomination.<br/><br/>In life some personalities have opinions different from others, believes that basically distinguishes them from others! If you reshuffle earth and pick every person individually to be chosen to posses beliefs identical to that of Lincoln's in the thirteenth amendment; it would be like picking a car from a bunch of flowers. So is shown in the movie. Thaddeus Stevens ,Lincoln's debater, for the amendment had his dissatisfaction in what this plead provides for the future, in normal ""movie"" circumstances he would agree 100% with Lincoln and edging it all up with a bow and the line ""yes Mr. president"". That was indeed not seen; just a breadcrumb of the screenplay's magnificence's and ability to add numerous life-like occasions.<br/><br/>Life-likeness is the criteria upon which a good movie separates itself from the rest of the disgraceful motion pictures around in Hollywood. People nervously sitting on the edge of their seats waiting in the telegraph room; for news about the war and a beckon of light in a body sits there with no burden on his back, narrates a story for the people there and everybody regardless of the irrelevance of the story; silently listening and being entertained by his great story telling abilities. Moments where he walks around his house wrapped in a blanket adds the life like impressions of the movie. And the need for Lincoln for basic protection from coldness, a giant in physical and heart-form; but a human, nevertheless.<br/><br/>During the course of writing this review I've waited to begin my walk toward Daniel Day-Lewis. Down a road of criticism? A road of lope holes? But a road of utter confession to perfection. I have never imagined I would need to use the word ""perfection"" once mentioning the movie industry, until now! His performance in there will be blood was outstanding but never a game changer! After watching this movie you would be convinced that such a character existed on this planet; not merely a character in a movie played by an actor. I have never imagined President Lincoln in front of me, but in the future when I do, it'll definitely be an image of him. Much the debate I have had about him or Hugh Jackman for the Oscar, I have never been more convinced in my life; Daniel Day-Lewis for the Oscar! I could hear it now, ""and the Oscar goes to Daniel day-Lewis *crowd on its feet, a standing ovation awaiting his arrival on stage*"". Hugh Jackman had indeed fluctuations in his character, moments of despair, happiness all added up with singing, but the simplicity yet complexity of Lincoln's character is definitely a game winner. The steepness of his neck, his method of walking his smiling when looking on the ground that is a diverse character that is a game winner! <br/><br/>250 minutes where you would finally use the word perfection in a concept in a movie!"

","Lincoln may be an interesting film for some, but not for me. I didn't like it. This movie seems like it's nothing more than a vehicle for Daniel Day-Lewis' monologues, with filler lines from other characters in between. People argue, Lincoln interrupts and tells some random anecdote for five minutes straight as the camera slowly zooms in on him, and then everyone else nods after he finishes. Plus, this movie made me see Lincoln as just another egocentric politician instead of a hero.

","""Lincoln"" is a gripping movie about the politics of the most turbulent times in America's history. A time when language was eloquent and even common people had a vocabulary that was four times a large as modern America's. Daniel Day Lewis transforms himself so completely into Abraham Lincoln that you forget he is acting. Everything about this movie is top notch from the script, actors, speech, costumes, to the cinematography. I was totally immersed in this film as if I was watching the events unfolding in front of me. Kudos to everyone involved in this production, especially the screenwriters, Daniel Day Lewis, and Sally Fields who turned in an outstanding performance! I have seen it three times now and would watch it again."
"zkonedog","10","3","4","8 March 2017"," Spielberg Proves That Contemplative Film Still Has Place In Cinema
","Before heading to the theater to see ""Lincoln"", I had read a number of reviews stating how it was ""long-winded"" and ""just a lot of talking"". Because of Steven Spielberg's track record, though, I had a pretty good inkling that it would be a solid effort. Even against those expectations, though, I was blown away by Mr. Spielberg's ability to make a contemplative film as intriguing and engrossing as any of his other action/adventure fare.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Lincoln"" focuses on President Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) dogged persistence to pass the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery towards the end of the Civil War. Other major players in the narrative include wife Mary Todd (Sally Field), William Seward (David Strathairn), Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), & Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones).<br/><br/>The most amazing trait of ""Lincoln"" is its ability to, despite being more ""talk than action"", so to speak, craft a compelling, inspiring tale filled with emotions about politics that still ring true today. The events may be sent 150 years ago, but the material still feels fresh and never boring. Also helping matters is that film only builds upon itself as it plays out, resulting in the most breathtaking material commencing towards the last 30-40 minutes of the picture when all the characters/events have been set up for some impressive climaxes. Basically, it's just Spielberg doing his directorial thing (!).<br/><br/>Also helping matters is the wonderful acting throughout. The auxiliary cast are all well-placed, but it is (of course) the performance of President Lincoln that makes or breaks this flick. Luckily, Day-Lewis should win an Oscar for this turn, as he so expertly captures the nuances of the script and it s sometimes comedic, sometimes somber, sometimes inspirational passages.<br/><br/>The simple musical score from John Williams is, again, pretty much par for the course (i.e. brilliant!). It is a powerful score, but one that does not detract from the words/actions on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I consider ""Lincoln"" to be a marvelous film that does so many things well. Primarily, though, it really makes you think about such tough issues as back-room politics, the emotions surrounding the Civil War, and the weight of the decisions made by our country's leaders. Please, please, PLEASE do not be put off by a few so-so reviews or the long (2:30) runtime. This is a true classic that should be required viewing for every American citizen."
"ian-31724","8","3","4","30 November 2015"," Good Movie, Very Factual.
","The movie Lincoln by Steven Spielberg was a biography about the 16th president Abraham Lincoln. The movie takes place in Lincoln's second term as a president when he is trying to pass the 13th amendment to abolish slavery. The movie is quite accurate in portraying the way that slavery was ended. The writer of Lincoln, Tony Kushner, kept details such as number of votes for and against slavery. Keeping details like these are important to keeping the movie factually sounds.This was a good reenactment of how it was Abraham Lincoln was president and how slavery was ended. Overall, i would say this a good movie and recommend it to a friend as well cast, factual film."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","4","12 February 2015"," Oscar-worthy performances all around
","Once again a fine proof of Steven Spielberg's love and respect for historical dramas, and of his ability to pull them off with dignity and grace. Lincoln, telling the tale of President Abraham Lincoln's attempts to dissolve slavery during the Civil War, is certainly admiring in tone, but not so much that it becomes ridiculous. It paints Lincoln as a man of higher morals, larger than life, but yet it acknowledges his humanity and the everyday side of his life. It shows us both his grandeur and insuperable ability to lead as well as his good humour and problems with his family.<br/><br/>Large part of that is thanks to Daniel Day-Lewis, whose Oscar was certainly well-earned. The man disappears into his role and I have no problems imagining that the actual man himself might have been something like we see here on the silver screen. He especially excels in the scenes that show the joviality of Lincoln, showcasing a man that's above all else wise and beloved. At times his performance comes across as a touch absentminded, which I'm not convinced is intentional, but it doesn't detract from the whole all that much.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is equally talented, with special mention going to Tommy Lee Jones playing the part of Thaddeus Stevens. On the technical side of things the film has no flaws. Everything from costuming to cinematography works as intended, which is no surprise given the director, but the films is all about the characters and there I have absolutely no complaints.<br/><br/>Lincoln is a good film, borderline great even. Its skill and talent will win you over and its message is one worth hearing. It's a shame it didn't win more Oscars, because it would have deserved them."
"ktohman","8","3","4","30 December 2014"," Great movie!!
","This is an amazing movie, hands down. It's extremely historically accurate, down to Lincoln's surprisingly high, reedy voice. Only very small and insignificant details were altered, and this was done only to enhance the effects and clarify the events occurring in the movie. It's exceptionally interesting to view the political strife involved in the Civil War from an insider perspective, and not only that but directly from the perspective of the president that is responsible for it all. Almost more impressive is the visual accuracy. Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Fields are visually quite similar to the original Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln, as are, I am sure, many of the other characters. Day-Lewis is amazing in his portrayal, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt never ceases to amaze."
"burlesonjesse5","7","3","4","7 May 2014"," Exceptional performances and Spielberg's knack for authenticity carry Lincoln
","It's obvious that you know what you're getting into when you view an historical epic by Steven Spielberg. He does his darnedest to get everything right. He's meticulous with every little detail down to the costume design, the musical score, the way people talk, the look of the sets, everything. In 2012, he almost succeeds with Lincoln, a recounting of the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's life. This film covers mainly, the efforts of one of our nation's most beloved presidents, to get a constitutional amendment passed that would abolish slavery. The performances are all top notch and you couldn't find a stronger cast assembled by Spielberg in any of his other films. Daniel Day-Lewis, who won an Oscar for his performance in the title role, not only looks like our 16th president, but impersonates him as effectively as he totally embodies the character (I never met Lincoln obviously but I'm pretty sure Day-Lewis got the posture right too). Along with Sally Field (Lincoln's wife Mary Todd), who is equally good, this film is a showcase for many great, almost forgotten screen talents, to show that they still have what it takes (James Spader, Jackie Earle Haley, Hal Holbrook, Tim Blake Nelson to name a few).<br/><br/>The only fault I find with this exercise is that it's a very talky picture that sort of repeats itself. You find President Lincoln and his cohorts constantly debating the same issues over and over again in scene after scene. Now let me remind you, the acting is superb, but as usual Spielberg doesn't normally write screenplays and Tony Kushner's (he wrote the more effective Munich) script for Lincoln seems almost too accurate and as mentioned earlier, repetitive. Also, it sometimes lacks heart and you can lose interest real fast unless you're a stone cold historical buff.<br/><br/>Regardless, this flick has some indelible images (the scene where Day- Lewis rides on a horse with his head titled just kills me) and an excellent opening montage where Lincoln empathizes with some forgotten soldiers. Granted, this poster child for the Oscars may not be Spielberg's finest hour (2 and a half actually), but it will provide you with a good old fashioned night at the movies."
"HelenMary","8","3","4","12 January 2014"," a masterly take on an immortal personality
","Difficult one to review as it's so multi-faceted. Abraham Lincoln as a character is without doubt one of the greatest, most famous, iconic, influential and brilliant men in the history of the World - especially the USA - and this is an educational, historically interesting, powerfully emotive depiction of that man and a snapshot of one of the most important moments in American (and World) history. The film is complicated to watch in that it's not slowed or dumbed down so you have to concentrate, and the writing is fast, intelligent and witty; I feel that the language was time-appropriate and the accents were good (to a non-American's ear) and Daniel Day-Lewis had clearly worked hard on his mannerisms to inhabit such a well-loved character. Day-Lewis's facial prostheses and SFX were superb, and the costume of all the characters fantastic. Sally Field was also well cast and performed well as Mary Lincoln and the scene where they both yell at each other/over each other's voices was particularly good; over the memory of the loss of their young son. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader were both stand out actors/characters and some of the comic relief of the film, which was a surprising addition. The scene where Spader's is shot at and runs away and has time to run back while the firer is reloading his pistol is laugh out loud hilarious and Lee Jones has some funny lines too, which makes the dryness of the film a little more light hearted. Lincoln also was quite the raconteur and lover of funny tales which make Day-Lewis' character charming too. There's an all-star ensemble cast, so many of the actors are famous faces. One of them, Joseph Gordon-Levitt although a small role showed up how good he was an an actor, and the little boy who played Lincoln's youngest son was also particularly stand out talented.<br/><br/>The screenplay and Spielberg's direction and ambition for this film were of a grand scale, lots of extras and little (apparently) in the way of CGI, which is good, and whilst I can find little to criticise with the direction and spectacle of the film as a whole, and it's emotional force, some of the cutting between scenes was a tad odd and jumpy, but I can't say that it bothered me so much, it was just worth mentioning. I liked reference to his diaries and, I thought, a sneaky reference to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter or perhaps that was just my imagination."

","Extremely important issue, extremely great victory of man against man, of mankind. A key moment in world history that is able to push the opportunity to make a movie on it in the background.<br/><br/>It's really hard to show the drama and significance of the event. Even the director and main character, I think, failed to do it. Same spinning all the time, the end was clear even before the start. On top of all was the emphasis on the fact that with immoral methods you can achieve moral outcomes.<br/><br/>My assessment of the film is so high!, because of the importance of the subject, Daniel Day-Lewis (from his previous films) and Spielberg.

"VeronicaNotHeather","8","3","4","5 June 2013"," If you know going in that that Lincoln is a procedural in which words provide the action, then you'll love it.
","Many complaints about this film amount to people expecting a bigger, more plot-driven story. If you are expecting to see Civil War battles, Lincoln visiting Richmond while grateful ex-slaves applaud him, and his assassination (the money shot moment), then you are bound to be disappointed. Or if you are wanting a controversial, revisionist take on Lincoln as a hardcore racist/tyrant (rather than the evolving and fundamentally decent man of his time that he was), then you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for profound, funny, quirky and appropriately-archaic dialog, complex political maneuvering and subtle characterization, then Lincoln is the movie for you.<br/><br/>As many reviewers have already stated, the basic plot of the film consists of the passing of the 13th amendment within a short window of time-- a time in which it will appear to the be the result of war necessity..this in turn would help in the ratification (in the Northern and border states not being forced to ratify) of said amendment--which is one of the reasons the peace conference scene later in the film is essential.) Okay, if that stuff confused you, then you now know how complex politics (even 19th century politics)were. Lincoln and congressmen have to manipulate language as a means of eliciting change and passing legislature. <br/><br/>Rather than spend too much time on the politics, I will focus on the cinematic qualities of the film. The cinematography is darkly lit and at times beautiful but mostly unobtrusive.. Other than occasionally losing the facial expressions of the actors in the dark shadows of the naturally-lit rooms, the lighting is fine. The editing is also unobtrusive--allowing the actors to just act (in real time.) In other words, this is not a very cinematic film. It would be as effective (if not more effective) as a TV film, but that's not a complaint..its just a fact.<br/><br/>Now to characterizations and acting. I will start with the supporting actors. Tommy Lee Jones, of the supporting cast, is the MVP, giving a caustic, funny, dramatic and surprisingly endearing performance. He's a blunt instrument of idealism and reform. Sally Field also gives a strong performance. However, at times, she and Kushner's dialog are a bit too melodramatic. But, that kind of makes sense considering how much of a diva (and entitled southern aristocrat) the real Mary Todd had been in her youth. Other strong supporting performances include the exasperated David Stathairn as Secretary of the State Seward and the funny and raunchy James Spader as the political mover Bilbo.. <br/><br/>Now to the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. He recently won the Oscar and there has been some backlash over this win due mostly to the fact that his Lincoln was probably the most emotionally-subtle performance of this year's nominees.. This is not a performance of emotional exhibitionism, but it is not an one-dimensional performance either; and the performance is as good as any other nominee in this strong year for acting. Yes, his Lincoln is admirable, pragmatic and smart as hell, but, he's also uncertain at times (about his decisions, the country's future and even racial issues),he struggles to communicate with his wife and older son, he lashes out unfairly at his hardworking cabinet, and he is manipulative and evasive. <br/><br/>He is a story-teller and a bit of joker. Some audience members have found his stories to be a distraction rather than crucial in our understanding of Lincoln. But I disagree. Lincoln's story-telling was part of his political maneuvering (at times used to expand upon a concept, at times used to evade more difficult discussion) but it was also used as a way for him to alleviate his own stress which is apparent by DDL's Lincoln laughing at his own stories and jokes. The real Lincoln did the very same thing--he laughed at his own jokes. However, when he wasn't engaged in political discourse or storytelling, he was a somewhat shy, passive man (not as strong-willed or communicative in his personal life as in his political life)...Like the real Mary Todd once said, ""What {Lincoln}felt the deepest, he expressed the least."" DDL's combination of warmth, evasiveness, subtle intensity, vulnerability, sly quirkiness, and burnout, was pretty much the Lincoln I read about in team of Rivals. Lincoln's humor was described as droll and eccentric and DDL got that down pat. But Lincoln, in his last couple years of life, was also a weary, burnt-out,lonely man--qualities DDL exuded as well.<br/><br/>Lincoln was a great leader not because he walked into a room exuding power..NO, he was a constantly under-estimated man during his lifetime. It was his cunning and one-on-one affability that got him where he was...(not that he didn't have enemies, but people who knew him generally liked him) <br/><br/>For those saying that this film's Lincoln is a mysterious mythic figure, I direct them to the fight scene between Abe and Mary that ends with Abe saying that he couldn't deal with her mourning their son's death because he couldn't allow it in himself. THe lines about wanting to crawl in the coffin with his son and how he has to suffer alone indicate the necessary burden of a leader (and father of another child) having to bottle up his feelings else be rendered dysfunctional if he surrenders to them--these lines say so much about the man. DDL's vulnerability is subtle but palpable in those scenes. Its a performance of great nuance. Those who say they weren't moved, sadly, don't seem to have been been paying much attention. Hopefully, they give the movie another chance.<br/><br/>I rated this film an 8 because of the slightly corny opening scene and because it should have ended after (spoiler ahead) Lincoln's long walk down the hallway. Also, since people already think its long, Spielberg might as well have bulked it up with more personal stuff and a bit more war carnage..after all, lives were at stake when Lincoln postponed peace conferences."

","Story focuses on the passing of the Emancipation Proclamation and does not give the viewer a robust sense of who Lincoln was - where he came from, his difficult journey to the White House, etc. The film is very ""heady"" in that it deals with a continuity of ideas, dialogs, debates, etc. leading up to the passing of the proclamation. I sensed that I was watching a filmed play rather than having a cinematic experience. Very little screen time was given to any sort of visual storytelling.

","No question this film will endure as one of the great historical/biographical cinematic masterpieces, right up there with ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Becket,"" and ""A Man for all Seasons"" (the version with Paul Scofield). First off, Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Lincoln is stunning, fully demonstrating Lincoln's indomitable will, his political cunning, and both his humor and his melancholy. Sally Field as Mary Lincoln shows she is a great actress. Tommy Lee Jones shines as Thaddeus Stevens. The host of great supporting actors is too long to enumerate. Then there is the script, a slap in the face to the mindless pablum so common to movies nowadays. Tony Kushner has written an extremely intelligent, historically informed script about Lincoln's struggle to pass the 13th amendment, and all the legal and moral complexities involved in that struggle. It is truly aimed at thoughtful, intelligent adults. This is simply a must-see film."

","The civil war, the issues of slavery in America and the life of Abraham Lincoln have been told many times, through books, plays and movies, and I say, ""Keep writing the books and plays, and keep making the films. Remind the world forever that freedom is the only way to allow the world to rotate around the sun, that man's inhumanity to others will not be tolerated, and that corruption in the government should be vanquished the moment it is discovered. For this story of the last year in the presidency of Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day Lewis in his third Oscar winning role), the fight to get the 13th amendment passed is covered.<br/><br/>Supporting Lewis in a very true to life visual is Sally Field as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, as strong and determined as her husband, even as she deals with several family crisis while her husband works himself nonstop to bring the war to an end as long as slavery is abolished. Tommy Lee Jones gives a mesmerizing performance as Lincoln's main rival, with a wise performance by Hal Holbrook as Blair, Lincoln's main adviser. Having played Lincoln a number of times himself, his participation is a great tie-in together.<br/><br/>Lewis is never anything but Lincoln in this film, determined with every depths of his soul to achieve his goals. His humanity, humor, self depreciating view of his looks and seemingly clumsy manner are apparent throughout. Lincoln has serious discussions with black soldiers, fighting for the north, paid servants in the white house, and ensues upon his offspring the very ideals that both got him elected and divided a nation in the first place. But as he finds supporters of freedom, that doesn't mean that these people are for the blacks being considered equal, obviously wanting to keep them ""dumb"" and ""voteless"" like women.<br/><br/>Technically brilliant, this is basically a simple plotted story of a great man, focusing on events and issues in an episodic manner. Some important historical characters are either just mentioned or seen briefly, and I wonder if this could have been made with more detail at even three and a half hours and be just as good as this version. An important film, it is the crowning achievement of director Steven Spielberg's later years, as important and socially significant as 'Schindler's List""."

","Most people will be aware that Steven Spielbergs filmography can be split into to two categories Action Adventures and Real Life Dramas and Lincoln falls into the latter categories but that's no disservice to the film as I think this is a fantastic film with amazing performances and a riveting story. When you boil it down the thing that are going to make or break this movie are the performances and they all work especially Daniel Day-Lewis who gives one of the best performances I have ever seen he embodies everything that Abraham Lincoln stood for and delivers a performance that is impossible not to get behind and it is easy to tell that the set backs in what he is trying to accomplish are taking a toll on him. Tommy Lee Jones also killed it in this movie I loved every second of his screen time he just seemed like an alternative version of Lincoln. Every thing Lincoln could be if he showed no restraint. The story of this movie is done in a very compelling way just do using in Lincolns last few months in office bringing the story into focus. James Spader was also extremely entertaining in this movie I loved his entire sub-plot of trying to get votes for the amendment and truly stole every scene he was in (except from any scene he had with Day-Lewis). Spielberg directs the film in a way to ensures that the audience is never bored and he doesn't do it in a lazy way by cutting the camera constantly he ensures that something visually interesting is always happening on screen. However my only flaw with this movie is the fact that we never truly saw with our own eyes what Lincoln was fighting for we never see slaves suffering and begging for freedom in fact most of the slaves seen in the movie are treated reasonably well. Of course I understand why one would want to end slavery I just think I would have made for some more compelling scenes in the film. <br/><br/>Lincoln is one of my favourite Steven Spielberg movies with amazing performance and a compelling and riveting story. <br/><br/>A-91%"

"g-bodyl","9","4","6","2 May 2014"," An Incredible History Lesson!
","For those of you who do not enjoy history or politics, I wouldn't watch this film. But for once, there is a historically accurate and rather entertaining film based on one of the greatest Presidents of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. This film will take you behind the scenes and in the mind of ""Honest Abe"" as he tries to pass the Thirteenth Amendment in Congress. This film is beautiful film in many regards. It has blissful cinematography, a subtle but great score by John Williams, great direction by Steven Spielberg, and just top-notch, amazing acting.<br/><br/>Spielberg directed a story about Abe which focused mainly in the last few months of his life. As the Civil War drags on, there is a battle between Lincoln's 13th Amendment which will end slavery and Democrats in Congress who are supporting the end of the war and not the bill.<br/><br/>The one thing that carries a film like this is the acting and everyone puts on an acting clinic here. Let's start with Daniel-Day Lewis, the greatest actor of our generation. The passion he brings to each project is amazing and because of Daniel, we see what kind of man Abe was. I want to say this is his best role, but every role he's done, they just been so amazing. All I can say is that he deserves his Oscar for this film. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens is wonderful and another great performance. Sally Field brings emotional depth as Mary Todd Lincoln in her amazing performance. We get good performances from Joseph-Gordon Levitt, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, and so on. Such a wonderful cast assembled for this film.<br/><br/>Overall, Lincoln is a politically-rich film, but we see the man Abe was as he was always telling stories, no matter his stress. He was a man with a sharp tongue and always had a plan. We see the fragile complexion of Mary Todd as she cares for her family. This is a passion project by Spielberg and through his direction of the film, we can tell. For those of you expecting action, don't watch this. It's very political and there are lots of a dialog, some which may seem dry. But, I was hooked on to every single word. This film brings emotion to the film and if this was not a movie, Lewis would be a perfect Lincoln. I rate this film 9/10."
"Buddy-51","9","4","6","19 January 2014"," A great historical film
","For his biopic ""Lincoln,"" rather than try to cram a man's entire life into a two-and-a-half-hour running time, Steven Spielberg has wisely chosen to keep the focus circumscribed and narrow: on the winter of 1865, four years into the Civil War, as the President works to secure passage of the highly controversial 13th Amendment, which, when ratified, will abolish slavery as an institution in the United States for all time to come. Lincoln's main hope is to convince a skeptical and still highly racist public that such a move is essential to bringing an end to a war that has already claimed 600,000 of their young men's lives. The obstacles that remain are the Democrats in Congress who are universally opposed to such a move and many Republicans who think this constitutional amendment may well pave the way to universal suffrage, with not just blacks but women ultimately being given the right to vote. Lincoln's major hope is to convince a sufficient number of lame duck Democrats to come over to his side, while not allowing the amendment's passage to throw a monkey wrench into any possibility of surrender on the part of the Confederacy.<br/><br/>A man of both faith and reason, pragmatism and passion, Lincoln knew that he stood on the threshold of history, that he needed to act decisively and at that very moment to wipe out the scourge of slavery that, since the young nation's inception, had brought shame and evil to a republic ostensibly founded on the concept that all men are created equal.<br/><br/>The movie beautifully captures Lincoln as a man bowed down by the burden of his position and the times in which he not only lived but played so vital a role in shaping, a brilliant but self-effacing man, keenly cognizant of his humble beginnings, as ready to lend an ear to the lowliest foot soldier or telegraph operator as to the greatest general or politician - indeed more eager in some cases, for he knew that the common man often had more honesty in his answer and wisdom in his soul than the great one.<br/><br/>This is the man whom screenwriter Tony Kushner and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, upon whose book ""Team of Rivals"" the movie is based, present to the audience.<br/><br/>But that isn't all. The movie also functions as both a fascinating look into the events of the time and as an illustration of how even the noblest advances in human history have often arisen out of a messy combination of moral compromise and shady back-room deal-making. The most obvious embodiment of that is Thaddeus Stephens (played with solid conviction and a sly self-awareness by Tommy Lee Jones), a Republican Congressman who has to weigh his strong abolitionist views against the pragmatic need to get things right.<br/><br/>The script encompasses Lincoln's domestic circle as well, as it explores the complex relationship between Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), a brutally frank, sharp-tongued woman frequently brought low by debilitating migraines and steeped in grief over the loss of their young son, Todd, a few years back. We also see the effect of all this on the Lincolns' oldest son, Robert (Joseph Gordon- Levitt), who is forced to live in the shadow of a great man, convinced he will never be able to live at peace with himself unless he is allowed to fight alongside all the other boys of his age on the field of battle.<br/><br/>A host of familiar faces - David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Walter Goggins, James Spader, S. Epatha Merkerson, among them - flesh out the canvas. And what a glorious canvas it turns out to be, thanks to meticulous set decoration and costume design as well as cinematography by the great Janusz Kaminski that filters the action through duskily-lit interiors and near-sepia-toned exteriors.<br/><br/>Of course, ""Lincoln"" would not be the triumph it is without the exemplary performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, who manages to turn a towering figure of history into a recognizable human being. Stoop-shouldered and slow of speech and motion, Day-Lewis conveys the quiet gravity that allows us to understand just how this one man could command the respect of so many of the people of his time and, in so doing, move mountains.<br/><br/>All involved have made ""Lincoln"" a portrait worthy of its subject."
"iamyuno2","9","4","6","4 January 2014"," A Near-Great Movie And The Best Of The Year
","Ignore the bad reviews and the lesser ratings given this picture. This is out-and-out a great, great film (even though it gets one or two details wrong - like the way Connecticut voted on the bill in question), with many great cameos and performances by some of the greatest actors of our day - not to mention the work of one of our greatest directors and movie minds ever, Stephen Spielberg.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis (as Lincoln) is brilliant here - as are Tommy Lee Jones (as Sen. Stevens), Sally Field (as Mary Lincoln), David Strathairn (as William Seward) and many other fine actors - in bringing an important but little-told part of history to life, with all of its many colors and nuances.<br/><br/>And here's a side of Lincoln we haven't seen before - Lincoln the impatient and demanding power-broker. When he wanted to get something done, he wanted it done, it seems - and he knew how to get it done (even if it took some scheming to accomplish what he wanted to achieve). Mary's active role in the Lincoln Administration is also brought to life here in a way you don't see in other films. (In most other films, all they do with Mary is portray her growing madness, just one side of the picture.)<br/><br/>This movie is the work of heavyweights and deserves recognition for its greatness. What an accomplishment! And it makes you feel like you were right there, at a pivotal and intense time in this nation's history, with much at stake. If you want to see what a great President looks like, look no further.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie achieves a quality level rarely seen in modern films and you absolutely need to see it!"
"thrwmbsbgkdoepmcjrmrdw","10","4","6","15 September 2013"," Great movie
","I love, love, love this movie! I can't say enough great things about it. I'm so glad that Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar, it was so well deserved. I thought that Sally Field was robbed of the Oscar. This is not just a wonderfully great film, but an educational one as well. I learned things about that time period and Lincoln that I had either forgotten or never knew. I just loved it all the way through from start to finish. All the actors were great. I think that the guy who played Seward was a bit overlooked as I felt he was just as good as Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. I saw this film three times in the theater, it is that good. It's well acted, well directed, well edited, well put together and an A+ film. If you haven't seen yet, don't delay go rent it today."

","Of course if you did watch this in 2012 or 2013, there is the elephant in the room that we have to talk about. Actually it's more a vampire hunter than an elephant, but you get the point. There was this other ""biopic"" that wasn't actually accurate, though it did try to encapsulate Lincoln too. A more action orientated Lincoln that was. Daniel Day Lewis on the other hand, plays it very subtle. Actually he plays it so subtle, that Tommy Lee Jones is allowed to shine in a way, that you are not used seeing him.<br/><br/>Of course Tommy Lee's ""character"" does have great lines, but also serves a purpose. And while this movie is not meant to be political, it does show (or should show), that republicans once had some sense in them. You wonder where it all went, when you watch abominations such as Fox ""News"". But that's a different story (though it obviously will lead to ""helpful/not helpful"" votes from some). Going back to the acting side, we also have Sally Fields in a very tough role. But she is more than convincing in that as well.<br/><br/>Some write that Spielberg is maturing. He might be, but it's not like he wasn't able to direct before. It just might be, that his interests lie in different things now. You might still need to read a book, which isn't a bad thing, but the movie does serve a purpose and is entertaining"
"xatian11968","2","22","52","16 November 2012"," Wait for the DVD to come out, or buy a Lincoln Standee.
","Though I went to this film with great hopes of some artistic integrity teamed with a modern lens, I was very disappointed in ""Lincoln."" It is yet another poorly executed film with all the best intentions that fails to do anything more than add yet another bad time piece to a long line of dull stereotypical portrayals of Lincoln and Washington D.C. in 1865 Civil War America.<br/><br/>All around this film is best seen at home; where the viewer can willfully decide to change the channel, or stop the DVD gladly knowing he paid little more than a dollar at the rental machine as opposed to suffering through a $15 dollar ticket ""razzie"" nominee. This film is a grotesque platitude to the 2012 genre of politically correct films that does nothing more than prop up a Daniel Day Lewis pretending to be Lincoln - where a cardboard standee of Lincoln would do just fine. For all those people who find this movie gripping or amazing, I can only say that these are the same people that would find paint drying compelling.<br/><br/>A recent movie ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" did far more to add to the collection of time piece films than this awful Spielberg work. In the former vampire film, Lincoln is human and believable with a Mary Todd that is both alive and strikingly relatable. In Sally Fields' portrayal she is ""the"" faded photograph that is deservedly buried under the annals of more agreeable history. Fields' Todd Lincoln is both an anachronism of bad 1980s housewives, and a questionable recreation of a history you can't but help scratch your head asking, is this really how the 17th First Lady was? The staging of the film was needlessly dark. We all get this is a time piece, but Spielberg decided against better judgment that 1865 was the literal dark ages, as most of the scenes were shadowy juxtaposed against glaring back lighting the flooded out most detail of the sets, the costuming, and the actors themselves. The lighting designer was a willing accomplice as the only bright and lively scene of remark in the film was the white washed facades of a far too bright Capital that architecturally looked no different than the White House. All the manner of costuming also seemed to find inspiration in the clothes rubbish bin that even Fieval from ""Fieval Goes West"" would be apt to pass on as just outright dull for humanity.<br/><br/>But let's return to Daniel Day Lewis. I had difficulty discerning whether he was portraying Abe Lincoln or fellow modern day actor Jay Baruchel. Lewis' portrayal was forgettable at how unremarkable it was; as I said before, a cardboard standee would have made a better performance because cardboard can't speak. Lewis was so full of himself in his portrayal of Abe Lincoln, his monotonous rehashing of Lincoln quotes was like watching a high school acting troop trying to pull a full blown production of Macbeth, and carried the same acting value.<br/><br/>The rest of the ensemble did little to add/ save the film, and in some cases made it worse. The Lincoln sons were well dull. Lincoln's cohorts weren't portrayals of fellow contemporaries, but came off as - Lincoln turned religious icon - subscribers bowing to a man who couldn't utter a wrong opinion. Todd Lincoln's lady in waiting was questionable and utterly lost in the PC portrayal of the Free African life let alone the slave situation. And the free Africans themselves were relegated to the peanut gallery as mere props. In one scene, an entire telegraph war communications room fell silent so Lewis' Lincoln could wax plastically on the strategy of his legacy. All around, the dynamics of the economic war that was the Civil War was lost in the political correct portrayal that only went so far as to say that ""slavery was bad, mmkay"" and did nothing to illustrate the situation in the House of the Representatives of the Nation at war up to that time.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, Jared Harris, Christopher Boyer, et al. – all great men who struggled to do their best in a film that struggled to even do just okay. And the stereotypical final Ford's Theatre scene is omitted, after Spielberg painstakingly forces the viewer to sit through January to April 1965, and then the viewer isn't even invited into Spielberg's Ford's Theatre. Overall, this film was a sad attempt among many sad attempts to bring to life History. That being said, perhaps Lincoln's true life can't be envisioned without bowing to the religious following Lincoln's legacy has become, where the man can do no evil because he was never human to begin with"
"micool123","4","11","23","29 January 2013"," Dialogue heavy.
","This is a beautiful looking film with excellent acting and for that at least it can not be faulted. However after sitting through the film in the cinema and then realising that the time seemed to drag, I have to criticise this film. The problem I found, was that the script was far too dialogue heavy, I was left wanting to be shown a story and instead having it explained to me in lengthy debates taking place in 2 or 3 rooms. We never really get shown what Lincoln is fighting for, this is only really hinted to us through dialogue and the rare few shots. I would have like this to have been more of a visual story and I feel that this was something that was highly lacking because the majority of the film takes part in a few sets and we never explore the world outside. I understand that this was a political biopic so of course there is going to be a fair amount of dialogue, however for me it was too much. This left me feeling detached from the overall narrative and although I thought the acting was superb, there was too much explaining in places where I wanted to be shown."
"skimberley","5","11","23","21 January 2013"," Tedious and boring
","With Stephen Spielberg directing, multiple nominations for Golden Globes, Oscars and BAFTAs, and a very high IMDb rating, I had high expectations for this film. Without doubt the actors performed well, but for a non- American, with a less than comprehensive knowledge of the history of the period, it was tedious, dull and boring. It is essentially a drama of politics, with endless political dialogue. The reputed greatness of Lincoln the statesman, certainly did not come across. Not having read reviews before watching I was expecting some kind of biopic spanning Lincoln's lifetime, but what we are presented with is a few months of his life and a lot of detailed political maneuvering!"
"sashank_kini-1","9","7","13","16 March 2013"," Steven's Lincoln is an Important Film Made and Played With Such Seriousness You Feel Proud To Be A Part Of The Experience
","Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' is so dignified and composed in depicting the endeavor of the Sixteenth President of United States that you feel proud to witness the victory achieved by its characters. It is a movie which makes you want to get up on your feet at the end and stand in silence for two minutes as a mark of tribute to Mr. President. Steven Spielberg makes his film keeping in mind that it isn't snazzy camera editing and unusual angles that will supply the strength that this film requires, but the careful and thorough understanding and execution of its central themes with the help of a perfect cast. Spielberg had an array of options to alter the cinematography of his film to make it more fast-paced and create tension using swifter camera movements, but he does not use innovative techniques because he knows that it wouldn't work here. He wants us to listen closely to every spoken and unspoken word and feel the crucial significance of the subject matter.<br/><br/>There are heavy dialogues involving constitutional amendments, slavery, Euclid's principle etc and we can choose to skip all this and concentrate on the popcorn in our hands or pay attention, and when we do the latter we rejoice along with the film's characters when victory is attained. There was a 'groupie' of youngsters who left the hall when Mr. Lincoln was gravely pondering about some matter in the first half, and I was relieved those idiots left because they were obviously little interested in the subject and would certainly not have found a reason to celebrate later. I, on the other hand missed about fifteen minutes in the beginning and yet found myself extremely engrossed by every word of dialogue spoken by brilliant actors in Lincoln, and later got to share their joy and victory as if it was I who had attained emancipation.<br/><br/>The groupie that left the hall had possibly bunked their college lecture or got to know that it was Spielberg's film or had glanced at the online ratings for Lincoln. I do not think they truly what the subject matter was and just came in thinking that they were going to see Lincoln jumping off a building evading knife-wielding Democrats. Lincoln's actual concern is the pursuit to find a solution to end the Civil war and pass the 13th amendment for abolishment of slavery in the Constitution. President Abraham Lincoln is the central instrument in bringing an end to both the crisis and the unjust legislation, but what we realize here is that it isn't an aggressive, outspoken and impractical Lincoln who's leading the party but an extremely sensible, persuasive, down-to-earth and astute (sometimes crafty too) Lincoln who's responsible for orchestrating the historical events. <br/><br/>He is very much like the director of a play, staying behind-the-scenes to let his party do the battle for him in the parliament while formulating the most carefully planned strategy to achieve enough support for success. Not once do we see him personally countering the Democrats but hear his voice through the voices of his supporters, which includes radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens who brings in the blunt and fiery force that Lincoln outwardly lacks. The movie hardly takes us to the scene of the actual war (we only get to see the gory aftermath), instead choosing to concentrate on the political battlefield between Democrats and Republicans in finding a solution to the war. We also get glimpses from Lincoln's personal life: his relationship with his strong- willed yet intensely caring wife Mary and some touching moments involving Lincoln and his youngest son Tad. And yes there is Lincoln's elder son Robert but the character is very forgettable because of Josh Gordon Levitt's underdeveloped interpretation of him. <br/><br/>In one of the scenes involving Lincoln and Robert, Lincoln remarks that he does not believe in people who prophesize too much; yet when the voting for the thirteenth amendment ends, we see Lincoln celebrating his victory embracing Tad in his office. This moment very subtly shows that Lincoln himself has predicted how his son's future shall be (one with relatively less inequality). This is just one of the many beautiful moments that brilliantly justify the themes of equality, freedom, courage, perseverance, heroism and compassion. Nothing (at least to me who is more open-minded to optimistic resolutions) to me sounded preachy or maudlin partly because Tony Kushner pens the script so well, allowing us to have moments of great fun with Thaddeus' irresistible zingers and the entire voting session with its twists and turns. <br/><br/>And more importantly it is the cast that makes us root for the movie's characters. Just listening to Daniel Day Lewis' calm yet extremely effective vocal delivery made me accept him as the President of the United States. Lewis is also supported by the camera work which circles around him and his audience (to whom he is directing something or just telling a story –a profound story) till it slowly pans and zooms into his face and we are all ears to him. The most astonishing part was how Lewis showed Lincoln's gradual aging through a slight crackle in his voice and an avuncular sparkle in his eyes that many older people, especially grandfathers have. While Sally supports Lewis effortlessly in her scenes, it is Tommy Lee Jones who nails Thaddeus so well that we are just as emotionally involved with his character as we are with Lewis'.<br/><br/>Comedienne Joan Rivers said on her show she 'found Lincoln so boring, although the movie had everything'; well, I think Rivers envied Thaddeus' character because he gave her still competition in repartee. I believe an important subject or person should be treated with highest seriousness and regard, and Spielberg does exactly that. 'If you want fluff, go watch a Katherine Heigl movie!'... I know I've begun sounding like Thaddeus Stevens now, but why I shouldn't when I believe in Spielberg's 'Lincoln'."
"jaddeo","5","15","34","5 December 2012"," Boring, dull and plodding but excellently acted
","I know I'm in the minority but this film is very boring. The first hour drags on and on explaining the 13th Amendment and it could have been edited down to a 10 or 15 minute seen. It's a pondering movie. I'm not sure what the revelation is about Lincoln in this movie. He's portrayed as he always has been: a revolutionary leader, great mind, folksy and very political when need be. The most interesting part of the movie is his relationship with his wife played by Sally Field. When she comes on the scene at least we have some fire, drama and neuroses. The rest of the film is a good old boys club and quite frankly not very entertaining. You could argue, I guess, that the political content is the guts of the film but it's not presented in an interesting way. The acting is exceptional but I consider this film as disappointing as the MGM 1936 Crawford vehicle about Andrew Jackson directed by Clarence Brown: The Gorgeous Hussy. In that film as well there is an exceptional cast dragging their weight to make something interesting out of American History. This is a modern day version of a bloated, antiquated Hollywood bio picture. Paging Wilson anyone???"
"cubsckc","5","12","26","21 November 2012"," Best Movie... Seriously?
","Looking at the reviews, I wanted to be completely blown away by this movie when I went to see it. I saw the new James Bond film and Twilight, and to my surprise they actually exceeded my expectations. The movie Lincoln started off very interestingly. I would say that they really had some good actors, and as far as an Abraham Lincoln... damn did they do a mighty good job. We are all taught as kids that the Civil War is about slavery, though that is pretty inaccurate, I think anyone can play along. But this movie really was depicted inaccurately, that in a way I find it insulting. As a historian, one of the wars that got me into learning about History was the Civil War and how devastating it was for both sides. This movie took away from that and basically just made it a war about slavery. I also thought the acting was so cheesy. You have the big bad southerners who's speech is so unattractive, mean, nasty. Then you have the smart northerners who are just so smart at saying what they are saying, they even make the audience snicker. The Blacks were all dressed in expensive nice looking clothing. Seriously? And now for some reason they all turned out to live in the streets of New York and Chicago. About 80% of the union soldiers were black. If you do a little more research you'll find they were for the most part immigrants. The lines everyone said in this film were all stereotypical, made up, and cheesy. It was like everyone was trying to be poetic every single time they spoke. Lincoln and his wife are fighting and they are basically just arguing poetically. SOOOO CHEEESY! <br/><br/>A few other things I didn't like were how cold Lincoln was made to appear. He actually wanted to end the war and preserve the Union. I also think this movie was pretty long. It was too long. The Gettysburg movie showed a better depiction between north and south and clearly showed how devastating and cruel the war brought one another. It did it in about the same amount of time. What's even sadder is that you only see Lincoln's last few months as President. It hardly gives you a good picture of what he was as a leader. <br/><br/>So in other words, you have a long movie that is historically inaccurate, really unnecessarly poetic and cheesy. WHY DID YOU GUYS SAY IT WAS AN 8 OUT OF 10?!!! Bad taste in movies guys. I will never watch this movie again. I can tell you what, I will watch most movies that aren't so good or even bad for the sake of spending ones time. But this movie really was too extreme to sit through again. I watched Lord of the Rings SO many times. EVEN THOSE MOVIES DON'T DRAG ALONG LIKE THIS ONE!<br/><br/>Best movie of the year? Seriously? Biggest disappointment of the decade! You had wonderful actors, an awesome director, and the story plot was already written out with history books. You also had the best president in the last century. NO WAY THE BEST MOVIE. What the heck is wrong with you guys? My only hope is there will be enough people after twilight that will put this rating at the right rate."
"tyler-harrell","9","16","37","9 November 2012"," Lincoln is a Revealing, Captivating Look at U.S. History
","Just give them the damn Oscars already! That was my reaction when word first went around that Steven Spielberg was making an Abraham Lincoln biopic, with Daniel Day-Lewis playing the ill-fated 16th president. With a top-notch cast, ""Lincoln"" lives up to expectations and delivers a revealing look at arguably the most important figure in American History.<br/><br/>If you're expecting to see large-scale, graphic depictions of Civil War battles, you may be disappointed. The film is loosely based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."" It covers Lincoln's final months as he juggles the seemingly impossible task of passing the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery and trying to end the Civil War.<br/><br/>Though nicknamed ""Honest Abe,"" the film portrays Lincoln less as a saint and more as a tactful politician. With 20 Democratic votes needed to pass the 13th Amendment, Lincoln enlists the help of Republican radical Thaddeus Steven (Tommy Lee Jones) and W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), whose back-door politicking and shady deals are necessary to help sway the votes of the opposition and change the course of history forever.<br/><br/>Irishman Day-Lewis immerses himself into the role of an American icon. Sure, he's got the towering gaunt looks, but this isn't your gruff-voiced and stoic Lincoln in prior portrayals. Day-Lewis' high tenor vocal projection (often noted by historians) commands your attention during his (obligatory) philosophical and expertly worded stories and speeches. His steely gazes and moments of silence illustrate the melancholia and vulnerability of a rational man deep in struggle to find peace in an irrational, divided country.<br/><br/>The supporting cast (Spader, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Michael Stuhlbarg) is equally captivating. The standout performances belong to Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field. Jones' energetic portrayal of Republican radical and Lincoln ally Thaddeus Stevens is one of his best roles. On the exterior he is a wig-covered, rickety old man, but once he opens his mouth do we see a powerful, passionate, and often hilarious freedom fighter who's as wily as he is cunning in the courtroom. Sally Field delivers a maddening performance as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Clad in lavish costumes, Field depicts the complexities of Lincoln's home life as she copes with the loss of a son and neglect of a husband trying to restore a nation.<br/><br/>As a lifelong Spielberg fan, I'm once again impressed by the direction he took with the film. Spielberg and his longtime collaborator/cinematographer Janusz Kaminski downplays large CGI settings and go for detailed on-locations that seamlessly transport the audience to that time in history. The filmmakers also downplay the depiction of the war on the battlefield (which we have seen countless times) and lean toward the verbal skirmishes in the House of the Representatives. In some ways, one could argue that ""Lincoln"" is like Aaron Sorkin's ""The West Wing"" by way of ""Amistad,"" as the fiery quip-filled debates and desperate solutions are taken from the pages of history and presented intimately behind the doors of the dimly candlelit places of power.<br/><br/>The film's Achilles heel is the running time. While there is little action or brief depictions of violence, it's Tony Kushner's witty screenplay that keeps viewers from looking at their watches and stirring in their seats. With the help and execution of the stellar cast, the movie never feels dull as some of the long dialogue sequences ooze with a sense of theatricality that makes every line feel as much as alive as it is thrilling.<br/><br/>Lincoln needs to be seen by all not just for the outstanding performances and craftsmanship, but as a reminder of sacrifice and great lengths taken by one man to repair a shattered nation and forever alter the course of history for the greater good. Having said that give it a damn Oscar already!"

","Save your money! I kept waiting to be overwhelmingly impressed while watching this interminable movie. Never was. Had this been Spielberg's first movie I'm not sure there would have been a second. His nomination for best director while Ben Affleck was ignored by the Academy was ridiculous. This movie was very graphic which could be considered a public service announcement - namely ""throwing body parts into open pits may be hazardous to public health and may devalue property adjacent"" It was refreshing to see the ""great"" Abe's realistic family reaction to his wife's mental problems.Kind of like real family members that want people to ""just get over it already!"" It was the first sympathy ever shown to poor Mary Todd. I wonder if anyone ever considered her insistence on referring to her husband as ""Mr President"" as the sarcasm I think it may have been. I loathed seeing her on her knees to this Great Emancipator"""
"horaceotoole","1","20","49","4 December 2012"," Close your eyes and listen
","My only comment is regarding the voice used by Mr. Day-Lewis in his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. I have read about the decision to use a higher voice and that it is supposedly more historically accurate as ""sources described Lincoln's voice as thin and reedy"". Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can no longer take this seriously. The problem (and once I noticed this phenomenon, I could not get past it) is that if you close your eyes, you cannot help but notice that the voice of Mr. Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln sounds almost exactly like that of the famous Mr. Burns from ""The Simpsons"". I'm serious. In fact, listen to the trailer available here on IMDb and you will hear it for yourself!"
"deschreiber","6","14","32","17 November 2012"," Let's be honest about this film
","Let's set aside the big Hollywood names acting in and directing this film, forget about its big budget, even forget about the seriousness of the topic. What are we left with, looked at just as a film? <br/><br/>For a start, it's very narrow in its content, focused entirely on how Lincoln got enough votes to get his anti-slavery amendment passed. That's all. Despite the grandness of the title ""Lincoln,"" it's only about Lincoln in this one small, if important, moment of his career, covering in considerable detail how he rounded up the required votes, how he pressured certain politicians, horse-traded with others, cajoled, tried to inspire, tried everything he could think of to get the votes needed to pass the constitutional amendment outlawing slavery. There are no subplots other than a little to-and-fro with his wife and some brief scenes showing his sons--mere gestures rather than subplots. The film is all about the down-and-not-always-clean vote- gathering business of politics. Once the bill is passed, the film quickly comes to its close, with a few short scenes to bring the war to an end and Lincoln to his assassination.<br/><br/>There are very few outdoor scenes. Almost everything happens indoors. The characters are seldom shown other than in their roles as professional politicians. There are no beautiful women, no common people other than in the background, only white guys, just about all of them dressed pretty much the same and almost all wearing big beards. The atmosphere is slightly claustrophobic.<br/><br/>The seriousness of the issue and the moral grandeur of Lincoln, (perhaps deriving as much from his historical reputation as his depiction in the film) keep one's interest. Obviously the passing of the bill is a foregone conclusion, so there's no real suspense.<br/><br/>I couldn't help imagining this film when it comes out on DVD or in five or ten years from now, when it appears on television. How many people will want to see it for a second time? I don't think many people will. Teachers will use it, but I have a feeling it will be largely forgotten in the world of movies.<br/><br/>Are these Oscar-worthy performances? The acting is excellent, but, given the script, they didn't have great potential, and it's hard to see them as extraordinary."

","This is a brilliant film by Mr. Spielberg that speaks of man's best and worst. He has presented these themes to us before and our hearts, minds and souls are better for it. The useless loss of war, the ideals of freedom and equality are common themes but never better embodied than here in this portrait of Lincoln starring Daniel Day Lewis in one of his most natural and poignant performances. With an engaging script by Tony Kushner and superlative performances by all, this movie draws a concise picture of 19th century America and the issues that have resonated throughout history and around the world. The view offered is not a grandiose heroic tableaux but a heartfelt human vision that embraces tragedy, justice and the need to heal a nation. Through Mr. Spielberg's artfully subtle direction we witness a war and a fight in government that reveals a man with a keen sense of humor, human nature and justice. It revisits this nations key and pivotal issues of freedom, justice and equality under the law for all. Sally Fields in one of her most compelling roles should surely be considered for an Oscar as well as Gloria Ruben and James Spader. With it's evocative setting, moving score, and perfect casting this is a film that is not to be missed. Excellent !"

Didn't anyone notice that YOU COULD NOT IDENTIFY anyone as a primary historical figure unless you majored in 1860 to 1866 in your history studies?

It's endless scene after scene of talk that doesn't drive the story forward. Neither the writer nor director appears to have understood that such things as intrigue and character development have been used in other films. Surely the opponents of Lincoln's bill were three dimensional people, but not in this film. <br/><br/>The character of Lincoln himself is so deliberate, studies and introspective that it's hard to understand how he could have even been an engaging, persuasive enough person to have won an election, think stereotype of a Librarian, Accountant & Specialise Doctor all rolled up in one. He tell stories from his pass, a lot and in one scene a character complains and walks out, this was a good strategy and one that was adopted by at least six members of the audience.<br/><br/>If this film is an accurate depiction of the people running American in the 1860's then it must have been a boring place to live.<br/><br/>My suggestion is that a non American director may have been able to inject some life into this icon of a person and that political ""back room"" manoeuvres would have spiced up this dreary tale.<br/><br/>Spielberg has had great success with adventure and fantasy films and one achievement with drama, zero with comedy, maybe he should stick to his strengths."

And this so called ""script"" was based upon accused plagiarist Doris Kerns Goodwin's ""Lincoln"" biography! Shame on Stephen Spielberg for using this source material and for instead not finding historical documentation of what would exemplify the humanity in the characters of Lincoln and his wife Mary Todd. Has anyone ever seen a human Lincoln? Not me (unless I include the one I saw at Disneyland). Spielberg's characterizations in this botched and failed effort were extremely stiff, unyielding and extremely unbelievable. Did we ever see anything in the movie that portrayed any intimacy between him and his wife? For God's sake, we do know that they had sex with and loved each other! And, if I wanted to witness a replication of the exact scenes that took place between him and congress, I would have goggled it, or watched C-Span. It also ticks me off that he had to include his trademark Spielbergian light LaLa in some of the scenes here.....dude, this isn't ""ET"". What a waste!!!!!! And to not give Sally Field any good scenes in this movie is a crime!!!! Shame, Shame, Shame!!!!!!

","Lincoln the person and President stands for and was an example of honesty and diligent open effort to move forward justice and equality in this country at a difficult and dangerous time in our history. He won the presidency, won the civil war and did more for freedom and fairness as any man who has lived in America. <br/><br/>Watching this movie instead focuses most of its energy on largely unsubstantiated assertions that in order to pass the 13th amendment Lincoln bribed, paid off and lied to various politicians. And assertions that Lincoln bent or broke the law and what was right in the name of a good cause. While no man is perfect and Lincoln may have had faults a movie focusing on shady and disingenuous acts is unfair to Lincoln and to America and reads more like a political statement or propaganda piece. The movie insults the audience's intelligence not only by portraying some dubious gossip as though it is irrefutable fact but also by suggesting Lincoln actually was good ""because he lied and bribed and deceived people. <br/><br/>The movie is further flawed by similar attacks on other characters that are without foundation and seem targeted to smear people trying to accomplish a good work. An example is a congressman fighting for passage of the 13th amendment goes home after the success and is shown in bed with his black house keeper? --No explanation no foundation just oh yea and we want you to know this anti slavery guy is sleeping with his house keeper?<br/><br/>I understand that Hollywood is left leaning and am usually willing to put up with a little slanting for a well told story. In this case the slanting is insane and the story isn't even very well told. There is also a fair amount of ""disfuntional family discussions"" portrayed between Lincoln and his wife and son which seem pointless and designed to just expose dirty laundry which when done for someone who lived that long ago tends to be 90% made up rubbish, and 10% latest Hollywood stupidity."

In fact, the entire film's timeline takes place during a single month in 1865. The audience was even robbed of seeing any of the details of his assassination.

"misscarley-539-373606","9","10","22","25 November 2012"," Daniel Day-Lewis' Not-So-Honest Abe
","The fact of the matter is: LINCOLN works. This is a-typical Spielberg. Oh sure, there's plenty of the light and shadow magic that is his hallmark (one feels that Lincoln's striking profile was somehow destined to be filmed in a Spielberg silhouette). But Spielberg found it necessary to build the film around the characters and not the other way around. And so we have an admittedly languorous film, Spielberg explaining that if a character needed to breathe, he allowed him to breathe.<br/><br/>Few filmmakers trust the audience to, not only have the attention span for real-life exchanges, but the appetite for it. Like Lincoln, Spielberg takes the slippery risk of actually trusting the audience's intellect. He does not pander; he takes his time, and Tony Kushner's adaptation of Doris Goodwin's excellent ""Team of Rivals"" makes full use of 19th century oratorical speech which, once our modern ears adjust, is deliciously engrossing.<br/><br/>Anyone expecting a Civil War version of Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan needs to be forewarned: This film is not a vehicle for gratuitous violence. There is, in fact, very little war footage and it is entirely a political procedural drama. LINCOLN is certainly beautifully shot by Spielberg's ace-in-the-hole Janusz Kaminski: artfully lit to emphasize the earthy, swarthy browns and blues that saturated the palette of 1860s America, as well as the bright freshness of the Washington capitol in the 1860s. It is also, in fact, an intelligent character study, penned by Tony Kushner it is an actor's dream of a film; its power lying completely in performance.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis melts away the marble and sweeps away the cobwebs of history. This is a living, breathing, and very imperfect human being. Daniel Day Lewis' Abraham Lincoln is a patient man, but has a volatile temper. He's a devoted father, but not without daddy issues of his own. He wants to love his wife, but can't love her the way she needs him to. He is a moral man, but  he's also a politician Honest Abe is indeed, morally pure— but not exactly honest.<br/><br/>And we, the audience, see and hear him as he almost certainly was in Spielberg's LINCOLN. A man of awkward build and height, his 6 foot 4 frame, strikingly tall in the mid-19th century, surely seemed even more imposing with his gaunt frame and 8-inch high stovepipe hat. This gives him an off-balance, wobbly gait. He also listens. And he speaks. Oh boy, does he ever speak. In a high, reedy voice, cracked with age and beaten by years of 'melancholy,' that unsettles the audience. It has none of the deep, baritone register we've been conditioned to believe was Lincoln's. Perhaps due to the simple fact that Daniel Day-Lewis is an Englishman and therefore Lincoln's mythology is not a part of his cultural genetic makeup as it is ours, afforded him the courage to take the risk and debunk the myth of Lincoln's voice and manner. Day-Lewis' Lincoln has the voice of a man weary with the weight of the country resting on his slumped shoulders.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis is, of course, one of the finest actors of this, or any, generation. And just as Lincoln was the moral glue that held the country together, Day-Lewis is the film's anchor. Oh sure, other performances in the film are more exciting and amusing (Tommy Lee Jones WILL get an Oscar nod for this for his acerbic abolitionist. James Spader as a whiskey loving lobbyist won't, but should). But Day-Lewis' embodiment of Lincoln is what gives this film heart. Even when he is off-screen, his formidable shadow is still present, making it possible for some of the film's best scenes to take place without him. Congress and the lobbyists steal the show. But what makes them tick is the fact of Lincoln.<br/><br/>LINCOLN covers a mere slice of Lincoln's history: his fight to pass the 13th Amendment through Congress, a feat that would end slavery in the United States and, more to Lincoln's point, the Civil War. It's an Alice Through The Looking Glass world in which the Democrats are, as Tommy Lee Jones' Thaddeus Stephens says, a bastardized version of Thomas Jefferson's party and are hell-bent against the passing of the Amendment, vehement against the concept of race equality. Lincoln's Republican Party, by contrast, is home to the liberals: the ""radical"" freedom fighters determined to abolish slavery. Not only is the President in a race against time to end the slavery issue and thereby save the Union, he has a highly unstable wife to deal with, a difficult relationship with his eldest son, a cabinet that doesn't trust him, and a House of Representatives that disrespects him.<br/><br/>This Lincoln is a knee-slapping spinner of bawdy tall tales (I never thought I'd hear the words ""George Washington"", ""outhouse"", and ""shit"" in the same sentence), and is neither ashamed nor dismissive of his humble backwoods roots. This professed simplicity belies his exceptional intelligence, a perfect and powerful political tool as he consistently takes his opponents by angry surprise with a royal flush of logic. Not only is Lincoln the right man for the job, he is the only man for the job. Perhaps this is why we love this man: Heroes make the impossible possible in the most impossible of circumstances. And the best heroes, the ones that last, are psychologically complex and certainly far from guileless. And to this extent, Lincoln is a hero.<br/><br/>LINCOLN is not Spielberg's best film. It is not even the best film of the year. And it is far from perfect– biopics rarely are. But it succeeds where it needs to, namely, in making us care deeply about this most extraordinary man, and even more about his cause. The fact of both which make it possible for us to be who we are today.<br/><br/>In Spielberg's hands, the legend is preserved and is carried forward, for the ages."

","Having read the book first (took me actually couple weeks:) I couldn't wait to see this movie. In short - I couldn't have been more satisfied. It follows the book closely, reflecting the actual events that happened during the last months of Civil war as precisely as they could be described. <br/><br/>Already the beginning will wet your eyes with the Gettysburg address smartly inputted to the movie and of course ends with Stanton's famous quote after AL dies. I'm very happy Daniel Day Lewis accepted the offer and portrayed AL with such great intensity and power as AL rightly deserves. I replayed some scenes (his talk with Mr. Stevens, argument with his wife) countless times, and always find them fascinating. He walks and talks exactly as AL did (according to the book) so this movie is not just a great achievement in cinematography but a brilliant depiction of actual events and an amazing achievement in acting.<br/><br/>The only downside is you have to know a little bit of history as you will be thrown into the action, and might find it confusing. If you are into books I really recommend to read the original book first, and then enjoy watching this movie."

","Before I write my review, I'd like to note some of reviews I read on this board.<br/><br/>Some (not all obviously) people reviewing this film were bored by it, and some thought Daniel Day-Lewis was okay. Just okay.<br/><br/>We've really gotten to the point where if one has to listen to what is considered too much dialogue (probably a page's worth in a total script would be too much), the film is slow and boring. If we don't see things blown up and crashed every ten seconds, there's just no action.<br/><br/>What a dull, dull tale, the story of a great President as he pushes for the passing of the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and end the Civil War. A big yawn. Not enough bloody Civil War scenes, I guess, and then we're deprived of a big ending too.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is a reverent look at a historical figure, not just as a historical figure, but as a man with children and with a volatile wife, a man who played politics just as they're played today in order to get his way.<br/><br/>As far as Daniel Day-Lewis, let me say that not for one second did I think I was watching a performance. I was, in fact, watching Abraham Lincoln, just like when Helen Mirren played Queen Elizabeth, I was watching Queen Elizabeth. It is a rare, rare actor that can work that magic. As brilliant as Meryl Streep was in some sections of ""The Iron Lady,"" there were other times when it was an impersonation, not the woman.<br/><br/>I found this a brilliant and important film, meticulous in its detail and research, right down to the ticking of Lincoln's watch. A man who cares enough to have the actual watch that belonged to Lincoln heard ticking is a caring and committed director.<br/><br/>Sally Field fought for this role, and she is brilliant. As Thaddeus Stevens, Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful, and the whole cast is great: James Spader, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Walton Goggins, etc. - all brilliant and well cast.<br/><br/>I have one criticism, brought out by another reviewer - after 2-1/2 hours, why was the assassination not depicted? This to me is one flaw, though I'm sure if I actually spoke to Spielberg, he could convince me of his reasoning.<br/><br/>As some side trivia, Tad Lincoln died at around age 18; Robert Lincoln lived until 1925, dying at the age of 82. He had two children; the Lincoln line died out in 1985.<br/><br/>A monumental film that deserves to be seen and studied."

","As with most war films you expect fight scenes and with Lincoln (2012) you get one right at the beginning but that's it! Instead it's more a war of words between many different men who are all playing to win their own battles. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis deserves his Oscar for playing the lightly spoken charming Abraham Lincoln who is physically weighed down after four years of war but still able to think on his feet. Although the North are winning Lincoln wants to ban slavery altogether and not just those of his enemies which he had achieved in 1863. <br/><br/>What is masterful about this film is the dialogue and script. Raged debates in the House of Representatives, intrigue in hushed rooms and family arguments are woven with heart and sophistication. Spielberg emphasises how important words are in defining ideas which he illustrates deftly in Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee-Jones) speech to define equality; a scene which also uses great insults on the debate floor to lighten and colour Lincoln (2012).<br/><br/>What also stops this film from sinking under the heavy theme is the urgency to pass the equality bill before events take over, and the life- or-death dilemmas that have to be made. <br/><br/>In the tradition of great political thrillers I heartily pass Lincoln (2012)"
"TxMike","Null","5","9","22 June 2013"," Excellent portrait of Abraham Lincoln, the man and the 16th President.
","The USA is still a fairly young country, formed in 1776 by the Declaration of Independence. The very early Presidents, Washington, Adams, Jefferson were helping to form the young nation, most of them elected for multiple terms. But then there was a string of more ordinary Presidents, most serving only one term then being voted out.<br/><br/>Then came Lincoln, taking office in 1861, the ""Civil War"" President because his term, ending with his assassination in 1865, coincided very closely with the beginning and the end of what was officially known as War between the States, the North against the South.<br/><br/>This movie, ""Lincoln"", does not attempt to cover all of Lincoln's life, or even a large part of it. It is the approximate first 4 months of 1865, when Lincoln, newly-elected for a second term, had to deal with the long-running war, dissension in his Cabinet, and what would become his legacy, getting the 13th Amendment passed. It was ratified in December by the states, abolishing slavery for all time. Lincoln held firmly to the concept that every person at birth has equal rights under the law and did whatever needed to be done to achieve that legal equality.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is considered by many as the best working male actor today and he won the Oscar for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. He is shown as a gentle family man, a humorous man fond of telling stories to amplify on a point, but also a smart and tough President who knew what he wanted to accomplish and would not let any obstacles stop him. The 13th amendment had been passed by the Senate in 1864, but the House of Representatives were the roadblock. The movie shows how the ""back room dealing"" might have been used to get the necessary votes.<br/><br/>Yes, it can be a bit slow, but I didn't mind, as it gave time to develop the themes and see Abraham Lincoln, the man. Every time I see a Lincoln movie I hope the ending will be different, but he always experiences the same fate!"

Of course the presidency of Lincoln and the subject (abolitionism) is worth a movie but an entire movie on the process to get rid of slavery? The murder on Lincoln is never explained, nor where he came from or what his background was.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Lincoln is not portrayed as a romantic hero because he simply wasn't. He corrupted officials, seamed to think that democracy is also engaging in war when the enemy does not agree, humiliating your political opponents and finally ask them to sign the 13th amendment. Finally celebrate the idea of democratic voting.<br/><br/>Where the movie fails is it takes 2 1/2 hours to tell the story, the figure Lincoln seams to appear from no where suddenly fighting against slavery. The process behind the man's motivation is taken for granted.<br/><br/>The acting is top class, the action scenes are very scarce but effective, but since the movie is titled Lincoln I expected to see a more complete biography."

","An historically disappointing film, with a great cast and great performances (Daniel Day-Lewis,Sally Field,Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn stand out in particular), but lacking in story, and moreover, integrity.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" spans the last few months of the War Between the States and Lincoln's life. Given the wealth and complexity of historical subject matter, the film focuses rather narrowly on Lincoln's supposed obsession with the passage of the 13th Amendment. <br/><br/>As screenwriter Tony Kushner would have it, Lincoln was willing to extend the War Between the States -- and if we are to believe the script, did so -- in order to pass the law in Congress abolishing slavery.<br/><br/>To Kushner's credit, Lincoln is scripted to express at least an awareness of, if not internal conflict over, the slippery slope he embarks upon with frank discussions of moral relativity. E.g., is it justifiable to violate the Constitution or States' Rights in order to do what he believes is best for the nation? The drama in the film revolves entirely around this issue.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film defends the position that the ends justify the means -- expediency over morality.<br/><br/>Other viewers will no doubt argue that Lincoln's cause was just and laud him as a progressive and a visionary. <br/><br/>The ethical shortcomings of the film are rather to do with what history the script excludes. <br/><br/>Specifically, there is no mention of what started the War Between the States. In the absence of an answer to this question, the naive viewer will suppose, ending slavery. <br/><br/>The fact is that the War was fought over the Northern States' blockade of Southern ports in an effort to control and monopolize trade; when the federal government chose sides (supporting the North), the War began. In short: it was all about money. Lincoln supported the Northern industrialists in blockading the Southern ports. Doing so was an abuse of Presidential power and in violation of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Moreover, the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) was made more than two years into the War, and was specifically intended to generate support for the War in the North, where public opinion had never been strongly in favor of of the War, and lately had turned strongly against it. <br/><br/>In this context, there is no mention of the Draft Riots in New York City (please look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots).<br/><br/>Another historical deletion is Lincoln's Liberia Plan (please look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_and_slavery). Indeed, if one consults historical sources, one finds that The Great Emancipator's plan was to deport the freed slaves to Liberia. Not exactly what the film conveys.<br/><br/>It is distressing to see a film honoring expediency over morality, while glossing over historical fact and context. <br/><br/>One hopes that Day-Lewis, Field and Jones will receive Academy Award nominations for their stellar performances. But the film's content was disappointing."

","Stephen Spielberg is a victim of his previous successes in many ways. When a movie comes out emblazoned with his name, whether it is as producer or director, expectations mount. Viewers may go in expecting a transformative cinematic experience.<br/><br/>As he's older and more powerful in Hollywood, he also has more time for pet projects, and since press about this movie states that he has been working on it for years, it qualifies as a pet project. Unfortunately, with his current penchant for pet projects, he seems to have forgotten what brought him greatness in his earlier years: making movies that large numbers of people like, want, and enjoy seeing.<br/><br/>People who are students of American History, particularly the second half of the nineteenth century will be enthralled by the scores of political figures brought to life.

But of course, one could say the same thing regarding the latest Tim Burton vanityfest.<br/><br/>The title ""Lincoln"" and the advance press buzz that it's a biopic would lead one to believe that maybe there would be scenes of actual slavery, to put into context what the men were arguing over. Or how about a little more background about Mary? Would it have hurt so much to flash back to Willie's death so we can see how it shaped her? Of course, I'm not a master movie maker or even a great novelist. But I know when something entertains me and when it doesn't. And I walked out on ""Lincoln"" about two-thirds of the way through.<br/><br/>Sorry Stevie!"

","I saw Lincoln yesterday and have been turning the movie over in my head. Something seemed lacking. Then I realized what that was.<br/><br/>The movie portrayed Congress debating over the 13th Amendment that would end slavery. The movie also portrayed only politically correct Black people. In Lincoln one only sees black people that are smartly dressed soldiers, suited gentlemen, and immaculately dressed, well-spoken and seemingly college educated women.<br/><br/>That historical fiction blights the movie.<br/><br/>The vast majority of Blacks in 1865 were not well-spoken, well-dressed, or well-educated. They had been denied access to such opportunities.<br/><br/>A reasonable person, in 1865, imbued with the observations of their time, might well believe that Black people were inferior in intellect or that that Black people weren't ready for the responsibilities of freedom. In Lincoln, you see these arguments aired. However, the speeches seem nonsensical when the movie deliberately declined to provide the social and cultural context that would have supported those perspectives.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about Lincoln, though. Daniel Day Lewis was exceptional in the lead role. He avoided the mistake of making A. Lincoln a caricature of who Lincoln was. The characters and the script closely follow history. Few actors could have so believably delivered the role of Thaddeus Stevens but Tommy Lee Jones manages that very well."

In fact, I contemplated leaving the theatre less than half way through. Had I been on the end of aisle, I probably would have. This movie started with uninteresting dialogue and forces the viewer to sit through hours of the same until the conclusion. Ugh! VERY disappointing. There is clearly room for another film about this great man, because Spielburg told us only about one month of this man's life. I wish I had gone to see Argo instead."

The movie Lincoln depicts the President during the Civil War, a pivotal time in United States history. "" it's a really good movie to teach more about the Civil War,"" Anthony says. He also feels the movie shows this President, who has become almost a mythological figure in many depictions, as a ""regular person."" Heavily researched, Lincoln's depiction of the man may provide a new perception amongst the older folks in the audience as well. Says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Morgan Bertsch, age 8, ""I thank Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks for making this fabulous movie.""<br/><br/>Reviewed by Anthony Aranda Video Review here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__EBxLluPQs<br/><br/>Lincoln is pretty good but it was made for an older audience. I usually don't watch too many movies that are this serious, but the history is important to kids like me. This movie is all about President Abraham Lincoln, and in the movie it's the middle of the Civil War so Lincoln is trying to make peace between the North and the South. He creates the Thirteenth Amendment so there will be peace in the country.<br/><br/>The main characters in the movie are Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln's wife and Lincoln's son. My favorite character is, of course, Lincoln because he is a good guy but he needs to spend time with his family more. He is too distracted by the Thirteenth Amendment that he almost forgets about his family. He really loves his family, but he also really loves the citizens of the country.<br/><br/>My favorite part in the movie is when Lincoln's son is riding in the White House with a goat and a carriage. Another funny part is when one of Lincoln's advisers walks in looking for the President and sees his son sitting, reading the paper like a grown up. There were some scary parts during the movie when the soldiers were fighting and getting hurt. This was a sad part for me, also, to watch.<br/><br/>To me, the movie is more than just what we know from the history books. I think it shows me a little more about Abraham Lincoln as a regular person. And it's a really good movie to teach more about slavery and the Civil War, which is a really important part of our history.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie for ages 12 and up only because the movie was meant for an older audience and there is some pretty graphic stuff in there. But if you love history, this is a great movie for you. Go out and see this movie in theaters now.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Morgan Bertsch Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaRvzOuHk4<br/><br/>I thank Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks for making this fabulous movie. Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field do a fantastic job on their characters, as Abraham Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln. He was the 16th President, who really wanted to abolish slavery. They really studied on their characters. And you will learn about the voting process.<br/><br/>Also, they really studied their characters and they really took them very seriously, and really show a bunch of emotions with them. I think they do a great job.<br/><br/>This is actually a time piece with an amazing all-star cast. And also, the costumes are fantastic!<br/><br/>There's a little bit of language and also parts of violence, but the history lesson is everything that everyone should learn.

"richwgriffin-227-176635","2","10","23","12 December 2012"," Why I don't like this movie
","I went to see this with some ambivalence - Spielberg movies are always wildly uneven, manipulative, and problematic. So, where to start? The film is ugly - camera-work, costumes, the physical look of rooms, sets, and production design. With only one exception (Sally Field), the performances were wildly uneven. I was always aware of Daniel Day-Lewis' acting choices. Sally Field's Mrs. Lincoln was the only performance that felt fully realized; true, she was helped by having the best written scene in the movie (the fight over their son's desire to enlist). The film reminded me of all those ""great men"" movies, usually from Warner Bros., in the 1930's and 40's: he's always the smartest man, the only one who has any real intelligence, and is hampered and misunderstood my miscreants. I also hated, hated, hated that little kid - strangle him! What a bore! I found myself groaning at too many scenes. The film also is a defense of the current liberal idea that corruption is fine - whether it's ""kill lists"" or favoring oppressive governments - if it gets you what you want personally. Winning is what is important, and if you have to win by bribery and deceit, oh well.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones has a few good scenes but they are uneven. We also aren't given enough screen time to the opposition. I felt bad for several actors, esp. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who aren't given enough to do. Black actors are ""used"" in this film in a really grotesque way: we aren't allowed to get to know them at all - zero character development.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this film 2 stars is for Sally Field's excellent performance. I fully expect this film will garner Oscar nominations and perhaps Oscars. I personally would prefer Ewan MacGregor or Hugh Jackman for Best Actor (The Impossible is an AMAZING movie; Les Miserables is more than even amazing!) It was a difficult 2 1/2 hours to sit through. But there are better movies out there to see right now."

","Lincoln is just an okay movie. Here is the good and the bad of Lincoln. The good: Lincoln had excellent directing, acting, and the sets were outstanding. One experiences the feel of the times for Lincoln. What I experienced from Lincoln is Washington has not changed at all from 1865 to present. The movie is full of political corruption, bribes, trickery, and lies. The bad: The movie should have been called how to get an act passed through congress. Lincoln is a drama with too much dialogue. I thought there was going to battles, and information on the conspiracy and assassination of Lincoln and was disappointed. I thought Lincoln would be closer to Bill O'Reilly's book. Lincoln is a long winded movie, but made well enough just to be okay. I give Lincoln a six out of ten."
"tfrizzell","Null","4","7","17 July 2013"," Historical Lessons Still Viable Today.
","Sixteenth U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (a mind-blowing part by the seemingly always flawless Daniel Day-Lewis) struggles to get his policies for emancipating all enslaved African-Americans passed through the Legislative Branch of government as the bloody final days of the Civil War continue in early 1865. An amazing cinematic achievement by director Steven Spielberg as he primarily uses the the nearly unending novel ""Team of Rivals"" by Doris Kearns Goodwin to create a portrait of quite possibly the most polarizing political and social reforms in this country's long history. In a time now when bi-partisanship is a romantic idea which seems more hypothetical than realistic, Lincoln struggled with North vs. South and Republican vs. Democrat just as contemporary presidents today do. Tommy Lee Jones steals every scene as Thaddeus Stevens, a politician trying to get all of Lincoln's policies through Congressional meanderings. Sally Field is also on hand as Lincoln's wife who struggles herself with the death of the couple's young son. Field's emotional fire has to be tamed though as her part could almost be an entire movie to itself and in the end the 16th President's ability to somehow immerse himself further in the nation's civil war and its possible political future uncertainties even after a potential emotional breakdown after his family's personal tragedy. ""Lincoln"" is deeper than an ocean. It has a bare minimum of action and is highly talkative ala something in the line of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or even ""Gandhi"". Spielberg almost makes the film feel like an elaborate stage play with top-of-the-line performers going effortlessly from scene to scene and creating emotional fireworks. Day-Lewis is the catalyst, but his supporting cast never backs down from his challenge of acting excellence as they all add to his almost mythic portrayal of quite possibly our most important commander-in-chief. As usual, Spielberg creates a historical atmosphere (basically showing Washington, D.C. as a small village which doubles as a mud trap of a town with moist soil at least a foot deep in almost every direction) which puts his audience in another time and another place. Towering achievement on many various cinematic levels. ""Lincoln"" is destined to be one of those rare productions which will likely survive time, its critics, and those who fail to believe in the power of the cinema to educate, influence, and enlighten. Total excellence. 5 stars out of 5."
"dharmendrasingh","6","4","7","20 February 2013"," Fails the goosebump test
","Spielberg misses the mark with his long-anticipated take on one of the US's most beloved presidents. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an almighty performance based on morsels of historical information, but is let down by a surprisingly narrow narrative. The film fails, or rather does not triumph, because it is a condensed epic, based on the book 'Team of Rivals: The political genius of Abraham Lincoln' by Doris Kearns Goodwin, and dubiously adapted by Tony Kushner. <br/><br/>Seldom boring, but often mundane, Lincoln, like the book, is about the arduous and uncertain process by which slavery was abolished. We see the political machinations needed to cover up Lincoln's personal abhorrence of slavery with the pretence that ending it would end the civil war. <br/><br/>Spielberg should have kept to the title and made a straight up bio of the great man's life. Perhaps then, the 150-minute run time would be justified. The film ends up being a run-of-the-mill political drama with moments of cringeworthy triumphalism, notably in the closing scenes, where votes are cast to pass the thirteenth amendment. <br/><br/>Pursuing DD-L for the lead role was Spielberg's smartest directorial contribution. No one – no one – could have played Lincoln other than the master craftsman. It takes a genius to play one. The startling Noam Chomsky-esque voice, pensive gestures and body language control all conspire to evoke the supreme intelligence and acumen of this exceptional man. DD-L's physical likeness is a happy coincidence. <br/><br/>Sally Field is noticeable in a minor role as Lincoln's wife. I liked the scene where she undermines Tommy Lee Jones's character, a profane, wig-wearing republican, by reminding him how powerful her husband is and how impotent he is. It isn't necessary to state but I feel compelled to remark just how beautiful she is for a lady in her mid sixties who, incidentally, has been acting since the mid-60s.<br/><br/>In a brilliantly written and played scene, DD-L intellectually justifies ending slavery by recalling Euclid's first common notion of mechanical law: things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. Sadly, the theory cannot be applied to the film. DD-L's force far outweighs that of the material. (It won't stop him from making history by winning his third 'best lead actor' Oscar.)<br/><br/>My recurring thought was: why make another guilt-ridden film which attempts to absolve the white male for slavery? Why not do as Tarantino has done and make a film which empowers the black male instead?"
"diane-34","10","4","7","12 February 2013"," When Hollywood gets it right, you have a ""Lincoln""
","Wow, that's what both of us said when regaining our speech after viewing this great film yesterday. I had seriously lost all hope that Hollywood could produce a serious film: a film like other nations seem to turn out with aplomb. But they caught me out yesterday with this marvelous movie that had no bloodshed, no violence of any kind, no talking animals or human figures that mouthed the lines of well known accents. No, this was a serious movie that required some modicum of grey-matter to follow all that was happening as well as a certain amount of old fashioned schoolbook knowledge. On all these accounts a definitely un-American movie. If J. Edgar were around he would have brought all the major players before the House Un-American Activities Committee for reasons that only he could fathom.<br/><br/>I believe, and rightly so, that all the major actors should win Academy Awards: Day-Lewis, Field and Jones. They are simply the standouts but there was not a weak actor in the entire movie. My personal favourite was Tommy Lee Jones but that is only preference. Spielberg should win as director because he brought this bunch together and moulded (I know, I know—it is a trite word but...) the cast into something beyond what it could/should have been.<br/><br/>I thought also that the screenplay was tremendous; the Set Decoration was truly marvelous and the lighting—the lighting, how do you recreate that felling of muted light that would have been the norm at that time? Everything about the film was magical; it is a must-see movie!"
"cinematic_aficionado","7","4","7","29 January 2013"," Bit of a hit and miss
","This film could have been so much more.<br/><br/>Spielberg does a fine job in putting the audience in the government offices in the 1860's and give us an insight of the struggle Lincoln were faced with in bringing about a change, in a culture that did not like change. So much we take for granted today required many sacrifices, something we remain stubbornly ignorant of.<br/><br/>The issue I have with this movie, was the title. Why Lincoln? Who was Lincoln? Where did he get his values from? Who were his influences? Why, how and by whom did he die? All we get from Lincoln is the aspect of his life in government. Had the movie been titled ""13th amendment"", it would have been a different story altogether.<br/><br/>Despite the great narrative and cinematography, not to mention performances, it was too long with much of its substance lost to the display of political wrangling, which though utterly necessary the extent to which it was done disconnected me few times.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I found the anti-racist overtone done a little too much. The majority of today's audiences in the West despise racism and find slavery pure evil. We did not need a reminder throughout the film that slavery was plain wrong no matter what the angle, unless the film was made back in the 50's or 60s.<br/><br/>There's definitely greatness in this film, but it is also greatly overrated."
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","7","21 January 2013"," Lincoln is not a perfect film, but it is an important film
","I'm not a historian, but I do agree, that the audience is spoon fed a story where Lincoln is always the crusader against slavery, and everyone else is playing politics against him. Seeing Lincoln only as always fighting slavery painted the most unrealistic picture of Lincoln, I've ever seen. While it is true that Lincoln regarded slavery as an evil and harmful institution, it is also true, that he shared the conviction of most Americans of his time, and of many prominent statesmen before and after him, that blacks could not be assimilated into white society. He rejected the notion of social equality of the races, and held to the view that blacks should be resettled abroad. As President, he supported projects to remove blacks from the United States as well suspended the writ of habeas corpus, which allowed him to arrest thousands of U.S. citizens that protest against him. This Steven Spielberg movie borders on propaganda somewhat, as the media hold Lincoln to be about the closest thing to a Biblical figure in American history without really looking at those facts. The movie makes 'Lincoln' look like that everybody love him at the time, while a small few whom has slaves are against him. It's hardly the truth. Not all people that protest against him was because they for slavery. He was just as unpopular in the north during the war for his attempts among other things to control the press. He didn't become God-like popular until after his assassination. The movie was to sanitized and staid for my tastes, but it does somewhat show how Lincoln certainly willing to do questionable rule-breaking actions for the greater good. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and there's a certain amount of rule-skirting that's right and proper when engaging in a noble mission like the abolition of slavery. Still the movie placed Lincoln the man on a near messianic level. He was a man of great accomplishments--maybe the greatest President--but he was not the faultless figure portrayed in this picture, still Lincoln the movie is a moving piece. The movie starts with two fan boys soldiers quoting Lincoln's greatest speech--'Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation' after witnessing the brutal civil war battle in the rain between Black Soldiers and White Rebels. It's set the tone of the film, it's about trying to heal the country during the closest months of the war. There will be no more battle footage beyond this point, as the battle go from the fields to the House of Representatives. The pacing of the film is not for all audience, as the movie can seem boring to those who seeking an action-packed Civil War movie. Anybody seeking a movie like that will be disappointed. The movie focus more on efforts, during January 1865, to obtain passage for the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the house which would formally abolish slavery while seeking for peace with the South. Daniel Day Lewis is magnificent in the role, the acting in the film was just awesome. He can really show Lincoln's melancholy side, his weird side of humor, and Lincoln's great use of story-telling. He will scoop the Oscar without doubt. The make up in the film makes him look like Lincoln to the point, it wasn't Daniel Day Lewis playing Lincoln, but Lincoln playing Lincoln. So uncanny. Daniel is surrounding by a great supporting cast, such as Sally Fields playing Mary Todd Lincoln. She was the right actress to portray all the fragility and complexity that was Mary Todd. There was sub-plots about Lincoln dealing with his oldest child Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), joining the Army. The way, Mary Todd makes Lincoln's life miserables over this issue is interesting scene. It's creepy when she mention the death of their other child like that. I'm surprised the film didn't bother dealing Lincoln's homosexual overtones with others men as a way to get away from Mary Todd, but it's explain a bit the sexual history between Mary Todd and Lincoln by stating out that Lincoln was too busy with the war to be the husband that Mary Todd wanted. The scene where Mary Todd hold Thaddeus is smart, but I was kinda disappointed with Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens. Tommy Lee Jones was good, but I'm so used to Tommy Lee Jones playing this type of role that I was kinda bored by his performance. It felt like Tommy Lee Jones playing Tommy Lee Jones. I groaned at the obvious foreshadowing of Lincoln's death, but the movie doesn't show the assassination. It felt like a lost chance to make the audience feel more for the character, as it's probably one of the reasons, people went to see this film. They wanted to feel sad about Lincoln dying. Sadly, the large movie audiences won't appreciate this film, because there's a fine line between learning history and living history. While the movie makes history come alive, it's doesn't have the features to draw people to see a movie. There is little violence, no nudity, and has way too much talking scenes. A lot of people will be missing out of this movie just because of those reasons. Check it out-- and see it yourself. You will find yourself, smarter and wiser after watching it."

","At this point I suppose it is almost expected that Daniel Day-Lewis will give a great performance in all of his roles, but that doesn't make his performance in Lincoln any less phenomenal or memorable. The theme of the movie is an old and familiar one, but that doesn't mean the message is any less effective or relatable.<br/><br/>The film is not a political thriller, more a political conversation between old men and we observe their conversations during a very important time in American history. It was the right decision to make the movie in this way. Considering that most of politics, even to this day, seems to be a bunch of old men, and now women, sitting around discussing issues. An audience can laugh during certain scenes at the backwards thinking of some people back then, considering how far we have come as a country since 1865, but we still get the sense of just how vital those conversations and debates are, that these characters were having. Since I am not the most political person in the world, some of the language that was used in the film I was not familiar with and some of the information may have been lost on me, but the overall risks these people were taking, and the reasons why they were taking them, were very apparent to me. And whether or not you let every single word sink in, you will be just as caught up in the argument.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is surrounded by other great performances, notably from Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field, among many others. The film feels like it was built for actors. The movie does not rely on editing or fancy camera work to tell it's story, most of the time people are just sitting around a room in a dense layer of cigar smoke rambling and banging on their desks to illustrate their pointsnot much has changed, although we may have nicer desks now. I at times thought Lincoln felt a lot like a play, and maybe even would have been more effective if it was done as a play. But the film works and works superbly.<br/><br/>Probably my only complaint would be that I had thought the film should have ended during a wonderful scene about five or ten minutes before the movie actually endedbut who am I to disagree with the brilliant Steven Spielberg? I do not at all mean this statement in a sarcastic manner, and this should be quite apparent to anyone who watched Lincoln."
"gregeichelberger","7","8","18","16 November 2012"," Lincoln: A reconstruction of an amazing historical character
","The difficulty in transferring an iconic, almost myth-like figure carved in granite or imprinted on currency, much like a Greek god or an Egyptian Pharoah, to a weak, vulnerable flesh-and-blood creature can be daunting indeed. <br/><br/>This is the task director Steven Spielberg takes upon himself in the new Touchstone/20th Century-Fox release, ""Lincoln."" Hollywood has tried several times to recreate some aspect of the life of the Great Emancipator, most notably in 1939 (""Young Mr. Lincoln,"" with Henry Fonda in the title role), 1940 (""Abe Lincoln In Illinois,"" with Raymond Massey), and 1974 (""Sandburg's Lincoln,"" with Hal Holbrook).<br/><br/>Incidentally, we will omit the latest incarnation, ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" <br/><br/>Now, two-time Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis dons the goatee for what will surely be another Oscar-nominated performance.<br/><br/>Written about in contemporary reports after his martyr's death by such poets as Walt Whitman, where the flowery 19th century literation replaced the more coarse, yet realistic commentaries and biting editorial cartoons of the day, one would think Lincoln more fictional than factual. <br/><br/>Spielberg here walks a thin line, giving the proper amount of reverence to the character, yet allowing him to be more than human with bouts of deep melancholia, playful moments with his son, Tad (Gulliver McGrath), bitter arguments with his manic-depressive wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field, ""Forrest Gump"") and political strategy that makes the later presidential arm-twisting of Lyndon Baines Johnson look like a Girl Scout picnic.<br/><br/>The nation's 16th president, born in a log cabin, raised in Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, a farmer, boatman, rail-splitter and traveling lawyer, was first vilified when running for the office in 1860, led the United States in her bitterest hour, was re-elected and victorious in the Civil War. Days after the surrender of the Confederate States of America, he was struck down by an assassin's bullet.<br/><br/>The question then, with such a wide range of life experiences to cover, where does Spielberg begin? He focuses on just four months – the last of Lincoln's life – January to April of 1865 when the South is almost crushed and Honest Abe is attempting to push through a reluctant congress the 13th Amendment to the Constitution (to outlaw slavery). The conflict is that to achieve one, he may have to cast the other out.<br/><br/>To appease both sides, he has to do a balancing act of amazing political skill, keeping the Republican Conservatives (led by Preston Blair, Hal Holbrook) and lame duck Democrats in line, all while dealing with the over-reaching political agenda of the Radical Republicans and reigning in their zealous anti-slavery leader, Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones, ""No Country for Old Men"") of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>To achieve passage of the amendment, he promises Blair an ill-fated meeting with a delegation of CSA leaders, including vice president Alexander Stephens (Jack Earle Haley, ""Little Children""), and instructs Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn, ""Good Night and Good Luck"") to utilize the sleazy, bloated W.N. Bilbo (James Spader, ""The Practice,"" ""The Office"") to offer as many soon-to-be out of work Democrats whatever political patronage jobs he can give away.<br/><br/>The legislation is abhorrent to much of the nation and could possibly bring, if not Negro supremacy, then at least Negro equality to a country ripped apart by four years of death and destruction over the plight of those very slaves. <br/><br/>While this is going on, he continues to deal with Mary, who is still grieving over the death of her son, Willie, three years before; as well as his oldest boy, Robert Todd (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, ""The Dark Knight Rises""), a bitter young man who wants to join the fray before it ends and he loses all chances for military glory.<br/><br/>Then, there is Lincoln's own personal demons which result in dark moments, nightmares and wracking guilt over being a party to the deaths of thousands of his countrymen. With such multiple story lines and situations, plus, clocking in at just under two hours and 30 minutes, one might suffer massive sensory overload with this ambitious biopic. Spielberg, however, acquits himself very well here, allowing the film to clip along at a faster pace than a story like this should.<br/><br/>This is aided greatly by Spielberg's deft hand and obvious love of the character and an engaging story (Tony Kushner) which is partly based on the book by presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. Praise must also be extended to Janusz Kaminski's cinematography, the spot-on set design by Jim Erickson and Peter T. Frank, and amazing costumes by Joanna Johnston.<br/><br/>With these attributes, I can almost forgive the opening scene which features a black Union soldier arguing with the Chief Executive over equal pay for blacks and whites. It's a smarmy politically-correct moment which would most likely never taken place at the time and under the circumstances. <br/><br/>Then there are the performances. Day-Lewis will surely be nominated for his deeply nuanced title character, which infuses some of Massey, some Fonda, and even a bit of Lionel Barrymore's twang, but maintaining the lofty eloquence of a man with more than the weight of the world on his stooped, hunched shoulders. <br/><br/>He's quick-witted, skillfully sarcastic, yet able to charm his audiences with his often ribald stories which defuses many tense situations. A far cry from his bombastic take in ""There Will Be Blood."" <br/><br/>Fields, Strathairn, Gordon-Levitt, Holbrook, Haley, Spader and Lee Pace (as pro-slavery Democrat Fernando Wood) also acquit themselves very well, and the lessons of this film (a certain Best Picture nominee) are to be heeded, especially by a younger generation whose only acquaintance with the subject may have only been in staid, boring history classes. At least here - as factually accurate as Hollywood can be - the topic is alive and dynamic and interesting."

","So much hype by the studio for this movie, and for Daniel Day-Lewis in his lead portrayal as Abraham Lincoln, why does it all seem to fall short for me? The reason is simple, it's wordy, slow moving, and lacks drama. Steven Spielberg is without a doubt one of if not the best director in the industry, but this epic is a dry lackluster diatribe in boredom. I'll give it to the historians who watch this and who will love this movie, but for the typical ""Joe six pack"" average movie goer, this movie is simply a sleep fest. So here's my take-away, if you watch movies for entertainment purposes, there are way better choices than this. If you want history with long oral diatribes, this baby fills the bill. One last word-Daniel Day-Lewis is truly a superb actor, and he is very good in this role, but was it the best of the year? I say no, actually Anthony Hopkins who wasn't even nominated for his role in Hitchcock was far and away much more convincing and brilliant and was robbed in not only not be nominated and or winning."
"billygoat1071","10","5","10","26 February 2013"," Creating History
","Lincoln is not entirely the whole biography of Abraham Lincoln. It's not about his life, nor how he became a president but it is the story how he became a great one. It features no origin or back stories. Its central focus is when he fought against slavery. One might not expect it to be a two hour film of lecturing and making decisions. Some might not enjoy it in that way but if you have the right mind and the heart to know the history then you'll get an interesting experience. With a bold direction and a remarkable performance from a brilliant actor, what possibly could go wrong? It's still surprisingly talky but it is also surprisingly engrossing.<br/><br/>The film's story for Abraham Lincoln is how he became a remarkable President. The film didn't gloss at the honest man. He'll always be the one who's having a hard time, surrounded by complicated decisions. He's never portrayed as perfect. He's just like anyone else, except he's wiser and acts like a father to anyone. He sometimes tells stories and such. The film may not show his childhood or anything in his past but you can see what kind of man he is. When it talks about the history, it serves an easy narration, but complexity displays when everybody inside is shouting out their opinions at each other.<br/><br/>Aside all, it spends most of the time discussing in places. It sometimes feels Shakespearean. The first act is a little slow for some reason, but the entertainment rises in every sequence. It gets a lot more interesting in the courtroom scenes. The performances brings some excitement. Every scene with Tommy Lee Jones in the court is difficult to ignore. It's a terribly striking performance, but the best performance is, of course, Daniel Day-Lewis who is, without a doubt, fantastic as Abraham Lincoln. It's totally fascinating performance that anyone would feel he's the real Lincoln himself. The rest are fantastic as well for spicing up everything else.<br/><br/>The film is almost a series of meetings. Outside the conversations, we get to see the tragedies going around and Lincoln's personal life, while he's handling his family's issues and the nation's struggle. Steven Spielberg may take an impressive new direction for the film, but his trademark drama elements still fills in the gravity moments. He never leaves his original style behind. In the filmmaking side, the production and the cinematography gives a spectacular look at the scenes.<br/><br/>The title, Lincoln, doesn't refer as the entire life of Abraham Lincoln. It's all about how the name ""Lincoln"" became famous and memorable throughout history because of one legend's remarkable achievement. The film shows a rather interesting way of portraying its history. It mostly explores inside the Civil War with politicians fighting their decisions. It may not be the usual type of entertainment for some, but seriously, it's all about the history and the film never backs away from that. Lincoln is generally thought-provoking and mesmerizing by its strong dialogue, and brilliant direction and performances, added with magnificent filmmaking."
"str_chuter8","2","5","10","26 January 2013"," Disappointing
","As several other reviewers have noted, this is a rather boring movie. Staying awake for the duration was a challenge.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is not one of Mr. Spielberg's better efforts. We are given too many modernist interpretations for it to be enjoyable. The first three minutes give us a glimpse of what's in store. Negro soldiers approach President Lincoln, complaining about their rate of pay. Using perfectly-educated diction. Quite farcical. The Negros idolized Lincoln. Lincoln was champion of their fight for freedom! None would have dared complain to the President about a paycheck. Mr. Spielberg completely misses the fact that these former slaves turned soldiers are getting PAID! One of the white soldiers then starts in reciting ""The Gettysburg Address"". More fantasy. Illiteracy was the norm. The average man could not read let alone recite something from memory.<br/><br/>The casting was dismal. Daniel Day-Lewis just did not do it for this viewer as Honest Abe. His voice is too nasal and whiny. He has perhaps a handful of good lines in the entire movie. His accent creeps through once or twice. We get very little sense of the greatness of the man. Sally Field played Sally Field. Tommie Lee Jones pretty much played Tommie Lee Jones.<br/><br/>The script was uneven. Near the end of the film we get self-absorbed introspection from Mary Todd Lincoln (""They're all just going to think I was crazy""). Not likely! In another scene on the floor of the House of Representatives, one of the Congressmen actually uses the term 'blacks'. I'm sorry, that was NOT in the lexicon of 1864 America. This wasn't even in the lexicon of 1964 America!<br/><br/>Of course, the title is quite misleading too. The film doesn't really tell us much about Lincoln, the man. Maybe a better title would have been ""Fear and Loathing in Congress"".<br/><br/>The film is overly dark. Why did the cinematographer feel the need to dim the lights down to mere shadows for nearly all scenes? This effect did nothing but distract the viewer and induce slumber.<br/><br/>But the biggest failure of the film is the lack of a cohesive story. Mr. Spielberg just throws various scenes on top of one another with little to hold them together. A bit more character development would not have hurt either. How many audience members know anything at all about lifelong bachelor Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (who chaired the powerful House Ways and Means Committee) and his mixed-race widowed housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith? Other reviewers have also tried somehow to compare this film to John Cromwell's Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940). There IS no comparison. Cromwell's film is masterful. Granted, the Cromwell film does have a few flaws of its own but the script and historical accuracy were exceptional. Raymond Massey gave the best portrayal of Lincoln this reviewer has ever seen. Ruth Gordon also gave a fine performance as Mary Todd Lincoln.<br/><br/>Much, much more was expected here. Sadly, the film fails as both entertainment and historical reference."
"Danusha_Goska","7","9","22","17 November 2012"," A Disappointment. But Daniel-Day Lewis is Great
","I really wanted to love ""Lincoln."" I was hoping for a biopic that would be both intimate and spectacular. I wanted the film to sweep me away and bring me close to an historical figure in the way that ""A Man for All Seasons"" allowed audiences to feel close to Sir Thomas More, or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" created an unforgettable impression of T. E. Lawrence. I was hoping at least for a film as good as John Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln."" <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" felt more like an educational docudrama than a gripping feature film. Daniel Day-Lewis, though, gives a commanding performance as Lincoln. You should see the film. It is good. It's just not anywhere near good enough. <br/><br/>It's hard to believe that Steven Spielberg, one of the most successful and influential Hollywood directors of all time, could have made a film so plodding and wooden. Scriptwriter Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer-prize winner. I would have to guess that Mr. Kushner did not win that prize for crafting gripping, dramatic scripts charged with dramatic tension and driven by character-revealing plot. <br/><br/>The film is entitled ""Lincoln"" but it would be more aptly titled ""The Passing of the 13th Amendment Outlawing Slavery."" This shift of focus may have been done to make the film ""relevant.""<br/><br/>It's a high school English class truism that the main character of a story is the one who changes. Abraham Lincoln does not change in this film. In many scenes, he feels like a statue in the corner. Lincoln deputizes WN Bilbo (James Spader) to hustle up the necessary votes. Spader is terrific as Bilbo, and he almost steals the movie. It's Bilbo who is moving and shaking. Lincoln just hangs back and comes out with a quip or bon mot or folksy, homespun tale or spooky prophetic dream every now and then. Heck, the animatronic Lincoln at Disneyland could do everything that Spielberg and Kushner allow their Lincoln to do. <br/><br/>Sally Field is too old to play Mary Todd Lincoln, who was in her forties at the time, with a young son. In her every scene, all I kept thinking was, ""So, how is Sally Field doing as Mary Todd Lincoln?"" I was never able to forget that it was Field I was looking at, never able to escape the fact that I was watching a film rather than being immersed in a story. <br/><br/>Many of the actors seem to have a hard time delivering Kushner's lengthy sentences. There is a scene where Mary Todd Lincoln is, in a long-winded manner, telling off Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) at a formal dinner, and it is so stiff it feels like a high school production. Daniel Day-Lewis never has this problem with the dialogue. <br/><br/>David Strathairn is terrific as William Seward, Lincoln's secretary of state. He and DDL are utterly convincing in their scenes together. You really get a sense that these are two political partners with differing styles who are struggling as best they can toward a common goal – ending slavery. At one point Lincoln grievously disappoints Seward, and he dismisses Seward by remarking, ""Time is a great thickener of things."" Seward's response is priceless. The movie comes to life at that moment. It is depicting a vital but trouble relationship, how that relationship vents its anger, how it heals its wounds, how it struggles onward toward a hoped-for goal. If more time had been devoted to Lincoln and Seward's relationship, ""Lincoln"" would have been a better film. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones delivers the biting insults of Thaddeus Stevens, Pennsylvania congressman and chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. Stevens' insults, and his ridiculous wig, and Tommy Lee Jones' persona and voice, are so striking that Stevens almost becomes a caricature. He bellows that another house member is a reptile too low to step upon. The film doesn't get beyond that. It doesn't bring us into the mind of a white man courageous enough to battle slavery. There is a great, brave, brief scene where Lincoln and Stevens speak face-to-face and one-on-one. Stevens talks about his contempt for the common man. How could such a contemptuous person fight for human dignity? It's a conundrum the film doesn't plumb. Lincoln responds to Stevens with a terrific metaphor about compasses and swamps. Again, if there had been more of this kind of intelligent, challenging, and focused dialogue, this would have been a better film. <br/><br/>My major disappointment with this film is that it didn't bring me any closer to Lincoln. There is something about Lincoln that defies the limitations of his time and place, and, therefore, understanding of him. He is truly larger than life. In the many photos of him, we see a compelling but inaccessible man. His features, with their marked facial asymmetry, grip and confound us – they invite, and resist, intimacy. He married a woman rumored to be mad. He was rumored to be a homosexual. He was martyred on Good Friday and it is said he haunts the White House. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance made me feel close to Lincoln, but the plot and direction didn't support that. I left disappointed. <br/><br/>The production values are lavish. Scenes are chock-a-block with authentic, accurate, books, costumes, boot buckles, mustache combs, clay jugs, corsets, wallpaper. You almost get a whiff of the stale air of a museum. I look forward to watching the extra-feature-packed DVD that will include a chart with little arrows pointing to each object and offering its provenance, age, and construction materials."
"jmoney-2","10","6","13","17 January 2013"," A movie for the ages
","Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is not a traditional biopic. It takes the view that a man's life is measured by his deeds. So, rather than trace the 16th President's whole life story, the film gives us a portrait of Abraham Lincoln by focusing mainly on the few weeks in early 1865 when he achieved his signature deeds: ending slavery and preserving the union. In seeing how he led the nation at that pivotal moment, we learn all we need to know about who he was and how he lived.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis brings Lincoln to life in a way that is both unexpected and likely to forever change our concept of the man. Our image of Lincoln has been so shaped by statues and still photos; it is hard to remember he was a living, breathing person. Day-Lewis' mesmerizing performance shows us a Lincoln who is engaging, charismatic, funny and sometimes fiery. This is the Lincoln who could captivate crowds with his oratory, who could inspire others to follow him.<br/><br/>Lincoln is not a movie where the drama is played out against a backdrop of politics. In this movie, politics is the drama. This is a movie about process. It lays bare the often-ugly route leaders had to take to accomplish change in the 19th century (a route that doesn't seem much different than the ones today). It's a movie that's about principle versus compromise, and the balance that needs to be struck to get things done. In one scene, Lincoln makes a poignant analogy while speaking with abolitionist Representative Thaddeus Stevens (played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones – who nearly steels the movie). Lincoln reminds Stevens that a compass can tell you which way is North, but it can't tell you where the swamps are along the way. It would probably do every politician a lot of good to watch that scene.<br/><br/>To tell this story, Spielberg has assembled one of the most impressive casts in movie history. From the wonderful Sally Field, to the aforementioned Mr. Jones; from the always-incredible David Straitharn to the great Hal Holbrook; from the hilarious James Spader to the terrific Michael Stuhlbarg – from top to bottom, nearly every speaking role is filled by one of our finest actors.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is simply saturated in greatness. We have our greatest living director (Spielberg), working from a script by one of America's greatest playwrights (Tony Kushner), based in part on a book by one of our greatest historians (Doris Kearns Goodwin), starring arguably the western world's greatest actor (Day-Lewis) – all to tell the story of our greatest president. When Lincoln died, it was said, ""Now he belongs to the ages."" Lincoln, the movie, is one for the ages, too."

","This movie is one of Steven Spielberg best films, saying this movie is well acted is an understatement of how well ever one does in this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis is the best Lincoln I have seen, however Tommy Lee Jones steals the show, while you're watching scenes with Daniel Day-Lewis you are completely entertained but, Tommy Lee Jones gets your undivided attention whenever he is on screen. Everyone else on screen is great but if Daniel Day-Lewis or, Tommy Lee Jones is on the screen you mainly focus on them. This movie keeps you interested threw most of the movie without even trying, you can just listen to these great actors talk and be completely content. This is the best biographical picture I have seen if you have any interest in the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, or the 13th amendment you will enjoy this movie."
"bkoganbing","10","6","13","1 December 2012"," ""These dead shall not have died in vain""
","Stephen Spielberg did some meticulous research or maybe I should say that Doris Kearns Goodwin did some for him when she wrote her best seller Team Of Rivals about Lincoln and his Cabinet during the Civil War. Otherwise Lincoln the film wouldn't be a film destined to win a lot of awards next year. Spielberg had it all down, including the club foot that Thaddeus Stevens had.<br/><br/>By the time that 1865 rolled around a most war weary public just wanted an end and they could see it in sight with Grant battering Lee in Virginia and taking some heavy casualties every time out and Sherman coming up from Georgia through the Carolinas after Joe Johnston. However the man in the White House had a deeper concern, he wanted something out of the war, something lasting. Like an end to slavery once and for all.<br/><br/>So with the Confederates looking to salvage their Slaveocracy and sending peace commissioners and the Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner in the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens in the House wanting abolition once and for all, Lincoln steered a tricky course through public opinion to get the 13th amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery.<br/><br/>In a nutshell the film Lincoln is about one of the lines from his famous Gettysburg Address. Abraham Lincoln wanted to know in his heart that the people he memorialized, who lay beneath the soil at Gettysburg, died for a noble purpose. As he said on that occasion, ""these dead shall not have died in vain"".<br/><br/>Not everyone in politics is in it for anything noble however and the President of the United States had more in the way of patronage to make things happen that he wanted. God only knows for instance what Lyndon Johnson had to offer to bring a few votes along to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Not everyone voted for that strictly to memorialize the late John F. Kennedy. Lincoln was an old hand at that from his years in Illinois. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field make a splendid Abe and Mary Lincoln and Spielberg gave us enough of a view of the home life at the White House with the two surviving sons. Robert Lincoln who was more his mother's son than his father's except he inherited Lincoln's ability as a lawyer wanted very much to serve in the Civil War. But Mary Lincoln lost her two boys between Robert and Tad and did not want to lose her oldest in the war. So Robert unlike his father who studied law by candlelight and clerked, got a Harvard education instead. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Robert and young Gulliver McGrath plays the mischievous Thomas Todd 'Tad' Lincoln.<br/><br/>Of the supporting cast Thaddeus Stevens as played by Tommy Lee Jones is most memorable. Stevens who unofficially led the Radicals was a man way ahead of his time. His 'housekeeper' was a black woman with whom he had two daughters whom he could not marry because of miscegenation laws. He wanted full equality for all and did not care who knew it. Later on he led the effort to impeach Lincoln's successor Andrew Johnson who as Vice President-elect plays no role here as most Vice Presidents do. That whole story is told albeit with a different historical slant in the film Tennessee Johnson with Van Heflin as Johnson and Lionel Barrymore as Stevens. <br/><br/>I think the only question remaining is how many Oscars Lincoln will pick up next year."
"B24","10","6","13","18 November 2012"," A Full House
","At a noon screening I sat in a full house of mainly seniors but also some young folks who appreciated the mood and gravity of the narrative as it reflected our own time as it did that of the debate and passing of the 13th Amendment. To my pleasant surprise, the crowd laughed at the right times and remained silent at the right times. Complicated history laid bare as stark reality rarely elicits such insight from a mixed audience. I attributed their discernment, perhaps too generously, to the fact we have good schools and great teachers in our community. A snobbish but natural reaction.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis will almost surely receive an Oscar nomination for his thoughtful performance of Lincoln. Indeed all the main characters may be nominated in one form or another, as will the director and the production staff. This is not merely a good film but a great one.<br/><br/>If I have one reservation, it is that the opening scene in which a group of soldiers ponderously recite parts of the Gettysburg Address seemed curiously staged, rather like having schoolboys stand at a PTA meeting to take turns mouthing patriotic slogans. A jarring departure, and too reminiscent of modern political correctness from an otherwise compelling drama. <br/><br/>I hope the outtakes will someday be available. I could have watched another hour or so without complaint."
"lovyrsmile","10","6","13","17 November 2012"," I loved the movie
","The subject of Abraham Lincoln life and all of his many accomplishments is just too big a scope for one 2 1/2hr movie to cover. I like that Steven Spielberg decided to limit it to his last few months in office and to a subject he felt so very strongly about. I wish that he would do a miniseries to include much more of Lincoln's life from humble beginnings on - that would be awesome. You see glimpses of all the different factions he had to deal with including his family and realize the great amount of pressure the man lived under every day, and yet, dealt with what he had to with quiet grace and honor. Politicians of today would greatly benefit from lessons learned from Lincoln. Honor is dead in Washington and these are the people leading our country to ruin. Lincoln was known as a story teller to make his points and there are several interesting facts brought out in the movie that are not ""common knowledge"". I liked the ending...Spielberg made a great decision in not sensationalizing the inevitable end. The movie made me want to know more about the key people around Lincoln also. I hope that Daniel Day-Lewis receives the recognition he deserves for this wonderful performance I felt I was watching Lincoln himself an not an actor so I really hope he is nominated and receives an Oscar. Well done Mr Spielberg and Thank you Mr Day-Lewis."
"tye1138","7","13","35","10 November 2012"," Third grade history and a glamorous 1800's destroy Lincoln
","The 1860's were a dark time in American history, there wasn't anything light or happy about. Spielberg decided to make this movie light and happy, in both cinematography/set design, but also in the story. What is presented on screen is non-controversial story, yes it's the truth, but its omitting all of the gritty stuff which could make a movie like this actually interesting, instead of just a costume drama. Films like The Patriot, True Grit and Glory, do a far better job representing the time period then Spielberg's lavish, over the top production. By far the weakest element of Lincoln is the lack of darkness, the lack of realism in how the film was made. <br/><br/>To Spielbergs credit, he is a fast worker, there is nobody in the industry today making big blockbusters anywhere near the speed he is doing it. However, on this film I wish he had slowed down a bit, I wish he had just taken more time to make sure the end product was more realistic. Its great to have a nice set, but if its over-lit, like we're watching a film shot in the 50's, it detracts heavily from the realism. Everything looks to modern in the film like it was made yesterday, even though SOME locations are actually real. They're too polished, everything is to good looking from the actors and costumes to the exterior locations and sets. Someone needed to dirty-up every single set, forcing Spielberg to realize that candles were the only light of the time. Again, because Spielberg works with the same crew day in and day out, all his movies look the same, no matter what time period they're shot in. To me, that is a huge detractor because dealing with the Civil War in Lincoln and World War 1 in War Horse, you'd think the world would be a bit darker and all that happy lighting and set design wouldn't exist. What's humorous to me is, Spielberg has made some dark movies, Saving Private Ryan and Schindler List being two of them. So what was stopping him from making Lincoln in the same way? <br/><br/>Lincoln does have some saving graces; an awesome cast, a very well written script, its edited to perfection and of course Williams score is top notch. You get the impression by watching this film, there are going to be a lot of academy award nods in the acting department and of course a best picture nod because hey, its Spielberg right? <br/><br/>Putting the lack of interesting history and glamorous 1800's aside, Lincoln is an entertaining movie and one has to admit, its well made. Leaving the theater I was disappointed because of what could have been. But it wasn't my movie and Spielberg's vision was clear, his 1800's are bright and glamorous, his Lincoln could do no wrong and the audience is sucked into that world for almost three hours, enjoying every moment of it."

It involves very little 'action' considering the civil war that was being fought at the time and although it does touch on Lincoln's rise from rags and his personal family lose it doesn't go much further than just mentioning it in one or two lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>I had some misconceptions going into the cinema on this one.

","It's commonly asserted that the war between the states was fought over the practice of slavery. The truth is the North had slaves also, plus all the slave ships were owned by the North. Bringing slaves over was a real money maker for the people up north.<br/><br/>No, it was about money. Lincoln could not let the South go in peace because it was such a cash cow. If Lincoln had been as honest as they claim he was, then at Gettysburg he would have said, ""I am hereby highly resolved that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth — whether they like it or not, and any attempt by the southern states to go and form their own nation will be met with force — even if we have to slay every last fighting man among them."" <br/><br/>One of the things I found true to life about the movie was how the Lincolns were opposed to their son joining the army — Mrs. Lincoln bitterly so. People of power and influence seldom had to serve in the armed forces, and if they did it was usually well behind the front lines. JFK was a notable exception that comes to mind.<br/><br/>Another accurate portrayal was how the Democrats were the party of slavery, and the Republican party was founded to counter that stance, with Lincoln being their first president to be elected. (Well, the Democrats still are about enslaving people, but now they have had to become a bit more subtle about it. Not that I am standing up for the Republicans, mind you. They have sold out the country here lately to a treasonous degree.) <br/><br/>The movie did a fair job of showing the dead, the maimed, the amputated parts being carted off in wheelbarrows to a mass grave a la Private Ryan, but the fact is that all this carnage took place because of Northern aggression. Lincoln could ride his horse among all the fallen and mourn and look all sorrowful, but the fact is that he and he alone was the one whom he should have blamed for all the bloodshed.<br/><br/>Still, Lincoln can be a moving tale, and the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is compelling. As a vehicle to dramatically transport one to another time and place this is worth a watch, but be prepared to suspend any true knowledge of history during your trip."
"Red_Identity","Null","7","16","27 December 2012"," One of the greatest Historical dramas ever
","I'm not a huge fan of Steven Spielberg at all, and I've never made it secret. He's talented yes, but the sentimentality and formulaic mainstream tendencies are always present in every one of his films, to different extents. Lincoln turned out to be a really fantastic film though, and is probably Spielberg's best film since Schindler's List and probably one of the few ones I have ever loved from him. <br/><br/>The reason the film works so well is because it has a really great screenplay at work. Tony Kushner writes this story like a pro, simply said. The dialogue is nearly always riveting, never dry, and is able to inject humor in all of the right places while still clearly defining so many of the characters that weave in and out of the story. It also wisely doesn't go to too many places and instead is clearly focused on one aspect of Lincoln's life and American history in general. Because of that, I would say this is a writers' film more than a directors' one, and in all honesty I am surprised Steven Spielberg chose it. There's not much indication that he's behind the camera, and that's great for me. Instead of feeling like a signature Spielberg film, it still manages to be tightly calculated and touching in all of the right moments because of his restrained directing. In the moments that do aim for something more moving, it feels more honest and doesn't feel hokey. I am incredible grateful for that, especially after the horrid War Horse last year.<br/><br/>The ensemble here is magnificent. Sally Field seemed out of place at first, but I warmed up to her as it went along and her way of playing up the infamous Mary Todd Lincoln. Other great performances include David Straitham, with a gentle and compassionate performance, Gordon Levitt, who I've never liked much but was pretty great here, John Hawkes, Michael Stuhlbarg, James Spader, and Lee Pace among the best. But the film belongs to two men, Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. Lewis is magnificent here, invoking the personality that so many have heard of yet never witnessed. Regardless, it's a different type of performance from the one he played 5 years ago as Daniel Plainview, and because it's simply not as physically or emotionally commanding, it won't be the type of performance everyone can get behind for awards. But he was perfect, and as of now is the best male performance of the year (although I still have a lot to see). Tommy Lee Jones is probably just as fantastic, stealing every scene he is in and injecting a dose of power, warmth, and charisma to everything he touches. I have yet to see most of the actors in contention for Supporting Actor, but I would be ecstatic if Jones wins it because regardless, it's an incredibly compelling performance.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think even those who aren't fond of Spielberg can enjoy it. He gives material room to breathe and instead of forcing every dose of sentimentality into every frame of certain scenes, he makes the film work beautifully, showcasing the fantastic acting and tight writing. This is highly recommended, and one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the best historical films I've ever seen."

","Abraham Lincoln. Steven Spielberg. Daniel Day-Lewis. Any of these words alone commands a lot of attention and respect; put them together, and you have an almost inconceivable amount of reverence. ""Lincoln"" is reminiscent of the powerhouse Oscar biopics of the '90s and early 2000s, but unlike other recent biopics, it mostly measures up to the hype.<br/><br/>I say mostly, because as good as ""Lincoln"" is, the tendency will be to exaggerate it because of the subject matter and talent on hand. The film deserves plenty of praise, but it operates on the level of what you see is what you get. It lacks of the obscured themes and subtleties of more recent Oscar-winning fair, but the ""old-school Oscars"" nostalgia it evokes will assure that it sees a good degree of accolades.<br/><br/>The rock at the film's center isn't Spielberg, but rather Day-Lewis. The two-time Oscar winner known for waiting for, finding, securing and delivering unforgettable leading roles as though he knows something no one else in his profession does, will disappoint no one except those hoping to see another incarnation of Daniel Plainview from ""There Will Be Blood."" Day-Lewis' ""Lincoln"" is calm, reserved yet every bit as commanding of the screen as Plainview. Day-Lewis knows everyone's eyes will be on him, so he dials his performance down in a way that makes him even more prominent, while also reflective of an older Lincoln who is used to the ""fame"" and concerned most about his legacy.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" takes place in the final four months of the president's life starting two months after his reelection (January of 1865) and concluding with his assassination. So no, it's not a traditional biopic, rather it shows Lincoln at a specific time in his life. You could also say the focus is less on Lincoln and more on passage of the 13th Amendment, which might've been a more appropriate (though less Oscar-baiting) title.<br/><br/>The even greater context is the Civil War, which is turning undoubtedly in the Union's favor at this point in time, but with the body count mounting, Lincoln faces pressure to end it by any means possible. One of those means is the 13th Amendment, which would abolish slavery if passed in the House of Representatives, but Conservatives believe a peace agreement might be reached faster. Realizing peace talks/the Confederacy's surrender could happen sooner than later and derail any chance for the passage of the amendment, Lincoln, along with Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) puts all his muscle into winning over enough congressmen to secure the necessary two-thirds majority vote.<br/><br/>Writer Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") keeps things straightforward in a film that could get lost in the intricacies Washington politics. Consequently, ""Lincoln"" is a rather accessible film, yet also a bit heavy-handed. Especially at the beginning, characters speak in rather detailed terms about, for example, the two-thirds majority vote, opting for clarity rather than authenticity of speech. <br/><br/>The script also paints Lincoln as a storyteller quick to snuff out verbal conflict with a good tale or two, usually ending in a humorous punchline. We get a good portrait of Lincoln's personality in this way, though hardly a complex one. The complexity comes in with the subplot involving his relationship to wife Mary Todd (Sally Field), specifically in regards to their two (living) children, Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Mary Todd gets a rather one-dimensional portrait. She's clever, but ultimately defined by how traumatized she was when their son Willie died of illness a few years prior. Field has the gravitas to hold down the part well, but it's far less interesting than the focus of passing the amendment in the main narrative.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" has its greatest degree of modern relevance in terms of how he had to secretly ""buy"" the votes of several moderates in the House. He promised jobs rather than uglier bribes such as money, but considering today's issues with nepotism, it's an interesting parallel, especially when you consider that this ""dirty work"" was done to achieve something so fundamental as securing liberty for an entire race of people. You can't exactly blame him for using whatever tactics he could. <br/><br/>Outside of the man in the tall hat himself, Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones should and will get noticed by awards bodies for portraying radical Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens, who throws about some legendary (albeit archaic) insults at his Democratic opposers. He's more than just comic relief however, as he gets a pretty substantial and well-rounded subplot that tests his character as well as Jones' ability. <br/><br/>A number of other talents show up or play integral supporting roles in the film, but chalk that up to every actor demanding their agent get them a part in the Spielberg film about Lincoln. Parts played by Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, James Spader, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jared Harris, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley and more could've as easily been played by unknowns, though they all do lend some extra legitimacy to the film as far as it being an event drama.<br/><br/>Also adding in this regard is all the top-notch technical work. Spielberg always has the best crews on hand for his films and ""Lincoln"" has an incredible visual color palette and the dignified look of a truly important historical drama. His camera is slow-moving and subtle so as to allow us to soak up Day-Lewis' performance and all the intriguing drama. He also knows a thing or two about emotional catharsis, and while the scene in which the House votes on the amendment won't bring you to tears, it's still so darn moving — you feel as though you are truly witnessing history.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" doesn't offer many surprises, but considering how thoroughly it handles politics and captures important themes about doing what's right in such a pure way, history teachers will show it in class for years to come.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! moviemusereviews.com"

","Stephen Spielberg directed it. An American icon. And it's got great reviews and award nominations so what's not to like. I excitedly bought my ticket and... fell asleep. I lost count but must have dozed off a half dozen times. I understand that the film is historically accurate, acting is top notch, costume and the sets are authentic recreations, but the reality is I was bored throughout. Unless the viewer has some historical interest in the 13th amendment and abolishment of slavery I find it hard to imagine how the average audience would be interested in listening to old men in top hats debate the 13th amendment in hard to understand 18th century old English. But if you ever have trouble falling asleep this film is a guaranteed cure for insomnia."
"J_Batek_II","8","3","5","22 June 2019"," Daniel Day-Lewis Paints An Image Of Lincoln To Last 100 Years.
","I can't remember what image I had of Abraham Lincoln prior to seeing this film for the first time. I'm sure I had my own ideas about how he looked, how he sounded when he spoke, his demeanor, etc. I've read about Lincoln - I knew he was said to be soft-spoken, with a sometimes high-pitched voice. I knew he was supposed to be tall, with a bit of a 'stoop' in his posture. Now, when I think of Abraham Lincoln, all I see is Daniel Day-Lewis as 'Lincoln' (2012). Day-Lewis captured all of those qualities I read about, as well as the look from the paintings we have all seen. Spielberg set an appropriate tone and I liked the darkness in many of the scenes. This combination made me feel like I was back in time, witnessing the real Lincoln. And, it's not just Lincoln, but the entire ensemble cast are well-costumed and in top form.<br/><br/>This film isn't for everyone, and it's easy to be mislead as to what this film actually is represents. This is not necessarily a civil war tale, or even a tale about slavery. This film is about the legislative process in early democratic America. It's about the law v morality. And, although I love the movie, I fell asleep the first two times I tried to watch it. It is a little longer than it needs to be and the scenes with Lincoln and his youngest son could have been cut to save about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>It may not be a perfect film, but after experiencing it, this is the image I will have of Abraham Lincoln for the rest of my life. That happens sometimes, when great actors take on great historical roles. Daniel Day-Lewis has created a new cultural frame-of-reference for Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

","Lincoln was a very commendable movie. It was very historically accurate which was perhaps the best thing about the film. It is quite a long film but is able to hold your attention for the vast majority of the film. It has it slow parts as all movies do, but they rapidly pick up and regrab the viewer's attention. Daniel Day-Lewis does a phenomenal job playing Lincoln. He makes the character relatable and very likable. I know myself, I fell for Lincoln's open and humorous behavior throughout the film. He did a very good job with the role he played. Sally Field also showed a very commendable performance, she played Lincoln's witch of a wife very well. I also admired the director's casting. He made all the actors look almost identical to the real historical figures within the film. It was amazing! The actors did genuinely represented the characters well! Overall it was a very good film, a bit slow at times, but very good! I recommend the film to all the history and Civil War buffs out there!!"
"suzanne-sellers","10","3","5","12 April 2014"," Breathtaking!
","I had avoided seeing this for several years because I thought it might be hard to keep up with the characters, or maybe it would be too ""wordy"" to understand. I'm also not a big fan of ""period speech"".<br/><br/>I was completely wrong! The speech is clear as a bell and completely understandable. After seeing it once, I plan to watch Lincoln again and again to savor every moment and every line. My overwhelming impression is how very similar politics is today to what it was then. Haggling for votes, horse-trading, promising jobs in the new Administration if votes for a particular piece of legislation are delivered. Unrepentant racists, spineless progressives who are afraid to vote their conscience. They existed then and they exist now. And the President is forced to compromise on some issues and press ahead on others which are unpopular to his advisers. <br/><br/>Poor Mary Todd Lincoln, half crazy over the loss of two sons Edward and Willie. She was forced to face tragedy her entire life - truly a tormented soul. Sally Field was fabulous in this role.<br/><br/>This film is so good I literally had goosebumps the entire time. To see our history come to life so beautifully, its simply the best film I have ever seen."

","Being not part of the American school system (and indeed, having not having had much of an education at all) the most I knew about Abraham Lincoln was the guy in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure who advised the students in a Most Triumphant speech towards the end to ""PARTY ON, DUDES!!"" You might think ""PHILISTINE!! How could you not know about his contribution to ending modern day slavery, or his untimely end in a theatre at the hand of one John Wilkes Booth?"" to which I can only shrug my shoulders and advise them to visit the two pathetic establishments where I spent most of my formative years. They'd soon change their tune.<br/><br/>So, here's Daniel Day Lewis in full regalia... bushy beard, top hat, wearing stilts... (Or is he actually that tall...) Does he capture the essence of Mr Lincoln? Who knows... but he certainly acts like I imagine the guy would, and he looks the part... so let's give him a pass. Abraham, according to how this film represents him, had a tendency to tell long stories of his personal experiences, which charmed and inspired everyone around him. He was well loved by pretty much all the population, and just coming into his second term as President. Then he decided to put a bill through Congress to end ownership of black people, and all Hell broke loose.<br/><br/>There was already a war going on between the South and the North, and this further exacerbated the situation because the South wanted to keep their plantations going... and they needed slaves to do that. So somehow Mr Lincoln had to perform the difficult task of getting the two sides to agree to peace, AND freeing ethnic minorities from the toil of the whip. No mean feat. But somehow he did it... (No SPOILER here, just read your history book) in no small way thanks to his gravitas as a leader, and his determination that every man should be equal. Alas, a bullet put an end to him soon afterwards, but all the ammunition in all the arsenals in the world couldn't stop his dream from achieving reality. (Sorry, stealing a tribute to Martin Luther King there. Still appropriate, I reckon) <br/><br/>This is the kind of movie I can imagine watching as part of exam coursework than for true entertainment purposes. It's very informative, and made with a true appreciation of the subject. It is also incredibly long-winded, and with not a lot to carry it for long periods other than Day Lewis's (admittedly superb) performance, things can get a trifle dull. We learn Lincoln had a fractious relationship with his wife, and his son threatens to sever ties with him over his desire to be a soldier. All interesting stuff, but not quite enough to pad out the lloonngg running time. So I 'get' what Spielberg is trying to do... I just didn't feel all that exhilarated afterwards, like if I'd watched a defining piece of cinema. Oh well... you're still a legend in my eyes Abe... 6/10"
"avik-kumar-si","8","3","5","23 October 2013"," A tremendous film with astounding performances
","The Steven Spielberg-directed Lincoln won two Oscars. But it could have easily won a couple more. Dealing with a momentous period in the life of the larger-than-life Abraham Lincoln and the events around him in his final years, the film achieved the fine balance between engaging the audience with Lincoln the man and the individuals around him from a personal perspective while capturing the aura of the great visionary.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis, in a superlative performance, is a treat to watch. The man invites aura and Day-Lewis absolutely nails the personality of the great erstwhile President of the USA to perfection. The poise, the voice, the gait, the delivery of the anecdotes and the list could go on. This is a performance that you feel like watching on loop. From Lincoln the husband to Lincoln the politician with a lawyer's brain, he engages the audience with each of Lincoln's many avatars. To top it, Tommy Lee Jones as the Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens is icing on the cake. Tommy Lee Jones with his thundering presence owns every scene he is in and holds his own with aplomb even in his scenes with Daniel Day-Lewis. Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln is terrific and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the son is quite likable.<br/><br/>However, there is much more to the film than performances. As Lincoln is at once about the force that is Lincoln and the pain of slavery, Spielberg needed to highlight both aspects simultaneously. And this is exactly what he does with tremendous skill and grace in his showcasing of a remarkable leader's heroic yet political mission against the spectre of a ravaging war looming large over a man's ambition of ending what he considered a heinous crime against humanity itself.<br/><br/>Featuring memorable sequences, breathtaking performances and storytelling of the highest quality, Lincoln is a must-watch."

","I don't know if it's because I'm young or what it might be, that makes me think this film was boring. I liked one thing about the movie and that was that I got to know Abraham a lot more. And I could see all the difficult choices he had to face. I've always admired Mr. Lincoln so I'm still glad I saw the movie, despite the fact that the movie didn't contain any ""action"". It was just a flat-line.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is famous for making great movies, but this was not his best one. Although I'm surprised Daniel Day-Lewis did such an amazing job, I was choked over how good he played, or should I say ""lived"" Lincoln. <br/><br/>It's a movie you should watch because of the contents, and the history and importance of Abraham Lincoln, and what he did. I believe any film lovers should watch it and be aware of its many Oscar nominations. (I personally wouldn't recommend it to any teenagers.)"
"severus2310","9","3","5","24 April 2013"," A movie to show that the content of the movie is still more important than the action
","Daniel Day-Lewis stole the movie. It was personally the best acting I have ever seen. There was no action scenes in this movie which is unlikely for a movie made by Steven Spielberg, but this film proved that he is not only good with explosions. The costumes and props of Lincoln set the time periods and scenarios very well and makes the viewer fell the appropriate atmosphere and the cinematography also manipulated the emotion of the audience as well as the excellent background music by John Williams. Steven Spielberg chose to tell the story in the perfect way, through both the eyes of both political sides and the time period was very well researched especially the way that people at the time thought and that added to the emotion created through the acting. The movie went through smoothly and there were almost no parts that seemed too short or too long. The movie Lincoln although it may not be for those who are looking for an action movie but if they would really take the time and understanding to see a movie with good content and acting or is interested in a drama or a political movie then this is a good movie for you"
"jwardww","5","21","63","9 November 2012"," Well, not so much Lincoln as Elliot Spitzer
","I thought I was watching a Mad TV sketch, replete with pompous dialog, howlingly bad wigs and imprecise accents, condescending racial stereotypes. But no, it was actually something that its producers hoped to be a contender for big awards. But what else would one expect from this pretentious director, the over-hyped doyenne of all-American Spam? Despite his many titles, one can identify only a few minutes of emotional authenticity in his oeuvre. They come in the early scenes of Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and Super 8. The rest is banal, trite and frankly phony. Sally Field usually elevates whatever role she takes on with her extraordinary talent. She is at sea here with this flatfooted material. The limited acting skills of D D. Lewis results in an unsure impersonation of Walter Brennan's voice as Grandpa McCoy, but a spot-on reflection of Elliot Spitzer's demonic aspect. Now there was an American politician whose fiendish visage did not hide a heart of gold. Lewis gives the impression of a man who does good deeds while hiding a preference to do ill. It was the opposite with the historic Lincoln, whose spooky Marfan syndrome could not dim a beautiful soul. If you want to connect with this wonderful President's spirit as communicated by a real actor, spend a few moments with Benjamin Walker's genius turn in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer. Played railroad straight, despite the ridiculous graphic novel source material, you get a better idea of what Lincoln was all about than you will from this pedestrian Flag Day float."

","First off, let me state that I felt the actors did a good job with their parts, especially Sally Fields; however, the storyline I felt left the viewer feeling very ""uninspired."" I believed this would be a film that could have showcased the leadership of Lincoln and left the viewer feeling a sense of courage and respect for the character of Abe Lincoln. Instead, I felt he was portrayed as somewhat of a simpleton with little depth of character. There was no great oratory from anyone, especially Lincoln, and considering the magnitude of which he felt the importance of passage of the 13th amendment, I think it would have been prudent for the writer of the script to have Lincoln give an inspiring message to mankind as to why he felt so strongly. Instead, I felt it was stated with no fanfare. I always enjoy the cinematography of a Steven Spielberg movie, but I felt the quality of the script was lacking where it could have been magnificent and inspirational. I was overall disappointed."

","It disturbs me when I think of how much money Steven Spielberg made for this. A glorified stage play, from the bottom to the top. Boring from start to finish. I hope to God Sally Field gets the Oscar she deserves for keeping this dull, talkie movie from being completely unwatchable. Her performance was the only true bright spot in an otherwise dreary, but intelligent exercise in non-committal. The Civil War scene was just Spielberg trying to scare the audience without committing and it was as transparent as glass.<br/><br/>How did the director of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan (not to mention War of the Worlds) drop the ball on the most important and compelling American subject of all time, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, SLAVERY and THE CIVIL WAR??? Ten minutes into this movie and I wanted to walk out, and two hours later nothing had changed. I could feel the suffering in the theater and the fake laughter they were all conjuring to try and keep themselves from wanting to die from pure boredom. Why Spielberg pulled a Chicago Cubs and dropped the ball on this subject is beyond me. The movie is almost insipid, its so bad. Spielberg made the mistake of trying to educate rather than entertain. There was more of Lincoln's spirit in ""Glory"" than there was in this entire vanity project. One of the biggest disappointments in the history of movies."

","This movie while historically significant just doesn't cut the mustard. The ending itself seeks to have the audience sympathetic with Abe instead being in pain over the assassination. The point of this movie is passage of the 13th amendment and what Lincoln did at every turn to insure he could get the votes. I would have much preferred his inner conflict to be displayed. Instead, Spielberg makes him out to be godlike instead of human. This image of Lincoln seeks only to editorialize on him rather than show him to be a tragic figure caught in a time of great difficulty. The only good acting in his movie is by James Spader who may have earned himself his first Oscar. Otherwise it is once persons views of the events at the time of the civil war. I don't expect this to be a box office hit but critics will laud it as they view these types of movies positively while most people will take it as average.

I cannot think of a flaw to report with this film. The accolades that have been heaped upon Daniel Day-Lewis are 100% deserved. Tommy Lee Jones is superb, as well. They will win Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Sally Fields delivers an outstanding performance as the emotionally fragile Mary Lincoln. The remainder of the cast is equally amazing. Whoever did the casting was spot on with every character. The story itself, the passing of the 13th Amendment, is one few people have heard, that is the actual details of the process.

","Our greatest President did not come from a wealthy home. He did not have an Ivy League education. Nor was he seen as experienced enough to take the office when he was elected amid one of the most politically volatile periods in United States history. But Abraham Lincoln was a leader of unparalleled strength, conviction, and honor, and Steven Spielberg's film brings to the screen the incredible story of how he united a fractured nation and ended the disease of slavery. <br/><br/>""Lincoln"" begins at the start of the sixteenth President's second term. Newly re-elected, he has a unique opportunity to work within an also fresh House of Representatives and see an unprecedented Amendment added to the Constitution to abolish slavery in the country. Lincoln's goal is complicated by his personal life; namely his wife Sally's depression over the death of their first son, and the rising tide of Democratic congressman determined to retain law keeping slavery as is. <br/><br/>No matter your politics, your race, or your background ""Lincoln"" is a film that unifies us. After a particularly dirty Presidential election this year, it was re-affirming to see how different Abraham Lincoln was than the men who have followed him. Lincoln was calm, soft-spoken and rarely raised his voice. He was every bit a political animal as the others who have lead the United States, but he did so through leadership. So sadly rare is that in any political office. <br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis deserves more than an Oscar for his performance. Lewis deserves to go down in history as one of the finest thespians ever to grace the script. Here he embodies a man that serves as a hero to us all yet remains a mystery, none of us know how Abraham Lincoln spoke, or walked. Yet Lewis is Lincoln. We never doubt for a moment that the man on the screen is anything but our finest President. <br/><br/>As his First Lady, Sally Field is as spontaneous and energetic as ever, though keeps with the documented depression and sadness that overwhelmed their family after the death of a son. She more than holds her own on screen with Lewis. Tommy Lee Jones is Representative Thaddeus Stevens, a short-tempered, quick-witted abolitionist on the side of the President to end slavery. Jones hobbles with a cane but portrays Stevens in thunderously strong performance. <br/><br/>Hal Holbrook, James Spader, David Strathairn, and countless others are the rest of Lincoln's cabinet, other congressmen, and party operatives. Each performance is perfect to a minute detail. But it is detail that separates Steven Spielberg's film from any other historical biography; ""Lincoln"" is as informative as it is entertaining. An enthralling script keeps the audience avidly interested as the set and person come to life. <br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is an American masterpiece. No historical film before it has unified its audience while telling a story vital to the freedom the United States is honored to represent today."
"cameronmorewood","10","5","11","12 January 2013"," Lincoln
","When going to the movies, most search for pulse-pounding action, laugh-out-loud comedy, or grade-A scare shows. While, Lincoln is none of these things, it is, without a doubt, a great American movie. Spielberg sets the table for his film expertly by casting his roles perfectly and hiring some of the great production designers in the business to create the civil-war area world required to give the film its full force.<br/><br/>At the center of his epic, playing none other than Mr. Lincoln himself, is one of the great actors of our time- Daniel Day-Lewis. Lewis creates a Lincoln so subtle, and so deep- that you instantly believe in the character. He speaks with a small, timid voice that is, in a way, also commanding and leader like. Abraham Lincoln has been called the father of our nation, and Lewis' Lincoln proves that title is fit. He plays the character with fierce passion, yet a warm spirit, and it'll blow you away.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally brilliant. Sally Field, in one of the best performances of her career, plays Mrs. Lincoln. Spielberg's film combined with Field's tenacity help to distinguish how much of an impact Mrs. Lincoln had in history. Give credit where credit is do- and credit is due here. She speaks with Lincoln constantly- and is very aware of the political situations he deals with. She is very opinionated and voices those opinions with a heart and soul most actresses couldn't project as well as Field does. Tommy Lee Jones is also very good; however, once the Oscars come around, he may have a difficult time beating out Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who was phenomenal in ""The Master."" <br/><br/>As for a more detailed overview of how this baby stacks up Oscar-wise, there are several awards it'll definitely be up for- Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Art Direction. It may be up for a few more- but those are the definite. For the intelligent moviegoer, Lincoln is a must-see."
"maximkong","5","5","11","5 January 2013"," Seems there is a missing 'Link' in Lincoln
","Spielberg ticked me off once again. This movie is very boring - even more so for the viewers like me who are unfamiliar with the detailed history preceding Lincoln's death. In fact, the whole >2 hours film was dedicated extensively to an event that involved political plays and nothing else. I have to say, at the end of the movie I don't feel much for the characters including Lincoln and the nation's civilians (the soldiers, the slaves who benefited from the amendment, or Lincoln's close friends and families) because that is how imperfect this movie turned out to be. The movie doesn't deserved to be given such a title as I still do not know much who Lincoln really was - his childhood, how he met his wife, more light on the family life? These were either non-existent or not elaborated enough.<br/><br/>Speaking of his wife, now I do not know if her depiction was accurate, but her role in the film only made the whole movie experience worse with her constant blabbering typical of a near control-freak housewife. Sally Field acted well befitting the demand of her role, but it doesn't save the film overall. Lincoln himself blabbers a lot too, and I wont blame it on the huge mouthful of dialogue which I assumed is the intended style of the film. So many things that were being uttered by him were pure gibberish coming from an accomplished politician and country leader, in contrast to some of the supporting characters who said things that made more sense. But I would commend a great performance from Daniel Day Lewis despite all the irritating flaws mentioned."

But the dialogue throughout the movie was gripping, moving, and frequently quite humorous! Those who know even a little about Abe Lincoln will know that he was fond of telling funny stories, and Spielberg did a fine job of incorporating that right from the beginning. And just about every other thing said by Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) was funny, whether meant to be or not.<br/><br/>The film is two and a half hours long, but is well worth sitting through, even multiple times as I have. After all, it is hard to condense so much history, even for just a short period of America's past, into even this length of a film.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is an excellent film for both history buffs and those wanting to know more about him and our nation's history alike.

","Portraying historical figures on film is a challenge. Such is particularly the case for beloved American icons with well-established identities.<br/><br/>The filmmaker's challenge rests not so much in recreating history. Typically, plenty of credible narratives exist which provide multiple accounts of the icon's role in history. What's toughest is striking the right balance between realism and art, melding history with entertainment, and doing what would seem impossible -- satisfying academics, film critics, and the ticket-buying, movie-going public. This is where Lincoln ultimately soars on at least one account, but fails in others.<br/><br/>One has to admire the filmmakers -- including Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner -- for not sentimentalizing the material. The creators appear to understand the gravity of the subject matter here, that what's portrayed on film and seen by millions over the next decades essentially becomes THE interpretation of history.<br/><br/>Which brings is to Lincoln -- the man, the President and the actor who portrays him, notably Daniel Day-Lewis. Â This is an extraordinary performance by perhaps the best film actor working today. I've long marveled at Day-Lewis' broad range of characters, from the villain in ""Gangs of New York"" to an equally mesmerizing figure in ""There Will be Blood."" To think Day-Lewis, who holds duel Irish and English citizenship, could manage to pull off absolute perfection in the role of perhaps America's most revered historical figure is an astonishing testament to the craft of film acting.<br/><br/>Every grueling detail of Lincoln's mannerisms -- his voice, his tone, his walk, and the disposition of his very presence -- are as exactly as one would hope and expect, which is not to say that any of this is predictable. After all, how exactly does one pull off the voice of a man who's voice was never recorded? How does an actor combine the expressionism of a largely self-educated Kentucky-born plainsman who becomes President, making him sound hokey but also wise? Day-Lewis' role will be favorably compared to Helen Mirren (""The Queen""), Meryl Streep (""The Iron Lady""), and Colin Firth (""The King's Speech""). But I think this was better, or at least more worthy of praise since a new benchmark has been hit here with the portrayal of iconic historical figures.<br/><br/>Still, Day-Lewis' marvelous performance isn't quite enough to make what is a good movie into a film classic. Some of the supporting roles, widely praised by most critics, aren't nearly as convincing in my judgment. James Spader is perfectly cast as the unscrupulous lobbyist. But I still couldn't forget for an instant that I was watching James Spader portray some guy that lived 150 years ago. I was reminded of Jude Law playing Watson in the ""Sherlock Holmes'"" series. Then, there's Tommy Lee Jones, who somehow managed to keep his West Texas accent in this mid-19th Century period piece, despite the fact the Senator he's portraying is from Pennsylvania. I enjoy Jones' work and his character, Thaddeus Stevens is actually more admirable in many ways than the title character Lincoln himself. But Jones, displaying the same heavy-handed bombast in every character he's played since ""The Fugitive,"" struck me as another out of tune chord in the Lincoln piano. Then, there's poor Sally Field, regretfully cast in the critical role of Mary Todd Lincoln. Aside from the fact she's at least twenty years older than the real Mrs. Lincoln, her character is an affront to actual history. For instance, there's no record or way Mrs. Lincoln attended the debates in the House of Representatives. But Sally Field gets her ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" dramatic moments, lending spousal encouragement from the front row balcony.<br/><br/>A few final thoughts: Those who go and see ""Lincoln"" (and I should note that this film should be seen) will probably be surprised as I was at how casual political Washington was in those times. Lincoln has virtually no personal security. The inside of the White House looks as cluttered with dust and worthless junk as my first D.C. apartment off of 17th Street. The imagery makes for one of the film's most interesting viewing pleasures -- seeing what day to day life was like in the chambers of power during the most critical phase of this nation's history.<br/><br/>Speaking of that history, Lincoln's final grade as a film will be reduced for what I consider a travesty. The blame rests alone with producer and director Spielberg. In one of the final scenes, when the climactic roll call vote is played out in Congress, each and every member of the House of Representatives must take a stand. Each man is required to take a position on the right or wrong side of history. Yet many of the names you will hear in the film have been changed.<br/><br/>That's right.<br/><br/>In the film's pre-release publicity tour, Spielberg explained his decision. He acknowledged that he changed the actual names of many Congressmen who voted against the 13th Amendment. His justification for doing this was (he said) not to embarrass the living descendants of these men.<br/><br/>Such gross misrepresentation of fact needs no counterargument. Those who were dead wrong, and who made the painful struggle for racial equality for all citizens more difficult should be exposed and known to all -- especially in a work which is presumably to be the most widely-seen recreation of this period of our history. It's mind-boggling that many of these names you will not hear in this movie, men who basically went on record against equality, have their names emblazoned on street signs and public buildings all over the country. Make no mistake. These are despicable people who abdicated all human decency when it mattered most.<br/><br/>I'd like to know those names. History and justice demands it. But instead, Spielberg chooses to whitewash it. And that's not just wrong. It's practically a historical cover up. One should hope and demand better from Spielberg.<br/><br/>Extended Review at: www.nolandalla.com"
"griffolyon12","10","5","11","19 November 2012"," A Marvel of Acting, Writing, and Directing
","Upon seeing director Steven Spielberg's latest, Lincoln, I would not at all be surprised to see both Spielberg and Abraham Lincoln-portayer Daniel Day-Lewis win their third Oscars, and deservedly so. Lincoln is a master class in acting, writing, and directing, as the cast and crew tell the story of the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's life and his battle to get slavery abolished by passing the 13th amendment.<br/><br/>All of the actors, from Sally Field as the tortured Mary Todd Lincoln to Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist Thadeus Stevens, relish in three-dimensional roles scripted with historical authenticity by screenwriter Tony Kushner, but it's Day-Lewis that steals the show. He disappears in the role, due in a large part to the brilliant make-up work which requires a genuine second glance to distinguish him from the real Abraham Lincoln in certain shots, in particular profiles. Where Day-Lewis excels though, is how he controls the performance. He rarely chews scenery, his high, reedy voice just seems perfectly natural to the Lincoln that he is presenting, with the real depth not always coming in his words, but in his soulful eyes. As a matter of fact, I would say that control is the best way to describe everyone's work in this film.<br/><br/>No performance outshines the other in a scene, there is never too much attention drawn to the cinematography, as everything all gels together nicely to feel organic to the story. What's most surprising, Spielberg and composer John Williams show genuine restraint in the sparseness of the music, such as letting it be entirely ambient noise when the 13th amendment is passed. However, this isn't the entire film, with Spielberg and company knowing when to give a little visual or aural flourish to make their point. While Spielberg often sits back in dialogue scenes to let the actors do their work, he always knows the right moment to push the camera in or pull it out to immerse you in their words, and the scene where the House is voting on the amendment, is as finely crafted a visual sequence he has ever done in his career.<br/><br/>Lincoln is a cinematic marvel, it shows the humanity of a man that we often put up on a pedestal, and even when we see him in all of his flaws, we are still drawn to him because he was just such a great man. It's such a loving portrait, that when you see Lincoln surrounded by his cabinet and his family, pronounced dead, you are overwhelmed by emotion to see a man that you have grown to love, never to open his soulful eyes again. However, as Spielberg illustrates in the final scene, with the slow dissolve from a burning candle to Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln will continue to burn on to inspire countless generations to come. If you want to try and make comparisons to the modern day political climate with this film, you're entirely in your right, but to me, this film is an inspiration, a firm reminder about the good of humanity and the leadership of a great man that should never be forgotten.<br/><br/>I give Lincoln a 10 out of 10!"
"SpitztheGreat","8","5","11","18 November 2012"," An Excellent Film
","Lincoln delivers. I could end my review right there, Lincoln delivers. So many things have already been written about this movie but I wanted to share some of my thoughts with the world.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing, flawless in fact. I've never seen him in a movie that he wasn't flawless in. I'm not sure I can say it any more clearly than that. DDL has made a career of playing strong characters (There Will be Blood) that dominate the screen. But in Lincoln he ""cracks the throttle"" and plays Lincoln with superb subtlety. President Lincoln is already larger than life, so there's no reason to take the character too far. Instead Daniel Day-Lewis presents a very Presidential Lincoln who is in ultimate control, even if those around him don't know it. If we didn't know President Lincoln was a real person then you would think that this movie was about some kind of impossible superhuman, that's how good DDL is.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is solid, no complaints about Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, or Joesph Gordon Levitt. They all pale in comparison to Daniel Day-Lewis, but that's the point. Sally Field has the thankless role of playing Mary Todd Lincoln, a person that makes Sybil look like a well adjusted woman.<br/><br/>Holding this movie back is it's length (2 1/2 hours) and its pacing. To say it straight: this movie is slow. If you're into history/politics/phenomenal acting then you should check this movie out ASAP. But if you're expecting this movie to be anything other than a slow burn you'll be disappointing. Again, if you like There Will be Blood, then you'll probably really like this movie.<br/><br/>The only other thing I have complaints about were the ending and it's overly cheesy handling of Lincoln's death (seriously, IMDb better not claim that's a spoiler, I didn't check the spoiler box). I felt that it should have been done differently, we all know how it ends and it could have been done in a more powerful way.<br/><br/>Those two ""complaints"" aside, go see this movie immediately if you've ever liked anything that Daniel Day-Lewis has done. Go see it even if you haven't because he does justice to President Lincoln that no one else could ever do."
"oldcrazyhobo","9","5","11","18 November 2012"," Incredible!
","I'm just gonna warn you, anyone who's not into history will not like Lincoln. If you're into history, specifically that time era (1860's) then you'll love what you're about to go see. The movie is all about Abraham Lincoln and his struggle with the 13th amendment. The only problem this movie really has is it's very talky. Lot's of talking and talking and talking... some people may not be entertained. I brought a girl to go see this and to say the least she was bored out of her mind while I was so into it. The directing is phenomenal, since you have Spielberg doing that it comes to no surprise. Same goes with the writing. Tony Kushner took six years to write the script and I have to say it was well worth it! Every line is so well thought out and every character performs it perfectly. Daniel Day-Lewis does an amazing job as Lincoln and the supporting cast is perfect. All in all I would defiantly give this a shot, but just a heads up it is long (about 2 and a half hours) and may be considered boring to some."
"richardchatten","9","2","3","30 April 2020"," The Thirteenth Amendment
","Yet another historical subject directed with the same fussy photography and at the same stately pace one expects from Spielberg when dealing with Olden Times and Big Subjects. The title - as so often - suggests a biography but in fact deals only with a short period of the subject's life; in this case the labours in the face of failing health and domestic discord to steamroller the 13th Amendment through Congress in January 1865.<br/><br/>Fascinating if exhausting, with a towering performance from Daniel Day-Lewis as an equally exhausted Lincoln working hard against the clock to secure his legacy; for which history - if not his contemporaries - remains grateful."
"charlywiles","9","2","3","15 February 2020"," Day-Lewis proves once again that he's the greatest actor alive
","I imagine that most of those who gave this a 1 or 2 rating and declared it 'boring' thought that they were settling down to watch 'Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter' rather than learn something about our history or one of our greatest Presidents in this enthralling, masterfully acted and brilliantly produced film. It's too bad that they couldn't appreciate inspiring art presented in a moving and powerful way before returning to 'Captain America' or 'Iron Man 4' or 'Batman vs. Superman 2.' I'd like to think that they're all under the age of 13 (maturity-wise if not chronologically), but unfortunately I suspect that it's just another example of the dumbing-down of America."
"zsmithson88","9","2","3","6 January 2020"," Daniel Day Lincoln
","Many have said, and many more will remember Abraham Lincoln as the most loved, heralded, and beloved president in the expansive, yet adolescent history of America. His unrelenting fervor that all people were created equal whether differing skin colors set apart or not, cemented itself through a tumultuous few years, which human dignity may now look back upon, smiling.<br/><br/>Spielberg is known for many great and priceless directorial endeavors. From the mounting atmospheric difficulties on the set of Jaws in Martha's Vineyard, to the graphic, however sincere beauty of Schindler's List, to the innovation of computer technology and imagination with the always endearing Jurassic Park, one thing remains true through Steven's lengthy film career - he continues to amaze us all.<br/><br/>Embarking upon the retelling of a man that altered the course of history forever is most certainly a task that carries certain and unmistakable intimidation and honor. Well, in short, Spielberg flourishes and delivers a film that deserves technical, as well as creative praise.<br/><br/>Choosing to cast Academy Award Winner, Daniel Day-Lewis was the wildcard to the entire production, and ultimately what gave the film a sense of humility, honesty, and integrity; all of the qualities that Lincoln embodied. Constantly and consistently throughout the film, I sat in wonder at how strikingly similar he was to the many photos and portraits we have to this day of the real Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>To make light of the ongoing war and methodical pace of the film, Lincoln (Day-Lewis) would unearth analytical jokes he heard during his earlier life as a lawyer, thus setting a nice pace for the two hour and twenty-nine minute haul. If these moments did indeed occur in the past, then Lincoln truly ""defined the era of which he was born into.""<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones must also be notably mentioned, due to his knack for making a role his own, despite the inclination of what should or shouldn't be from certain standpoints. Bottom line: Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor and always remains a constant, never disappointing.<br/><br/>The thing about this film that is quite remarkable is the focus on the overall depiction of how much burden Lincoln carried during his role as the 16th President of the United States. From personal grief, to national mourning, Lincoln carried the plethora of emotions within him, utilizing such as a propelling agent to achieve the supreme goal of seeing the 13th Amendment eclipse January of 1865.<br/><br/>In closing, there was a story of lawyer and his pet parrot, told by Lincoln. You see, this parrot rattled on and on about the coming of the ""end of the world!"" The lawyer, eventually tiring of this ongoing proclamation, killed the bird, thus fulfilling the doomsday message of the ""end of the world"" for the parrot, at least."

Each moment that could be written off as overly ideal or sincere only makes the sharper points about political maneuvering sharper, while lifting the brilliance of Lincoln & his compatriots to their proper iconoclastic stature.

"zafar142007","8","2","3","16 August 2016"," Amazingly crafted, very convincing indeed
","Spielberg has dramatized the most difficult months of Lincoln's presidency in intimate and sympathetic detail. I remember the way Lincoln would connect with his audience, share an anecdote and immediately lighten up the atmosphere. He seemed like an immensely likable man. When the moment demanded, he could also be tough and exercise the power his charisma granted him over others. The film focuses on the visionary that he was, the realist he had to become to achieve his vision and the certainty he had in his beliefs. The one thing that separated him from his peers was the ability to seek out the important from the inane. It is shown that he was aware of the historical moment that was upon them in the form of the Thirteenth Amendment, and he 'cepit diem'.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis has given us a remarkable performance. It is very hard to make out that the Lincoln we see brooding and connecting is actually an actor; someone for whom perfection has almost become a religion. The intensity of the gaze, the quiet voice, the slightly hunched posture, the thin grizzled beard have almost reanimated a history chapter.<br/><br/>The movie also delves into the personal conflicts of the great man. His own son joins the army, and he is faced with the tough choice between ending the war or passing the bill to abolish slavery. One could save his son and the other could save millions of people from a life of servitude. He doesn't back down, and the immaculate politician he was, manages to do both.<br/><br/>This is amazingly crafted, very convincing indeed. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>""If in pursuit of your destination, you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp, what's the use of knowing True North?"""
"AliceofX","8","2","3","21 February 2016"," Pulls You In
","In a film like this the last thing you would want is for the film makers to be historically illiterate. Usually it takes a sharp eye to catch that but this film takes no time and right at the very start destroys your confidence in the film's accuracy by calling the north free. That put me on the edge and I couldn't just relax and enjoy the rest of the film.<br/><br/>And yet despite that early blunder Lincoln did turn out to be a great film that was superbly acted. It was a film where the main character gave many speeches and told strange tales that went nowhere. Usually saying that would mean criticising the film but here it's made to work. You want to keep watching Daniel Day-Lewis. The movie pulls you in and doesn't let you go until the end.<br/><br/>It also looks spectacular. It has the type of gorgeous visuals that you'd want in a grand historical epic. If only it was one, because while the story is good it is somewhat lacking. Generally politics doesn't make for the most interesting story subject and that maybe the films problem.<br/><br/>But overall Lincoln is the type of film you would expect from Steven Spielberg in terms of quality and I highly recommend it to fans of historical drama."
"jennaroseashby","8","2","3","9 December 2015"," Good movie
","The movie ""Lincoln"" may have some people who believe that it did not correctly show how the abolishment of slavery really happened, but I think that the movie did accurately show how slavery ended. The reason I think that the movie accurately depicts how slavery ended was because Lincoln went through very many steps and tried hard to make sure that they got enough votes to make the abolishment of slavery happen. In the movie it shows this by showing how many votes it took to make owning a slave illegal. It showed how many arguments the abolishment made and it clearly depicted how much effort Lincoln put into abolishing slavery. You could also see in the movie how emotional Lincoln was because of how strongly he wanted this law to be passed. Besides the fact that no one called anyone a ""fatuous nincompoop"" the ending of the film ""Lincoln"" accurately portrays how it really happened."
"rches","10","2","3","4 December 2015"," Lincoln how true is it?
","The movie Lincoln showed how much Lincoln care about passing the bill that abolished slavery. Thaddeus Stevens as portrayed in the movie was a radical republican who would go to almost any means to abolish slavery. Part of the reason why he was so serious about this was that he was in love with a black woman which was in fact true. Even though it was extremely taboo at the time. Also at the beginning of the movie it show black men talking to Lincoln about his Emancipation Proclaimation, which freed slaves in areas of rebellion. The blacks were fighting for their freedom from slavery. At several times throughout the movie Lincoln showed how much he feared that the bill wouldn't get passed and all of the slaves he ""freed"" would go right back to being slaves. He was willing to risk getting impeached just to get the bill passed. It was a great movie Spielburg did a good job with this one."
"bmironti","9","2","3","1 December 2015"," Historical Accuracy of Lincoln and Slavery
","The movie Lincoln was an accurate portrayal of the history of slavery. The movie mainly focuses on the emancipation proclamation and the end of slavery. Although the emancipation proclamation was a big step towards the end of slavery and the end of the civil war, there were many other events that also pushed toward the end of both. By leaving out the other events, the movie is not historically inaccurate. The movie was just focusing on Lincoln and what he did to help end slavery while he was in office. In the end, this movie was very good and successfully portrayed the history of slavery and President Lincoln.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Brandon Mironti"
"jacksont-97972","9","2","3","30 November 2015"," Review of the end of slavery
","The movie Lincoln accurately portrays the ending of slavery good in some ways and worse in others. The movie's main topic was about Lincoln and the things he went through to actually get the amendment passed to end slavery. Although Lincoln did made a big part in the ending of slavery he was not the only factor. During the civil war the we're thousands of blacks fighting for their freedom. In the movie it shows the soldiers who fought for freedom but it was the only scene like it. For the movie in my opinion to more accurately depict slavery it should have showed more about the blacks and showed how they fought. The movie Lincoln I would say successfully portrayed part of the battle to end slavery. It showed Lincoln's part in ending slavery but lacked showing what the blacks did and how they contributed."
"byrne-78218","8","2","3","30 November 2015"," In conclusion the movie greatly showed how Lincoln fought to end slavery
","I believe that this movie greatly shows the end of slavery, and how hard Abraham Lincoln worked for it. It showed the great battle to win the slaves' freedom. For example, all the yelling and fighting in the house, trying to explain why they believed they were right. But, I don't think it showed enough of what happened after slavery ended. I believe the viewers would have wanted to see what happened to slaves, where they were, where they were living, and what rights they gained. Also, we would enjoy seeing what happened to the soldiers after the war, like his son. After his death, I would have liked to see more of the publics opinion, and words of his family not just images of how they acted. But all together it was a very good movie. It accurately showed how he tried very hard to end slavery and the war. It showed the trial, to hear everyone views and how they are reacted to. All together, Lincoln gained the slaves freedom, and this movie showed it very well."
"jth4799","9","2","3","29 November 2015"," Accurately depicts the end of slavery
","This movie is set in early 1865 during an intense period in history. The Union and the Confederacy were trying to work out an end of the Civil War and the House of Representatives was debating the 13th amendment. The purpose of the 13th amendment was to free all slaves in the United States but it was also just a means to the end of the war. Lincoln did believe that all men should be free and that slavery was awful, which was depicted in this movie, but he also believed that passing this amendment would end the Civil War. In the movie, Abraham Lincoln and some Republican party members of the House convinced other Republicans and Democrats to vote to pass the amendment by offering them other positions in government. According to historians, this was accurate (historynewsnetwork.org). After all of their hard work, on December 6th, 1865 the 13th amendment was ratified and all slaves were free in the United States. Overall, this movie, ""Lincoln"", accurately portrayed the end of slavery."
"dan_knowlton-56908","10","2","3","29 November 2015"," The Emancipation of Slavery
","Although a good portion of this movie was about ending the civil war, my main focus is on how Lincoln decided to end the civil war. In my opinion I think that accurately portrays the end of slavery along with all the struggles Lincoln had to face while trying to free the slaves. It also shows how hard he had to try to get the democratic votes by giving the democrat representatives positions in government. He didn't have to deal with the republicans as much because he was elected by them and he had the head of the Republican Party to back him up. Lincoln had to deal with the hard choice of being able to end the war in a week and risk many democrat and republicans to decide not to pass the vote because for what they know the passing of the emancipation would end the war but, if it ends before the emancipation is passed they won't sign it. More than a couple of times did his cabinet disagree with Lincoln's decision on the war and the passing of the abolition of slavery. That is why I rate this movie a ten out of ten and how it showed the struggles of being Lincoln in that time."
"grays-16394","8","2","3","24 November 2015"," Lincoln Movie - History Review
","Its overall plot is entirely factual. Confederate peace commissioners trying to work out an end to the war, the House of Representatives debating the 13th Amendment, and both events involving some shady political maneuvering, making it an intense time in Washington. The movie is about Lincoln and the politicians on both sides of the aisle who were involved in the process of passing the 13th Amendment and ending the war -- not about the actions of other involved parties. Therefore the complaints of the movie not including Lincoln's childhood or past are invalid, the movie is not meant to include that. These stories are not this movie's to tell. My only con with this movie is that the free African Americans were involved in efforts to get the 13th Amendment passed, and the movie could have shown this a more. So, is Lincoln 100% accurate about every single detail? No. But it does accurately portray the current events on where the movie focus's and it offers an accurate overall view of the individuals involved."
"AmyJenson1995","8","2","3","17 October 2015"," Daniel Day Lewis, the reincarnation of the best President of our History
","I am not particularly a political movie fan but this one particularly touched my heart.<br/><br/>This is not a biography of Abe, let's be clear on that point immediately. This movie is focused on a particular part of his life, the most defined moment of his Presidency: the ratification of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in the United States of America.<br/><br/>So this is about the debate and the multiple manipulations and negotiations leading to this decisive and historical vote. But this is also a movie about Abraham Lincoln and his tireless will to abolish slavery and end the Civil War which is tearing the country apart for 4 years, claiming thousands of victims including his eldest son who died in the very first years of the conflict.<br/><br/>I have to say that you couldn't find any finest actor than Daniel Day Lewis to incarnate Old Honest Abe. His performance is literally mesmerizing. I had the impression to see the real Abraham Lincoln throughout the movie and this is actually the sign of the greatest actors in the business. He is very sober but still remains impressive. His performance deserves praise and recognition. We don't see much of Daniel Day Lewis but we are not judging the talent of an actor or an actress by the number of movies he/she appears but by how his/her performances in each of the movies they did appear is touching each one of us and make it unforgettable. On this second point Daniel had proved how a legendary talent he is.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is following his path by performing in the right tone and attitude. Tommy Lee Jones is really awesome as Rep Thaddeus Stevens who is despising slavery as much as Lincoln and who is married to a black woman. Tommy is also a great actor and he can play everything to perfection. Having him and Daniel together is certainly the best asset of this movie.<br/><br/>I think this movie is one of my favorites and I will have the pleasure to watch it again. If you haven't seen it yet you should."
"Kings_Requiem","8","2","3","23 March 2015"," Four score and...
","It's really great. Daniel Day-Lewis is the best. Someone could film him sleeping for 3 hours and it would still be fascinating. He will definitely get another nomination and hopefully another win. <br/><br/>The entire cast ranges from pretty good to excellent. Lewis, Field, & Jones should all get nominations. James Spader kinda steals the show at different points throughout but isn't likely to garner any attention. It's Spielberg's best film in quite a while IMO. Depending on who you are it could only be the best since last year's Tintin (or War Horse), but for me I'd say its the best since Munich or if you wanna go back even further, Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>There is a scene at the end that I kinda feel they could've done without. It just felt slightly unnecessary to me. If the credits would've rolled after the scene directly before it then this could very well have been a 10 for me. All in all though it is still very very good and worth a watch for Spielberg and movie fans alike. And depending on how the rest of the potential Oscar contenders play out then this could be the film that receives the most nominations. <br/><br/>Just because of the sheer insanity of it I'm going to list all of the names of the cast... Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jared Harris, Lee Pace, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley, Bruce McGill, Walton Goggins, Lukas Haas, Dane DeHaan, and another few familiar faces that you've probably seen in other movies or TV shows but don't know their names. That cast alone should be enough of a reason to see the movie never mind the fact that the movie itself is fantastic as well, but its certainly made all the more possible because of Spielberg (and his crew) and this mammoth cast that was put together. Just unbelievable!"

In my opinion, Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens transform into their roles and truly become these men. Lincoln does a great job of showing the ""behind the scenes"" of politics, as Lincoln hires men to go around and persuade senate member against the thirteenth to vote for it, this adds a bit of fun into this politically stuffed movie. That being said this is a political movie, it can be confusing at times and a little dry, but you have to remember this isn't an action movie, you have to go in with the correct mindset. I would recommend this movie for mature audiences as the politics in this movie would lose the interest of a young gun looking for some action."

I see no reason why this movie needed to explore his childhood as down-voted by other reviewers.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Daniel Day-Lewis's approach to Lincoln and I thought Sally Field had some wonderful scenes which boasted theatrical excellence - (01:05:00) is one of those moments.<br/><br/>I really hope you watch this movie!"

","Steven Spielberg directs Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, a revealing drama that focuses on the 16th President's tumultuous final months in office. In a nation divided by war and the strong winds of change, Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery. With the moral courage and fierce determination to succeed, his choices during this critical moment will change the fate of generations to come. <br/><br/>The screenplay by Tony Kushner was based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, and covers the final four months of Lincoln's life, focusing on the President's efforts in January 1865 to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives."
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","7","2","3","8 September 2014"," Exactly what I expected
","This is yet another film that I'd been putting off for ages, which I finally got round to watching. But whereas many films surprise you, Lincoln did not - it was exactly what I expected, a slow film about politics.<br/><br/>The film was pretty good overall and gets 7 stars, with only 3 against, so let's take the short route and talk about the 3 negative stars.<br/><br/>It was overly complex and not very exciting, but I accept my low interest in politics as a factor in that, but it still had an element of Spielberg spoon feeding which I couldn't tolerate. The educated black corporal, enunciating his point perfectly, questioning Lincoln's policies, followed by the two rather dense white boys, fumbling their words, just to emphasise that Negroes were indeed quite intelligent chappies and shouldn't have been slaves at all. We knew that already.<br/><br/>There were no battles or real fighting in it. I remember when I was a young lad, excitedly watching a movie with bare breasts at the start, only to discover two hours later that these were the only bosoms throughout the entire film. A trick to haul audiences in by showing grimy fight scenes at the start, but nothing else thereafter. Lots of military costumes, stills, bands playing - no action.<br/><br/>And most importantly, the film wasn't really about 'Lincoln' at all, was it? It should have been called the 'Thirteenth Amendment', a film about the abolishment of slavery. If it had been about Lincoln then I would have expected scenes about his childhood, growing up, how he got into politics, who he defeated to become president, kids, marriage, etc. but that's not what the film was about.<br/><br/>A film about the abolishment of slavery and the signing of the 13th amendment, which was presided over by Lincoln, the president at the time. Lincoln was a good film, but it fell short for me. It was overly complex in some places and very restrictive in its approach in others.<br/><br/>I mostly enjoyed it though and at least I can say I have seen it."

He plays the character like he was a real person, and excels at the role.<br/><br/>Another thing is the many little details. The set design is great, the music is amazing, the cinematography is top notch, and the script is perfect.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie has a very timeless yet important message.

","The Academy got it wrong. This is the best film of 2012. This is Steven Spielberg's triumph. At about 2 1/2 hours, it's a bit long, so it is best enjoyed on ""disc"" with perhaps an intermission or 2-night viewing, as it does bog down a bit at the two hour mark, but I wouldn't cut a thing. Daniel Day-Lewis IS Lincoln. His performance is beyond amazing. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones give surprisingly superlative performances. Their best ever. As do the rest of the fantastic supporting cast. It's not for children. The war and hospital sequences show the brutality and stupidity of war. The amputation ""dumping"" of arms and legs is nightmarish. You must see this film. It is better and far less melodramatic than ""Gone With the Wind."" It only covers the last four months of Lincoln's administration and the passing of the 13th amendment, abolishing slavery. Both Lincoln and Mary Todd-Lincoln portray amazing stress and seem to age ""years"". Great ""sets"", make up and costuming. The dialog seems absolutely real and believable . You must buy this video, but wait until the price settles down. It is a haunting and terrible slice of history. Beautiful location cinematography. The Ford Theater assassination is only covered briefly, and only because it is expected to be mentioned in the film. Amazing in all aspects. I actually give it an ""eleven""."
"classifiednatural","9","2","3","25 July 2013"," Goodness Yes!
","Golly Gee Willacker's ""Hat"" man! I think that Daniel Day Lewis outdid himself on this one. I am impressed by all parties responsible for making this one and the conception of it really drove to be an award winner. The acting was worth watching this movie for alone. The incredible portrayal of the finest President to walk the face of the earth. In watching this I felt drawn to fact, reminded of Lincoln's intellect and profoundly entertained by what I was seeing was someone else's view of ""Lincoln"". Boy oh boy do I feel guilty for not knowing who Daniel Day Lewis was before this. ""Last of the Mohican's"", ""Gang's of New York- 'Bob the Cutter'"", and now this! Wow, my advice to anybody is try to portray him as one of the greatest, I mean ""take it slow"". That is what he is doing and it is paying off. ""Last of the Mohican's"" by the way is one of my favorite soundtracks. I now want to read the book from David McCullough- when and if he does it. What a daring triumph. It's not like nobody cares, everyone is going to be particular about this one. Did he/they pull it off, yes!"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","2","3","26 June 2013"," Despite being far too dry, Daniel Day-Lewis makes this film with enough warmth, authority and iconography to justify the man himself.
","I remember back when Lincoln was just a rumour. A rumour with Liam Neeson attached to star. It appeared like a dream team reunion too good to be true. Perhaps enough to redeem Spielberg's uninteresting last 10 years. Although I admire Daniel Day-Lewis, I must admit I was disappointed when Neeson dropped out, but now I can't picture anyone else. I love Day-Lewis' performances in My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood, but his Abraham Lincoln was on an unprecedented plain of acting I wasn't sure he was capable of and at least belongs among those two. He brings such warmth, authority and iconography to the role that it's upsetting when he's not on screen. Although the writing is almost like a play with far too much dialogue- driven scenes that it may as well be a filmed play, it develops his character very well with little human moments and profound philosophical ideas that are interesting just for the fact they come from such an important figure in American history.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the deliberately saturated aesthetics don't justify itself being a film, and pace aside (which is already pleasantly slow), it could've easily be exactly the same product on the stage. It has moments, but it's not nearly as cinematic as it could be. Granted, that makes it feel more mature for Spielberg, especially after having War Horse last year, but it also feels like a dry history lesson. I can already imagine the generations of American kids having to watch it that I feel like it already has the reputation it can only have in 10 years time. There are many opportunities to show and not tell that Spielberg doesn't take, the main one and most interesting one being not showing Lincoln's assassination. While that shrinks the scale of the film dramatically, it also shrinks the intimacy. So Lincoln is sitting somewhere in the middle, but it's certainly on the good side, elevated by its excellent performances. Although Sally Field is over-dramatic in her few scenes, Tommy Lee Jones subtle performance is thoroughly compelling and a highlight of the supporting cast along with David Strathairn and Lee Pace.<br/><br/>Part passion project and Oscar bait, it's difficult to detach it from its awards hype. This is the last of the Oscar films I had left to see, and before Argo's reign, I went in expecting it to be a viewing of a Best Picture in the making. Personally, I'd consider them on a par, with Silver Linings Playbook and Les Miserables my favourites to win but only the former has a sliver of a chance. Lincoln feels like it was designed to be a Best Picture, sitting on the same shelf as Gandhi and The King's Speech, and in a way, it deserves to be, I just wish those films could actually be masterpieces, rather than crowd-drawers. If it wasn't for The Master, Day-Lewis would be an easy win but I look forward to seeing him onstage, most likely with Jones. I learned quite a lot from Lincoln, as I've never had a true history lesson on the man or events being not from the U.S.A. but a viewer is a visual learner more than anything and the actions of Lincoln speak louder than its words, despite the imbalance of ratio. At least it somewhat lives up to the promise of the premise and talent.<br/><br/>7/10"

Turns into mouth to mouth battles of long angry speeches.<br/><br/>Daniel-Day Lewis looks the part but may not sound the part as he gives an outstanding award worthy performance. Sally Field plays crazy like Sally Field. Tommy Lee Jones gives good speeches.<br/><br/>If you like dialogue driven movies you'll like Lincoln. The most effective scene toward the end had no dialogue as Lincoln rode through a battle field. Proof movies are visual and meant to be seen and not heard.<br/><br/>It may not be historically accurate but it's not a documentary. Don't go to the theater tired as it is too long and often slow.

"angiequidim","8","10","28","12 November 2012"," Lincoln is thoughtful, poignant
","Review by Ray Silveyra www.thatsmye.com <br/><br/>Lincoln is thoughtful,poignant, and with our nation at one of its most important elections,this is a movie that is relevant and important. Though it may not reach the heights to be spoken in association with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, with Lincoln, Steven Spielberg adds yet another classic to an unprecedented cannon.<br/><br/>Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the film follows the President toward the end of the civil war, as he tries to gain passage of the 13th amendment, abolishing slavery. The Civil War is ultimately a backdrop to the struggles Lincoln faces with a divided Congress, an impatient cabinet, and a family that is often treated second to a nation.<br/><br/>The film features a stellar cast that includes Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee-Jones, Joseph Gordin Levitt, and David Strathairn. The entire cast is utterly superb in their roles, but Tommy Lee-Jones (as Thaddeus Stevens) absolutely commands the screen, delivering his lines with a whipping intensity and a demeanor that is quiet, controlled and critically believable Look, we all know the outcome, we know that the amendment passes, but Spielberg manages to enthrall his audience not from the passage of the amendment but rather, the reasoning behind the amendment. Spielberg so perfectly captures the political arena, that the audience will, without a doubt, be more emotionally invested in its story than any other thing on screen, Lincoln included. Unfortunately, when the movie isn't dealing with the political plot, it tends to drag, only to be picked up again by the political battle that controls the movie. Consequently, when the political plot is resolved, it is difficult to keep further interest in a remaining story that feels secondary and undeveloped. Sadly, yet appropriately, Lincoln dies with the resolution of the political plot. The film's greatest strength, and perhaps its biggest downfall, is that the Amendment, as it was in real life, is bigger than Lincoln himself.<br/><br/>At a time when our nation is deciding its next president and debating the validity of equal marriage, affirmative action, workplace equality, and undocumented immigration, it is appropriate that Lincoln, with the grandeur of Grade-A performances and the epic quality one would expect from a Spielberg film, is outshone by a political battle that is important to know and relevant to apply in our present. In one of his most fragile moments, Daniel Day-Lewis's Abraham Lincoln, asks, ""Do we choose to be born? Or do we fit into the time we're born into?"" The film may seem self-righteous to some, yet to most it will be evident that Lincoln is an intense, near-perfect film, that, now, more than ever, necessarily fits into the time is it born into."

","I saw this movie 3 times! I NEVER do that. But it was so very brilliant I had to see it again, and then one more time. And of course, each time I caught something I had missed. The first time, one is doing their best to keep up with the story line. But in a story of substance which is rendered so artfully and sensitively, subsequent viewing allows one to pick up the nuances and contemplate its message. And I learned a lot. That Lincoln was a very skillful and savvy politician. No doubt a skill honed during his years as a practicing attorney. I also didn't realise that close to the end of the war, Lincoln was presented with a very tempting offer by the South to end the war but which would allow the so called Confederate states to carry on as usual. But he chose to push through to make his Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 a reality. A political gamble he won, but just. By a hair and at a time when his entire cabinet was pressuring him to do otherwise, to take the easy way out. Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln was beyond brilliant. Also loved the story telling scenes. And his Secretary of State who would get so tried with him, failing to realise it was Lincoln's stress release. Day Lewis also took great pains to imitate what history books described as Lincoln's vocal pitch and manner of speaking. And the scenes with Mary Lincoln were superb. Sally Field made an exceptional performance--the interchange between her and her husband over the death of their young son was one of the movies' very memorable scenes."

","Spielberg's Lincoln was a moving portrayal of the president's force of will and belief. The film focuses on and subtly examines his character in the month before the passage of the 13th Amendment.<br/><br/>Unarguably, Day-Lewis' performance is stunning in retrospect; during the film I saw a person, no actor. In my opinion, the integral and most defining aspect of this film is the script. To some, the pace may feel drawn out. However, every second is meticulously crafted and integral to the story and for the purpose of weaving together the picture of Abraham Lincoln and the atmosphere he lived in.<br/><br/>Lincoln is a call to remember and to value the humans who defined history and impacted our very lives today.<br/><br/>I give it 9.3 stars.

"gtamddd","7","1","1","22 December 2018"," Daniel Day-Lewis elevates an otherwise just decent period movie
","Let's start by stating the obvious: Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing, a luminary, a beautiful, perfect, flawless, shining beacon of actorship, one of the, if not the, single greatest actors of our time and just an all around daddy. No real recordings of Abraham Lincoln exist, obviously, duh, but if Lincoln somehow came back to life, I would probably have to tell him to his face that I expected much more of him and that he simply can't stack up to what Daniel Daddy-Lewis made him out to be. His portrayal of the historical figure of Abraham Lincoln will forever be what I'll be thinking of when I read any of his speeches or watch any random YouTube video about the American Civil War made by some fat guy from the mid-west.<br/><br/>Something else to be admired were the extensive, beautiful period-accurate backdrops that is almost expected from Spielberg movies at this point. I only really noticed a blue-screen background being used once, when Lincoln was surveying the aftermath of the Siege of Petersburg. All the other hallmarks of Spielberg directing were present as well. Solid cinematography and casting decisions, combined with the director's experience surely made it easier for the stars of the movie to shine in the way they did."
"ivko","10","1","1","16 December 2018"," A great movie for a great man
","I've watched this movie a half dozen times. It's become one of my favorite movies, which is a bit ironic because I so carefully avoided watching it when it came out. Everyone kept talking about Daniel Day-Lewis's performance, but I knew it was one of those quieter, historical pieces and I wasn't in the mood. Finally, it aired on HBO some weekend and I thought I might as well see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>I remember just being completely blown away. Before I'd even reached the half-way point I was on the web ordering a Blu-Ray copy of the film. The movie is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. To me, that comes down to one thing: Daniel Day-Lewis. Don't get me wrong, the supporting cast is extremely solid, and the cinematography is gorgeous; even the costumes and set pieces are beautifully done.<br/><br/>But what brings me back again and again is Lewis's performance of the great man. In every scene, he just seems to suck the oxygen out of the room; I almost feel as though I've been holding my breath while I watch his scenes unfold. Of course, I have no way of knowing what Lincoln was actually like, but it just feels like Lewis captured the essence of everything I imagine Lincoln was like. That aura of intelligence and sadness, of a love for the common man combined with the knowledge that he will never truly be one of them. And just below the surface, disguised by the easy charm of a master storyteller, a will of pure iron that will lead the nation, even to places they might prefer not to go.<br/><br/>Even in rooms full of people, Lewis paints a portrait of a man who stands alone. Always quiet and thoughtful, to the point that you just begin to suspect he might not be paying attention, and then he speaks and reveals a profound depth of intelligence. Not the arrogant intelligence of someone who dismisses those of lesser capacity, but a grounded, earthy intellect that embraces the views of everyone around him. In short, Lewis creates a vision of Lincoln that I would like to believe is true, given his importance to our nation and its history.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, I can't recommend this movie enough. I may be wrong, but I think 'Lincoln' will go down as a great movie with several wonderful performances and one magnificent performance by one of acting's greats at the height of his ability."

","This was not the movie I thought I was going to see. This film is about the passage of the 13th amendment to free the slaves. It looks at the various backroom dealings with lame duck Democrats in order to obtain its passage. As a docu-drama it would make for an excellent showing in the classroom if not for the F-bomb Steven Spielberg insists on putting his his films (aka ""Super 8"") in order to ruin it for kids.<br/><br/>Sally Field played an excellent Mary Todd Lincoln capturing her period of perceived insanity. Tommy Lee Jones plays a very important role as Thaddeus Stevens, who was instrumental in the passage of the amendment. Daniel Day-Lewis creates a complex Lincoln, one that goes against the grain of former Lincoln performances. This film does not include the Gettysburg address delivered by Lincoln, but presents it by having others recite it. There are no Lincoln-Douglas debates, no rail splitting, nor does it show how his mother was killed during a zombie infestation as does other films.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film seemed liked an ""Oliver Stone"" revision of history where African-American soldiers speak up to Lincoln about inequality. This appears to be one of those scenes designed to compact history for the screen.<br/><br/>Parental Guidance: No sex or nudity. 1 F-bomb about midway through the film."
"MovieManChuck","Null","1","1","11 July 2018"," An excellent, extremely well acted 13th Ammendment drama
","4/4<br/><br/>Some argue that Spielberg is no longer at the zenith of his career, and that might even be true. He isn't churning out summer blockbusters like Jaws or Indiana Jones anymore, but he still makes remarkable dramas. Lincoln is a perfect example of this. It's truly one of the better historical films I've seen.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is the best possible cast for Lincoln. He is able to portray every edge of his role. He can (much like the real life Lincoln) fluidly transition between the serious president who will Stop at nothing to end the war and pass the 13th Ammendment, and the laid-back, down-to-Earth storyteller he was known to be off the job. It's very rare for a man to possess kindness, reason, a good reputation and the ability to persuade simultaneously the way Lincoln did. It's even rarer to see a man with such virtue as Lincoln have been done justice on screen. Lewis hones the role and does just that.<br/><br/>The long running-time may (understandably, given the subject matter) repel some viewers with less patience and love for films in general. Cinephiles and history-buffs alike will find that the 150 minutes speed by all to quickly, not giving the proper historical resolution to Lincoln's assassination and other aspects of his life. As far as excitement, this movie falls between full-on war films such as Glory (1989), and Ken Burn's The Civil War. It's deliberate but holds your interest. <br/><br/>Overall, I think that the movie has mass-appeal and Spielberg did a fair job marketing it. It's not a perfect movie, but it's truly great. I think we can agree that Lewis was phenomenal in the role of Lincoln, and that this is Spielberg's best effort in 15 years."
"abower-75835","9","1","1","19 December 2017"," An Inspiring Look at Both the Congressional System as Well as The Lincoln Legend
","The opening shot is a brutal and devastating look at the Civil War. In the rain, men slaughter each other as blood mixes with the mud. In a remarkably bold scene, Spielberg sets the stage for the state of the nation at the advent of the 13th Amendment, without ever having to return to the bloodshed of the War. (Something I am certain he is capable of, see the first 27 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"") The rest of the film is remarkably tame if compared to that first scene, so the drive must be found elsewhere. Similar to the Oscar-bait films of the past few years, ""Lincoln"" is driven by passive drama through the struggle to pass the 13th Amendment (a common, yet effective film trope) and awe inspiring character work. The ceaselessly perfect Daniel Day-Lewis disappears into the role of Lincoln, with myself during first viewing taking numerous double-takes to see that that was indeed an actor and not a stunningly crafted CGI Lincoln, a la Peter Cushing in last year's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"". Lewis turns in one of his best performances this time around, perfecting the mannerisms and indescribable subtle awkwardness of the legendary president. Yet even Lewis is eclipsed by the scene-stealing role of Thaddeus Stevens played to perfection by an ever belligerent Tommy Lee Jones. Being of a younger audience, this was a dramatic turn from the straight-man comedic of the MIB series, and Jones blended into the role of Stevens. His crass attitude and defiant stature allows Jones to create a gruff, outspoken congressional legend. Filling out the supporting cast are memorable takes on legends like Secretary Seward (David Strathairn), journalist W.N. Bilbo (James Spader) and of course Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field). Hal Holbrook as Preston Blair, founder of the Republican Party, was a particularly excellent casting choice. Holbrook had a storied career playing Lincoln and playing the founder of the party Lincoln made famous was a suitable way to round out his career and dance with Lincoln. My one doubt on the casting end was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln. While Gordon-Levitt is one of my favorite actors and makes every project he stars in sparkle, he seemed to stand out as Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a film which held great strength in its historical accuracy; with the actors becoming their roles and not standing out as the Hollywood legends they are. That one blemish on such an historically accurate film was made negligent by the astonishing costumes and historical set pieces. The focus on the time period did numbers on the plot which revolved around one off the greatest congressional battles in history. ""Lincoln"" is one of the most accurate political dramas I've witnessed save ""The West Wing"". The backroom deals were brilliantly filmed and staged as to always seem exciting. Shots of back alleyways and smokey Senate offices perfectly encapsulated the atmosphere of 1860's Washington. The push and shove of swing votes never seemed trivial and stakes, while rarely seen, were well established and brought high drama in what easily could've been a bland retelling of the story. An especially pleasing subplot that placed extra stakes (and humor!) to the film was the delegation from Richmond. Their constant delay and interactions with General Grant found me chuckling at times and their very existence brought serious twists into the congressional workings in the A-plot. One key player, and personal idol of mine, Salmon P. Chase was completely left out of the story sadly. As a Radical Republican like Stevens and a Cabinet member like Seward, it seems ridiculous he was not included within the story. By and by this is a phenomenal historical film which stunningly exceeds the expectations of a seemingly unstoppable trio. Steven Spielberg, 3-time Oscar Winner Daniel Day-Lewis, and our most legendary president, Abraham Lincoln."
"rachelliu","8","1","1","14 December 2017"," Wonderful, informative film with good production and acting
","Firstly, I'd like to say that the film is not centered around Lincoln's life, as I expected, but more on him and his administration's role in the passing of the 13th amendment. Which doesn't necessarily make it bad! It just caught me off guard.
 I really did enjoy this film, even though it is not really along the lines of movies that I usually watch. Apart from great content to work from, I thought this movie did a very good job connecting the audience to the characters. It's also very difficult to build the suspense needed in a drama film when the audience already knows what happened in history, and I think the team behind this film did do that very well. I also really enjoyed how they presented the duality of the amendment at every level - for instance, how the Lincolns were divided on the passage of the bill, but presented a united front. This was mimicked in the cabinet and in the house. It shows a more nuanced view of an issue that is usually portrayed as one-sided, whole-heartedly and unitedly supported by the North. Although I sincerely hope that our government actually functions more cohesively than they are portrayed here, this film does create a good sense of the disunity among Republicans and ardent opposition by the Democrats in Congress.
 One critique that I would really like to focus on (and this is a more personal preference than anything) is that this movie focuses Lincoln the ideal more than Lincoln the man. With few exceptions, this film depicted Lincoln as poised, rational, and morally just at all times. There was no mention of his infamous letter to Horace Greeley in which he claimed, ""If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves, I would do it."" It also sort of shows Abraham Lincoln as some sort of mighty rock that stood his ground alone against the masses that called for peace at the price of abolition. While this is true to a degree, this movie doesn't really give credit to the century of foundation that abolitionists had already laid for Lincoln to stand and succeed on. Even the few scenes in which Lincoln loses control of his emotions, it is excused as reasonable and unavoidable. This is a pretty typical thing - we tend to portray Lincoln as an epitome of virtue. At the same time, I understand that in a film, character and effect is often more important than strict historical accuracy."

"eshwarmail","8","1","1","9 December 2016"," A near perfect adaptation of one of the most celebrated Presidents of the United States set in the backdrop of one of the deadliest civil wars.
","Steven Spielberg is a director who almost always never stays in the present and more so in recent times. Its either a historical drama/adventure, futuristic sci/fi fantasy or a mix and match of both. Even though he has ventured and succeeded immensely in a wide array of genres, he will always be best known for bringing some of the most imaginative creatures to life on the big screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is probably one of the greatest actors in the history of modern cinema whose powerhouse performances brought many interesting characters to life and etched them as a vivid memory for movie lovers across the world. A collaboration of these two in presenting one of the most important, remarkable and bloodiest times of American history is one that isn't to be missed.<br/><br/>The American civil war is consuming people by thousands with no end in sight. Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis), the 16th President of the United States has just won a re-election and is positioning himself along with the Republican Party to pass the 13th Amendment which outlaws slavery which is again the primary basis for the raging war. Understanding that there will never be an opportunity to abolish slavery than the current moment - Lincoln, whips from Congress, lobbyists etc. race against time to get the votes while legally bordering on the means.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln is visually known for his unique features - the beard, the hat, the mole, his height. When you see Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln, in a few minutes you start believing that it is Abraham Lincoln playing himself as the Daniel Day-Lewis we have seen outside the movies is no longer visible. The minimalist performance throughout and saving the histrionics for only when required works perfectly. However the same cannot be said about others, I trust the director Spielberg for this difference as he would have done enough research on their personality traits. Sally Field as Mary Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens are both vocally loud and melodramatic yet impactful. While James Spader plays an interesting and entertaining role as Bilbo and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wasted as Robert Lincoln. Most scenes involve a large cast in the canvas, the experience of Steven Spielberg clearly shows in the details of how the extras and the background characters react to situations.<br/><br/>The screenplay may not be innovative as it follows a linear approach but the complexity of letting the audience in on the bits of information which most already know is perfect to keep up the anticipation, interest and pace. Another aspect that standout is the beautiful production design - again minimalistic. While the backdrop is set on the raging civil war, there is no actual war sequence shown except for the aftermath in battlefields. The period settings look very realistic that includes makeup, costumes, buildings and city view - but not something we are seeing for the first time especially from Mr. Spielberg. Even the color tone of the movie looks authentic but one may not feel drawn to the movie just by the appearance. The background score stays in the background and is impactful when required. Kennedy and Lincoln, though celebrated for their time in the highest office - are even more known for their assassinations and conspiracies surrounding them. While this movie doesn't indulge much into the assassination of the protagonist, how they showed it is innovative.<br/><br/>A near perfect adaptation of one of the most celebrated Presidents of the United States set in the backdrop of one of the deadliest civil wars."

The film has a very moving message to send to the world and that is this Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other that's mathematical law that still something we all must abide by and attend to and although threats of hatred are still as dominant as they were when Lincoln was president shows a great divide almost a split between people's beliefs and opinions which must be shared the people's voices must be heard! Steven I want to thank you for making this film because it teaches me and also the world about an important part of American history but also a part of world history and the film has many rousing speeches regarding the American Constitution and the negativity of someone's actions whether they felt it was the right thing to do how do people react to people's judgements of certain agreements or disagreements and how the power of the right to a free democracy allows us all to make our own judgements ourselves regardless of other people's judgements what matters is your own! Tony Kushner writes an outstanding and witty script worthy of a stage play and the beautiful articulate words are complemented by a score of majesty grace and outstanding respect for the film it accompanies by the Master John Williams, outstanding horn solos complement the character of Lincoln in such a way that it never feels overwhelming to the film or the scenes that the music accompanies which are a very small number of scenes which benefits the film enormously and lets the film breathe which is a huge relief to certain fans of John Williams! Steven, Daniel, the entire cast of Lincoln which I have not got the space to mention and last but by no means least John thank you so much for using your creative talents to make and accompany a film of such high importance and courage I am moved to tears every time I hear the end credits suite at the end of this outstanding important moving unforgettable masterpiece of a film!"
"filipemanuelneto","7","1","1","28 April 2016"," A new level for Daniel Day-Lewis
","This film tells the efforts of President Abraham Lincoln to approve in Congress a constitutional amendment to end slavery in the United States. Directed by Steven Spielberg, has a Tony Kushner's script, and Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role.<br/><br/>Its not a novelty that the abolition of slavery in the U.S. was made incredibly late compared to other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom or Portugal (the small European country was one of the first to promote large-scale slavery but was also one of the first countries in the world to abolish it completely). See this movie elucidates us the reason: the economic strength of slavery was huge and during the civil war there was a fierce opposition to the abolitionist campaigns, even in the North. Lincoln is portrayed as being immune to everything and everyone, struggling to make the amendment pass. But the racism was omnipresent in U.S. that time, and some scenes of this film forget that and put the President in direct contact with colored people, something that probably never happened in formal contexts. Despite some partiality in the way Lincoln was portrayed, and some historical inaccuracies, the script is very good and show us the real bureaucracy that, even today, was necessary to approves the amendment. The performance of the actors was also good, particularly Day-Lewis, who almost metamorphosed himself to play the iconic U.S. president and deserved the Oscar for Best Actor who won with that. Also the costumes, sets and makeup were at the highest level. John Williams signed the soundtrack, as usually happens in Spielberg's films, but it didn't shine as intensely as often shines.<br/><br/>An good film that addresses a turning point in American history, this film has good quality but is far from being one of the best of Spielberg. However, undoubtedly marks a new stage in Daniel Day- Lewis's career, which becomes the only actor in film history to receive the Oscar for Best Actor three times."
"conklinc-92182","8","1","1","30 November 2015"," The end of slavery
","I think the movie Lincoln accurately represents the end of slavery, as far as the events that took place during the Civil war. In the movie, Lincoln took many steps to end the horrors of slavery through his presidential seat, but the slaves involved also helped their own cause tremendously. President Lincoln throughout his terms fought the Civil war and the war against slavery, through politics and determination he pushed congress and the house of Representatives to vote for the passing of abolishment of slavery. It took much convincing of the Democratic party and many tricks from Lincolns closest circle to convince some of them to vote for the abolishment of slavery. Many were slow to pick the side of abolishment because they were unaware and afraid of what would come of slaves now being freed, but they soon saw the way of Lincoln, and knew that if they wanted the war to end then ending slavery would be the best way to do that. For if slavery was ended the south would collapse because it depends so much on slavery. The slaves fought submission resiliantly and they came to the votings and voiced their opinions, that's how the slaves helped their own cause of ending abolishment."
"schastie-78840","10","1","1","29 November 2015"," Lincoln freed the slaver withing the United States.
","This movie is sincerely impressive. It describer the most valuable and deep problem of the human being.Slavery. Many scientists still argue about who has freed slaves and made the USA the non-volunteer labor free country. I am to join the movie's creators opinion. I think, that exactly Abraham Lincoln did it. He made a lot to evaluate and solve this problem. ""I may go very slowly, but I never go back"",-he says. The achievement of his goal was feasible for him, because he was the most stubborn and careful person of the 18 century. Abraham Lincoln was absolutely sure, that all people are created equal. ""The God created us equal"". He signed the 13-th amendment, which abolished slavery within the United States. He struggled for this. In 1863 Lincoln created the ""10% plan"", which was supposed to end the Civil War by abolishing the slavery, however, many republicans reacted on it sharply. Southerners, they thought, deserved punishment. Lincoln could not sign this document, because it would have meant the end of the war without the slavery abolishing. It was really hard time for him. But on January,1, 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The democrats in the debate court were truly lead by Lincoln's ""enlightment"" ideas. With the minor advantage, voting, the Emancipation Proclamation took it's place in the world, freeing 3 million slaves in America. The movie ""Lincoln"" demonstrates, that the president of the United States, Lincoln, was not only the head of the government, but also a friend of the nation. He liked to tell different stories, inspiring everyone for the ""free"" world."

Given the legendary status of this historical figure though, and his importance to American national identity, they could have gone safe and made a hagiography, a film about a saintly man being saintly and having no flaws whatsoever.<br/><br/>Instead, they focused on one particular event, the passing of the law that outlawed slavery throughout the United States. In order to see it through, Lincoln is required to perpetrate an ongoing deception about the status of the war which is hanging over Congress' heads and inclining them to favour abolition of slavery. He lies over and over again, explicitly contradicting the traditional portrayal of ""Honest Abe"", the man who ""cannot tell a lie.""<br/><br/>The result is a 'political procedural', rather like the excellent TV series 'The West Wing', in which characters stay true to their principles because of - not despite - their wisdom and fine judgement in knowing when to compromise. This is exemplified in the film by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, the character played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones, who climbs down from his tub-thumping rhetoric of absolute racial equality that has spooked many of the more conservative Representatives from voting in a bill which clearly leads in that direction.<br/><br/>Due to Spielberg's talent for melodrama, this is a fascinating story filled with tension, in which the title character's flaws are not shied away from. Coming in the same month or so as Django Unchained, it showed a much better way of making a film about American slavery, without Tarantino's ridiculous excesses.<br/><br/>For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/lincoln-2012.html"
"jackasstrange","8","1","1","24 November 2013"," Great film, One of the best of 2012
","Lincoln is such a fantastic film. I don't know if i like it so much because it appeals a lot for me, since that i'm very interested in historical films with super- productions, but anyways, i love it. <br/><br/>It's always fortunate when you can at the same time appreciate, learn a bit and being entertained by a film, and Lincoln guaranteed provides all these elements to the viewer. The stories told by Lincoln, in a great but overrated performance, are really great and entertaining, and i can forgive the fact that they are pretentiously put in the film just to make Lincoln appears as a great and almost flawless 'hero'. <br/><br/>But even better than Lincoln's stories are The Courtroom discussions. This is where the film reaches it's apex, in my honest opinion. It's just fascinating to see Tommy Lee's character prosing and doing his oratory pro- Abolition of slavery. His words are funny and eloquent, just showing how bad-ass he is. <br/><br/>However, i think that Lincoln had an unnecessary final 20 minutes, telling his death and stuff. I mean, there is no point to show his death at all. The film should've ended ten minutes after of the great climax. Unnecessary as well was Joseph- Gordon Levitt character's Robbie, whose importance to this film is irrelevant to the main subject. The music was also disappointingly cheesy and generic. Overall, Lincoln don't appeals to a great audience as the super- hero blockbusters, but can be as entertaining as one of them, if you watch it with the right eyes. 8.2/10"
"Chris_Silver","6","1","1","21 July 2013"," Lincoln simple review
","Daniel Day-Lewis. Do these actors get any more phenomenal then he? If you were to think of an amazing character actor, who absorbs the script and the background of his character but also adds his own twist and personality to the character. I know i use this word in lots of my reviews but 'Emphatic' he was. What can't he do. Same as the great person he portrays. Abraham Lincoln, an iconic founding-father who would be extremely hard to play for any one to play. I think it was hard for even Day-Lewis to do. But he was spectacular. Sally Fields is the Leading actress but i don't feel that she leads very much. Marry Todd Lincoln supported Abe to the best of his abilities and i feel that Sally Fields did that same thing with Daniel. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a good surprise as Lincoln's son Robert but the best part other than Day-Lewis was the heartfelt performance by Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens. He was great. But back to the film. I always found it hard to take Steven Spielberg's Directing hard. But he did a fine job with this. Fine like a nice Italian woman who is walking down the street, like that Fiat-500 commercial. Not the fine like ""Oh that was satisfactory, that was fine."" I'm not calling Steven Spielberg a fine Italian woman, but his directing here was great. I can't imagine having all of those actors portraying congressmen in one room and the camera stands and cranes and all of the crew on one set and having to manage all that. I know he had assistant directors and such but i salute him for even taking the task. The cinematography nomination was well deserved as it was one of the best of the year. Although the film was phenomenal even the smallest acting role was played to perfection. It was neither the crew nor their microphones and cameras that submerge you in the story. It was the acting."
"cherold","7","1","1","16 June 2013"," absorbing but a little bloodless
","This drama of political intrigue has much to recommend it. The story of the passage of the 13th amendment in the house involves a surprising amount of chicanery and political fixing, and it is refreshing to see politics shown as both a devious profession while showing it as one that can do good. And Tommy Lee Jones gives a first rate performance as a Republican radical (back when that was a good thing).<br/><br/>Jones is also notable for creating a sense of a flesh and blood person, which cannot be said for Daniel Day Lewis' Lincoln. It's a good performance, giving you a shrewd but folksy man determined to strike a blow for history, but Spielberg films Lewis much in the way a biblical epic films Jesus. This, and Lewis' careful, overly perfect delivery, make Lincoln more icon than man, and at times he comes across as a Disney animatronic Lincoln.<br/><br/>The movie feels very much like it wants to be the movie about Lincoln school kids see, and so it works hard to be faithful to history. But it also takes pains to be firmly on the right side of history. The few black people in the movie are better spoken than the white people; every one of them speaks like a Yale graduate. I'm not saying there weren't many well-spoken, educated black people at the time, but I cannot help but suspect they weren't *all* like that. Lincoln is given a halo, but I can't help but believe - and perhaps this is simply my own cynicism - that his motives were more complex, his temper less even, his movements less assured, than what you see here. Jones, Lee Pace as a fiery Democrat, and the lead fixer seemed far more interesting as characters than Lincoln, because they seemed far more like real people.<br/><br/>But then, that's how Lincoln is always portrayed. Lincoln as human being is rare, although Hal Holbrooke, one of the many effective stars in this film, played a more flesh and blood version of the man many years ago.<br/><br/>While this could have been better as a movie, it makes for an excellent history lesson, both informative and consistently engaging. It is not a great film, but it's a great thing to show to high school kids."
"julian-mumford","6","1","1","10 April 2013"," Deserving and infuriating at the same time.
","Director Stephen Spielberg is now in the phase of his career where he chooses personal projects that he believes are important. Notable, worthy stories just waiting to be told to a wider audience.<br/><br/>Lincoln, perhaps the most celebrated of American Presidents, presiding over the end of the devastating American Civil war, together with the emancipation of those in slavery within the US, clearly falls into this category.<br/><br/>To cover Lincoln's early life and achievements might take several films, so Spielberg and writer Tony Kushner have decided, rightly or wrongly, to ignore Lincoln's early life. The screenplay focuses on the end of the war and more specifically, the in-depth political machinations necessary, to allow slavery to be abolished, before becoming a bargaining chip upon the surrender of the Confederate army.<br/><br/>As we join the story, despite earlier setbacks, the war is going ""well"" under Ulysses S. Grant. Wholesale, futile slaughter is continuing to occur but the war of attrition favours the ""Union"" and all indications are that the war is won.<br/><br/>Lincoln foresees his dream of passing the 13th amendment to allow slaves the right to be free, will never pass Congress, once the South rejoins the Union. Effectively an agonizing choice, if the war ends too quickly, the opportunity the pass the amendment disappears. Delaying the end of the war consigns countless thousands to an early grave or the possibility of mutilation on the battlefield.<br/><br/>To put the conflagration into context, historians estimate as many as 750,000 or more soldiers were killed during the war. More than the combined total of American casualties in all wars fought subsequently. Some 50,000 casualties at Gettysburg over three days alone.<br/><br/>The screenplay, based on the book ""Team of Rivals"" attempts to portray the necessary horse trading, cajoling, threats and favour induced vote ""buying"", required to secure support to allow the amendment to pass. The story in many ways remains relevant with the state of modern politics, with fixed position stalemates and general intransigence very much the order of the day.<br/><br/>Without the right actor anchoring the story, the whole enterprise could resemble a high school play gone badly wrong, with a tall actor, dodgy beard and Stovepipe hat incongruously perched on his head. Fortunately the director persuaded the only actor that could inhabit the character believably to take on the role.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis ""is"" Lincoln, at least we think he is. Despite photographs, there are no recordings of his voice and therefore Lewis creates a reedy, ""olde Worlde"" timbre to his voice, mannerisms and posture.<br/><br/>It is likely another best actor Oscar statue will be added to the Lewis mantelpiece, from an acting point of view, he is exemplary. Lewis is totally believable and receives sterling support from a large list of supporting actors, notably Sally Field as his rather fragile wife, Jospeh Gordon Lovitt as one of his sons, Tommy Lee Jones (Thaddeus Stevens), David Strathairn (William Seward) and James Spader (WN Bilbo).<br/><br/>The period detail is excellent, production values are what you expect of a Spielberg production, directorial flourishes are almost non existent and the John Williams score is subdued but effective. After the directors recent rose tinted and sentimental ""War Horse"", it is good to see a realistic and mature approach to the horrors depicted. Battle scenes are very limited but the tone is dark and ominous, bad things are clearly occurring and Lincoln knows he possesses the power to stop them, if he so chooses.<br/><br/>It is historical fact that Lincoln loved recounting stories to illustrate his point and Lewis delivers these beautifully, despite his cabinets evident exasperation. Lincoln himself received very little formal education and came from humble beginnings, acquiring knowledge through voracious reading.<br/><br/>So an important story, with fine acting, costumes, sets and production values, surely a crowd pleaser? Unfortunately, for the average International cinema goer without a deep interest in the minutiae of American politics and Machiavellian art of acquiring political votes, this is dull, dusty and rather boring watch. Worthy of course and certainly staple viewing for US high school students and without question, the best and likely the last film on the subject.<br/><br/>Oscar voters will of course bestow the film with many awards and box office suggests, as expected, that the film will perform much better at home than abroad.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A historical drama, deserving of five stars in many ways but only two from an audience experience, therefore settling on the above result, which is both deserving and infuriating at the same time.<br/><br/>Despite being worthy, this makes for a difficult and rather tedious watch, almost as if the director has forgotten why people go to the cinema in the first place. Which is a pity, bearing in mind the historic achievement depicted, which 150 years later, is difficult to believe anyone could conceivably vote against.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

","Making a film about Abraham Lincoln is no simple task for a variety of reasons. Lincoln, the man and the story, is such a complex layering of accounts and instances and points-of-view that to try to portray each and all of these in a film would be a fools errand. But if any filmmaker is capable of portraying several of these as well as possibly imaginable, it is Steven Spielberg, and if any actor is capable of bringing this role to life, it is Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>That being said, it is worth noting that this film is probably the most acting and dialogue driven Spielberg has ever made. This film is a very surprising take on Lincoln, because of how Lincoln has been thought of in the past and because of how he is portrayed to us in history classes. Lincoln is traditionally thought of as a man who was eloquent and grand, most likely because of his appearance and his height. However, as indicated by historical accounts, Lincoln is portrayed in this film as a humble midwestern man who was plainspoken and sincere. He is shown to be a jokester and a storyteller. Day-Lewis does an excellent job of humanizing Lincoln and taking our perception of him from Lincoln, the president and historical figure, to Abe the man.<br/><br/>Equally as impressive as Day-Lewis' performance was Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens. Jones' task was, in a way, made even more difficult by the fact that he had to play an old, world weary man while the same could be said of Lincoln himself. He had to, in many ways, parallel Lincoln and be his incarnation in the House of Representatives while still being his own character, and I cannot say that he could have done a better job.<br/><br/>We have been waiting a long time for Spielberg to do a serious historical film in the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. In a way, this is his grand return to that stage."
"shephardfp","2","5","12","11 March 2013"," A History Lesson on the 13th Amendment - NOT A 7.7!!
","There are films for entertainment and there are films to win awards. This fails on both accounts in my humble opinion. I give it a two because it probably cost them a lot of money to make and I feel bad for them. As an average person in the street open to watching different genre's of film this was extremely difficult to watch and let's be honest, stay awake.<br/><br/>Firstly, this is obviously not an action film however IMDb states it is a biography (half a tick), history (tick albeit on the 13th Amendment rather than Lincoln) and drama (no tick). Lincoln lacked drama. If you exclude the 10 minutes of voting on the 13th Amendment there was little drama to pull you into the film.<br/><br/>Lincoln (Lewis) Grandpa Simpson'd his way through scene after scene speaking down to the floor during most of his monologues. He won an Oscar for his performance likely due to his ability to appear arthritic, tired and a little senile for the entire movie. I would suggest this was not very difficult and simply involved staying up late to learn his long winded speeches. At one point during one such speech to his party members, one states in disgust that he can not bear another one of his speeches and storms out of the room forcing me to let out an involuntary chuckle in agreement. (Funnily enough as the speech eventually concludes he appears from the shadows as if he has listened for the whole time??) <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones also won best supporting actor for his role as Thaddeus Stevens when in fact this was no different from most of his film parts. You know what you're going to get with Jones. Stern look, short abrupt dialog, stern look, furrowed brow, now pondering look. I feel he won this award as he injected a very small amount of life into the film and provided the struggling viewer a beacon of light to stay awake as the film died a slow death over 2 and half hours.<br/><br/>A few other reviewers have stated Sally Field overacted in her role as Mrs. Mary Lincoln and I would have to agree with them. The overacting was so apparent it was laughable and there was no chemistry between Jones and Fields on screen.<br/><br/>In summary, if you like watching long winded speeches about random events, enjoy the political process of government, want to learn about the 13th Amendment and oppose drama or other forms of excitement as it frays your nerves then watch Lincoln."
"MKProcks66","10","5","12","15 January 2013"," A great movie to see Abraham Lincoln on screen.
","Lincoln is a motion picture directed by Steven Spielberg. Due to titled in the name of one of the greatest president of United States and direction tag of Steven Spielberg, it was one of the highly anticipated movies coming this year. This movie is not actually a biopic; it presents the part of the life of Former president of US Abraham Lincoln at the time of the civil war. It was a hard time as a president for Lincoln we all know this, but this film completely shows his mental strength to take tough decisions which was going to change the future of nation. History of Lincoln as we all know is not the main interest which was highlighted by the director but he was trying to convey the message of Lincoln to the audience. Why the president was so eager to abolish the slavery? What was in his mind when he has to choose between end the war or pass the 13th amendment?<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece of Steven Spielberg. By this movie he has proved once again that he can not only create history by making movies which make deep impression on its audiences mind but he can also rewrite history from the page to big screen by making every character and every scene so alive that audience can live that time. A great part in success of this movie is the hand of Tony Kushner in screenplay. Role of Lincoln is played by two times Academy winner Daniel-day Lewis who has done splendid work to make us realize that how great personality the president had. He played the role with complete justice to the character. John Williams has done some good work in music department.<br/><br/>MY RATING â€“ 10/10"
"KC-Hansen","10","5","12","20 December 2012"," Brilliant
","There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said, but alas, I was so blown-away I had to try...<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both ""Super 8"" and ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" and directed both ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and ""War Horse,"" two highly acclaimed pictures.<br/><br/>Spielberg calls the shots in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most memorable roles yet. He seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. <br/><br/>One requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film."
"cultfilmfan","10","5","12","18 December 2012"," Lincoln
","Lincoln, is a film that works on several different levels much to my delight. As a film about a famous historical figure, a drama and an involving character study as well. Because most people will have probably learned about Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation in history class and many other details about Lincoln, some of this story will seem familiar because of facts we have learned over the years from textbooks and grade school and high school classes. However the film offers a lot more about Lincoln, that I had ever contemplated, or basically knew before going into the film. The film basically does focus on Lincoln, as he is in his second term as president and the civil wars has been going on for a couple of years now. Henceforth the decision to abolish slavery and put an end to the civil war. Historically, I do not know all the little minor details and things that some historians, may, or may not have a problem with. Being a Canadian, I only know so much American history and I felt that I walked away from this film having learned more and appreciated more than I did going in. Whether this was because the film was carefully researched and displayed the facts and evidence carefully, or because it was a well put together and powerful film, or perhaps both that satisfied both my film critique of the film, but also gave me food for thought and helped fill in some of the background of American history that I had only ever had a basic concept of before. Having said that let me share with you some of the things that I did not know about and thought the film tenderly and affectionately brought to the screen. Abraham Lincoln, is seen here not as an overly complex, or difficult character to figure out, but I really liked that about the film. He is seen as a calm and soft spoken man who generally seems to care and have empathy and compassion for those around him. He seems to be slow to anger even though he does have occasional moments of anger and frustration trying to get this bill passed. We see that he loves his wife, but there is some distance between them, perhaps even lost love over an event that we learn in the film has grieved both of their hearts and unfortunately maybe had an affect on their marriage and feelings about one another as well. Then we have quiet scenes where we see Lincoln, playing with his young son and just the respect and love they have for each other. Those scenes I found particularly heartfelt and beautiful. The film does portray Lincoln, in an honored and respected view and going by the film I can completely see why they did that. Here is a man who is president of one of the largest and most powerful countries in the world. He has a lot of responsibility, a lot he has to get done and probably a lot of stress and pressure to deal with. However, he does not brush off his family, or have an arrogance to him, or even a sense of entitlement, or prestige that he thinks he is better than others. He seems to identify with the common man and woman of that time and we see that in the way he talks, behaves and perhaps how he is governing the country. I marveled at Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance of the president. It is not just a great performance because he looks and sounds like him. There is so much more to it than that. Just his posture and his soft voice and the fact that he can become so passionate about something and almost be in a rage and then the moments where he is laughing over an amusing story, or anecdote to where he quietly and lovingly plays with his youngest son. There is so much range, depth and emotion in this performance and Lewis makes us believe he is this man and he makes us have respect and love for him not just because he is a good man, but because he makes him believable and relatable. The supporting performances I all really enjoyed as well, particularly Tommy Lee Jones's performance also. The film looks authentic and though it is a slower paced film, I felt it captures the audience's attention because of the performances, the detail to authenticity and because of a story that is filled with engrossing and captivating characters and events and sometimes some great humorous scenes as well. I loved knowing more about Lincoln, both with his presidency and the legacy of his work, but also really appreciated getting to know him with the people that surround him, whether it be his family, co-workers, or people who have, or maybe even didn't vote for him as well. A powerful and affectionate portrayal that is not forced or sappy and emotional, but allows us to care because of these real people whose lives we can identify with before us and the passion and technique that went to bringing it to the screen. One of the best films of 2012."
"tavm","10","5","12","20 November 2012"," Daniel Day-Lewis made a fine Abe in Steven Spielberg's Lincoln
","Just watched this with Mom and my movie theatre-working friend. We all were pretty enchanted by Daniel Day-Lewis' characterization of the 16th president of the United States. Seeing his struggles in getting the 13th Amendment-that's meant to abolish slavery-passed provided most of the drama though there was also some pertinent conflict between Abe and wife Mary (Sally Field) about the death of one son and the about-to-enlist-status of another son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Then there's Tommy Lee Jones as anti-slavery congressman Thaddeus Stevens as he admirably takes charge of his scenes whenever he's on screen. Steven Spielberg really outdoes himself this time in depicting the administration's dilemma during a time of war and a divided country. So on that note, I highly recommend Lincoln."
"richard-1787","10","7","19","17 November 2012"," The finest movie I have seen since Schindler's List
","Not since I first saw Schindler's List have I been so overwhelmed and impressed with a movie. Yes, Day-Lewis gives a performance that will be one for the ages, like James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He gets great support from Straitharn and Jones, who make their characters come alive as well.<br/><br/>But, for me, the two things that really allowed this movie to become the masterpiece I saw this afternoon were, first and foremost, the miraculous script, and then the directing of it. The script does not, in any way, play down to someone's negative idea of the American public. It deals with complex issues, sometimes in Biblicly-inflected language, that is beautifully delivered by Day-Lewis, Straithairn, and Jones. This is movie script as real dramatic literature, where the beauty of the language counts but in no way impedes the power of the drama. I saw this along with a fair-sized crowd, and you could have heard the proverbial pin drop. No one was futzing with his cell-phone, or talking to his neighbor. Spielberg kept us in the palm of his hand throughout, and we did not dare look away, for fear of missing the complexity of what was going on.<br/><br/>By the end, I felt exhausted, and deeply moved by Lincoln's death, but at the same time very happy I had gone through the wringer with it. I don't know if this is what Aristotle meant by catharsis - I don't think so - but this is what theater at its best can and should do to and for us.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. If it does not carry off all the major Oscars (except for actresses), I will be very surprised."
"popandcrackcorn","4","4","9","24 April 2013"," Unpopular opinion about Lincoln: a story by popandcrackcorn
","Steven Spielberg's Lincoln was awful, and it needs to be said. So bring it on all you nerdy trolls and TAs for any history professor at any community college. I have very little fear of deleting comments, but please only rebloggers are allowed to continue ahead. <br/><br/>I'll begin with a question. You loved Tommy Lee Jones in Lincoln, right? He was fantastic and really controlled a heavy moment in the film, though only having a small amount of actual screen time. He was interesting and wise and really made us feel strong for our country. Jones' character showed the power of America's negotiation process at its finest, and we love that scene and how great he was. So then tell me, what his character's name? <br/><br/>You have no idea, and I'll tell you why. It's because Abraham Lincoln was the most dominant character of an entire era, and so prolific that he's considered one of the greatest men (who we have pictures of) in history. But the film didn't give us time to identify with that character at all, mainly because Spielberg skipped right into a certain section of his life. They took a legend whose history every American knows intimately, and made his character as closeted as K.C. Armstrong (baba booey, baba booey). So right off, the viewer loses the connection between the main focus and interest of the film. <br/><br/>Also the movie is like C-Span boring, which sucked as Lincoln had such potential. It was one of the most anticipated films of the year, directed by the greatest director of our lifetime and about one of the most important historical icons of our era, while being portrayed by one of the greatest actors of our lifetime. It should've be more immaculate that having AC/DC cover ZZ-Top songs while Emma Watson showers me with hundreds. But that will just have to stay written on the daily letters I write Hermione. <br/><br/>The majority of the movie is reminiscent of Shakespeare-esque scenes where diplomatic leaders are talking about something that might be important, but you have no idea what's going on anymore because you blanked out an hour ago. It's like watching Game of Thrones after they stopped showing nudity, but before the ghost zombies showed up. Lincoln is 65% cabinet meeting discussions, 10% violence, 5% Tommy Lee Jones and the rest I don't know because I passed out about fourteen times and every time the movie was still playing. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is what Lincoln's life was mostly like, but please Spielberg, throw in some violence or dinosaurs or have an enormous robot appear for no real reason. It worked for Wild Wild West, which was completely terrible, but now has spawned a cult of weirdness. Or try focusing on a larger part of Lincoln's life, like how he grew into being a powerful patriot wielding an ax to defend freedom and justice and was called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. <br/><br/>So you argue, ""But it's Steven Spielberg?"" And I answer, ""Duel, 1941 and Always were massive flops"". You retort, ""What do you personally think of those movies?"" I answer, ""I love all three of them"". But I'm in a minority on this one, and thus win this argument, as long we don't bring up the 25 agreed upon classics he directed, or Jaws which is the greatest movie that doesn't involve droids. <br/><br/>So you counter with, ""But it starred Daniel Day Lewis."" Yes, Daniel Day Lewis is a master actor. He carried both Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood, amongst many others. But in Lincoln, Lewis just stumbles unnoticed into committee meetings, and give quips and jokes like he's on massive amounts of opiates. He reminded me of Popeye's dad Pappy, but drunk and giving a three hour lecture in parables that I don't get. Also the great Sally Field has less screen time than it takes to get through the Zaxby's drive through, so there's that. <br/><br/>The truth is that I didn't totally dislike Lincoln, as it was a good attempt to capture a man with such an epic life. But it was also very pretentious and boring. You can call me un-patriotic, though I voted like five times in the last election and I hate paying my taxes and have seventeen ketchup packets from McDonalds in a drawer plus enough pepper to start a war. But in the end, Lincoln would've made a great History Channel movie of the week, but to be recognized as a classic is ridiculous. Just skip this one all together and re-watch Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure instead."
"skimari","5","4","9","2 March 2013"," Not equal to my expectations
","Do you have to see the full movie, in order to write a review? I only saw about one hour of this movie before I wanted to leave the theater. So I will not call this a ""review"", for which I am not qualified, anyway, just the expression of my personal disappointment . I expected to see a great movie about one of the greatest figures of the American History, and saw a movie about a petty politician, a joke cracker, a ""little"" man. I seems as if they deliberately made this movie as talky, awkward, tedious and uninspired as possible. If this was their intention, they were certainly successful. As for D.D.Lewis portrayal of Lincoln, I am afraid he left me totally unmoved. I believe he has by now established himself as a character actor. His mannerisms, his weird expressions, bizarre half-smiles and small voice, in combination with his ""restrained"" acting, makes me wonder if this is really ""Lincoln"", or an insignificant and unimportant relative that took his place by mistake. And yet I read that he prepared for this role for years and he got the Academy Award. What can one say except that this brings to mind Andersen's tale of ""the Emperor's new clothes""... Maybe when this movie is released as DVD, I will try to see it again, in case I discover something that I missed in the first viewing, although I believe that first impressions are always right."
"elioolei222","3","4","9","2 February 2013"," What genre is this movie ?
","Sometimes when movies are boring I continue to watch them but this one I couldn't see it anymore after 2 hours of waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>It is called a Biography, but whose biography. If the 13 Amendment was a person yeah but this one is not a biography. What about the drama I think I saw a new genre ""Political Drama"" to vote or not to vote. As for the History I don't know a lot about it but I didn't learn anything from it . It was a movie that took 1 month of real events and played them nothing else because nothing really happens. I feel the same after watching this movie nothing new to think or to wander nothing at all. I saw a good rating about this movie 7.9 in here but I can't see why maybe the shooting and the acting but there is no story to be told ,how can a movie like this get such a high rating.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to see something about this President but I didn't see anything besides the fight for the 13 Amendment that even Lincoln couldn't explain why he wanted it. Never was in this movie a good scene talking or screaming out loud about justice about what is right and what is wrong,nothing. Your emotion's never change during the movie. So I don't get what this movie was about so I went read the positive reviews and I still don't get it. How some people say that the great acting of Daniel Day-Lewis was thanks to Spielberg. I accept that everything was beautiful and every actor did their best thanks to $65,000,000, but I think Spielberg and his Writers failed their jobs and don't deserve the Oscar nominee . I saw his last movie before this one War Horse and that movie was great had emotion this one is just plain bald.<br/><br/>Could have shown us a little about his past and a little after he died but nothing just that month of the 13-th Amendment where we don't learn a thing about the life of Lincoln or Lincoln apart from his obsession to pass that amendment in the Congress . He doesn't have an emotional thing attached to that obsession he just want's it fulfilled and he doesn't know why. That that I saw is not a man fighting for what he believes but a man fighting for no reason. Every movie is good because someone is fighting for something (family,friend,freedom,revenge,from alcohol,for or from an idea,emotion ) this movie shows us someone fighting for something that he isn't sure of what he is going to accomplish."
"mikhail007","5","4","9","3 January 2013"," For such a dull movie, surprisingly historically inaccurate
","First of all, this is probably the dullest movie I've ever seen. This is not because there is no action scenes. One of my favourite movies is 12 which has zero action, black and white, and a steady camera. Lincoln is just dull because the dialogue was boring and awkward. Half of the movie is about congregational procedures which is like watching CSPAN from mid 19th century. It is amazing that even though this movie is so dry, it is largely historically inaccurate. This movie focuses solely on Lincoln during the time when 13th amendment was being pushed through congress. It doesn't go into his childhood at all. It narrows the view of history by portraying the cause of civil war is solely slavery. It paints Abraham Lincoln as lonely hero who is only goal in life is to correct injustice of slavery. In reality the cause of civil war is very complex. Abraham Lincoln himself did not believe in equality of races. This is evident by his public speeches. Spielberg made a movie about the legend of Lincoln instead of the historical person. I think that completely invalidates the film. Since this movie took some liberty in the use of historical facts, it could've went all the way and did something like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. At least that would've been exciting.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this movie is phenomenal acting performance by Daniel Day-Lewis."
"caelee122","8","4","9","29 December 2012"," Portrays Lincoln's presidency during the Civil War, and second term while the thirteenth amendment is trying to be passed with influence from the Republican Party.
","The movie ""Lincoln"" by Steven Spielberg was a great movie that was able to portray the truest form of history. This movie was able to contain and use these historical standings by the acting for each character, the historical accuracy characters, and the portrayal of relationships throughout the movie. With any minor flaws this movie had it was still a great realistic movie that should be seen by people of all ages.<br/><br/>One great point of the movie is the acting abilities of each actor who plays key characters in ""Lincoln"". Daniel Day-Lewis was a great actor who was able to portray Lincoln with the most accuracy. With only few lines or scenes that had traces of over acting, he was able to use his acting talents to put himself into the shoes of Lincoln given the best performance. Another great quality of Daniel Day-Lewis is that he is able to not only capture Lincoln's personality, but found himself looking like the true Abe Lincoln. Along with the great performance from Daniel Day-Lewis was another character of importance Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He was a man of the radical Republican Party who had outlandish views. However he found himself changing views to insure that the thirteenth amendment, when signed would give slaves freedom, would pass. During this movie you are able to see how resilient he is to what is happening around him and you are able to see just how important this was to him, whether it was historical or not.<br/><br/>Another important point in the movie is how Spielberg portrays Lincoln and his family through the various relationships. One important relationship is between Lincoln and his wife Mary Todd Lincoln, played by Sally Field. In most research they found that the two had a relationship that was slightly strained. Lincoln always inquired about her sanity and this was after their tragic loss of a son. This was shown best when the two talk to each other throughout the film. There is also another great family aspect to this movie through Lincoln and his sons as he helps and learns from the changes they bring to the mood of the movie. One slight example is through all the comedic relief that is given from the youngest son Tad Lincoln, Gulliver McGrath, whenever there seems to be too much discussion or information Lincolns son finds himself at the right place at the right time. Showing these moments of a real family most people would find themselves enjoying the movie. <br/><br/>Even though most flaws are considered to be distracting with any found in this movie there is not enough to distract from the movies endearment that captures the audience. One flaw found is that the wrong flag was used to represent the United States, the fifty stars would not be tell around the 1900's, yet this flaw did not distract from the film itself. This movie is one that not only history fanatics should see but even those who find themselves going to movies in general."
"aharmas","10","4","9","19 November 2012"," Daniel and Lincoln
","Watching this extraordinary film a second time, it confirms my belief that a great/good/excellent film will only improve with age and reward you enormously. Unlike other contemporaries, it's easier to enjoy and admire every single bit of the study of Lincoln's last weeks. The story deals with remarkable political maneuvers that took place in order to pass the Anti-Slavery Amendment. What makes the film different from the typical political biography is the way it incorporates the intimate moments of his family life, and how it is affected by the historical events that are destroying the nation.<br/><br/>Armed with an army of very talented performers, led by Daniel Day Lewis at his best, Spielberg restrains himself and lets the erudite screenplay take flight. Impeccable art direction and costume design help recreate the era. Michael Khan and John Williams are also on hand to give us a fluid film that is rich and alive, with every conversation being a joy to behold, and when it reaches its climax during the final vote scene, one wouldn't expect to feel such a thrill, but it is unavoidable when there is a director of such caliber. This film couldn't be any further from a big action blockbuster, but the audience's reaction is about the same: pure exhilaration.<br/><br/>Some of the joys here involve just about any scenes with Day-Lewis because he doesn't appear to be acting but channeling the man himself. He presents a full human being, with both emotional and physical loads, endowed with sensibility and guile and able to envision what the multiple consequences of his actions could be. There is one scene when he weighs the various alternatives and puts on his lawyer hat to evaluate his next move, and it's a marvelous option to understand such a special historical figure.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones, as the cranky politician is not far behind as he also knows the way things must be done in order to retain the respects of his followers and manipulate the ultimate compilation of votes. Sally Fields is effective as the emotional and scarred wife who has a big investment in the ultimate passage of the amendment because the current political situation had direct effects on her family. Equally good are the rest of the supporting casts, which includes names such as James Spader, John Hawkes, John Straitharn, and Hal Holbrook.<br/><br/>Overall, the film works as a drama and a historical retelling. We might never know its accuracy, but its soul is there, along with a direct message about how Lincoln saved this country and made indelible contributions to the history of the world."
"classicalsteve","10","4","9","19 November 2012"," A Stooping Soft-Spoken Politician Saves a Nation
","Former portrayals of Abraham Lincoln via Hollywood have characterized him as a thundering man of resolve with a deep resonant voice whose utterances ring of an Old-Testament prophet. Of course, how could such a man, regarded by many as the savior of the United States, be anything but? However, the primary sources do not align with these ideals. At 6'4"", Lincoln was a lanky and stooping creature with long thin legs which would give any basketball point guard a run for his money. He often walked with a bit of a sway, sliding his feet along the floor with a lurch. And he was devoid of a low resonant voice like that of Charleton Heston or Burt Lancaster.<br/><br/>The current film, directed by Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner, portrays the US's 16th president closer to the primary sources. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is no less than stunning. He speaks with a high, often raspy voice which is how the primary sources from the time describe it. He slithers along when he walks, almost as if he has never gotten used to his height. He had a funny way of telling stories, sometimes irritating those around him with his sermon-like pronouncements. He comes off like a protestant preacher, quoting Old Testament passages at will.<br/><br/>But Lincoln was a master politician. He had two problems. Uniting the country by eradicating the Confederacy, and emancipating the slaves. The story focuses on a crucial yet sometimes overlooked moment in Civil War history: the very end of the war beginning in January, 1865. In this moment Lincoln needed his emancipation proclamation passed by the House of Representatives. (It had already passed the Senate.) But hard-line southern democrats engaged political road blocks to stop passage. And he needed a swift surrender from the Southern Confederacy.<br/><br/>How would Lincoln achieve both goals? During the film, some of his advisers foretell that he can accomplish only one of the two. He could lift slave emancipation as a condition of southern surrender. If the Emancipation passes, he could face southern resistance for an even longer period thus taking the lives of more young men. The story focuses on Lincoln's efforts to pass Emancipation as well as ending the war. The fight in the House is a bloody war of words with stiff resistance from the hard-line democrats and uneasy middle-of-the-roader's fearing they'll be killed or chastised for voting to end slavery.<br/><br/>An honorable mention goes to Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, an unflappable opponent of slavery and secession. Stevens was elected to the House of Representatives in 1848 and had added his voice to those of other abolitionists. His rhetoric in the face of biting argument becomes the unifying force which eventually leads the House into the direction they need to end slavery and make the US whole again. I assume he'll be nominated for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Spielberg's best since ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Lincoln"" shows how history often unfolds in very unpredictable ways. The final vote to end slavery was not a slam-dunk event as often portrayed by history text books. The effort was calculated and took many weeks to accomplish. Many private meetings, and even some bribery, were the means required to accomplish the task. Lincoln also had to be careful to respect to some degree the rebels while simultaneously not recognizing them as a sovereign state. Since property rights were a condition of being a US citizen, the emancipation of slavery becomes a somewhat legal conundrum. Lincoln was a lawyer at heart, and needed a way to justify his means. This film gives a very clear sense of the obstacles which nearly hindered the United States from becoming a ""more perfect union""."
"virek213","10","4","9","19 November 2012"," Spielberg On Honest Abe
","Given the difficulties of America in the 21st century, it is oftentimes difficult to remember that America has faced much more challenging and much more tragic circumstances throughout its history. The biggest challenge America ever faced was not a war for freedom in some faraway part of the world, but a war for freedom on its own soil. The Civil War, in which Southern states split off from the rest of the Union over the issue of whether African-Americans should remain enslaved, tore America apart between 1861 and 1865; and only one man was able to settle the issue. That man was Abraham Lincoln, our nation's 16th president. The last three months of Lincoln's life, in which he managed to accomplish so much only to have it end in his assassination, is what is detailed in LINCOLN, director Steven Spielberg's impassioned and highly involved American epic.<br/><br/>Stepping into the shoes of ""Honest Abe"" is English actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who essays a Lincoln not as we thought we knew him, with a stentorian manner of speaking, but a high, reedy-voiced man reflecting his origins in Kentucky and Illinois whose word nevertheless carried considerable gravitas, even as he presided over the messiest conflict America would ever see. Not only does Day-Lewis preside over the immense task, after having won a second term in office, of trying to end that conflict, but also to resolve once and for all the issue of slavery by the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Making things worse for Day-Lewis, even members of his own cabinet, including Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), are torn on the issue of compromise with ending the Civil War and passing the amendment with the required two-thirds majority needed in the House of Representatives. The task for Lincoln thus falls in no small measure on two prominent Northern politicians, Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), to not only keep his Republican majority in line, but also to cause twenty Democrats to defect from the hard line of keeping slavery in place, come hell or high water. The debate in the House, particularly with Jones commanding so much attention, is as bitter and rancorous as any we've seen in our modern era; and the final vote is 119-56 (with eight abstentions, it is just enough to allow the 13th Amendment to pass). In the end, Day-Lewis visits many of the Civil War battle sites and reflects, in the days before his violent demise, the cost of war and the battle of ideals.<br/><br/>Spielberg had handled great American historical issues and eras before in such films as THE COLOR PURPLE, AMISTAD, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but LINCOLN was clearly a personal obsession for him; indeed, this project was twelve years in the making. And while he may not have been that much of a history buff either in grade school, high school, or while briefly a student at Long Beach State in the late 1960s, he nevertheless developed a taste for it throughout his career. The impact of the Holocaust as shown in SCHINDLER'S LIST is what almost certainly fired his imagination, to understand the why of that tragedy; and in LINCOLN, he does very much the same thing, in illustrating why Lincoln was so important to America, not only of his time, but of all time, leading up to the 2008 election of our nation's first African-American president. And here, he allows Day-Lewis to give a portrait of Lincoln that rates right up there with Henry Fonda's portrayal in John Ford's 1938 film YOUNG MR. LINCOLN, and Gregory Peck's in the epic 1982 TV miniseries THE BLUE AND THE GRAY. Sally Field is also superlative as his wife Mary Lincoln; and Holbrook and Jones, seasoned veterans both, are excellent as the men fighting the good fight.<br/><br/>The usual excellent score by John Williams (with some period music thrown in) and the cinematography by Spielberg's usual DP Janusz Kaminski, along with the performances, make this 149 minute-long epic extremely breathless; and Tony Kushner's fine screenplay, based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""A Team Of Rivals"", gives the cast and Spielberg plenty to work with. As LINCOLN proves once again, Spielberg is a director capable of bringing the most difficult subject matter to dramatic life and understanding more about ourselves as human beings and as a nation at large. Great filmmaking does that, and, without question, LINCOLN is an example of great filmmaking; and I would rank it as the single best film of 2012."
"Doppelquacker","10","4","9","19 November 2012"," A movie that shouldn't be missed!
","Lincoln begins rather abruptly, with an absolutely gruesome battle scene that makes you feel you are truly witnessing it, hundreds of men in hand-to-hand combat with knives, bayonets, and swords in a muddy field. Fade to black. Then we see Lincoln sitting in a roughly built battlefield pavilion where he discusses the war and life in general with 2 black soldiers, followed by two white soldiers. Many do not like that part of it, but it didn't bother me. (It's always been the personal side of historical events and people that interests me, not battle strategy or what size of corn cob was used for cleanliness in encampment latrines.) <br/><br/>Spielberg decided to narrowly focus on the final four months of Lincoln's life and his desperate push to get the 13th Amendment through the House BEFORE the end of the war. That narrow focus is the cause of some of the controversy surrounding this movie. However it is a very pivotal part of American history and I believe it deserves that narrow focus. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is stellar as Lincoln, but many think Tommy Lee Jones as the thunderous abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens steals the movie. Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln is also very Oscar-worthy. If Lincoln doesn't garner several Oscars, it will be a travesty. <br/><br/>And that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!"
"marzblackmann","10","4","9","19 November 2012"," Impressive and unforgettable
","I just saw this film yesterday morning and it is DEFINITELY one of the BEST films of the year.<br/><br/>LINCOLN is a movie that isn't action packed. It's just filled with great performances that just are so hypnotic and engaging.I have to say,much,like what oliver stone's ""NIXON"",it gave me a humanizing affect of the man. I mean,this is a President,who is dealing with So much on his plate:the civil war,still in mourning of the death of a child,his wife is in emotional/mental turmoil,and the whole subject of slavery. He is being pulled in so many different directions.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis IS the Laurence Olivia(forgive me if I misspelled his name) of our generation. His portrayal of our nation 16th president is simply INCREDIBLE. The performance so captivating,that you just no longer SEE the actor! Sally Field!Welcome back to a role worthy of your Oscar winning gifts!wow! She is brilliant as Licoln's wife,Marry todd.Tommy LEE JONES..he just is fantastic.Every one,did good with what parts they were given. Thank you Mr.Spielberg,once again,you have proved why you are indeed one of the best directors EVER.<br/><br/>It is a well written piece of work,that's for sure. I am not sure about the historical accuracy but still, it's just so impressive.<br/><br/>I do encourage you to see this film,but like I said before,there's not any action per se,(much like watching C-span with a bunch of guys in long beards and such.haha)but a beautiful work of art."
"natalierosen","10","4","9","18 November 2012"," Masterpiece
","Stephen Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" is yet another masterpiece from the master. It is one of the best snapshots of our 16th president and the social milieu in which he lived that I have ever seen. It concentrates on Lincoln as president toward the end of the Civil War and the machinations between Congress and him to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution eliminating slavery from our national reality. <br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis as President Lincoln and Sally Fields as Mary Todd Lincoln are brilliant as is Tommy Lee Jones in the part of Thaddeus Stevens the great orator of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and fierce proponent of abolition.<br/><br/>A refresher course on the 13th Amendment content:<br/><br/>Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<br/><br/>One can understand by attempts to pass present-day legislation how difficult it actually is and the compromises it takes to pass it as events on the ground unfold. Outlawing slavery by passing the 13th Constitutional Amendment was, to say the least, a Herculean task. Our racist past still even now digs its heels into the cement of our national architectural landscape. It lives on in generational perpetuity gumming up the works in our attempt to create a more perfect union. Through this excellent film one can see the nature of our racist roots, the brilliance of Lincoln as he overrules many in his own party to force Congress into passing the 13th Amendment. One can see that which divided us then still divides us now albeit in different form through a quite different Republican Party hardly, now, the party of Lincoln.<br/><br/>This is a must see for those who love watching the arc of history as it bends, slowly, towards justice. The film's creators spared us the view of Lincoln's assassination but rather cut to an announcement of its occurrence at another Washington theater. We hear Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War, at the president's bedside uttering history's memorable quote: ""Now he belongs to the ages."" And so he does as history marches forward from then to now and our election of the first African American president not once but twice resoundingly so. Not surprisingly it made me cry as I thought about my own efforts to support our first African American president and how thrilled I am to be apart of this nation's efforts to perfect this union. <br/><br/>This film presented the Civil War era and the Lincoln presidency as a reflective mirror of our nation's past that lives today and is not only relegated to the south but occupies a major wing of a major party continually seeking immense power in every state taking advantage of the lesser angels of our nature to do so. It is up to us, in my view, to make sure they do not attain power so as Lincoln in his Gettysburg address so artfully said about the massive amount of Civil War dead  ""that these dead shall not have died in vain!"""

","Greetings again from the darkness. The movie lover in me has been anxiously awaiting this one for months. On the other hand, as a citizen, the recent Presidential campaign antics put me in quite the political funk. Tired of the rhetoric and disenchanted with the current leadership, I was concerned my thoughts might poison the outlook on director Steven Spielberg's latest. Fortunately, both Lincoln and ""Lincoln"" allowed me to forget those in charge today, and instead witness the look and feel of true leadership and greatness.<br/><br/>Despite the title, this is not simply a biographical sketch of our 16th President. Rather, it's an essay on back room politics ... the key to Washington and democracy. Deal-cutting, horse-trading, arm-twisting are just some of the strategies involved in reaching compromise. When the stakes are history ... abolishing slavery ... the passion of those unseen actions is intensified. We see a man at the height of his power willing to do what is necessary to reach a goal in which he fervently believes - even though his views are not shared by a great many others.<br/><br/>Some of the most fun in the film occurs during the House floor debates between Republicans and Democrats. These scenes serve as a reminder that the two parties are often at philosophical odds and, just as designed, debate and discussion lead to compromise and advancement. At least that's the general idea and purpose. Next to Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, err, embodiment of Lincoln, the script is what really jumped out at me. Loosely based on ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" by Doris Kearns Goodwin, Tony Kushner's screenplay serves up dialogue that is sharp, crisp, entertaining, thought-provoking and filled with message. This is a very talky film, not a Civil War film. We only get a couple of brief battlefield scenes, but the conversations never allow us to forget that the brutal war is always on the mind of the politicians and citizens.<br/><br/>Having always been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln, and familiar with the legend, the icon, the monuments, the statues, it was with true awe that I recognize what Daniel Day-Lewis delivers. His presence is so powerful that I found it all but impossible to look at anything else when he was on screen. That will certainly mandate a second viewing, but I have no hesitancy in recommending a film that brings to life what a great man can be ... what true leadership can be. This is a man who carries his burdens in his soul. He may have been self-educated, but in addition to Shakespeare and Euclid, Mr. Lincoln understood people. That knowledge allowed him to maintain his high principles through patience and reasoning and even (sometimes) humorous story-telling.<br/><br/>We are never allowed to forget that this is a Spielberg movie. The scenes with Lincoln and Mary Todd (Sally Field) are somewhat distracting to the greater stories, but perhaps that's the point. These discussions were distractions to him as well. In fact, Spielberg is quite kind to Mary Todd Lincoln. Other tales have not been. Either way, Ms. Field is effective, though I wish she had less screen time.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is a who's who of character actors. Most won't be named here but Tommy Lee Jones is a key player as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, a radical abolitionist; David Strathairn as Sec of State William Steward has Lincoln's trust; Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Lincoln's son; and Jackie Earle Haley plays the Confederate VP Alexander Stevens. There is also a tribunal of political lobbyists or fixers that add quite the element of dirty-politics: James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson. There is a quick scene at Appomattox showing General Robert E Lee, and we get a couple of scenes with General Ulysses S Grant (Jared Harris).<br/><br/>Lastly, the score from the great John Williams excels and compliments the mood and pace of the story ... he is careful to never overwhelm. Williams is probably in line for his 48th Oscar nomination (second only to Walt Disney). This is a film about process and the people who made that process work - even at a time when everyone thought the choice had to be made between ending the war and abolishing slavery. Choose one, you can't have both. Abraham Lincoln proved that sometimes the right man is in the right place at the right time. Unfortunately, those times come around very rarely.

","We are history buffs and Lincoln is part of the family. Daniel Day Lewis wasn't acting as Lincoln, he WAS Lincoln. I felt like I knew the man by the end and I liked him. There was a lot I'd heard but seeing it on the screen was like watching history. They absolutely could not have picked a better cast. James Spader was excellent, Tommy Lee Jones is Tommy Lee no matter what movie he is in and he always delivers, love that man. The casting person should get an Oscar for their part. It was interesting to envision the white house with gas lamps and fireplaces to keep warm, dirt streets, etc. I have had my children to the historic sites shown on the film and this made even more of an impression instead of just walking through historic sites. I wonder how the movie will do being released the same time as Twilight, but our theater was full and I hope all theaters do the same. Propaganda? Only if history is propaganda. They of course left out some of the reasons he did what he did, I'm sure so as not to anger some viewers, but overall a great adaptation of how Washington ran back then and all the work involved, with a lot of added laughs to boot."
"juddp39","10","4","9","18 November 2012"," Pure Enjoyment in a Motion Picture
","from the other side of the aisle.............................<br/><br/>This is a must see movie....even if you are not a history buff. The acting, costumes, cinematography are breathtaking.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Lincoln discussing with two white soldiers and two black soldiers as to why they were fighting in the war. It is 1865 and the Civil War is nearing its end. While there is the Emancipation Proclamation, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln begins in earnest to achieve passage of the landmark constitutional 13th Amendment which will forever ban slavery from the United States. The Amendment must be passed before the Confederate States of American sign a peace agreement and the South is back in their Congressional Seats. Needless to say, even without the southern states there are two sides to the issue. Thus begins the movie.<br/><br/>As the movie starts off there is about 5-7 minutes of a Congressional Session which is difficult to understand and seems a bit boring. Not to worry, from then on you are riveted to the screen, the actors and everything else Spielberg is offering. You will laugh, a tear will come to your eye and you will be amazed at the oratory of our 16th President.<br/><br/>You need not be a history buff to understand and appreciate the movie and the long tentacles of political maneuverings. In fact, it doesn't look a whole lot different than today's political arena.<br/><br/>There are several major issues that are floating about and the course of those issues keeps the viewer glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Sally Fields is the quiet sleeper in the film as she does an outstanding job of playing Mary Todd Lincoln. David Strathairn plays Secretary of State Seward and is a major contributor and thorn in Lincoln's side. Tommy Lee Jones is also ""Bravo"" as Thaddeus Stevens, an influential congressmen, This is the first movie I have walked out of knowing that I was going to buy the DVD when it came out."
"eschetic-2","8","4","9","17 November 2012"," The moving trick of making an icon human
","For over 50 years, Raymond Massey (ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS - 1940) has been the public image of the ideal and idealized Lincoln, but whatever the year end awards may think of Daniel Day Lewis' performance in Stephen Spielberg's LINCOLN, I think this may be the standard for the next fifty years: not of an idealized Lincoln, but a warmly believable, *human* Lincoln achieving his final and perhaps greatest political feat in the final months of his life.<br/><br/>We are not given a perfect film to showcase Lewis' magnificent performance; to be honest, Spielberg has not found a satisfying emotional opening (an unconvincing close up of hand to hand combat) OR finish to his film following his triumph in the House Chamber and White House and the well finessed finale to Lincoln's life that we all know (and finding a fresh way to tell that tale, with young Tad in the seat at Grover's Theatre that his parents might have occupied, is in itself a minor achievement), David Strathairn's solid Secretary of State Seward is never allowed to show the warm literate relationship which made these two former rivals for the Republican nomination for President the envy of their Cabinet colleagues and Tad, the President's youngest son, is played with more an eye to the loving parent's image than the physically challenged (a cleft palate and lisp) historical reality, but the performances of the entire cast - Sally Field's magnificently layered Mary Todd Lincoln (""Molly"") and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Robert Lincoln in an impassioned scene with his father outside the army surgery especially - more than make up for any failure of detail.<br/><br/>VISUALLY, the detail is astounding, from the look of a still unpaved Washington and pre-electrified White House to Secretary of War Stanton's whiskers, the viewer is drawn into the historical reality of the last chapter or three of Doris Kearns Goodwin's magnificent ""Team of Rivals"" (the whole book follows Lincoln from the beginning of his drive for national office), and delineates Lincoln's drive to get the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, formally and finally abolishing slavery in the United States, passed on to the States shortly after his re-election and before the new Congress could be seated in the spring. It explains even more clearly than Kearns Goodwin had why the timing of the passage was so important to Lincoln and the country. <br/><br/>Warner Brothers' 1972 transfer of the Broadway musical 1776, like the stage version before it, showed that with the proper skill and passion, it is possible to build great suspense around a historical political event the audience consciously KNOWS to have happened but may not know the drama which surrounded it originally - so it might be easy to slough off the second time the feat is achieved, but the achievement is far from easy and the result here is in many ways even more impressive than in the musical because there are no side issues to distract the debate over...well, less potent side issues. There, the issue was independence and the side issue was slavery. Here, the issue is slavery - as Ben Franklin had prophesied, a question for a later generation - and the side issue a broader equality - a question which WE know would take more than a hundred additional years to address.<br/><br/>The film's requisite set pieces bridging the main body of the film and the end - the burning of Richmond and Lee's surrender - are somewhat perfunctory, but ultimately satisfying. It's a fair mark of how well the film held its audience when a dozen of the full house when I saw it stayed for the full ""crawl"" of the credits at the end.<br/><br/>Over all, the film will leave you feeling a new respect and almost affectionate connection with our 16th President - one entirely appropriate at a time when we have just re-elected a president who so much of the country (admittedly in a FAR less divisive peacetime) has developed almost as warm, personal feelings about. It's fascinating to see Lincoln trying to hold his Republican Party together as the Radicals of HIS day (who were extreme LIBERALS) start to overwhelm the moderates from the perspective of a 21st century where the Radical Right has started to lose control of the party in the face of a president Lincoln made possible and who is, in fact, more like a Moderate Republican than a traditional Democrat.<br/><br/>If the film can capitalize on its own quality and the fortuitous timing, my fondest wish is that much the same team could make ANOTHER Lincoln film from earlier chapters of ""Team Of Rivals"" focusing on Lincoln's drive for the presidency itself! That one should be a corker too, and a great legacy to a broader understanding and knowledge of our essential common history."
"CrappyCritic","5","3","6","15 December 2013"," A good movie, but really drawn out and bland
","Let's just say, ""Lincoln"" did a good job at conveying a PART of his life, but for the majority of the movie, it revolved around the 13th amendment's ratification and at that point should have just been called ""The 13th"" or something. It did very little to revolve on his history and how he came to be in present position, instead it just throws you into the fray, and just establishes him just being ""there"" in the aftermath of the battle.<br/><br/>Another weak point of the movie is the dialog and the build up, its a very dialog heavy movie, so if you can't stand listening to people talk, this is definitely not a Lincoln movie for you. It's not in general the people talking that is unengaging, but how it's executed and portrayed, there's no sense of you, the viewer, captivated what people are talking about, or feel that tension and stress that Lincoln had to go through to get the amendment ratified, if you want to boil it down to simple terms ""it's an old man debating with a bunch of old men with another bunch of old men in a building"", and this is by no means no disrespect to Lincoln himself, but how it was portrayed was really, really slow and boring, and only to conclude on a ending where you don't even see a scene of Lincoln's assassination and is directly mentioned by ""The president has been shot."" That's it. If the point was to evoke a strong emotion while being indirect about it, it really backfired, just didn't work here. All in all, it's not a bad movie in what its trying to convey, the actors do a good job, but if you came here for a life story of Abraham Lincoln, you should probably look into documentaries, because the dialog would probably be more engaging there than here."

","I admit I am one of relatively few moviegoers who believes Steve checked out shortly after ET, but I really expected he would at least turn in something passable with ""Lincoln"" --- I mean really, with a subject like this how can you screw it up? Turns out, quite easily, when you completely ignore the subject.<br/><br/>As soon as the title card vanishes you are dropped right in the middle of the Civil War, and even deeper into the internal struggles of getting the 13th amendment passed. Even with Daniel Day-Lewis' incredibly absorbing performance --- he hypnotizes with his intensity every second he's allowed to take center stage (which isn't often) --- we're down into the infighting, the excruciatingly long oratories and debates that are more about the political roadblocks and hedges of getting a piece of legislation passed than revealing much of anything about Lincoln's motivations, history, and state of mind.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis gets no help from Tony Kushner's self-aggrandizing, smug, boring script. Hiring Kushner was a huge mistake. In all his works his scripts are about passionately making a point, usually at the expense of the point itself (the wildly overrated and shamelessly pandering ""Angels in America"" says this best). And Kushner's verbal diarrhea does some very big damage in robbing us of any of the pleasures a blockbuster can give us: great sets, location shots, historical intricacies...you name it, since most of the show is all long-winded diatribes you're rarely if ever treated to any set outside a Washington great room.<br/><br/>Go in expecting a rich portrait of one of the most vivid and impactful presidents and you'll go away sadly disappointed. It's about as exciting as watching an afternoon of C-Span.<br/><br/>But why should I have been surprised? Steven has been going for the safe middling formula for some time now. Figure out what makes folks feel good, nod their heads and smile...and give them only that.<br/><br/>What a bore."
"brower8","10","3","6","9 April 2013"," Masterful cinema -- avoids the predictable cliché
","Stephen Spielberg has succeeded at making a movie about Abraham Lincoln without telling us what we already know. It would be easy to turn any project about our 16th President into a one-man show, transforming a fictionalized biopic into a dull documentary in practice. He found away around that by letting others say what Lincoln said. He draws us into the nation's capital and the political process of the time, showing the political order, warts and all. He puts most of the action in the weak light of fireplaces, candles, and gas lamps, giving us a feel that we are back in the time of Abraham Lincoln as no other brightly-lit staging could ever give us.<br/><br/>This is a very human Abraham Lincoln that we see -- and not a stiff granite statue beyond human feeling and doubt. Lincoln had his feelings and his doubts -- and those made him human AND great. It is about one piece of critical legislation, the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in America... and its significance. (The Confederacy would have gladly surrendered so long as it could maintain slavery, which would have been the equivalent of winning the war but losing the peace)<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER: Stephen Spielberg cleverly avoids leading us into the predictable necessary last event in the life of Abraham Lincoln, the ultimate cliché of history, by having a son at some theater not named after someone named Ford."

"ericbobg","10","3","6","14 March 2013"," Lincoln - The Subtle, Mature Spielberg
","Check out my full review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2013/03/film-lincoln.html<br/><br/>I finally took the opportunity to see Steven Spielberg's epic historical drama Lincoln. And I'm so glad I did. It's a film deserving of the many accolades it's received. It gracefully guides us through President Abraham Lincoln's most far-reaching political victory: the passing of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. Equally remarkable, it connects us to the giant historical figure of Lincoln on a personal level. This movie is the realization of an effort by a truly great team of filmmakers, led by Spielberg, but brought to cohesive fruition by a team of producers, writers, cast, and crew that are as dedicated to telling a meaningful story as they are to making it universal. Its a masterclass of film for the industry and a lesson in subtle, dexterous storytelling for the rest of us. Plus it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.<br/><br/>To be more specific on how the story is framed, the film deals primarily with the struggle to rally enough supporters to gain a 2/3 majority vote for the bill proposing the amendment in the US House of Representatives. While the Senate had more easily passed the bill earlier, and afterward it would be ratified among the states, the film takes the stance that the battle in the House was the lynchpin to the process - not only because of the close voting numbers in that governing body, but because of how its passing fit within the political context of the war and the popular opinion across the county. That I can explain this to you is a testament to the clarity with which the story is told - and political dramas can be tough to follow. To be fair, I've read Doris Kearns Goodwin's book Team of Rivals which was Spielberg's main source material for the film. But while true political dramas are more about delivering intrigue, the real summation of the story is an emotional catharsis realized when a set of circumstances and people find success in bringing to pass an historically groundbreaking and life-affirming event.<br/><br/>Spielberg opens with a war scene, set in a muddy riverbed, of hand-to- hand combat from a time before modern military training and Hollywood action, where men clumsily, intimately face the reality of giving and receiving death. Awkward hands push faces, men wrestle and reel in the water, bayonets hit and miss their marks. It's a chilling context, necessary to remind us from the start that the ensuing story takes place in a land where Americans have engaged in and felt the effects of such combat for four long years. Politicians and citizens alike are anxious for this unnatural predicament - brother fighting brother - to come to an end. This is just the first of many evidences that this is Spielberg at his best. His quest for historical accuracy is another. Lincoln's study was carefully constructed to match the original down to the wallpaper. The ticking from Lincoln's actual watch was recorded. Spielberg is noted for having now famously come to set in a suit and addressing the lead cast members as Mr. President and Mrs. Lincoln.<br/><br/>Lincoln shows the career arc of a master craftsman for both Steven Spielberg and John Williams. Both gained meteoric success through their collaboration on Jaws (1974) and have been a famous working pair ever since. Their distinct style set the modern standard for high-quality, entertaining, thematic, blockbuster filmmaking and scoring. This film portrays the skill of aged and experienced craftsmen willing to risk taking their art to the next level. As a follower of both their bodies of work I feel Lincoln is a culmination of their skill, thoughtfully matured with a touch that is subtle, slight, refined, and exquisite in its deliberate application that is lastingly powerful. And yes, I did look up ""subtle"" on thesaurus.com. I've said it before and I'll probably repeat again that artists' best work comes later in their career when they remain dedicated and persistent in the pursuit of the art.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is fully deserving of his recent Best Actor Oscar win for this performance (and he gave one of the most charming acceptance speeches for it). He captures Lincoln's spirit without basing his performance on our standard modern perception of the man (i.e. the voice, the walking gait). Historians will notice Sally Field is almost a full two decades beyond the age of her character but unless you are categorically unable to withstand such inaccuracies, you will be convinced by her portrayal of the tortured Mary Todd Lincoln. Even after reading all of Goodwin's book, it was only Sally Field's performance that opened me to empathize with her character. <br/><br/>I should also mention screenwriter Tony Kushner. His script delivers truthful dialogue that adroitly walks the line of accessibility and accuracy while never making us think we are listening to historical dialogue. I'm excited to see what his next project will be. Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as well. His normal crotchety and closed-in attitude - occasionally a liability for him in that he seems to always play the same character - is an asset here as he plays radical abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens. In fact, it's his character that gives the summation of the film as he comments on the messy, imprecise, precarious process of getting a bill through the House. He calls it ""The greatest measure of the Nineteenth Century. Passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America."""
"rogargaro14","9","3","6","1 March 2013"," Mr Spielberg you did a great job!! it's worth it!!
","The film itself, has a strong script, that has only the right amount of talking, but not only that, if you mute and watch the film without the sound, you can easily understand what it is all about by just looking at the visual features, just the images,. The film is based in historical facts, and it's historical accuracy it's pretty good, but of course it's always a little bit ', as all ''Hollywood'' films are. As in all Hollywood films, the facts are a little extended and exaggerated to give a little bit of ''salt'' in the film,and make it more interesting to the public to see. I think they did it well,they had the right amount of ''salt'' and even then it didn't became historically inaccurate, Steven Spielberg did a great job. Because of that, i believe the right amount of historical accuracy and the right amount of exaggeration, made the film successful, because it didn't bore the public, but it stood there with strong solid historical facts, without becoming a boring ''documentary''. It had heart and emotion to it, with the great performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally field, that made us see, that Abraham Lincoln was not just a legend, not just a president, but a human being,a father, a husband, with problems and worries as we all have, and most of all a man who sacrificed his life, and his well being in the name of his ideals. Not only that, but a smart man.<br/><br/>this is not the full review to read the full review please go to my blog http://n-reviews4u.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/extra-lincoln-film-review- only-here.html"
"RogerCampbell","10","3","6","27 February 2013"," A must see for anyone interested in the history of our great nation!!!
","Steven Spielberg directed this historical biography that focuses on President Abraham Lincoln's relentless efforts for passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States before the end of the Civil War. Passage of the amendment before the end of the Civil War is viewed as critical by President Lincoln and members of his cabinet. Efforts are tireless and tensions are high during this tragic but groundbreaking period of time in the United States that sees President Lincoln strive for change and peace at the same time. Although the passage of the amendment is first priority to the President, the horrors of the Civil War are brought to the forefront when his son Robert insists on enlisting in the army despite the efforts of the President and the first Lady to discourage him.<br/><br/>Daniel Day- Lewis gives a brilliant performance as President Abraham Lincoln and is supported by an equally brilliant cast that sees Sally Field give an emotionally charged performance as Mary Todd Lincoln while Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays President Lincoln's son Robert. Other supporting cast members who give memorable performances are Tommy Lee Jones, Hal Holbrook, James Spader and David Strathairn. <br/><br/>History buffs are in for a real treat as Lincoln shows how history was made with the help of well crafted, realistic looking sets and costumes along with a script that sticks close to the inspiring events of the period. Lincoln is a little long at 150 minutes but with its entertaining script and creative performances, movie-goers will enjoy this picture. <br/><br/>Hopefully they will come away from the picture reassured that Abraham Lincoln, although he was many things, was in fact, not a vampire hunter."
"chaos-rampant","Null","3","6","13 February 2013"," Miss Ravenel's Conversion from Secession to Loyalty
","In the 1867 Civil War novel Miss Ravenel's Conversion from Secession to Loyalty, a Union captain is assigned at the end of the war, to complete the muster-out rolls cataloging his regiment dead and missing over four years of fighting; to get a sense of the insurmountable task ahead of him, these 'rolls' were indeed supplied after Appomattox by the War Department in the form of sheets that measured a yard square. <br/><br/>In the book, the captain is chosen because he is the only one who has been there since the start and made it through, the only one who has the memory to write the chronicle, jot down the history. Meaning there is the killing and dying, but there is a relative truth to it, a struggle to remember the narrative, one which must have some invented sense in its mechanism. <br/><br/>Spielberg has no notion of this, never had. <br/><br/>It's all about what kind of world you think this is. From his perspective, it is all too clean, clearly-defined, closed instead of open-ended, you can see that in the story he chooses to tell of Lincoln, the people as he shines his light on them. Oh, I'm fine with the facts they put in, they could have put more, could have put less. They could have made a fuss for example of Copperhead activities of the previous summer, to make Democrats look worse. More astutely, they could have said that Lincoln's re-election was at all possible because of costly military victory. Anyway, they have very cleanly managed to convey a complex political situation, the issues at stake. <br/><br/>But again it is a simple-minded effect. <br/><br/>Again with the moral platitudes, again with the flaccid narrative and speechifying, with the good guys on one side, noble in the eye of history if not constitutional law, and bad on the other, malicious fools or at best doddering pawns. It reminds me of the few instances we saw Germans in his Warhorse, flatly inhuman, cruelly whipping horses. Again having the subject be safely self-evident, because what would be those who abolished slavery if not great heroes, villains those who opposed it? <br/><br/>And you can see the same dull unambiguity in his visual iconography of Lincoln—Lincoln as mythic shadow, as weary traveler, Lincoln in the candleflame of legend, popular, pedantic perceptions of the man. How else would you do it? <br/><br/>The one great scene for me is where the passing of the Amendment is given to us as Lincoln waiting in his office, startled by the sudden joyous ringing of bells—there it is, the gap away from ceremony and heated fact, the waiting as gears snap into place, the man alone wondering. <br/><br/>It's just not for me, overall. Because in Spielberg's world it cannot be just an army camp the president is visiting, not just life with its clamor and filth, it has to be so that four soldiers, two of them black, recite to him his Gettysburg Address—no soul here, only the sentimental schooling. <br/><br/>But this is why it troubles to speak of it, because as you watch it, the doubt and inner turmoil is there, the morally fickle North and hostility to negro equality is there, the bartering of half-truths for necessity is there, the radical galvanizing as a byproduct of bloody war. <br/><br/>So I'd ask anyone who likes this to more carefully differentiate solid scholarship in Goodwin's book, the historic legend of the man, some narrative complexity in the script, versus insights in the film and cinematic dimension in the presentation of people whose life is not in any book. Historic persons or not, the life you have to imagine.<br/><br/>The difference is between researched history, and bringing it alive as fiction, which is what all filmmakers do, and why Spielberg so often fails when he tries to portray life. You could get the hats and wardrobe historically right, the correct type of wood in the benches, the words and gaslight, but still make a cartoon.<br/><br/>So this is why I blame Spielberg. Film is a matter of representation, of creating the illusion of a world that moves. So the facts are here, but making it alive is a matter of erudition on the part of the filmmaker, a feel for either people or cinematic devices.<br/><br/>Spielberg has taken some narrative complexity, and as he shouts action and we should have the flow of what is real life to his characters, he can't help but reduce, some truthful moments in Lincoln reduced by juvenile moments elsewhere, the same juvenile handling of people I find in all his other films.<br/><br/>So this is everything he would most like to be thought of as, versus who he can't help but be. It's a silly film."

","Just when he should be thinking about slowing down and taking it a bit more easy, middle-aged Abe finds himself tasked with sorting out a long running dispute between two sets of neighbours, while simultaneously trying to stop one of those sets of neighbours from taking advantage of a group of immigrants, and all this in the face of being nagged by his sharp-tongued wife.<br/><br/>OK, so I've synopsised Steven Spielberg's Lincoln as if it was an episode of a long running sit-com, which is unfair of me. It's a reaction to the fact that I went to see Lincoln because I thought I ought to, not because I wanted to. After all, as a Brit, what interest could I possibly have in USA history (apart, possibly from that War of Independence bit where the tenants threw out the landlord)?<br/><br/>Notwithstanding having seen the trailer a number of times, my preconceptions were wrong. This is not a biography of Lincoln. It is not even a view of the Civil War. Instead, it is a view of the concentrated period leading up to the passing of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution abolishing slavery, detailing the horse-trading needed to get the necessary votes, the pressure to get the Amendment passed before peace negotiations with the South begin in earnest, the unlikely alliances needed to achieve this, and Lincoln's role as a consummate politician within all this.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it does get sidetracked from time to time with additional pressures arising from Lincoln's family (Sally Field, who I normally loathe, is rather good as Mrs Lincoln, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is grossly under-used as son Robert): I felt this could all have been omitted with little significant effect on the film, which otherwise held my attention and entertained me throughout. Yes, it is earnest and, yes, it is worthy, but it is also enjoyable.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones steals every scene he is in, and Daniel Day-Lewis stakes his claim to the 2012 Best Actor Oscar. If he wins, it is because he deserves to."

","""Lincoln"" is not a movie for those who don't have an ear for grandiloquence. It is not a movie for those who expect it to be an action-packed Biography. It is not a movie for those who aren't fond of parables. Then what is it? It's a melange of method-acting at its best, ultra-natural ambiance of a war-torn nation and a brilliant script that throws light on the personal and tactical life of the most revered and pragmatic President in the history of the United States.<br/><br/>It's the fourth year of civil war. The Union clearly has an edge over the Confederates. Lincoln has been re-elected as the President. He wants the thirteen amendment, which proclaims emancipation, be passed by the House. Every single white man in the country opposes the amendment for it might nullify the bigotry for the colored folk, but still support the amendment for their respect in Lincoln. Lincoln wants the amendment to be passed before the war gets over and against the advice of his very loyal subordinates; he sets a deadline for the amendment to be passed. <br/><br/>The movie then takes you through the devious tactics of Lincoln; how he painstakingly ensures that he doesn't have any 'traitors' on his side ;how he, as a bereaved father, opposes his elder son's wish to enlist; how he ensured the amendment received bipartisan support . A man with a gift of gab, Stevens serves as Lincoln's right-hand man in the house and has worked for the abolition of slavery throughout his life, for personal reasons as well. Lincoln's men ensure they gather the support required for the amendment to be passed and succeed. Later on, Lincoln is assassinated, though the assassination is not shown in the movie.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis, barring his uncanny resemblance to Lincoln, has given life to the most respected in American history and it's a performance that is worthy of nothing less than an Academy award. Tommy Lee Jones and all the other Lincoln's men played their respective parts brilliantly, and Sally Field was a tad melodramatic. It may not be Spielberg's best, but it is one movie that has several powerful performances by one of the Hollywood's finest."

"mwburrows","2","6","16","18 December 2012"," Lacking charm, charisma, excitement, or entertainment.
","Lincoln begins with a suitable arousal, instantly fading into a gruesome and horrific melee between Confederate and Union troops. I watched with genuine disgust as soldiers trampled upon one another in a muddy marsh, punching, stabbing, kicking, crushing,crying and screaming. These brief 30 seconds are perhaps the most enthralling of the entire film. What could have been a sweeping historical epic becomes a tedious drama about the ""13th Amendment"". The first act - easily 40 minutes or so - revolves entirely around the attempt to pass this amendment which would abolish slavery or some such thing, and scene after scene after scene includes dreary office backdrops in which Lincoln and his subordinates discuss the ""vote"" and ""votes"" and the ""13th Amendment"" and the fact that they need more ""votes"" and that they don't have enough votes, and so on and so forth. There is literally no narrative value in repeating the same topic a dozen different ways for an hour - the audience got the idea in the first 10 minutes. As the story progresses we're introduced to new buzzwords like ""slavery"" which are in turn swapped for ""The 13th Amendment"" during the second act, and move onto larger indoor settings like courtrooms and conference rooms. To make things even more boring there are plenty of Lincoln monologues thrown in that you won't make any sense of and that don't relate to the story in any way. Just when you think the film is about to pick up and inject some excitement into the dull drama with the invasion of a place called ""Willimton"" (something like that), the director instead opts to indulge the audience with - incredibly - an underwhelming dialogue between Lincoln and his subordinates discussing the battle, instead of showing us the gritty civil war in its most naked and entertaining form. You won't really make sense of what happens between key scenes as the 17th century dialogue is difficult to follow and the drama so confusing that you'll tune out and wait for the next arousal scene to clue you in. And that's that. Two hours of boring speeches. A waste of money and effort - the only reason it has gathered praise from the critics is because it fills scenes with dialogue instead of thrills. Intentionally designed to appeal to the critics and not the audience."
"ryan-506-922387","5","7","20","20 November 2012"," Worth Seeing but skews Lincoln's Moral Character
","Do you think we choose to be born? Or are we fitted to the times we are born into?<br/><br/>It's not every day that you go to the movies to be left inspired by film you just spent 2+ hours watching.<br/><br/>Last night, I got to see the recently released movie, ""Lincoln"" and while there were probably more people watching the 100th installment of the Twilight series, I doubt they left fulfilled in the way viewers watching our 16th President battle through Congress and a nation torn apart (unless Lincoln made a vampire cameo in that movie). <br/><br/>The last time I left feeling inspired by such a movie was by the 2006 movie Amazing Grace, which chronicled William Wilberforce and his struggles in Parliament to end the British slave trade. The similarities were incredible and as a result I felt equally satisfied too. <br/><br/>As an addict of American history, the story of Lincoln was well done, and chronicled the last few months of his life prior to his assassination. There were plenty of subtle nuances throughout the movie from Abraham Lincoln's postures to famous photos involving Lincoln that were acted on. One such moment that I found moving was the reenactment of the now famous photo of Lincoln in a more private moment reading a book to his son, Tad on his lap. <br/><br/>Showing Lincoln as a real person and not some marbleesque statue (as it is so easy to view him as) was probably this movie's greatest trait. Daniel Day-Lewis (you probably remember him from The Last of the Mohicans) did a great job of showing the softer and more personable side of his character. As one who has read just about every major biography on Lincoln, I can tell you that life for Lincoln was more misery than it was sunshine and roses, and this persisted throughout his Presidency. From the day he took the oath of office, there were states already seceding from the Union. He also experienced the death of one of his own children. Not to mention the scores of dead bodies that died during the war he presided over. <br/><br/>Flaws that kept Lincoln the movie from being epic<br/><br/>However, there were areas, I wish the film would have focused more on. Such areas would've been a greater emphasis on the role Lincoln's Christian faith played in his presidency and the influence it had in the life and death decisions made on a daily basis. This was largely ignored until the end of the movie in which they did a remake of Lincoln giving his 2nd Inaugural Address which demonstrated the deeply seated Christian-Calvinistic beliefs he held. <br/><br/>But my biggest annoyance with the movie, was the multiple strings of profanity that was accredited to Lincoln as if he had actually said them and in particular, him taking God's name in vain, which I'm sure if he were alive to see today, would have been a huge point in contention with him. This may seem like a petty indifference, but to me it is besmirching his character in an unnecessary way. <br/><br/>In the book Abraham Lincoln: A Biography, Samuel R Suddarth, a Quartermaster General from Kentucky, quotes Lincoln as saying, ""God knows I do not know when I have sworn before,"" and there are not any known quotes of Lincoln having used the profanity he was accredited with in this movie. So if this film is supposed to be named after Lincoln the man, portray Lincoln the man, and reflect Lincoln the man, then they should accurately reflect the character of Lincoln and the values that he held. <br/><br/>The difference between the movie Amazing Grace portraying William Wilberforce and this movie here, is that the former showed him for everything Wilberforce was. On the other hand, Spielberg was right about about 85% of Lincoln, which is more than I can say about other historical movies, but glossed over on what I'd say is Lincoln's most important aspect of life - his faith and trust in God, and in doing so, it was an injustice to the movie. <br/><br/>In all, the movie is absolutely worth seeing<br/><br/>That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie, and I'll probably go see it again just to catch all the subtle nuances of the movie that I missed the first time. The chronology of events the movie displayed, the ruckus in Congress over the 13th Amendment being passed, and the interpersonal exchanges between Lincoln and the soldiers that fought for the Union, the conversations he had with slaves, his love for his children, and the misery that he faced for much of his adult life were displayed in a most moving way. <br/><br/>In the end, Lincoln didn't view the Great Civil War as a match between Winners and Losers, but whether the greatest of Unions would remain forever separated or not. <br/><br/>And Spielberg got that right."

","When I saw the previews for Lincoln and found out that Steven Spielberg was producing and directing it, I knew I would be in for a treat. What I didn't know was how much of one.<br/><br/>This movie was magnificent. I've not seen anything like it in years. There's so much to like the acting was exceptional (by all!), the set and costume design were top notch and the dialog was clever/wonderful. Lincoln is based on the book ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" by author, historian and Pulitzer-Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin who has chronicled the political lives of other past American Presidents. Essentially, ""Lincoln"" is about the passage of the 13th Amendment (after the Emancipation Proclamation had been passed and he had been re-elected) and how difficult it was for President Lincoln to get members of his party and even of his cabinet to pass it. Cleary much artistic liberty had to be taken with various parts of the movie's dialogue, but the House of Representatives dialog where many of its members would publicly stand to address each other and the issues at hand must have been accurate due to the reporters in the chamber! The reporters were the public record keepers writing down the words of the congressmen and publishing them in all of the popular and well regarded newspapers of the day which are probably available (perhaps at the Library of Congress?) for public viewing.<br/><br/>I don't know what other movies will be competing for movie of the year or who will be competing for an Oscar with Daniel Day Lewis, but I sure hope this movie wins big. See this. I doubt you'll be disappointed!"

","Daniel Day Lewis is the Academy Award winner for best actor in 2012, hands down, with this addition to his resume of great acting parts. He truly IS Abraham Lincoln as well as we can know the man over 100 years later. How does a Brit (of Irish & English decent) do that American accent and mannerisms so well? Don't know. But it's so worth the time and money to see this movie just because of DDL's performance.<br/><br/>Now, regarding the movie...I loved it. It totally captured my imagination and transported me back to the Civil War era. Jumping right in at the time of Lincoln's Presidency, we are brought into this small but very important time in his legacy and our country's history. The accompanying actors are splendid with none, IMO, lacking although not holding a candle to DDL's performance. The cinematography and sets are splendid, and costuming was interesting and spot on for this film. The storyline moves nicely for a non-action flick and before I knew it, the movie was over! Good sign, I'd say.<br/><br/>Interestingly, to take such a relatively small part of history and make it into a 2+ hr. movie that was entertaining and captivating was no small feat. Especially when one considers the genre...no car chases, no action, no sex, no ""language"" to speak of and no special noticeable effects. Grand mention needs to be made of Steven Spielberg's direction of this film. Had Spielberg written all over it as he's one director that seems to be able to bring out the kind of emotion and feeling that is rarely felt while watching a movie. Can anyone say, Best Director?<br/><br/>Because some parts of American history is so lacking in education, to see the ""beginnings"" of the Republican party was eye-opening and I applaud Producers and Director for their passion (which is obvious) and their historical covering of such a great time in American history. Truly I am proud to be an American after watching this film. Teary-eye I clapped at the end along with others who probably felt similar kinds of emotions. Don't miss it on the Big screen. Lincoln was a Big screen kinda man."

","One of four faces on Mount Rushmore. The image on the American five dollar bill and the penny. The inspiration behind the naming of several major cities and the motto for the state of Illinois. The 16th president of the United States and the man who fought tirelessly to end slavery in our country. Abraham Lincoln is without a doubt one of the most renowned and beloved Americans to ever live.<br/><br/>And who better to play the role of our great leader than one of the most beloved and celebrated actors living today: Daniel Day-Lewis. A two time Academy Award winner and four time nominee, Day-Lewis is known for his powerful and moving performances in films such as There Will Be Blood, My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father, Gangs of New York, and The Last of the Mohicans. Considered by many to be the greatest actor working today, it is always a pleasure to watch Day-Lewis perform on screen, especially in the case of Lincoln.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, Lincoln is the story of the last few months of the life of Abraham Lincoln. Centering specifically on the end of the Civil War and the effort to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which would abolish slavery, Lincoln is a deep character study into the life of our 16th President and the people close to him in his late life.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis headlines an all-star cast that includes Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Stathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, John Hawkes, Tim Blake Nelson, Hal Holbrook, Jared Harris, and Jackie Earle Haley, just to name two handfuls. With a cast like this, there is no doubt that Lincoln is one of the most anticipated films of the year. And with the execution, I would also anticipate many award nominations in the coming months.<br/><br/>The easy nominees to anticipate come from the cast. I'll get to Daniel Day-Lewis in a moment, but let me start with a few of the other major performances in this film. Having both won Academy Awards far before stepping on the set of Lincoln, it is no surprise for me to say that Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones are both fantastic in this film. Field plays the troubled yet loyal wife of Lincoln, Mary Todd, and Jones plays the Representative Thaddeus Stevens, a major enthusiast for the end of slavery. Playing two very strong, unpredictable, and outgoing individuals, both roles demand each of the performers to be on the top of their game, and neither disappoint. Field is sympathetic and sometimes terrifying as Mary Todd and Jones is vicious yet heartfelt as Stevens. These performances are the glue that holds everything together after the film's star, and are incredibly necessary for the film to succeed.<br/><br/>But let's not kid ourselves. This is Daniel Day-Lewis's film. Portraying one of the most iconic Americans to ever live, it is amazing to watch this film and forget that you are even watching Day-Lewis act. From the opening credits to the closing screens, Day-Lewis is not even in this movie. He is missing and all that is to be seen is Abraham Lincoln. In one moment I actually took myself out of the mesmerizing performance to remind myself that this is the same soft- spoken actor that played Daniel Plainview and Bill the Butcher. Daniel Day-Lewis is known for performing so brilliantly that you forget he is actually the one acting in the film, and it is no different in Lincoln. It takes a brilliant mind and talent to be able to remind us how wonderful a famous icon was, but Day-Lewis does just that. As Abraham Lincoln tells us another parable or gives words of inspiration to soldiers and members of his cabinet, we are reminded how amazing our 16th President is, and that is a credit to Day-Lewis. We have all read and learned hundreds of facts about Abraham Lincoln and have seen countless men portray him in plays, movies, and television, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the actor Lincoln deserves. With a powerful, emotional, poised, and moving performance, we are reminded in the same moments of the greatness of both Abraham Lincoln and Daniel Day-Lewis. It is a performance that must be seen.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/lincoln/"
"Ryan_MYeah","10","4","10","11 January 2013"," The tag team of director Steven Spielberg, star Daniel Day-Lewis, and screenwriter Tony Kushner equal a powerful examination of Lincoln's life.
","I've been eagerly anticipating this movie for months, and what wasn't there to look forward to? It's directed by Steven Spielberg, my favorite living director, as well as the director of my all time favorite movie Jurassic Park. It stars a magnificent cast, including Daniel Day- Lewis, one of my favorite actors, and it's written by Tony Kushner, the mind behind the masterpiece Angels in America. With all three of them working together, how could this go wrong? In short, it doesn't. Lincoln is among the best movies of 2012, and at least better than that horrid Vampire Hunter clone.<br/><br/>The movie focuses entirely on the last few months of Lincoln's presidency. In this time, he seeks to put a stop to the Civil War, which has now begun its fourth year, but in doing so, he also hopes to pass the 13th amendment and abolish slavery. He has no problem with getting help within his own house, but he faces a challenge in convincing enough members of the Democratic Party to pass the bill. On the side, he's also facing troubles within his own family, specifically his oldest son wanting to enlist in the Union.<br/><br/>That may seem fairly standard for a biopic, but the movie manages to transcend that. It's a character study and commentary that gets down to its issues with aplomb. This is some of Steven Spielberg's best direction, wisely dialing down the sentimentality, and allowing for a more refined, procedural, and organic presentation. Even his usual craftspeople tone down their own style, much to the film's benefit. The way Spielberg handles actors is always a highlight as well, with a large cast of fantastic character actors that makes finding a standout among the supporting players tedious. None are better than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Virtually unrecognizable, and comfortably slipping into the emotion of the character like a pair of shoes, he gives another incredible performance to add to his already strong portfolio.<br/><br/>Then we get down to Tony Kushner, whose screenplay is the final necessary piece of this beautiful puzzle. He manages to get right into the head of Lincoln, his familial troubles, and his personality traits, and strongly examines the racial issues and bipartisanship without glossing over them. There are a lot of long conversations in this movie, and Kushner does well to make sure that they're never boring. He deserves kudos for the riveting dialogue, and the appropriate doses of humor, but just as much thanks ought to go to Editor Michael Kahn and his fantastic pacing. The ending does seem a bit too long, but considering everything that came before it, I'm willing to forgive and overlook such a thing. The movie is a brilliant look into history, and a definitive representation of who Lincoln was as a person. Recommended without hesitation.<br/><br/>***** / *****"

","Maybe it's because I'm not American and don't see Lincoln as some kind of political demi-God, but I honestly cannot understand the rave reviews of this.<br/><br/>After the umpteenth ""homespun yarn"" from DD.Lewis I was ready for walking out of the cinema! It seems Lincoln did not have any knowledge of succinct answers to a question, in this you get a five minute monologue about some old boy from his past instead of a simple YES or NO.<br/><br/>Most of the other characters seemed equally cheesed off with his yarns, although I spent most of my time wondering who these people were, what part they had to play in the film and even who's side they were on, the accents were all over the place, so unless you learned the characters when you studied American history you will have little idea of who's who.<br/><br/>The origins of the Civil war had little to do with freeing Negro slaves...until Lincoln started losing the war and needed more bodies for canon fodder and using slaves was simply a practical choice, but in this movie Lincoln is portrayed as some kindly benefactor to the poor slave...instead of the master of the largest group of slaves in history.<br/><br/>Maybe distorting history helps white Americans sleep soundly soundly despite the entire country being built on slavery, maybe that's why ""every school should show this""?"

","Lincoln is Steven Spielberg's best film since Munich (2005). For Lincoln he assembled a terrific cast, one of the best ever. The film is full of dialogue, a result of Tony Kushner's rich screenplay. Because of this Lincoln doesn't even seems like one of Spielberg's films. It doesn't have his typical thrills and action. In fact, it seems very much like a theater play. Daniel Day-Lewis's impressive performance was singled out by some critics as one worthy of a Best Actor Academy Award, but Day-Lewis is only the first among equals here. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, a fervent abolitionist, has some of the best lines in the film. Sally Field as the grieving Mary Todd Lincoln is at the center of the film's dramatic subplot. Both Jones and Field deserve an Academy Award for their performances. James Spader as Republican Party operative William N. Bilbo steals every scene he's in. Other famous names in the cast include David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jared Harris. Day-Lewis made his Lincoln a fully-realized and likable character. When he's talking one can't help but listen to his every word. The film covers the final four months of Abraham Lincoln's life, focusing on his efforts in January 1865 to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution pass the United States House of Representatives. Slavery and war are the two issues here. It's made clear that it took a lot of effort to abolish slavery in the United States. The film presents arguments in favor and against slavery, though it's not a detailed look at American politics of that time. In addition, it seems like an idealized look at American politics. The Civil War was a war between the industrial North against the agrarian South. Seeing Lincoln is really like a trip back in time because the sets and the costumes are very good. In conclusion, the film is easily worth recommending."

","Having seen Spielberg's Lincoln film Thanksgiving afternoon, I'd like to comment on the president's war powers, which ""Lincoln"" said he wasn't sure of, which is incorrect. First, a president's powers as commander-in-chief are implemented under the 1795 Act of Insurrection. Secondly as Anna Ella Carroll, Lincoln's legal adviser wrote, given that the Confederate government had imposed itself upon the Southern people, the Confederacy could be treated as a defacto belligerent (read: foreign) government. Under the doctrine of military necessity, slaves could be freed as a temporary war measure to prevent their public use to provide material aid to the Confederate Army. Carroll was the first to write publicly on war powers and her two major pamphlets ""The War Powers of the General Government"" and ""The Relation of the National Government to the Revolted Citizens Defined"" were partly financed by the War Dept. and distributed widely in Washington, D. C. and the Border States. My definitive biography of Carroll, Great Necessities: The Life, Times, and Writings of Anna Ella Carroll, 1815-1894 reprints these. Also see and join www.friendsofannaellacarroll.org Otherwise, kudos to Mr. Spielberg et al. for a superb movie, and to Mr. Lewis, for the best portrayal of Lincoln ever. The main topic of the passage of the 13th Amendment is one I'm not familiar with in detail. Brilliant idea. The script was dense and a chef d'oeuvre in and of itself. I do wish, however, for less reality in lighting. I know gas lighting was not very bright, but with all those beards, and a number of male characters, it'd be nice to get clearer images to keep the players straight. This is a serious film, not dumbed down. As a matter of fact to catch its full implications, one would have to see it more than once."
"metrobiz","7","4","10","22 November 2012"," LINCOLN: Au Contraire
","The reviews are glowing ... but the film is not. The performances are good - and in the case of T. Lee Jones and D. Day Lewis, terrific. It's almost as though the President has returned to life. The other perfs are somewhat canned. And, though some are calling the film Spielberg's ""maturing"" as a Director, really it's more like he phoned it in. There was none of the ""something new,"" or an angle or perspective, or a gem technique such as the color frame(s) of the child in ""Schlindler's List,"" or the final, powerful panning shot before credits roll in ""Munich."" <br/><br/>And then, the trite, saccharine, contrived chorale of the illiterate soldiers reciting back to Lincoln the Gettysburg Address in the Opening. Highly unlikely. Disney-like. Did they have NPR in their knapsacks? Or even a newspaper with the text (they'd already memorized)? Weird. <br/><br/>Lincoln deserved a better effort from the Director. Even the nat sound was like something from a '50's Western. The 1950's. Williams music? Something he had in a file cabinet somewhere. The music was restrained, properly probably, but it contributed little. The cinematography? Dark and contrasty. But at least that was intriguing and atmospheric as one contemplates the actual lighting of the day, night, and time.<br/><br/>On top - or bottom - of this, the movie was tooooooo long for comfort in the multiplex environment of today. Already, at the end of its first week, the picture was relegated to the smallest screen and auditorium. It will best be seen later on Blu-ray, after it has a run on PBS, where it belonged. Ken Burns ""Dust Bowl"" topped this (as did his ""Civil War"") ... Steven. On a Blu-ray Director's cut it could have been longer - because then one can stop the player for a break, or not.<br/><br/>This is the second recent Miss for Spielberg, the last one being the Disney'esque ""War Horse"" where the begged-for ending was missed, where the soldier SHOULD have returned with grandpa and the horse back to the granddaughter who also loved the horse ... and then they TWO go riding into the cinematic sunset (remember, at the end) to the soldier's home, or anywhere, leaving it to the audience to imagine what might happily happen next. This was the kind of film it was, one that should have circled back to a happy, loose-ends tied-up ending - and Spielberg missed it. It was a horse story folks.<br/><br/>As for LINCOLN, it could have been performed on a stage nearly to the same effect. But this is film. And, for Spielberg, it was lacking. <br/><br/>One scene that does capture an essence better than most is Lincoln's ride through the carnage of the War. It's easy to understand that Lincoln would struggle with Depression, as has been reported. What an unholy mess in which to be mired with little in that day and place besides alcohol to relieve the horror, the sadness, the nation so sadly asunder. The theatre maybe? Even that was a tragic idea ... <br/><br/>Bravo to D. Day Lewis though. One wonders if his voice was that of Lincoln, a little tinny. A line of dialogue somewhere could have clarified that. As for Lincoln the man, he was easy to find in Lewis' performance."
"jdkraus","10","4","10","21 November 2012"," Thank you Mr. Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis for making this movie.
","From what we know about Abraham Lincoln, he had a very hard life marked by tragedy—his immediate family died when he was a child, and two of his own sons lost their lives at very young ages. Despite his hardships, he was a brilliant man when it came to law and politics. For his four years as president, he saved the United States from complete obliteration and he altered history by opening better opportunities for African Americans. He had accomplished much in his life, and to do a film on such a man would be both an incredible and a challenging feat. I do not lack any confidence in director Steven Spielberg. He has done many masterpieces and very few failures. Walking into the theater, I did not know which avenue Spielberg was going to take with this film. Trying to cram the entire life of Lincoln in 2 hours and 30 minutes would be impossible. So would focusing on all of his four years in office. Fortunately, Spielberg and his team zero in on the last four months of Lincoln's presidency. <br/><br/>With a comprehensive and focused plot, the movie gets a chance to explore the White House war room, political negotiations, Lincoln's family, and the issue of trying to pass the 13th Amendment within the House of Representatives. The movie comes off as a political drama— not an action flick, which is a good thing for Lincoln never saw the actual battles, only the bloody aftermaths. The film also truly shows the mindset of the North against blacks. Just like in the South, there were bigots who opposed the idea of freeing blacks and giving them the right to vote, as well as abolitionists who only wanted the amendment to pass as a means to cripple the South's manual labor source of slavery. Unfortunately, the film romanticizes Lincoln's true views on the subject. He is depicted as a man who wants equality for all. This is far from fact. Hollywood is a master of fiction, and this is appropriate for Lincoln in this movie. Who would want to see Abraham Lincoln as a racist on the big screen?<br/><br/>In regards to Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as Lincoln, it is easily the best of the year (thus far). It is hard to say that this is Lewis's best role, because every performance he delivers seems to be his best. What is particularly unique about this portrayal is that Lewis is subtler and more relaxed with a calm confidence. He gives us a down-to-earth, gentle spirited, and soft-spoken individual that is simple for us to admire. The assistance of great make up design helps him look like old Abe, but in all honesty, I think without it, he could still embody the soul and heart of the man. I vote for Lewis to win his 3rd academy award for this flawless portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>Lewis is not alone in great performances. Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Jared Harris, and Hal Holbrook (to a name few) make a standout cast, each adding diligence to their respective roles. Tommy Lee Jones specifically warrants attention for another Oscar nomination as Thaddeus Stevens. His tough, no-nonsense, and deadpan delivery of lines suits him perfectly. <br/><br/>Like all of his films, Spielberg gives us a technically sound piece of work. John Williams score is gentle, often creating a mood that relates to what is happening on the screen. Janusz Kaminski's use of imitating natural light delivers a beautiful and old-fashioned looking film. The production design, costumes, editing, and even sound mixing meshes together in a solid mix of perfection. What I like most about this movie is how it sheds light on an important part of history while keeping our attention and interest without an ounce of it getting dull or pretentious. In all honesty, ""Lincoln"" is Spielberg's best movie since ""Munich."" With a great cast, great production values, great plot, and great pacing, I cannot complain about this movie at all. 10/10"

","As of the 19th of November 2012, 76 reviews have been posted for the movie Lincoln on IMDb. If I may,allow me to leave the reader with twelve fresh points about this wonderful movie.<br/><br/>(1) Not once did I ever look at my watch. The movie could have played for another 449 minutes and I would have been thoroughly entertained. (2) Daniel Day Lewis was never one of my personal favorite actors. He is now. (3) I never left my seat at the conclusion of the movie. I stayed put and saw it twice. Both times the movie brought tears to my eyes. I was not alone. (4) I saw this film in a stadium style theater. God bless the senior citizens who climbed a lot of steps to see this movie. (5) Both showings I attended were in front of a packed house. The house applauded following both viewings. (6) Spielberg added a dramatic piece of scene setting background music to Lincoln that was also used to great effect in ""Saving Private Ryan"". (7) I agree with a local review published in Baltimore. The reviewer said that as Lincoln walks, his lumbering steps remind you of how the back half a costumed horse prances on the stage. Actually, I prefer Lincoln's horse to the 2011 War Horse by leaps and bounds. (8) Kevin Kline, in an uncredited role, portrays an wounded soldier. I'm not sure, but I think I was able to pick him out, but I wouldn't bet on it. That makes quite a statement when an actor of Kevin Kline's reputation takes a roll as an extra. (9) How many Academy Awards will this movie win? I would not by surprised if lead male, female, and supporting male and female awards go to this cast. (10) Speaking of supporting actor, how in the world do you pick between Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, and James Spader? (11) God bless Doris Kearns Goodwin for the time she spends building the characters of ""Team of Rivals"". The characters popped to life in Kushner's screenplay. (12) I wish Abraham Lincoln could have seen the diverse audience, young and old, all colors, who reveled with this movie. Everyone left a better person for seeing this motion picture masterpiece."

I am a fan of both of the above, but just wasn't sure how they could make it all entertaining, but they certainly did. Sally Field is amazing as Mary Todd Lincoln; but I have been in love with her since she was Gidget almost 50 years ago and when she was the Flying Nun, as well. The screening I was at, both Day-Lewis and Field were there for Q&A that followed, and she still looked awesome. Tommy Lee Jones is, well Tommy Lee Jones. He is stellar as Thaddeus Stephens. The few negative reviews I have read on here, appear to be history purists. People, it's a movie.

"cd637","9","5","14","17 November 2012"," Spielberg and DDL at the their best.
","Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is an incredible film. It is probably the most subtle and restrained film you will ever see from the director, and all the better for it. It is also probably one of the most brilliantly acted movies of all time. Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln is phenomenal to whiteness. You forget that you are watching an actor, and when the credits roll, you feel as if you just hung out with Lincoln for 2 and half hours. DDL is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of our time. That being said, there is not a performance in this movie that can be faulted.This film features a tremendous supporting cast, who each gets their own moment to shine. <br/><br/>Lincoln is a movie that feels very real and authentic, and is able to engross you in the world and in the lives of the people it portrays. I can understand some people really not liking this movie, because it is not an action piece, but a heavily dialogue driven movie, which some can find extremely boring. There is one, extremely brief battle scene which is followed by dialogue, and dialogue, and more dialogue. But in my opinion, the dialogue in this movie is some of the most beautiful and witted dialogue I have heard in recent memory. The screenplay overall is 'A' solid. <br/><br/>Some may also argue that the ending of the film wasn't handled well, but I think the way Spielberg executed the final moments of the movie was done so in the proper way and was not off-putting from the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>I think the movie falls just short of a masterpiece due to the fact that there were a few moments were the movie felt like it was dragging a bit and a few times where my mind started to wander onto something else while I was watching, but I was always able to quickly latch back on.<br/><br/>But that being said, I think the movie is excellent and one of Spielberg's greatest achievements. I walked out of the theater moved and wanting more.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in film, great acting, or history, Lincoln is a movie for you!"
"pampinault","10","5","14","17 November 2012"," The more history we write, the less history we change...
","First, let me own up to the ""spoilers""...Lincoln successfully drives passage of the 13th amendment, wins the Civil War for the Union, and is assassinated at Ford's Theater. Sorry. I too, wish this final fact could have been rewritten! With that out of the way, I can say with no hesitation, this movie provided a profound experience for me. I am anxious to own it, in order that I might savor it many times over.<br/><br/>I was left with an indisputable impression that the speeches, the deals, the manipulations, and the unapproachable chasm between the isles of Congress have existed throughout our history. We could just have easily been watching the brokering of any number of bills before the 2012 Congress...though perhaps without the level of conversational artistry employed by the screenwriter. Pity! <br/><br/>There were moments of sheer delight listening to Lincoln's anecdotes, cold and glaring examining of wartime violence and small minded bigotry...and of deep sorrow at the failings of the human spirit. Throughout it all, the human-ness of the President, from his gentle, folksy style to the awkward gait, sloping shoulders, and fragile presentation of this historical giant was brilliantly crafted by Daniel Day-Lewis, and supported by Sally Field's portrayal of Mrs. Lincoln. <br/><br/>The dissection of the political process was fascinating. The actors were breathtaking. I will count this as one of my all-time favorite movies, and recommend that if you can see it...do!"
"galahad58-1","9","5","14","16 November 2012"," 13th Amendment
","Lincoln focuses on Abe Lincoln's trials and tribulations while trying to pass the 13th amendment that would set the African American citizen free from slavery for all time. While there is a good bit of historical focus, there was room for more that would have fleshed out his struggles, but that would have made the movie way too long. There are two things about this film that I really enjoyed: Daniel Day Lewis is marvelous as Lincoln and should garnish an Oscar for this film. The second is while not fully expressed the film shows how corrupt, self-centered, pro-slavery, anti-Negro that the Democratic party was during that time--and if you read history for hundreds of years. There was a lot more atrocities the Democratic party did to the African American that could have been explored, but again that would have made the movie too long. You have to understand that to make a movie in the time constraints, that there is only so much that can be put into the film. Some nice history points were brought into the movie and it allowed you to see Lincoln as a human being."
"debbie-schumacher-disney","8","10","35","2 November 2012"," Worth Seeing
","I saw a pre-showing of ""Lincoln"". The movie was good- a little slow moving and long. It will make the nomination list for Costumes, Make-up and Set Dresser (what was up with all those packages wrapped in brown paper and tied up with string?). Sally Fields was stellar, in portraying Mrs. Lincoln, as an emotionally devastated mother- and not a crazy lunatic that others have. I am concerned with the opening set-up that may whitewash the truth of the Civil War. (The war began because of taxes placed upon Southerners by Northerners- not because of slavery). However, Spielberg did well in delivering the emotional turmoil of a Nation torn and Lincoln's performance as a Chess Master to find a way to bring the country back together. It is a good movie- you should see it, just not after your Thanksgiving Dinner. :-)"
"marthawilcox1831","1","3","7","12 March 2014"," Boring
","The only reason why I watched this film is because David Oyelowo is in it. He is only in the opening scene as a token soldier dumping information about the mistreatment of African-American in the army. I didn't believe his character or his place in the film. Someone obviously likes him and wanted to give him the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg and get a Hollywood credit.<br/><br/>The film itself is dull. It's just a collection of speeches and anecdotes which reminded me of 'Dunkirk' with Bernard Lee and John Mills. That film is also a collection of speeches and reflections on war rather than people living their lives in real time during the war. The process of passing a bill in congress was just as dull as the congress sequences in 'Amistad'."
"Essex_Rider","1","3","7","21 January 2014"," I nodded off
","I would expect this movie to be of interest, and generally well received, by Americans, however, I found it tedious beyond tedium. Long drawn out speeches in dark surroundings with seemingly endless bodies and cigar smoke. All it showed to me was that the same horse trading happened in American politics then as happens now. I thought Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal was excellent, but his vast talent was wasted by the screen overcrowding. It could have been really good, it could have shown, as in the opening, more of the civil war, it could have shown more of his background, but instead it concentrated and became mired in early American politics and little else. What an irony though, to think of his emancipation bill being hauled through congress, only to see black folk swinging lynched from trees 100 years later. I was really looking forward to this biopic, but it really isn't what I'd hoped to see."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","3","7","3 March 2013"," Not the most accessible of films, but still a great one
","Much of Stephen Spielberg's output I do like very much. Not all his films post-Saving Private Ryan have been great, but there have been a handful that have been and Lincoln is one of them. I can though understand why some wouldn't like it, the first hour is lengthy and slow as well as quite talky. I think it may also depend on how much you know about Abraham Lincoln and the 13th Amendment, in the case of my mother she found the film interesting but because she didn't know much about the subject she didn't always find it easy to follow.<br/><br/>Admittedly my knowledge of it consists of knowing the basic facts but not the full picture. I cannot say whether it stretches the truth or whether it is accurate, but that wouldn't have mattered much to me as I found myself captivated. Lincoln is not a flawless film, aside from the slow pacing in the first half I did feel that more could have been done with the ending, that had potential to be very moving but the idea to have something else going on during that fateful event and then rushing through the aftermath for me undermined the emotional impact and how much we cared about what happened. Of course we do, here though we just don't have enough time to express it.<br/><br/>That said, it is a very well made film, and Spielberg directs superbly. The sets, costumes and atmosphere look both gritty and beautiful, and everything is very evocative. The battle scenes are scarce but, the beginning scene in particular, there are hints of the gut-wrenching realism that we saw in Saving Private Ryan. John Williams' score is haunting and understated. There may not be a main theme that everybody will remember strictly speaking but Williams has always had the ability to boost a bad/not-so-good film a notch or two and I cannot deny how beautifully composed the score for Lincoln is.<br/><br/>Lincoln is very well written as well. There is a lot of dialogue, but it is very rich and intelligent with the verbal sway in the courtroom also entertaining. The story picks up after the first half, which still had its interesting points, don't get me wrong, with the courtroom scenes compelling(the final one when the Amendment is passed was the best one) and the scene with Lincoln and his wife talking about the loss of their son affecting without being too mawkish. And I think those who lost a loved one but don't talk about their grief will really relate to it, it may not be the case for some but that was the vibe I got from watching that scene in Lincoln.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerising, he won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance and it was more than well-deserved. He had a difficult task of trying to make a major historical figure authentic. He does that just by his enigmatic presence and penetrating eyes alone, it is a very authoritative and thoughtful performance. He is very well supported by a large- perhaps by some people too large- cast. Some can have a tendency to speak it a little too quickly but the intent is there and I can definitely understand why, having to do assessed college presentations I've been in that boat. Sally Field makes the most of a rather unsympathetic role, which may have been a reason for why some didn't like her performance, I thought she gave her all and her rapport with Day Lewis is strong. Tommy Lee Jones has the juiciest dialogue of the film(some of it had me quietly chuckling actually), and he relishes it in one of his best supporting performances in recent years.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film but understandably it is one that not everybody is going to be thrilled by. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

"ifredpr","9","3","7","4 January 2013"," Fitted for Eternity by Ivette Fred-Rivera
","It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. (Last passage of the Address Delivered at the Dedication of the Cemetery at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln November 19, 1863.)<br/><br/>Opening shot: the American Civil War, the first person we see and hear is a young black man, soldier during 10 long years, the second we hear is Lincoln -whom we don't see yet, we will see him very soon from the back, the audience's position, asking about his situation, the third that speaks is another black soldier. They are paid less than whites. But in a hundred years, they will vote. This visionary soldier recites words of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address of 1863, the most quoted words in American political history. Lincoln, in turn, asks and listens to the Other: ""Abraham Africanus the 1rst"", as his detractors called him. The movie shows Lincoln's distinctive command of language, his good sense of humor, his ability to tell stories and to make the political issue personal to others by narrating an anecdote or a parable. Also his capacity for argumentation, guided by a clear vision. For example, his knowledge of Euclid's self-evident principles gives him a case for visionary imagination. Mathematics and logic as well as ethics have to do with the imagination, with seeing the consequences of the premises, and seeing the consequences of one's actions. Lincoln strongly believed that we had to end first slavery, then the Civil War, as the first was the cause and the second the effect. This seems simple, self-evident reasoning, but it is really difficult to recognize the order of priorities, which comes first and what comes next. His advisers saw it exactly reversed. Lincoln is emphatic: the passing of the thirteenth amendment is a military necessity. Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) advised him after the reelection: 'you are loved by people, you can do whatever you want now, do not waste this opportunity'. The depiction of the relationship between Mr. President and Mrs. President (as she names herself) is an asset in the characterization. Mrs. Lincoln says that her experience will help ordinary people, presumably like herself, to understand what meant to be with an extraordinary man during extraordinary times. (The irony involved reminded me of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.) The characterization of Lincoln is well balanced because of these interactions. Though Lincoln is very conscious of his solitude, calls himself ""the king of infinite space"", and prefers to think alone. Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), the most powerful abolitionist in the House, takes the House approval of the thirteenth amendment original document to his maid-mistress. For a moment I thought he would take it to Lincoln, at the top, to celebrate their triumph, but instead he brought it to whom this resolution will directly affect in real life, the people who are at the bottom, with no voice as are not even considered people. Very tragic and ironic for the Democratic Party to have been so blind and troglodyte in this historic moment. Lincoln is not afraid of the future, the unknown, the challenges ahead, he recognizes that he does not know black people and that he defends their freedom as a matter of principle (as a Kantian would do); he will learn from them in the process. Interesting, Lincoln needs to experience the sight of the victims, of their corpses. 'Never have seen anything like this.' Excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski; mastery of light and shadow, chiaroscuro, of the composition of cinematographic space, the interplay of interiors and exteriors, of angles, particularly, the diagonals that give movement, depth and the impression of a larger space. These techniques were masterly used by Vermeer and Murnau. The windows, outside light coming through the window to the interior space, and the exterior seen in the distance. Father and young son, their shadows reflected as a vision of future free generations. Excellent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Very handsome and stylized Lincoln!! ""How tall is he?"" The height, the attitude, the physical and moral heights. It is a very difficult challenge to perform ""Lincoln"", he is very iconic and heavy. Father Abraham wants to travel to the Holy Land after so many years of suffering. A black servant is the last person seeing President Lincoln walking away from the camera after his Amendment has been passed. Lincoln's death, the first US president assassination, is presented briefly. It reminded me of the Iliad where neither the death nor the funeral of Achilles appear. In the penultimate shot, dead Lincoln is lying on a small bed, nestled as a boy, his face quite calm, obviously, his murder has not astonished him; then in the final scene at the Capitol, Lincoln is standing erect, in action, delivering a speech to the multitude in the middle of the frame. Again, command of composition, of inner space and outer space. The joy for such a victory and the sadness for his tragic death. For Lincoln, as a remarkably responsible president (like king Oedipus), both spaces, both bodies -the political and the private- are only one.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for the beautiful gift, director Spielberg.<br/><br/>""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party duly shall have been convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""

","Like many others, Lincoln is one of my favorite U.S. Presidents. His role in the abolition of slavery was vital to the country. <br/><br/>In a movie like this, historical accuracy is important for the simple reason that people don't like inaccuracies. There was no sacrifice of precision for entertainment purposes in this film and I was pleased with that fact.<br/><br/>This movie was not about the life of Abraham Lincoln, it was pretty much exclusively about his life during the civil war. In fact, the movie is more about the 13th Amendment than it is about Lincoln himself. This kind of surprised me as Lincoln was quite the interesting man even prior to his presidency. He was known for being very persistent as he ran for office many times and lost. His life is also the perfect story of rags to riches. Anyhow, Spielberg chose not to include these things in the movie for his own reasons.<br/><br/>I consider myself an educated man and I can honestly say I learned a few things from this film. Unless you are an avid fan of Lincoln, you will learn something while watching this film, some may even be shocked.<br/><br/>However, this film was not perfect. I was quite disappointed that the film did not include some key events that happened in Lincoln's presidency such as Willy's death and Lincoln's death was not shown first hand. The man hunt of John Wilkes Booth was even left out.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie though as it features incredible acting from Daniel Day-Lewis and the supporting cast."

","Lincoln was a phenomenal portrayal of the president in this time of toils. This film perfectly revealed not only the politics and the insights of the people of the time, but it grew a certain sympathy for Lincoln as a person and what he was trying to accomplish as a President. Likewise, the picture depicted just how complicated it was to push through the 13th amendment, and how much it meant to so many people. One of the most powerful moments in the movie to me was when Lincoln's former slave was watching him walk down the staircase after the amendment was passed, the appreciation in his eyes was moving. Also the actors were amazing and fell into their roles perfectly. The overall production of the film was outstanding with every seen having a purpose, and every witty story of Lincoln's perfectly in place. If you are looking for an action war moving, this is not it, but if you are looking for a movie that ignites a new found love for your country, this could be the perfect find."

","""Lincoln"" is a political thriller that focuses on the president's behind the scenes efforts to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed through Congress during the last days of the Civil War. When the outcome of the war was shaping up to be a Union victory, President Lincoln, masterfully played by Daniel Day-Lewis, was afraid that the slaves freed by the Emancipation Proclamation and now fighting as soldiers for the Union would be re-enslaved and returned to their former owners as property. With the help of Representative Thaddeus Stevens, Tommy Lee Jones in a ferocious performance, Lincoln has Union agents contact Democrat legislators on an individual basis in the hope of getting votes for the amendment."

","Although I thought the movie was good, it was slow in some areas. I think Daniel Day Lewis WAS Lincoln as only we could imagine he could be. He was quirky, profound, steadfast and even the walk appeared as what we read about Lincoln. What puzzles me at times is the factual side of these movies. I do know that the story of Thaddeus Stevens is true according to Wikepedia and even deeper than shown in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is worth watching if no more than to how Congress and the floor worked back in the mid 1800s. You may draw a conclusion that the Rebublicans actually had or were perceived to have a democratic stance and the Democrats had more of a current day Republican's stance pertaining to their interactions with black people.<br/><br/>All of the acting was very noteworthy, especially Daniel Day Lewis, if not Oscar worthy."
"lee_eisenberg","10","5","15","26 November 2012"," story of the past and present
","There are couple of things to discuss about Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"". Despite what the title implies, the movie is not the life story of the sixteenth president. Rather, it focuses on late 1864 and early 1865, when the reelected Lincoln was trying to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed to outlaw slavery. What we see is how Lincoln had to scratch a few backs to ensure the amendment's passage. Similar things happen to this day.<br/><br/>But there's an even more important clear analogy to the present day. When the proposal to ban slavery gets brought before congress, a number of congressmen attack it as things like ""an attack on freedom"" or ""an overreach of government power"". In later years, the reactionary forces in the United States said the same sorts of things about the Civil Rights Act, and today the Tea Party types say the same sorts of things about today's social progress.<br/><br/>Does the movie have any drawbacks? Well, there's not much look at the war itself, except for a scene of disembodied limbs on a battlefield, and there's not much look at slavery, except for a photo of a whipped slave. Of course, one could make the argument that these aren't supposed to be the main focus of what Lincoln had to do in order to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed.<br/><br/>Above all else, the movie shows Abraham Lincoln's human side. The sixteenth president saw that ending slavery would take significant ambition, and he did what he felt that he had to in order to carry out this objective. It's not Spielberg's best movie, but it's definitely up there. Daniel Day-Lewis brings a fine embodiment to Abraham Lincoln, as does Sally Field as his wife Mary. Providing impeccable support are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, and Tommy Lee Jones."
"caseymoviemania","2","4","11","17 February 2013"," Casey's Movie Mania: LINCOLN (2012)
","At the time of this writing, Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN has won numerous awards including BAFTA and Golden Globes as well as scoring 12 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis. Not only that, the historical epic was widely greeted with (near) universal praises among top critics and viewers when it was released last November in the US. Even the US box office grosses was really impressive, which was currently sitting at $173.6 million against the modest $65 million budget. Now that the highly-acclaimed LINCOLN have finally reaches our local shore (which will be open nationwide on February 21), is the movie really that praiseworthy? I hate to say this, but LINCOLN has to be one of the most overrated movies ever made in recent memory. How this movie could have ended up such a praiseworthy historical epic is seriously beyond me.<br/><br/>Partially adapted from Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Teams of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, this historical epic focusing on the last few months of Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) life as he tries to convince and manipulate the Congress into passing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which would officially end slavery and also allow people to vote regardless of race. At the same time, Lincoln is also facing the ongoing Civil War during his second term as the 16th US president.<br/><br/>First of all, LINCOLN is unlike any historical epic Steven Spielberg has ever done before in his illustrious directing career. There's nothing majestic or even any sense of epic grandeur normally expected from Steven Spielberg. Instead, he and screenwriter Tony Kushner opted the most unconventional way by shifting a larger-than-life historical figure like Abraham Lincoln into a deeply personal, yet intimate portrait of the 16th US president. Suffice to say, everything in LINCOLN is heavily constrained into a chamber drama. At the surface level, such radical approach is certainly ambitious but unfortunately, both Spielberg and Kushner are not Aaron Sorkin or David Mamet in term of executing a movie heavy on dialogue.<br/><br/>As a result, this lengthy 149-minute LINCOLN feels like watching the paint dry. While I have to applaud Kushner's meticulous detail on how US backroom politics are achieved during the mid-19th century, his overall screenplay feels too static to warrant this as an intriguing drama worth paying attention for. Then there's Spielberg's delicate, yet plodding direction where he is hopelessly out of touch. By stripping his usual lively direction to a skeletal core, his attempt on minimalist direction fails miserably to sustain the momentum and pacing of the movie. Further damaging the overall structure of the movie is Michael Kahn's poor editing, while John Williams' score is almost non-existent and Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is so drab and uninspired with far too many static shots.<br/><br/>As for the huge ensemble which was heavily praised by the US critics, I can say that only Daniel Day-Lewis deserves some, but not all, praises in his uncanny turn as Abraham Lincoln. But that is as far as he goes. His so-called subdued acting leaves little to be desired of, and frankly, his supposedly layered performance comes across too single-minded and dare I say, boring. Apart from what we know as one of the most beloved US presidents who made a great achievement by abolishing slavery, both Spielberg and Kushner fail to scratch beyond the surface of Lincoln's life. As Mary Todd, Sally Field is equally wasted as Lincoln's estranged First Lady. The rest of the supporting actors are forgettable as well -- from Tommy Lee Jones' fairly adequate turn as Republican Congressional leader Thaddeus Stevens to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's sadly thankless role as eldest son Robert Lincoln.<br/><br/>LINCOLN is a terribly misguided effort. I don't blame Spielberg for trying something different in his usual approach on a historical epic genre, but this is the kind of movie where it should be directed by someone else more qualified. Seriously, LINCOLN deserves far better treatment than this lifeless movie."

","I had HUGE hopes for this film. I was very excited for the Lewis/spielberg combination and the critical debate about slavery and its consequent abolishment.

Lewis gave a good performance, expected as usual, but it was very far from saving the huge failure of this movie. I honestly cannot fathom how in the world this got nominated for Best Picture when it is clearly one of the worst movies made in the past year.

","Lincoln is probably Spielberg's best film of the new century, but he likes to remind us of his inability to avoid ghastly choices of adding manipulative melodrama. Lincoln is a film about The 13th Amendment, and when the film focuses on this, it's excellent. However, the film ends unnecessarily with Lincoln's death. It's a misstep that hurts an otherwise great film which began with an equally overwritten opening scene where two white soldiers attempt to rehash the Gettysburg Address, only to have it finished by a black soldier. Spielberg's weakness is becoming more evident, but at least his strengths rule supreme for most of this otherwise excellent film. It's filled with great performances by Daniel Day Lewis, David Strathairn, Tommy Lee Jones and many more. An excellent procedural."

He can present us with entertaining blockbusters as well as compelling films such as this one of America's sixteenth President. Daniel Day- Lewis delivers an amazing performance that gives strong appeal to posturing and even vocal presentations in terms of Lincoln's preference for storytelling to obtain a point. Lincoln's ambition was not just to end the Civil War but to also grant equality to African American citizens and free them from slavery. In order to gain passage for this amendment it needs the right number of votes and this leads to numerous court sessions where ending the war is crossed with race and where one's heart truly is. While Day-Lewis perfectly embodies Abraham Lincoln and his pursuit of peace and freedom, he is backed by strong supporting players. Sally Fields plays Lincoln's wife who fears that her son will die in the war. This brings to question her motives or devotions. David Strathairn plays the Secretary of State working alongside the President but questions actions done without consulting him. Tommy Lee Jones plays a vocal Radical Republican Congressional leader Thaddeus Stevens who bears a secret in his final scene. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Robert Todd Lincoln, Abraham's son. Flawed only by its anti- climatic outcome. We know Lincoln's fate but perhaps a visual presentation would have made for a rousing climax. As is it is a great look at a figure of integrity.

"llltdesq","10","2","4","21 April 2015"," Lincoln is a movie, not a non-fiction text or documentary
","This is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. There will be spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>This film is based in part on the book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. It is not a historical documentary, it is not a non-fiction history text. It is a film made for entertainment purposes first and foremost. Therefore not all events depicted should be expected to be the absolute and complete truth.<br/><br/>You have a two and a half hour film trying to cover a period in history four months long. Did two black and two white soldiers speak to Lincoln, with one black soldier berating Lincoln about the treatment of Negro soldiers and then have two of them recite portions of the Gettysburg Address back to him? Probably not as depicted. But Lincoln spoke with troops regularly, particularly in the field. Could a soldier, particularly a Negro soldier have recited the Gettysburg Address, in whole or in part roughly a year after its delivery? Most certainly, given that the memorization of speeches was common in those days, the speech was reprinted in newspapers in its entirety and soldiers got newspapers in the field.<br/><br/>Getting to talk to the president back then was much easier than it is now, in part because, up until Lincoln, no one had ever shot one. Lincoln was literally besieged by office seekers, because the president did, in fact, hand out patronage himself. Lincoln did walk down the street, he did cut a comic figure in the saddle, he did haunt the telegraph office and his cabinet was often hostile.<br/><br/>Members of the House did, indeed, call each other buffoons, idiots and so on-on the House floor. After Preston Brooks caned Charles Sumner on the Senate floor, House members began carrying guns and knives on the floor. So much of what you see here is a realistic depiction of behavior at the time. End of sermon.<br/><br/>The film itself is really an actor's movie. Daniel Day Lewis shines, but I must confess that Tommy Lee Jones stole the film as far as I'm concerned. Thaddeus Stevens was actually a much meaner and much less charming and affable as he appears here. Jones softens him somewhat and does a magnificent job. Sally Field is marvelous as Mary Todd Lincoln and David Strathairn delivers a magnificently understated performance as William Seward. Lee Pace does admirably as Fernando Wood, a New York Congressman and ""Copperhead"" (a Democratic politician sympathetic to the south).<br/><br/>The vote in the House is dramatized and most likely a bit too long, but fairly accurate for the most part, with some compression.<br/><br/>This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray, with Blu Ray looking marvelous.

"luke-a-mcgowan","7","2","4","6 April 2015"," Well-acted, beautiful looking, self-enamoured film
","Lincoln is a beautifully acted, beautiful looking film about one of the most remarkable men of American history. Steven Spielberg continues to remind us why he is likely the greatest director of all time. Lincoln is visually beautiful, with costumes, production design and cinematography off the chart. With very little imagination, we are put inside the 19th century. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a typically stunning performance as he embodies the former President. Tommy Lee Jones is also sharp, witty and grouchy as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. Hal Holbrook, Lee Pace and David Straitharn also turn in great supporting roles. <br/><br/>However, not all the acting is able to hold up with Day-Lewis and co. At times the presence of high profile 21st century actors like James Spader and Joseph Gordon-Levitt can become distracting (even though their performances are fine), as there is not enough fake facial hair in the world to disguise them. Sally Field also hams it up and overacts as she tries to grasp at all possible screen time and remain relevant long past her prime.<br/><br/>Where the film suffers is its screenplay. The film is clearly more enamoured with its own words than we are, and we are subjected to long, dull monologues that bore and tire us. Even during the film's most enjoyable moments (the Congressional debates) little effort is made to examine the Democratic opposition to the 13th Amendment, preferring to serve up racial diatribe in order to saintify Stevens and Lincoln and demonise the others. With respect to Tony Kushner, but perhaps if the screenplay had been written by a less poetic and more political-savvy writer (a Sorkin or a Willimon or even a Clooney), Lincoln could have been something engrossing."
"kluseba","4","2","4","15 May 2013"," This failed classic feels pointless and inconsistent
","Before you get me wrong, let me set things straight. I have loads of respect for the historical character of Abraham Lincoln and his achievements. I studied human sciences for four years at university. I am interested in topics with economical, ethic, ethnic, philosophical, political, psychological and social issues. I have elaborated opinions on many topics but I am open to listen to opinions of others if they can explain and elaborate them in front of me no matter what their point of view might be. I think it's important to create movies about historical events and characters and I'm not talking about all those biased and rather similar war movies that have flooded our cinemas since 9/11. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to watch this movie. I thought that it didn't get so many awards for nothing. I have much respect for Steven Spielberg. I adore Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. Everything seemed to be prepared for a great film but I got quickly disappointed.<br/><br/>But let's start with the positive things first. First of all, the costumes, decorations and settings are breathtaking. They really take you back in time. The artistic details are authentic, elaborated and rich. Any artist and historian will enjoy this aspect. <br/><br/>The acting is also on the positive side. Daniel Day-Lewis' interpretation of the legendary president is authentic, intellectual and very stylish. Tommy Lee Jones who portrays Thaddeus Stevens is another highlight. There is a little surprise about this character in the end of the movie that put a smile on my face. <br/><br/>Let's though talk about the negative aspects. The most important thing is the storytelling. I'm aware of the fact that this is not a biopic and that the movie only focuses on a little aspect of Abraham Lincoln's political career. But I feel that the viewers are thrown too quickly into the story. The movie features several scenes that touch the president's past and future or the issues of the Civil War. If you keep these scenes, you also have to give a few more details about them. I know American history well and was able to follow this movie but as a blockbuster for a bigger public, this film clearly lacks details and orientation. The film should have spent more time on the issues of the Civil War. The introduction and character development of the president as well as of his friends and foes should have been done in a smoother and more detailed way. The film ends with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln that is shot in the most boring way possible. If you include this detail, you should have shown the whole story of the murder, why it eventually took place and what happened shortly afterwards. If you really want to create a movie that is some sort of statement against slavery, you should have shown the evolution that the proud black people of the United States of America have gone through since the pioneer work of Abraham Lincoln instead of only showing the assassination of that ladder one. <br/><br/>Sometimes, I feel that even the makers of the movie weren't sure what this movie should have been like. The simplistic title ""Lincoln"" clearly underlines this issue. The movie is a historical drama but of what kind? An extended biopic? Check. A social drama around the American Civil War? Check. A political statement? Check. By trying to be all of this at the same time, the movie feels confusing and pointless. <br/><br/>The dialogues are sometimes very elaborated and intellectual but sometimes almost too simplistic. This quite strange contrast made this movie rather incoherent for me. In one scene, Abraham Lincoln has a philosophically intriguing discussion with his wife and at another moment, he has to hold a speech that is incredibly improvised, pointless and short. There are many of these two- faced moments and they really bothered me. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones do great jobs but the supporting actors were everything but important or impressive. I would have liked to learn more about the motivations and views of the political adversaries of Abraham Lincoln. Many intriguing historical characters of the Civil War are introduced like cameo appearances. Once again, the makers didn't seem to be sure what they wanted to do. If you want to do a movie about the Thirteenth Amendment only, then you should have excluded the details about the Civil War. But if you include them, please elaborate on the historical context and let the actors some space and time to show their talent.<br/><br/>Instead of doing so, the movie includes many useless dialogues. Some discussions and speeches are without a doubt intriguing but what you get here are almost one hundred fifty minutes of dialogues. This is definitely too much. The makers should have included some additional elements to lighten things up. This could have been a few battle scenes of the Civil War. It could have been a few flashbacks elaborating on the Abraham Lincoln's life. It could have been the difficult relation to his wife or family as well. It could have been the complicated relationship between Thaddeus Stevens and his wife. Many possibilities were there to create a more entertaining and at the same time profound movie. What we get are only dialogues of an unstable quality as in an old fashioned theatre play.<br/><br/>The weak points are much more prominent than the stronger parts. On the positive side, we have great costumes, locations and settings and two solid main actors. One the negative side, there are too many dull dialogues, more or less convincing supporting actors and many pointless scene choices. This movie is hard to sit through, even for those who are interested in the topic. I wouldn't watch it again. I can't understand all the awards and positive critics. I come to the conclusion that 2012 wasn't a good year for Hollywood cinema."

","History has told us Lincoln is responsible for abolishing slavery, but it's the exasperating hardships and personal sacrifices that forever altered the landscape and direction of this country. Making the amendment battle the cornerstone of the story reveals Lincoln as a simple man, yet equally complex. As the civil war rages on, Lincoln struggles with the carnage on the battlefield, as well as the conflict within his own cabinet pertaining to the Thirteenth Amendment. Spielberg wisely focuses the last three months of Lincoln's life, and his own crisis of conscience between ending the war or slavery. If you're not entirely sure why Lincoln is universally regarded as one of the greatest U.S. presidents going into this movie, you'll have no doubts by the time it's over. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't just play Lincoln--he inhabits him. It's a remarkable performance that won another Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Day-Lewis. With his Oscar winning performance as Lincoln, he became the sixth performer to win more than two Academy Awards, and the first male performer to win three awards for lead roles. Impressive secondary performances abound as well. Sally Field, as Lincoln's unstable wife, delivers a marvelous performance, as does Tommy Lee Jones as the fiery, passionate Thaddeus Stevens. ""Lincoln"" is an authentic, visual masterpiece--reproducing and portraying the landscape and atmosphere of the 19th century in extraordinary detail. The incredible performances receive most of the notoriety, and rightfully so, but the production values and set design are simply stunning. Jim Erickson (set decorator) and Rick Carter (production designer) both won Oscars for Best Achievement in Production Design. <br/><br/>One requirement upon seeing ""Lincoln"" is you must commit yourself to two and a half hours of laborious dialog and monologues, from a litany of characters encompassing a variety of topics. A major challenge Spielberg had to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period--and fitting it into a structured, disciplined film. Throughout the film, there are an abundance of subtleties that can easily go unnoticed, and the demanding content of the film's script makes this a challenging picture to watch. <br/><br/>That being said, ""Lincoln"" belongs to the ages, and is one of the finest historical films ever made. Steven Spielberg's landmark motion picture enriches the American canon - freeing the Great Emancipator from his tintype image in our history books, and explores the wit and wisdom that made the man."

","This is an excellent film despite the usual Spielbergian visual flourishes that clunk or exasperate in equal measure. The plot revolves around the final months of Lincoln's Presidency when he tried to push the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery through the House of Representatives in January 1865. The focus switches between the shenanigans and politicking to get 20 votes from the amenable and wavering Congressmen and Abe's home life with a distraught and grieving wife and a son who wants to enlist. The film is saved from over-worthiness and just being a drama doc by the towering and astonishing performance by Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln. The acting is uniformally good, the staging and production values excellent. Problems lie with the over-sanctification of Lincoln (cue bright shining lights from above onto Lincoln) by not including obvious bad contradictory elements to the story, and the playfulness of the script and director towards their liberal agenda, eg in your second term use your political clout to end the war! Will Obama take note? The complaints seem to be from the younger generation who cannot sit still and listen to a polished dramatic script that is conversational - tough, youngsters, this is not Iron Man 1865!

It's the kind of amateur mistake you don't expect to run across in a Steven Spielberg movie - and so it kind of ruined the rest of the story for me, as I was expecting other blunders to occur along the way. <br/><br/>Apart from this, the movie captures a great deal of accurate details, picturesque scenes and episodes from that time line. The acting was quite good. Technically it could have been much better if the scenes weren't cut from so many different angles and close ups.

"Likes_Ninjas90","9","2","4","3 February 2013"," No one here is anything less than convincing
","Are films too conveniently timed to coincide with contemporary moments or do they force us to address the unwanted memories and atrocities of the past? To this day, America struggles to address its racial history, determined to shield itself from its ugly and divided past, particularly in pop culture. Only two years ago an edition of Mark Twain's novel ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" (1884) was published replacing the word ""nigger"" with ""slave"". <br/><br/>The same attitude applies in Hollywood. Director Spike Lee declared he wouldn't view Quentin Tarantino's slave-Western Django Unchained, as it would be insulting to his ancestors. The film has also been criticised for the frequency of the word ""nigger"" too. However, this year Steve McQueen (Shame) will also be releasing a film called Twelve Years a Slave and the frequency of slavery as a film topic could infer that there is genuine interest in exploring the subject as a result of recent America history. <br/><br/>Yet despite documenting Abraham Lincoln's efforts to pass the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery, Steven Spielberg's Lincoln isn't concerned with foreshadowing modern history, like Obama's 2008 inauguration. Spielberg bought the rights to Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""Team of Rivals"" before it was written in the early part of the last decade. The film began development under the Bush administration and Spielberg stated in an interview with the ABC: ""It's not about America today, but it has tremendous repercussions looking back about what America could be today under the right leadership"". <br/><br/>Spielberg is deemed one of the most iconic Hollywood filmmakers since Frank Capra. Through cinema he has recreated some of the most important historical events of the last century, including the Holocaust (Schindler's List) and the Invasion of Normandy (Saving Private Ryan). He is a great fit for this material but like Capra, he is susceptible to over sentimentalising his most work, as was the case recently with War Horse (2011).<br/><br/>Through their films both directors have shared a vision of America becoming an idealised land of equality. For Spielberg, this stemmed from childhood as he was tormented for being Jewish and admitted to being embarrassed by his heritage. After 9/11, the way that the Bush administration shattered relations with the Middle East stung Spielberg's American Dream. <br/><br/>Hence, Lincoln is a film concerned by the need for great leadership and social equality, though at the expense of bending the political and legal rules. The haunting image of a pile of amputated limbs, thrown into a ditch, visualises the film's moral dilemma and poses a question to the War on Terror itself: in times of conflict, how long can a political party withhold change before engaging with social reform? <br/><br/>Following his re-election, President Lincoln (a magnificent, chameleon performance by Daniel Day-Lewis) faces pressure to end the Civil War and abolish slavery. Yet he is reminded by his staff, including William Seward (David Strathairn), that ending the war before the vote will mean there is no reason to emancipate slavery: ""It's either the amendment or this confederate peace, you cannot have both."" Lincoln is also urged by wife Mary-Todd (Sally Field) to end the war because their eldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is determined to enlist in the army. Lincoln requires twenty votes to pass the motion, including votes from the Democratic Party, and enlists some men (John Hawkes, James Spader) to offer jobs as bribes to those who will support the vote. <br/><br/>What's surprising about the film is that despite encompassing many of Spielberg's staples, the lost child, an anti-war message and social and racial equality, it is without the director's usual preachiness and cinematic gaudiness. The narrative is conventionally structured but resembles a play rather than an epic. The screenplay by playwright Tony Kusher (Angels in America) gives the film and its backroom drama well researched and highly colourful conversations to work through. I did find some of the political terminology, combined with Early Modern English (""buzzard's guts!"" ""water closet""), to be intimidating at times though. <br/><br/>Buoying the film past these challenging moments is the amount of humour and wit. There are hilarious conversations and anecdotes in the film, which are respected by Spielberg's restrained direction. The colours are gloomy and drab and the camera-work is sparse. The film is mostly compromised of men talking in rooms and the containment of these scenes is a reminder of, for better or worse, where leadership begins and ends. Relying heavily on the charisma of the cast is an intelligent move by Spielberg as no one here is anything less than convincing. Tommy Lee Jones is hugely enjoyable in a highly theatrical turn as Thaddeus Stevens, whose public image and values are tested as he momentarily suppresses his passion and fierceness to help his party secure the vote. <br/><br/>One of the few cinematic moments is an opening scene where we see the abstract images from Lincoln's dream about a ship. He later says in the film: ""We're whalers!"" This reflects the same themes equal to Herman Melville's novel ""Moby-Dick"" (1851): a Manifest Destiny and the impossible search for equality. Spielberg and Lincoln therefore share a collective and optimistic dream for America, but the director resists lingering over the film's contemporary relevance. His film and its necessity for leadership achieves an applicability that extends far beyond what has happened in the last four years of American history and surges deep into an uncertain future."

","""Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they."" ⎯Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract, or Principles of Political Right, 1762. Spielberg's Lincoln, loosely based on historical events and the people who actually lived those lives rather than the actors representing them is more about our present slavery than the American civil war and the 13th amendment for the abolishment of slavery: ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" Perhaps I'm too cynical or just paranoid about the motives behind Hollywood's entertainment as part of the leisure industry and capitalism but when spectators like me and my friend pay for the so called privilege of being entertained during our free time by those who are forced to provide entertainment for the indentured masses, I'm not interested in dramatic propaganda. Nowhere is it more blatantly obvious than in Spielberg's films, which are hyped-up to be something they are not: That is to say, worthy of these ridiculous awards we laud upon the well-paid slaves of this film: Daniel-Day Lewis - the best slave-actor in the world; Sally Fields the best slave-feminist and interior designer of the white house; Spielberg – the best boy in the world because they all care so much about telling the truth. If the film's intention is self- parody I applaud its success. However, if they are so naïve as to think people are going to be duped into believing that Lincoln or any other man or woman, whether he or she be black or white, president of the United States or God really will free us from bondage, think again! These shadowy images on the cave wall we now call a cinema screen are relatively well photographed but this film is a poor and somewhat sad reflection on humanity's willingness to remain in a state of ignorant self-serving bliss. ""The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said ""This is mine,"" and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody."" ⎯Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Discourse on Inequality, 1754"
"rubenm","5","2","4","26 January 2013"," Spielberg shows us History
","Politics is a dirty business. 'Lincoln' shows us that this has been the case for at least 150 years. Lying, scheming and lobbying were as much a part of the decision making process in Lincoln's time as they are now. Lincoln himself isn't afraid of a few dirty tricks in order to realize his great ideal: the abolition of slavery. <br/><br/>The film portrays Lincoln as a tormented man, torn between his political goals and his democratic principles. To make matters worse, he also has family problems: his wife is not supportive at all, and his son plans to endanger his own life by joining the war that Lincoln wants to end. <br/><br/>It seems like this is good material for a solid historical drama. Still, I didn't enjoy the movie very much. To put everything in the right historical context, there are lots of subplots and side stories that are sometimes difficult to understand for someone who isn't very familiar with Lincoln's life. Large parts of the movie consist of politicians talking about 19th century politics. And some parts are even completely incomprehensible without knowledge about the historical context, like the scene at the Appomattox courthouse. For Americans, this probably is a very famous event in the history of the Civil War. But for Europeans these events are not common knowledge. <br/><br/>Watching the movie, it's tempting to compare with what's going on now. When a black soldier says he hopes that blacks can have the vote 'in 100 years', I couldn't help thinking that 150 years later, the US has a black president. The final scene of Lincoln giving his second inauguration speech reminded me of Obama's second inauguration speech, only a few days ago. And the scene of Lincoln and his aides sitting by some sort of telegraph machine, waiting for news about the battle at Wilmington, is very similar to the famous photograph of Obama and his entourage following the operations leading to the capturing and killing of Osama Bin Laden. <br/><br/>Although Steven Spielberg doesn't portray Lincoln as a saint, but as a man with doubts and sorrow, it is still a very patriotic movie. One of the strongest quotes in the film comes from the speaker of the House. When one of the congressmen says it is very unusual for the speaker to cast a vote, he answers: 'This is not usual, this is history'. That's the spirit throughout the whole movie. Spielberg wants to show us History."

","Spoiler: Lincoln dies in the end . . . . but then, you probably knew that - hopefully.<br/><br/>Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals has long been one of my favorite books - the best book on leadership I have ever read. So, I was excited when I heard that Spielberg's Lincoln would be based on the book. In fact the movie focuses primarily on the passage of the 13th amendment (Emancipation) by the Congress. There is so much more in Team of Rivals, that please don't think you have gotten the essence of the book (or the man) by watching the movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie is terrific. While Lincoln is using every trick he and his cohorts know to garner the needed votes for passage of the amendment, his humor, his character, and the anguish he suffered throughout his life are well displayed. As far as the politics of the vote, it is easy to trash our current Congress (well deserved), but this movie shows you that things have not changed since the beginning of our Republic. Everyone has their own ideas as to what is best for themselves - oops the nation - and many times things get done for the wrong reason (Payoffs, positions - feeding the individual's greed for wealth or power). It is so today and was so in 1865.<br/><br/>One of the best roles which illustrated this was Hal Holbrook - playing the role of Preston Blair who was trying to broker a peace offer between the North and South. And then Lincoln, a very ambitious politician himself, playing both ends against the middle - doing almost anything to keep the Union together, signs a true, but misleading statement to the House which helped seal the deal for the vote for emancipation. Lincoln a staunch opponent of slavery made the famous statement "" if I could save the Union by freeing all the slaves, I would do it. If I could save the Union by freeing none of the slaves, I would do it.""<br/><br/>Well, back to the movie - the script is superb, the acting superb, the resemblance to the actual people amazing - I wish at the end they had introduced all the actors next to the real life person - Lincoln was great - Gideon Wells was dead on.<br/><br/>I hope you see the movie - this one immediately moved into my top ten (along with a bunch of zombie flicks). You will not go wrong with Lincoln. DonB"
"dfranzen70","9","2","4","1 January 2013"," Splendiferous - hello, awards season.
","Can anyone truly be surprised that Lincoln, starring the gifted Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Steven Spielberg, is an out-of-the-park, instant classic? The movie was destined for success as soon as those two signed on, and do they ever deliver. Lincoln is a powerful, provocative, timely piece of art that is so well crafted that it diverts focus, as needed, from the president to the issues at hand - the potential end to the Civil War and the potential ratification of the 13th Amendment.<br/><br/>The movie covers the time period of December 1864 until Lincoln's death in April 1865, with attention paid in equal amounts to the aforementioned national issues and the character of the 16th president himself, a tactful, down-home man who suppresses his emotions at the expense of his health. His is the most exasperating of dilemmas: should he agree to a peaceful accord with the confederates - and thus risk losing the fight against slavery for all time - or allow the bloodiest war to continue - and thus hope that the surrender would compel the defecting states to observe an amendment to abolish slavery? Ah, but of course there's even more to consider - would said amendment even pass? As more and more young men die each day, the decision becomes burdensome, almost Sisyphusian task.<br/><br/>In 1865, it was the Republican Party that was anti-slavery, made up mostly of Northerners, with Democrats coming from the South. In order for the amendment to pass, all of Lincoln's Republicans would need to vote for it - plus a good number of Democrats. As today, lobbyists were deployed, by the Secretary of State (David Strathairn), to convince undecided politicians to vote for the amendment if and when it was presented for a vote. Meanwhile, the confederates are requested by a Lincoln emissary to travel from Richmond to Washington to talk - but will they arrive in time? And is this what the president truly wants?<br/><br/>One thing is for certain: the machinations within political circles has not changed all that much. Secretary Seward attempts to woo some lame- duck senators with promises of jobs in Lincoln's new administration, but there are only so many jobs to go around. As these negotiations and overtures go on, the War Secretary (Bruce McGill) orders a massive attack on the rebels. Lincoln's own son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is frustrated by his father's refusal to allow him to enlist, and First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) has tremendous mood swings and could well be mentally unstable.<br/><br/>Standing tall above the fray is the inscrutable, yet vulnerable Lincoln himself. He sees his end and believes he can find the means to achieve it, but at what cost? See if this sounds familiar. One argument brought up by a senator against the abolition of slavery is that it would lead to Negros getting the right to vote, to be on the same ground as white folks. Topical, isn't it, with current talk about immigrants and their standing in our country. Lincoln himself puzzles over the ramifications, but he is convinced that he must first get the amendment passed and then worry about the consequences. Why? Here's a sneak-peak story. Lincoln wonders if we are born equal, if we are born for certain times or if we must fit into the times into which we are born. He even uses a Euclidean notion to prove a point, along with countless other stories with some sort of impetus behind them. This Abraham Lincoln is lawyer, teacher, thinker, philosopher, and father.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis, as is his wont, disappears into the role. Imagine an Irishman playing an iconic American - preposterous! And yet there he is, plain as day, looking and sounding like he jumped out of the Oval Office in the 19th century. To say that his performance is terrific would be an astounding understatement. He breathes Lincoln, gradually allowing us to see various layers of the character. <br/><br/>But we have come to expect that from Daniel Day-Lewis, haven't we? What about Sally Field, though? Let's think about this. Sally Field is 66, 20 years older than Mary Todd was in 1865; she's only 10 years older than Day-Lewis. Can we accept her as his wife and not his mother? A resounding yes. Field hits her role hard, with raw emotion and guts, toning down the First Lady's infamous histrionics. For the past couple of decades she's done a lot of television and few big-screen roles. This may change things, oh it just might. Sally Field has just proved that an actress of certain talent can play younger. She's not just a plausible Mary Todd, she's Mary Todd incarnate.<br/><br/>Their supporting cast is filled with familiar faces, with not a slouch to be found. Hal Holbrook. James Spader. Strathairn. McGill. John Hawkes. Jackie Earle Haley. Gordon-Levitt. And a dour, bewigged Tommy Lee Jones. Spielberg doesn't mess around when it comes to casting epic masterpieces, does he?<br/><br/>Lincoln is a hit, from beginning to tragic end, thanks to...well, everyone. It's the kind of film that makes you forget you're in a dark room with strange people. It's the kind of film that makes you think you're standing in the balcony of the Capitol, watching the proceedings. It's deliciously detailed and does not shy away from the grisly results of the wars between men."

"samkoseoglu","7","0","0","22 June 2018"," Spielberg Knows Exactly What He Wants to Display
","There are some weird reviews of the movie that I come across every now and then claiming that the movie actually portrays Lincoln as a saint and it would be better to present him with his mistakes and such. These sights are clearly presented with claims disproving themselves with that kind of perspective as Spielberg tries to demonstrate the exact opposite of that view. It may not be the best effort, but it is, in sharp contrast with this kind of reviews, an effort to portray a man, rather than a saint or a hero without a humane presentation. <br/><br/>By portraying such a man, Spielberg takes a great risk of course. But, he does it with the only way that a director should lay his endeavors, he presents a small part of a grand narrative. That is the key to the movie. People complain about the movie's title or the presentation of a short period of Lincoln's lifetime, they have no idea about cinema in my opinion. Recently, I have watched one of the adaptations of ""Germinal"" by Emile Zola, such a grand narrative for me. Claude Berri tried to adapt the novel in that 1993 version. That was one of the worst adaptations I think, just because of the movie's incomprehensible endeavor to recapitulate the whole novel in nearly three hours. The only thing that could be recollected from the movie as a good feature was its language, which was French. If, by any chance, Claude Berri tried to recapture the last part of the novel, last ten days, even ten hours of three main characters of the novel when they are stuck in the mine after the accident, it might well be a nicely presented exhibition without the haste and tumultuousness of a very long novel narration in three hours which seemed to lose the influence of the story stored in a format that which we call a book, a novel. Why I gave that example, just to remind people that grand narratives equal grand lifetimes or biographies and Spielberg knows it. He also knows that 13th Amendment was the most important point to depict on screen about Abraham Lincoln. Some other director may think that it was not, it was some other thing from his earlier times worth to demonstrate, and that director may create a great demonstration as well, it is not my point. The point is that a director should capture a moment, a thing to present from a narrative rather than recapitulating all of it, and Spielberg does that.<br/><br/>Other comments about Lincoln's stance against slavery, if it was fake or not what we see in the movie, are also centered around certain pieces of information about Lincoln's ideas, from some letters or deduced from political actions; however, they miss the point. Lincoln's notions are altering throughout the time just like all of the United States, he does not take a stance like an absolute abolitionist but one cannot claim that he does not actually care about slavery, he only uses that subject for his war policies. That is, to put it mildly, narrow-mindedness. Lincoln, as Eric Foner puts it, is part of a spectrum of thinking on slavery in that era believing that it would be a long process to get rid of slavery, but step by step he is, in some sense, evolving. Spielberg tries to portray that transition or evolution period with vague dialogues of Lincoln, he never takes a strong stance like Thaddeus Stevens, but it is a rather discursive evolution of a person with attitudes of a mediocre development."

The acting, overall, was the movie's strongest feature. Never once did an actor stray from the character they were supposed to be playing. The attitude of Daniel Day-Lewis in the movie really does exhibit how Lincoln has always been described throughout the Civil War period. Everything, from the language to the setting, was how I imagined it would have been in 1865. The relationships between men and women were also very accurate to the time. Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field complimented each other very well in the movie and portrayed what a 19th century husband-wife relationship would have been. One thing I did not like about the movie was how Spielberg didn't show or talk about Lincoln's's childhood or the severe poverty he faced growing up.

Spielberg has the mood and light fine-tuned to the point that when the characters are donning shawls against the cold--this in the white house--you shiver. I can'think of a single actor who was not up to snuff, but James Spader as a rascally vote procurer stands out. Sally Field as the troubled Mary Todd Lincoln is a sympathetic gem, and her portrayal should go a long way towards explaining and perhaps inviting history's revision of that unhappy woman. The film focuses most on the nuts and bolts of legislative and presidential processes, and while that may be boring for some,it has such a ring of authenticity and research that it had me scrambling for the history books to check on things I hadn't known.

","""Four score and seven years ago..."" Famous words, some of the most famous words that have ever been spoken in human history. Spoken by a famous man with so many words in the history books. So much of what Abraham Lincoln did has ended up in the history books and yet very few ever really know him. They don't really understand what he did and how he did it. Figures in history often have that problem. We spend hours upon hours trying to figure them out and putting them in a modern context. What would they think of what we are doing today? How would they feel? What advice would they give to us about today's problems? Rarely though do we ever look at what they actually went through in their own time. The hardship and the struggle of every day life giving us the structure of what exists today.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that the details aren't out there. Volumes upon volumes of text books are dedicated to these people and the lives that they led but we are always discovering new things about them. And that's because the context, both historical and emotional, can only really be understood with that often get lost over time as history moves forward. That is until the invention of film. With film, meant in broader cinematic terms rather than the physical medium, we can attempt to capture the reality of the struggle in a new and exciting way. Not to mention with technology and techniques being what they are today, the process of capturing it can be even more accurate and honest then ever before.<br/><br/>As a result, we have a film like Lincoln. Directed by Steven Spielberg someone that many might consider a historical figure of the modern age, and starring Daniel Day Lewis, an actor who is on his way to becoming one of the best of the modern age if he isn't already. Through attention to detail and command performances by all involved, Lincoln paints a beautiful portrait of one of the most incredible and well known men in history. What makes the film even more remarkable is the fact that littered within the film are great lessons for the modern day. A nation divided by political and economic differences shows that little has changed in the past 100+ years and yet everything has changed.<br/><br/>How did Lincoln do it? Even in seeing this film I'm not entirely sure because I am left with a sense of awe at the fact that he was able to accomplish anything at all. I am left with this same sense of awe after seeing this film. For all the ways in which Spielberg could have approached this film, he chose the most difficult way and yet the most relevant to modern times.

","The poster for Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" depicts a beautiful portrait of the 16th president that screams ""ICON!"" Every preconceived notion of this film (Spielberg, Day-Lewis, LINCOLN!) points to a large-scale film trying to create the legend that the American memory preserves. But this film is anything but big. Sure they reconstructed 19th century Washington D. C., but what do we have if not another big Spielberg epic? The answer is an intimate, humanizing tapestry of a man and a nation.<br/><br/>Spielberg brilliantly opens his film with a direct confrontation of legend. Privates in the Union army approach President Lincoln, utterly starstruck, trying to recite some of the President's most famous words. And what does honest Abe do? He sits back, humble, patient, and pensive. Spielberg's intention is clear: to deconstruct myth and build an enduring memorial to a man. Drastically cut down from its early drafts, Spielberg takes a little piece of what could have been Tony Kushner's never-ending (but always witty and brilliant) screenplay, focusing on just a month of Lincoln's presidency as he battles for the passing of the 14th Amendment.<br/><br/>There is no need to praise Daniel Day-Lewis more on his Oscar-winning performance. He creates both a strong character and a human being in perfect harmony with one another, just as Spielberg addresses reality and legend. Like his performance, almost every aspect of this film is subdued, subtle, and brilliant. The Cinematography is nothing grand or revolutionary, but rather finds beauty in being simple and natural. Kushner's fantastic script allows these characters shinning moments in utterly honest humanity. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones give some of the most honest performances of their career. Every aspect is perfect for what the film is.<br/><br/>Upon my first viewing, I left thinking ""That was good...but nothing exceptionally great."" In retrospect, I guess I wanted the traditionally big Spielberg epic like many of his career defining films. But upon my second viewing, I saw the film for what it was. I saw the human story that it always was. I saw the tragedies and triumphs that decorated this month of Lincoln's presidency. I saw not the great president that we remember, but the great, flawed, and warm human being that was. And that man, by far, makes a better film than the legend."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","22 February 2013"," The 13th Amendment
","""Lincoln"" is not a cradle-to-grave biopic of the arguably most loved and respected president of the US. Rather, it focuses on two parallel events: the Civil War and 13th Amendment of the US Constitution (i.e. the abolition of slavery). The fascinating thing is, at least to the extent of how it is depicted in this movie, their convoluted cause-effect relationships, which just may need advanced Game Theory to unravel.<br/><br/>Quite a few people likened the opening battle scene to that of ""Saving Private Ryan"", the obvious thought association of director Steven Spielberg. A more appropriate comparison, however, should be through thought association of the lead actor Denial Day-Lewis, to ""Gangs of New York"". In the opening battle scene of ""Lincoln"", we don't hear a single gunfire, but instead see close-up hand-to-hand melees.<br/><br/>Dealing with historical events which dictate that he must adhere closely to facts, Spielberg works his usual miracle in creating drama without stooping to melodrama. While never wavering from the main theme of the 13th Amendment, he enriches ""Lincoln"" with the other macro scenario of the Civil War as well as the micro scenario of the protagonist's family life.<br/><br/>It is in handling the main theme that he excels, having the courage to depict not only the struggle to achieve the noble goal, but also some of the shady strategies such as buying of votes. Whether the end justifies the means is left to the judgment of the audience. The best part is the fight in the House of Representatives, which at times threatens to impersonate a three-ring circus. And the best of this is one climatic and elating scene by Tommy Lee Jones depicting the passionate, fiery abortionist Thaddeus Stevens. With victory tantalizingly within reach, Stevens exercises utmost self-control from making a politically unwise reference to ""racial equality"", toning it down to a less provocative ""equality for all"". Under the severest of provocations, he holds his ground, but finds emotion release in an outburst of hurling at his opponents the worst insults allowed in the legislature, exclaiming that the 13th Amendments will give equality even to the lowest scum of the earth, sub-human creature the like of them! For this scene alone, Jones deserves an Oscar. As an aside, all 5 supporting actor nominees this year are already proud owners of an Oscar (lead, support, or both), so there is less pressure in this category for any one of them to win.<br/><br/>Spielberg, as always, does not neglect to let the audience have a glimpse of his lighter side, a mischievous kid that is forever present inside the great director, such as in this movie a quick cut from a crab-shell-crushing hammer to the gavel in the House of Representatives. Another example is when Stevens, after the triumphant passing of the 13th Amendment, ""borrows"" the original document for one night, taking it home to show his black housekeeper who is for all intent and purpose his wife, a relationship that they dare not reveal. The appreciative companion quips, ""it is just impossible for you to take your housekeeper to the House"", something to that effect.<br/><br/>The cast and performance are uniformly first-rate. Jones has already been referred to above. Day-Lewis has already swept all of the Best Actor awards announced to-date and will no doubt pick up the Oscar in about 50 hours from the time of this writing. Playing Secretary of State and Lincoln's right-hand-man William Seward is David Strathairn, another Oscar-class character actor (nominated for ""Good night, and good luck"" although losing to a well-deserved Philip Seymour Hoffman). Sally Field plays Lincoln's wife while rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays his son, the former still grieving the lost of another son to ilness while the latter fervently longing to prove himself my enlisting. There are also Hal Holbrook, John Hawkes (""Teardrop"" in ""Winter's bone"") and many, many other, all solid performances. <br/><br/>Just one more thing I like to mention about this top-notch movie (in addition to Janusz Kaminski's absolutely first-class cinematography, of course): voting before the arrival of secret ballots. The public roll-call procedure, entirely unimaginable today, provides exceedingly entertaining drama in ""Lincoln"". While in the audience you are reflecting how unfair this is, you are at the same time enjoying the unfolding of the drama of the infinite number of ways with which a member can announce his vote. One even voted yes and immediately changed it to abstain!"

","Over the course of his life, Steven Spielberg has graced us with powerful movies like Jaws, ET, The Color Purple, Schindler's List and now Lincoln. A film that's so powerful, so moving and awe-inspiring that it might be his best film since Schindler's List. It tells the story not of a man who has now considered a saint and legendary president, but instead focuses on a offbeat, humorous and somewhat awkward man who helped lead our nation in arguably one of its darkest hrs. First off, what Daniel Day Lewis does in this film is so remarkable and so poignant as he plays Lincoln again not as a ""divine"" man, but someone who has his flaws like all men but has a passion and belief in something and will fight at all costs to get it done. We observe Lincoln's humor, deal-making and compassion as he fights to get the 13th amendment passed while also bring to end the Civil War with as little bloodshed as possible. However, Day Lewis is matched remarkably by Tommy Lee Jones who is just extraordinary as Thaddeus Stevens who captures all of his zeal and passion in helping blacks get equal rights and Sally Field who really is under appreciated but captures what Mary Todd Lincoln dealt with losing a son, being mocked by politicians and citizens alike yet standing by her husband even though it's hard. Credit also goes out to David Straitharin, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley, Joseph-Gordon Levitt who has that remarkable scene with Day Lewis when they're arguing over whether he should go to the army or not, and the rest of this remarkable cast. The cinematography, the music and the set designs all match the 1860's and the scenes where Lincoln clashes w/ his cabinet over the bill is one of the more powerful moments I've seen in a movie in a long time. Tony Kushner's script is on point as he portrays the amendment's passing as a work of compromise, shady dealings and other tactics that match American politics today and the whole fight for the bill really captures how we as Americans are divided as of today over major issues and how we have to fight to appease them before they tear our Union apart. Also the movie's ending is so raw and powerful that I'm sure you'll be like I was in tears of this extraordinary man whose life was cut short before his greatness could be ascertained. This is the best picture of the year and I hope the Academy honors Day Lewis, Field and Jones and Spielberg for their unbelievable achievement. 10/10"

"jadepietro","10","4","12","27 November 2012"," A Lincoln Portrait for the Ages
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Film biographies have also seemed to be a stodgy affair, the biased mishandling of fact and fiction to make the subject more compelling than life itself. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is a remarkable achievement, a concise and engaging film that treats both the man and the myth with an evenhandedness and craft that simply impresses the moviegoer at any level.<br/><br/>The film is based on the best-selling novel, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin, but the director shrewdly focuses the film on Lincoln's final months and the the passing of the 13th Amendment. As war rages on and the nation is torn apart, the political climate is awash with abolitionists and pro-slavery forces, with neither sides willing to bulge or be nonpartisan. ( Sadly, history continues to repeat itself. )<br/><br/>Spielberg has always been one of our most accomplished directors and here he shies away from his tendency to sentimentalize this subject matter and make it more palpable for mass consumption. He renders the brutality of war with mere images of the carnage that became the Civil War and layers his film with that high cost of freedom. There is no dumbing down of the story, plot, or its large cast of characters. Everything is richly created, with a high level of excellence in the production design by Rick Carter, gorgeous photography and lighting by Janusz Kaminski, an unfussy and stirring score by John Williams, and wonderful period costuming by Joanna Johnson. Foremost is a literate screenplay by the talented Tony Kushner that engages the audience from the start. Kushner's dialog, characterizations, and speeches have an intellectual and poetic nuance that distinguishes this film from other standard film biographies. <br/><br/>Lincoln has a tendency to bog down a bit with the internal political manipulations and schemes needed to ratify this amendment to the Constitution. In fact, some scenes about the internal battles of the politicians became somewhat repetitive to me. Additional screen time and depth given to the president's personal life and less emphasis on the governmental bureaucracy would have made this film even more compelling.<br/><br/>However, Spielberg seems more interested in the ethical complexities of the issue of slavery and the moral consciences of the politicians at that time than Lincoln's family dynamics. He even uses some actors as a pseudo Greek chorus to establish more clarity for the movie audience and mirror those legislative point of views. Spielberg tries to equate the similarities of America's government then and now ( the use of lobbyists, the influence of the media, the wheeling and dealing to sway a vote ) and he succeeds brilliantly. <br/><br/>The director assembles an excellent cast in telling his story. At the center of the film is a towering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president. His lanky physique, angular facial structure, and awkward demeanor truly captures the man and our predetermined notion of him. Throughout the film, Day-Lewis eloquently delivers many speeches, tirades, and witticisms with much authority and passion. His portrayal is wholesome, restrained, and understated, quite powerful in its completeness.<br/><br/>Among the many supporting roles that standout ( Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lee Pace, Stephen Spinella, Gloria Reuben, and the trio of James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Hawkes ), two veteran actors invest themselves wholeheartedly into their roles: Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones. As Mary Todd Lincoln, Fields distances herself from the clichéd crazy First Lady persona and brings a stateliness and emotional center to the film. Her bond with Lewis seems authentic and helps to add the most affecting moments to the film. Jones plays Thaddeus Stevens as a highly moral but audacious and impudent politician, a man not afraid to bully a rival into submission or change course for the cause of equality. Along with Day-Lewis, both Field and Jones should be getting more accolades this award season.<br/><br/>Historically speaking, it is safe to state that Lincoln was a great man. Cinematically speaking, it is also safe to say that Spielberg's Lincoln is a great film. GRADE: A-<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com <br/><br/>NOTE: Liam Neeson was originally slated to play the 16th president but pulled out due to conflicts in his schedule. It would have been an entirely different film but he could have easily slam dunked the Confederacy singlehandedly. Abe Lincoln...action hero?"

Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln -- among MANY other great actors and actresses.

"agrogan_99","9","4","12","25 November 2012"," An almost perfect film honoring one of America's greatest
","Summary: An almost perfect film honoring one of America's greatest Steven Spielberg is one of those directors, who can almost perfect anything he touches. Well, not always perfect it, but make it good enough. So, now he touches upon the 16th president of America. Does he succeed? Well, if that 9 out of 10 didn't tell you, I think he did.<br/><br/>Every actor in this movie is perfect. While their lines aren't always great and are often cheesy and forced at points, each actor was a superb casting choice. Daniel Day-Lewis alone seals this film with his high, reedy voice, and tired and lined face. Tommy Lee Jones's character was amusing, as was each member of the House representatives.<br/><br/>That's not to say all of them were, as I said, eased into the movie with little force. For example, Jeremy Strong's performance as William Seward rather annoying, and even some of Lincoln's outbursts I found unnecessary and long. But probably the biggest unnecessary plot point was Gordon-Levitt's performance as Robert Lincoln, which never influenced the main story and just lead to character development we already know is there.<br/><br/>It's fairly hard to explain. In historical films, the attempt to use character development and classic clichés doesn't always work. Now, you could say it is pleasant to really experience the drama of a tragic and legendary event by buttering up the victim to the point of the victim seeming like a messiah. But here's the problem here: Lincoln already is a messiah-like figure, so trying to make his personal struggles more dramatic seems forced in some areas.<br/><br/>But that's only in some areas because there are incredibly powerful moments in the film involving historical drama. The scene where Lincoln and his wife argue about his son's decision was quite strong, and led to a touching and relevant scene. And of course, the scene where Lincoln finally passes the 13th Amendment is brilliant.<br/><br/>Finally, let's talk about the special effects and lighting. I applaud Spielberg for his use of lighting, making the happy moments especially bright and the depressing or intense ones particularly dark. Also, I believe Day-Lewis didn't stand that tall; if he did, well then I congratulate a very good effect. Dead bodies and makeup are also given props.<br/><br/>So, that's Lincoln. I'm surprised people actually found this boring, for it's a very over-the-top film. The struggles presented in the film, despite the sidetracking, mirror daily life events. Maybe you aren't abolishing slavery, but persuasion, trickery, grudges, inconveniences, and tragedy can be present. Combine these common struggles with a iconic figure in history, and you have a heartfelt and clever story that does sometime stray from the main ideas it presents.<br/><br/>So, like I said, if some plot points didn't go anywhere, this would be a flawless film. Kudos, Steve."
"ashcrda","10","4","12","25 November 2012"," An American History few know or understand
","If you consider the film ""Lincoln"" boring then you care nothing for the true history of the United States and have no insight into the profound suffering for the sake of the 13th Amendment that continued well into the 1960's. How can one claim to love one's fellow American's and proclaim this film boring? President Lincoln's great moral crusade was demeaned and audaciously rejected by the people. It required two more amendments, the 14th and the 15th, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to finally pry loose a small bit of freedom for the slaves. As late as 1930 black men were lynched in Marion, IN in an effort to continue keeping the former slaves under the control of white people. How many billions of dollars have been wasted by this country for the sake of keeping the freed slaves in a condition as close to slavery as society could dream up? How many men died unnecessarily during WWII because bigots would not let black men, who were willing, fight for their country? W.E.B. DuBois said ""the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line."" His words rang true throughout the century, sage advice for the leaders of our country, words that, if heeded, would have made us an even mightier nation than we have been. But if DuBois had tried to get a sandwich at a café he would have literally risked his life.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is not boring, it is the truth. If you intend to be a useful citizen of the United States it is necessary to see the attitudes present during the struggle for the 13th Amendment, understanding that the fiercest of them lasted well past one hundred years after Lincoln's great moral crusade. Anyone viewing the movie should sit in rapt attention, understanding finally, how deeply and permanently the color line has affected the growth and success of the United States."
"ftbear","5","3","8","21 January 2013"," Politically correct revisionist version of Lincoln's life.
","It is clear that the majority of reviewers of this film either know nothing of Abraham Lincoln's real character, or they are simply ""going along"" with the politically correct crowd and kissing Spielberg's uh, feet.<br/><br/>Spielberg set a new low in 2001 by refusing to allow ABC television to show his film ""Saving Private Ryan"" unless they left in the ""F"" word. ABC stayed true to its policy of ""as much as we can get away with"" and caved in. Spielberg laughed all the way to the bank. We now ""enjoy"" the ripple effects of that landmark decision with a level of filth on television that was undreamed of only a few years ago. You can't open Pandora's Box ""just a little.""<br/><br/>The fact that the majority agreed with ABC is meaningless. The citizen ""majority"" threw the Christian's to the lions and pushed the Jews into the ovens. Observers of history will know that falling in step with the majority opinion on matters of morality and the value of human life often leads to self destruction as well as the destruction of others. Standing with the crowd can mean you're standing for nothing.<br/><br/>Spielberg has done it again by putting filth into the mouth of Abraham Lincoln. Letters written by Lincoln to some of his Generals, instructing them not to use foul language in front of their men, are matters of public record. Even so, Spielberg has his version of Mr. Lincoln saying things that simply were not a part of his character, personal morality, or vocabulary. So, if we accept Spielberg's version, we must believe that Mr. Lincoln was a hypocrite who condemned the use of vulgarity by his general's but freely practiced it himself. I think not.<br/><br/>As he did with Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg simply forcing his version of ""reality"" on the viewing public. People that have a clean vocabulary are mocked and ridiculed today as being ""prudes"" or worse. So, Spielberg has to bring Lincoln down to the P C level with the lie that he was ""a regular guy"" who used foul language to express himself. It's simply not true.<br/><br/>Spielberg is also good at promoting his personal point of view by omitting the truth. Lincoln was a devoutly religious man. No, he was not a churchgoer. But, he was a bone marrow deep believer in God. Again, his personal reading of the Bible, his prayer life, and his practicing and promoting Christian values are matters of record. His letters, his speeches, his government documents and even the Emancipation Proclamation itself contain open and easily recognizable references to Lincoln's personal belief in God. His faith was the foundation of his life and the guide for his actions; privately as well as in conducting his duties as President. Spielberg would have you believe otherwise; so he simply left that part out.<br/><br/>Lincoln writes in the third from the last paragraph in the Emancipation Proclamation: ""And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God."" Hardly the words of the P C non-believer that Spielberg presents us with.<br/><br/>People that believe in God are not ""politically correct"" today. So, for the most part Lincoln's spiritual life is simply ignored. Spielberg gives us a false representation of Lincoln caused by the simple omission of truth.<br/><br/>Spielberg's movie making formula has become quite popular. He is not the only producer that follows this form. That is, to use a film to ""propagandize"" the viewers with the producers own politically correct version of an otherwise truthful subject.<br/><br/>After donating one million dollars to Obama, Spielberg shared a private showing of ""Lincoln"" with the President in the white house. Nothing more needs to be said about Mr. Spielberg's political agenda. This film serves that agenda.<br/><br/>So how does Hollywood ""schmooze"" the public into accepting their propaganda? (Spielberg is not alone in doing this.) They treat the making of a movie like the making of a pot of beef stew. That is, most of the ingredients are familiar and acceptable to all of us. Then the ""chef"" adds his or her own ""secret spices"" to give it the personalized flavor that they want us to swallow. With the film Lincoln, most of the ingredients are in fact good ""beef and potatoes."" That is, the main portions of the film are ""true."" But, truth serves only as a ""base"" to be personally ""flavored"" with Spielberg's P C point of view. When the news media does it that's called putting their ""spin"" on the subject. The recipe works well.<br/><br/>As the reviews here indicate, most movie goers have eaten a big bowl of Spielberg's stew with no notice at all of the ""personal ingredients"" he has flavored it with. Hence, all the high praise for his ""great"" movie making skills and the production of yet another Spielberg classic. You bet. Have another glass of Spielberg-Aid.<br/><br/>At the beginning of Richard Attenborough's great film ""Gandhi"" he says ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man."" Mr. Attenborough remained faithful to those ideals.<br/><br/>Spielberg has given us a good deal of seemingly accurate information about Mr. Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation itself. But, he has not been ""faithful in spirit to the record."" This film is not even close to portraying ""the heart of the man."" Rather than seeing something of the real beauty in Lincoln's heart, we see a distortion warped by the politically correct agenda in Spielberg's heart.<br/><br/>Mr. Lincoln deserves better. So do we."

It felt very contrived on every level from the badly dressed sets using the wrong flag to the shriveled, drained body parts that are still dripping blood and tears that never make it out of the eyes.

","I have admired Daniel-Day Lewis since he blew the world away in My Left Foot. He blows me away as much here, probably for the fact that he looks and acts so much like the Abraham Lincoln every true American knows from photos, writings, and historical accounts. He is an amazing actor with a way to just absorb away until all there is left is another person. I felt as I watched him that I was in the room with Abraham Lincoln-- not a caricature or an impersonation, but the man himself. Even more impressive as an Irishman! The only foreigner to do as well with an American persona was the great Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara!<br/><br/>Obviously the performance is Oscar material but I must say as much as I love his work that the Best Actor Award should go to Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in Les Mis. That was just a plain tour-de-force! (how appropriately French)<br/><br/>I remember Sally Field since she was The Flying Nun!!! So she is like an old friend to me. I admire her earthiness and ability to also dissolve away and let the character live through her.<br/><br/>I would highly suggest a review of your Civil War history before watching this movie, because unless you understand the politics you will be bored quickly, no matter how good the acting and replication of dialogue, costumes and scenery pertinent to a period piece! I still give it 10 stars even though the dialogue and storyline was hard for someone not versed in American political history to understand!<br/><br/>BRAVO DANIEL!"

","If only. That's what I felt leaving the theater, if only Lincoln had lived, if only we had a Lincoln during Vietnam, if only we had a Lincoln today. We always live in remarkable times, only most of the time we have unremarkable men and women leading us. So much deserved praise has been written about this film - the acting, the music, the cinematography, the costumes, the screenplay, and more - that I thought I'd mention another aspect of Spielberg's genius, his talent for directing fine actors in small roles. In most film with big stars, the camera stays on the central character and everyone else is window dressing, little more than moving mannequins. In ""Lincoln"", in scenes crowded with actors, the performances are choreographed brilliantly. Take Bruce McGill's portrayal of Edwin Stanton. He captures Stanton perfectly, and does it mostly with facial expressions and his posture. Hawkes' Latham. Nelson's Schell. McRobbie's Pendleton. I wish there was a special Oscar given to Spielberg for ensemble direction, only Scorsese rivals him. Day-Lewis, Obama, and Lincoln at the time of the passage of the 13th amendment, are all basically the same age. I imagine this gives Day-Lewis great insight into Lincoln's commanding presence, his mastery of men. He plays Lincoln, he is playing Obama, he is also playing himself."
"Robert_duder","6","3","8","14 December 2012"," Thoroughly mis-represented and fell way short of my expectations
","I love Steven Spielberg and I was so incredibly thrilled when I heard of this film. This was probably one of my most anticipated films of the year. I drove three hours to see the movie. I figured there was no way I could miss on this one. I was wrong. I read a few reviews on IMDb and they all voiced many of the same complaints I had. The biggest perhaps is that Lincoln...has very little to do with Lincoln. This film is in actuality 99% about the passing of the 13th Amendment. Lincoln is a player in all of it but this isn't about his life. In fact it barely scratches the surface of a blink in his presidency. How dare they call a film Lincoln and then not even bother to show him giving the Gettysburg address? They barely touch the assassination and the film is nearly entirely devoted to everyone in the House of Representatives arguing and the lobbyists trying to get the votes. Parts of it are interesting, uplifting and emotional but it runs far too long to only be about the passing of this bill. Was it a big moment in history? Of course. Should they have called it Lincoln? No. Some decent performances, and the few emotional moments save the film from being utter crap. If not for the fact that Spielberg was behind the camera and some strong lead performers this would have tanked completely.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant as Lincoln. What a shame the film wasn't actually about him because he would have been heralded for his brilliant performance. He gives this subtle, quiet determination to Lincoln and shows just how incredibly charismatic Lincoln was. He is just awesome in the role. Sally Field is good as Mary Todd Lincoln. She's good but she's not great. I am a big fan of hers but I felt like she really overplayed the role. I mean considering what this movie is about her character should have been a very tiny part of the big picture. Instead they awkwardly force her manic, bi-polar personality into the story which makes her overly dramatic and makes her outburst scenes seem almost silly. Her and Day-Lewis do have good chemistry and they play well off of each other. Again, if the film had actually been about Lincoln she could have been amazing. David Strathairn is very good as Lincoln's chief of staff and adviser William Seward. He holds his own against Day-Lewis and the two of them together are excellent. Tommy Lee Jones gives a stand out performance as the outspoken Thaddeus Stevens. It's not a big role but his performance makes you take notice. James Spader also plays a top notch role as lobbyist Bilbo. He just has this distinct charisma in the role and he's fun to watch. The supporting cast is a virtual whose who of Hollywood A and B listers. You will recognize nearly every person on screen. Joseph Gordon Levitt has a very small, almost insignificant role as Robert Lincoln. He gets one good scene with Day-Lewis and is otherwise underused. Jackie Earle Haley, Bruce McGill and Jared Harris are a few of the supporting actors who give solid performances.<br/><br/>As you can tell I was not disappointed with the cast. Everyone was in place, everyone did well and there were some truly amazing performances. I suppose my biggest problem with the film is simply how disappointed I was that this wasn't about Lincoln's life. I expected a sweeping epic bio-pic about his life or at the very least his presidency and it was not even close. It shouldn't surprise me much that critics love this film and it is sweeping the awards categories. They are strictly picking this on the merit of heavyweights like Spielberg, Day-Lewis, Lee Jones etc. and the fact that it is a powerful moment in American history. The truth of the matter is that the mainstream public will be disappointed in this film. Some will be caught in the hype created by the critics who rave about it but when you peel back the layers of this film you will certainly see how misrepresented it was and how different it could have been. 6/10"

People thought that this was an odd project for him to take on, but those people have obviously not seen ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", or ""War Horse"". All of these films are fantastic and evoke tremendous amounts of emotion that few movies can. ""Lincoln"" however tops almost all of Spielberg's past films. Even though I am not American, I still felt tremendous pride that a human being like that did so much and sacrificed so much just to get the American people to accept all of their fellow man. I have never felt such respect for a human being before in my life, and Daniel-Day-Lewis plays Abraham Lincoln perfectly, and it would be a crime not to award him the Best Actor award at the Oscars. This is the film of the year in my opinion and shows just how much Spielberg and his collaborators know what they are doing and their films just get better and better.

It made us want to research the characters in the film. Thaddeus Stevens and Lydia Smith were two I had to check into after the movie. I don't usually go for Tommy Lee Jones in movies, but he was pretty good in this one. Even characters like Grant were very well done. I hope Lincoln was the man portrayed in this movie. Its a film that makes you proud to be an American."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","3","8","5 December 2012"," Brilliant Script and Casting make this one of the year's best movies
","Hollywood powerhouse Steven Spielberg takes on the Civil War and the biopic in his latest movie, Lincoln. But this is not the traditional biopic, as Spielberg primarily focuses on one month of Abraham Lincoln's life- January 1865- when the legendary President employed his cunning political skills to procure enough votes in the House of Representatives to pass a Constitutional Amendment that would ban slavery in the United States. <br/><br/>Lincoln's intelligent and humorous script by Tony Kushner and its outstanding, Oscar worthy performances enraptures the viewer. Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, and Tommy Lee Jones deliver those rare performances that make you feel like historic figures have come back from the dead. Daniel Day Lewis delivers an intimate yet distant performance as Abraham Lincoln, bringing the sixteenth President's jovial and melancholic qualities to life. A great deal of credit must also go to Tony Kushner for writing a historically accurate Lincoln. Historians are still debating Lincoln's personal beliefs, such as his racial attitudes and the morality of his leadership decisions. Kushner's treatment of Lincoln reflects these uncertainties. For example, in conversations about the future of African Americans in America, Lincoln's true feelings about black people are not always easy to decipher, except for his opposition to slavery. Some might find this to be a dodge or a cheat on behalf of Tony Kushner, but I think it is brilliant. The film should not answer this question. <br/><br/>Of course, it is clear that Kushner and Spielberg admire Lincoln very much, and in this respect the film is biased. But they are not afraid to show that Abraham Lincoln was a complex man full of contradictions. He is a man of high morals, but he is willing to sacrifice those morals for the greater good. Lincoln unabashedly dives into the dark side of politics by resorting to bribery and patronage to turn partisan Democrats to his side. He enlists the aid of W.N. Bilbo (played by James Spader) to procure votes from the few Democrats who might betray their party. One of the highlights of the movie is Spielberg's surprisingly funny portrayal of the corruption of nineteenth century politics. <br/><br/>Drawing inspiration from Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography of Lincoln, Team of Rivals, the movie significantly focuses on Lincoln's relationship with his cabinet and Congress. Lincoln's determination to pass the Thirteenth Amendment when there was still the prospect of a negotiated peace with the South drives his Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) mad. But the most significant supporting political character is Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), who pushes the Thirteenth Amendment through the House of Representatives. Jones perfectly captures the personality of the staunch Radical Republican, so assured of the righteousness of his convictions that he takes down his opponents on the debate floor with confidence and zeal. Stevens is one of those rare honest politicians that we love to root for, made all the more identifiable to us for his modern views on race. My favorite scene in the film was when he delivers the Thirteenth Amendment to his housekeeper/girlfriend, a woman of mixed race. The sight of these two elderly people sharing this moment together was very touching.<br/><br/>When the film isn't focusing on politics, the President struggles to find time for his wife Mary and his sons Robert and Tad just when they need him the most. Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) and Robert (Joseph Gordon Levitt) are both under immense pressure. Robert feels he must enlist or else he won't measure up to his peers, but his mother is crushed by the death of her son Willie and cannot bear the possibility of losing another boy. Sally Field brings just the right combination of likability and wretchedness for the role. <br/><br/>Lincoln is flawed in several important respects, however. The film's limited time frame does not allow Spielberg to capture the complicated history behind the Thirteenth Amendment. As Historian Eric Foner and other critics have noted, emancipation amendments were championed by radical abolitionists before Lincoln. Secondly, the film ignores an important aspect of emancipation- the slaves themselves. The fugitive slaves who ran to Union lines forced the North to adopt a more immediate emancipation policy in the first place, and Spielberg's decision to focus only on Lincoln demonstrates that people are still more enamored with the big names of history than average people. Of course, it is true that a biopic cannot focus on every aspect of emancipation, but African Americans could have been placed on a more equal footing without diverting too much attention from Lincoln. <br/><br/>The film is also based on the false premise that the South would have blocked an anti-slavery Amendment if they were readmitted into the Union, making it imperative for Lincoln to pass it before the end of the war. But in reality, Lincoln would have called a special session of Congress in March 1865 and passed the Amendment quite easily, since the Republican victors in the previous election would have taken their seats in the House. The Southern states would not have been able to block the Amendment anyway, as they would not have been granted any influence in Congress. <br/><br/>I think this movie is too aware of the Lincoln legend for its own good. There are a few too many moments where people stare at Lincoln with wide eyed admiration. Spielberg indulges in his typical overt manipulations a bit too much. Viewers might also be challenged by Lincoln's long monologues. Even I had trouble sitting through them.<br/><br/>Still, Lincoln is easily the best Civil War movie since Glory. Spielberg does for nineteenth century politics what Edward Zwick did for Civil War battles, and if I haven't made it clear enough by now, I LOVE this cast. If you like Civil War history and great performances, you must see this film."

","This spectacular film shows the struggles president Lincoln faces as he combats his cabinet and other radical republicans in his effort to emancipate slavery. As the likelihood of his success dwindles down, Lincoln needs to find a way to allow him to gain votes in Congress while at the same time, representing his well-loved status he holds with the people of the north. This film is very moving in how personal slavery becomes to Lincoln and how he makes it his number one priority. As people close to him began to turn away, Lincoln stood strong with is beliefs and did whatever he could to get the 13th amendment passed while remaining calm and composed. This film made me really think about the question ""What if Lincoln had failed to get the 13th amendment passed?"""
"dutchs-1","8","3","8","27 November 2012"," Spielberg Just Doesn't Know How to End a Movie
","I often say Tchaikovsky wrote ""how the hell do I land this thing?"" symphonies. The final notes sound, then, nope, a long coda that finally sputters out from exhaustion. Spielberg makes movies that way. Schindler's list concluded with the surviving Schindler Jews placing memorials on Schindler's grave. Okay, that was kind of neat. In AI, the robot boy finds the Blue Fairy and gazes at her until his batteries run out. Fade to black. Perfect. A very 2001 enigmatic ending. Nope. We get another 15 minutes of him being revived in the distant future. In Lincoln, we see him walking out the door on the way to Ford's Theater. Fade to black. Cut! CUT! Oh no, nononoNONO. We know he got shot! Why tack it on to the end? Just fade from him walking out the door into his second inaugural speech. Why does he feel he has to tack a superfluous ending onto his movies? <br/><br/>It's good. Daniel Day Lewis owns the role now. Tommy Lee Jones is dryly humorous as abolitionist activist Thaddeus Stevens. He spends the whole film in a wig that would embarrass Donald Trump, then when we see him last, we find out why he wears it. The plot deals with the maneuvering to get the Thirteenth Amendment banning slavery through Congress. But it has about as much punch as the vote to fund a new dam or declare a day honoring whatever. The pro-slavery characters are portrayed as slimy, but they might as well be crooked car dealers. The film needs something more to drive home the horror of slavery and the moral imperative for ending it."
"The_Film_Cricket","10","3","8","19 November 2012"," A great movie about the political intrigue of the 19th century.
","There is a moment deep into Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" that probably reveals more about the person of Abraham Lincoln than anything else that we could ever know about the man. He asks a young telegraph operator ""Do you think we are fitted to the times we are born to?"" It is a deep and difficult question that speaks, most aptly, to Lincoln himself. Within the structural time-line of American History, Abraham Lincoln's tenure upon this earth ended half a generation before voices and images began to be captured by recording devices. His voice is lost to history and that, in effect, cements his legend because not knowing how he sounded or how he moved leaves us to interpret Lincoln any way we want. We idolize him because we cannot humanize his flaws with our senses.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" tries to capture the essence of a man whose legacy is known to every American school child, not as a five dollar bill but as a man who has become the American ideal, a person who was born in poverty, self-educated, desperately honest, a deep thinker who was motivated by moral right. He was also as shrewd and crafty as any politician in American history. Apart from that, the movie also tries to find the very human essence that pulled Lincoln through a civil war, the end of slavery and personal tragedies that strained his marriage.<br/><br/>As played, in a beautiful performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, Abraham Lincoln is a calm, soft-spoken man with a whispering voice and a distinct Kentucky accent. He is a charmer who is always telling stories (which irritates his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton). He is a deep thinker who sees the issue of slavery as a moral crusade. Around him are men who join in his crusade, but at his side is his wife Mary (Sally Field) who has shared with him a personal tragedy. Some time ago they lost their young son to typhoid fever, and Mary's very essence reveals the emotional weight of a mother bereft of her child, but also a 19th century society women who is forced to put away the pain and smile while greeting guests for a social occasion. When the eldest son Robert expresses interest in joining the Union Army it leads to a conflict between the Lincolns that reveals some very surprising truths about their relationship.<br/><br/>Lincoln takes place in the last four months of the president's life, a time that saw the end of the war and the difficult passage the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery. Most of the movie deals with the inner-working of the 19th century political system and how the men who surrounded Lincoln helped him in his crusade to free the slaves and pull the Union back together. Lincoln is willing to fight tooth and claw to get the amendment passed while many of those around him believe that it was an exercise in madness. Those in opposition questioned what abolishment would mean to the social strata – what would Blacks want next? Voting rights? Integration? Interracial marriage? The Presidency? Lincoln's view was that slavery was immoral and that abolishing slavery would also mean pulling the financial structure out from under the Confederacy. He asks the impossible. He wants to abolish slavery, end the war and still be able to pull the southern states back into the union.<br/><br/>What is most surprising is that Lincoln is seen in this film not simply as humble and honest but as a shrewd politician who believed that the passage of the Amendment was so important that he was willing to bribe, threaten and make deals and promises to get the right number of votes. The passage of the amendment is helped along by his Secretary of State, William Seward (David Straithairn) and by Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) the Representative from Pennsylvania. Stevens is seen as a gruff old codger who manages to wheel and deal with the power of his temperament. He is a hard-nosed abolitionist whose agenda against slavery extends to more than just politics and legislation. The critical job of getting Democrats to change their vote rests in the hands of three wheeler dealers (James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson) who break the rules to get the job done.<br/><br/>The details of the period are perfectly captured not just in the clothes or the sets but in the cinematography by Spielberg's frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski who establishes the interiors of the White House, not as a temple, but as a dimly lit trading house where deals are made and broken. We don't feel as if we are on a set, but in a real time and place. There are shadows and dark images here that suggest more than the screenplay is saying.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the film is beautifully written. Many times, the film seems to halt just so Lincoln can have a personal aside. In most cases that would be a fault, but here it is so well written and acted that it becomes mesmerizing. Most surprising is that Lincoln's Gettysburg address is spoken by young soldiers fresh from the battlefield who have memorized it. It is begun by two white soldiers and finished by another who is black. It is a deeply moving moment.<br/><br/>In the weeks leading up to the film's release a question has come up: Is the film historically accurate? Only a historian would know for sure, but in all fairness, who cares? This is not a documentary, it is drama and if it stretches facts for dramatic effect but keeps the basic structure of the historical outcome, it hardly matters. What does matter is that Spielberg has created a wonderfully moving drama about the greatest struggle that our country ever faced, and how the time of that struggle was fitted with a man whose intelligence and moral convictions kept this country from perishing from the Earth."

","Watching Lincoln, I couldn't help thinking we were in present times. Technology and history move forward, but man's emotions don't. Somehow Lincoln manages to rally a disparate group of self-centred congressman to a higher purpose. I guess that is the key, a leader who sees above all the noise of human affairs to a much better state of being and has the energy and character to effect this goal. Spielberg could not have chosen a better cast, all the actors were totally believable. What comes across for me is how difficult it is to rally people to a cause, how difficult great leadership is. Lincoln had drive, a sense of humour and a belief that he could succeed. Needless to say his family paid a terrible price. The world needs great leaders!"
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","7","3","8","18 November 2012"," One Man's Show
","While a more fitting title would be THE 13TH AMENDMENT, as the film primarily deals with the passing of the law to free the slaves, LINCOLN focuses on a President who had the determination to see something through – all the way through till the end.<br/><br/>It may take a few minutes to adhere to the voice and stature Daniel Day Lewis provides our 16th President. Sounding like a decrepit small town barber suffering a cold, Lincoln walks with a jangly gait – at times seeming too frail to hold himself uptight – and that stove top hat looks about to envelop his wiry frame. But he does a fantastic job telling parable/stories that serve to convince friends and opponents alike While his feeble manner is explained aptly buy one character, noting how the Civil War, and being responsible for the deaths therein, can age a man considerably. It's how the (perhaps two-time) Oscar winning actor combines the lethargic physicality to the freshly heartfelt monologues that makes the story work.<br/><br/>So while Lincoln fares so capably on his own, his family serves as a distraction. Enter wife Mary Todd and their two sons: the youngest, Tad, stares wide-eyed at slaves in photographs like a modern kid leafs through baseball cards; while guilt-ridden law student Todd (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), witnessing the tragedy of war, yearns to join the military.<br/><br/>Sally Field's moody Mary Todd Lincoln is a woman torn between mental instability and blunt honesty – she's Abe's personal cross to bear but he wears it with pride. During certain arguments you'd expect him to shout, ""To the moon, Mary"" before giving her a forgiving peck on the cheek. Thus each family member lends menial significance – but in a story based on ""The Political Genius"" of Lincoln as opposed to his personal life, perhaps this was intentional.<br/><br/>On the political side, standing out past the others (even David Strathairn's patient sidekick William Seward), Tommy Lee Jones plays up the scruffy hero in Thaddeus Stevens. The veteran actor knows how to successfully turn a craggy grouch into an endearing angel. His scenes often feel like an introduction to his own spin off sequel – through his timeworn eyes the dream of freedom seems the most important.<br/><br/>Although director Steven Spielberg does a fine job moving along a film set within conference rooms and that big important Courthouse, he's a bit too manipulative in the process: you'll know exactly who to root for, who to throw tomatoes at, and who to cheer with once the historic outcome is revealed.<br/><br/>While politically, the outspoken liberal filmmaker, in lionizing a famous Republican, plays a delicate balancing act: the stuffy conservatives are as much a bulwark/hindrance as the stubborn democrats (while a barrage of ""g-damns"" flow like pellets at a shooting gallery). All in all, Lincoln himself seems more an Independent, painfully triangulating through an uphill climb: How he and his colleagues sway votes by creative manipulation is entertainingly fun.<br/><br/>So with all the elaborate sets, beautiful costumes, rich cinematography, and talented character actors (including Hal Holbrook, James Spader, and Bruce McGill, who hilariously complains how Lincoln wins every argument), Daniel Day Lewis triumphs with his stories alone. For a colorful performer who can be too stagey in other projects, he portrays Lincoln so genuinely subtle and meaningfully soft-spoken, the audience has no choice but to hang onto every... single... word.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","After nearly two decades in production limbo, the story of Abraham Lincoln arrives on the big screen courtesy of Steven Spielberg. Lincoln— which could more appropriately be titled The 13th Amendment—shows the trials surmounted by our sixteenth president in ratifying the Constitution in order to abolish slavery. Though the film's focus is chiefly on this particular amendment's passage, the scope of the film is nothing short of magnificent. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis personifies Lincoln, characterizing him as an imposing figure in stature, but a jovial, soft-spoken leader of an adoring public. Day-Lewis has garnered recent prestige for his grand, ominous roles as Bill the Butcher in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, and Daniel Plainview in Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood (Best Actor Nomination, and Win respectively). However, as the titular character in Lincoln, Day-Lewis's methods are subtle and reserved. He does not impose himself upon each scene, but rather observes silently: speaking only when articulation is necessary or a humorous anecdote will rouse his compatriots. Though he expresses less grandeur in this portrayal than previous outings, Day-Lewis is as brilliant playing Abraham Lincoln as ever.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis isn't the only one whose acting abilities should be commemorated though. Lincoln is brimming with astonishing character actors. Tommy Lee Jones embodies Thaddeus Stevens, a stringent abolitionist, and vicious tongued debater. Jones is sure to reap numerous award nominations for his fierce portrayal of the reluctant Stevens. James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Hawkes play a trio of seedy contractors charged with persuading several Democrats to adopt Mr. Lincoln's cause. The scenes containing this trio are thick with humor, and contain some of the best dialogue in the film. If nothing else comes of this terrific film besides Spader increasing his presence in cinema, it will not be a waste. David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, and Jackie Earl Haley showcase their impressive talents in this film. Lee Pace (Pushing Daisies) is superbly wretched as Fernando Wood, one of the main opponents to the anti-slavery legislation. Another actor certain to receive some acclaim for her depiction is Sally Field. Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, the depressed, yet supportive, wife of Lincoln. She shares a few overwrought scenes with Day-Lewis that remind the audience that Abraham is not the only Lincoln being studied here. A particular scene shows her matching barbs with Jones, and winning out against his imposing character. Lincoln is filled with actors whose names may slip your mind presently, but you are sure to recognize in future films.<br/><br/>Spielberg creates an intriguing political drama with Lincoln. He paints a delicate portrait of Abraham Lincoln, but also manages to infuse the film with a pounding political momentum. The script for Lincoln was crafted by Tony Kushner (Angels in America, Munich). Kushner and Spielberg create Congressional hearings that are fascinating to behold. Some of the greatest scenes in this film are void of Lincoln, and concern the fiery debates between members of the House of Representatives. It's as if someone has switched to an exciting presentation of C-SPAN, or an actual meeting of the Houses of Parliament. <br/><br/>Lincoln does have a few brief lifeless moments: the beginning is ridiculously heavy-handed, and the closing segments feel entirely unnecessary. Seated near me during the showing was a young boy; when the credits close after Lincoln has been declared dead, he declared: ""I knew he was going to get shot in the head."" I couldn't help but chuckle. He highlighted an interesting point though: It feels excessive to include Lincoln's demise. We are all aware of his death, and it isn't handled in an interesting way, but rather shoehorned in at the close. It's almost as though Spielberg, or a studio executive, figured audiences wouldn't know about one of the most infamous assassinations in history. Although for a brief few minutes in the beginning of this film, as well as the close, there is a dry spell; the majority of Lincoln thrives.<br/><br/>http://flickermotion.blogspot.com"

","Title, movie posters, and trailers for this movie are deceptive. You will leave the theater without learning much if anything about either Lincoln or Civil War. It was entertaining, but entertainment only was not what I was looking for in this political/war drama. More appropriate name for this smoothie should be- 13th Amendment. Even then, film is biased and inaccurate. You can easily find and read about many factual errors. I understand, you can't make factual movie about specific Egyptian pharaoh, but Lincoln lived 150 years ago, and we didn't use hieroglyphs then. 8 out of 10 rating? Not even close. For such movie to be 8+ would need to be much more then just entertaining. I would give it a 6, eventually 7 for great acting, cinematography, costume design if misleading methods were not used to get you to buy theater tickets.

"Deckard-16","10","5","17","21 November 2012"," Memorial worthy movie making.
","Steven Spielberg, America's greatest movie director, has made over 20 feature films. He's had a few misses, but mostly he's been very good to excellent & he's had a few outright classics & ""Lincoln"" is one of those classics.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of those very few hype-proof performances. No matter how much praise you have heard about his portrayal of the 16th President Of The United States you are still not quite prepared for it (reminding me of Heath Ledger's work as ""The Joker"" in this regard). His Lincoln is very lived in, worn but not worn down, looking like the weight of the nation is upon his shoulders & looking strong enough to bear up under it. He's funny, warm, calculating, coarse, smarter than most, but wise enough to know he doesn't have all the answers. He has a code that will not break. Day-Lewis's turns in a performances that rates alongside Pacino's Michael Corleone & Ledger's villainous turn as my all-time favorite.<br/><br/>However there are other great performances in this film, most notably by Tommy Lee Jones as a crucial ally to get the 13th Amendment passed during the final weeks of Lincoln's life that the film covers. Every key actor in this prodigious cast has a moment or two that stuns.<br/><br/>None of this is possible without a script by Tony Kushner that may even surpass Day-Lewis's work. It features more than a few speeches written with a love of the language--of English & the English of that time-- rarely heard anywhere in America & they are often thrillingly delivered by a cast up to the challenge. It is also rich in irony (I don't think the Democratic Party during this period would've won the ""black vote"".) <br/><br/>So all that Spielberg has to do is yell ""Action!"" & ""Cut!"". Of course it's not that simple. The great gift of a great director is to know how much guidance is needed to get the job done. There are no obvious Spielberg moments here (like another Kushner scripted movie, ""Munich"", that he directed), but you know that you're in the hands of a cinematic master.<br/><br/>John Williams' score is subtle. Michael Kahn's cutting let the moments breathe without ever dragging out too long. Janusz Kaminski has said that he merely let his cinematography ""serve the story"", but he's being a bit too humble. His shots are a stunning parade of shadows & natural light. They don't call attention themselves but, nevertheless, it is a beautiful movie to watch. The set design, costumes, art direction & everything else are Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" isn't a movie you ""should"" see (although you should) it is a movie you'll want to see. Despite it lack of physical action it is every bit as entertaining as ""Argo"" & ""The Dark Knight Rises""."
"DJRMewzique","10","5","17","20 November 2012"," The Oscar race has just begun, but it's already all but over.
","It may be premature to say, but I think the Oscar race is already over.<br/><br/>""Lincoln,"" Steven Spielberg's latest opus which focuses on the final four months of Abraham Lincoln's life, the focal point being his greatest accomplishment, the abolishment of slavery in the United States in January of 1865 and the end of the Civil War, has every element imaginable to render it possibly unbeatable for a slew of Golden statuettes.<br/><br/>First and foremost, there is Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. His transformation into America's 16th President is, for lack of a better word, uncanny. I would not for an instant lay claim to knowing very much about the Lincoln in any way, shape or form, but Lewis embodies every detail that I feel I have ever learned about this iconic political figure. From his speech patterns to his physicality, I could not imagine a better performance than what Lewis displays in every single frame he is in. Already a two-time Oscar winner (""My Left Foot"" in 1990, ""There Will be Blood"" in 2008), winning Best Actor in 2013 is truly his award to lose.<br/><br/>And then there is the rest of the cast, each one possibly looking at some recognition by the Academy.<br/><br/>Sally Field, also a two-time Oscar winner for ""Norma Rae"" in 1980 and again in 1984 for ""Places in the Heart"" could very well be looking at her third nomination and possibly a win as Mary Todd Lincoln. Her performance as the emotionally tortured and completely supportive wife is absolutely magnificent.<br/><br/>Then there are the supporting players....the members of the House, those who helped Lincoln gain voted to pass the 13th amendment. Tommy Lee Jones, almost guaranteed his fourth Oscar nomination (he won in 1994 for ""The Fugitive""), brings his A game as Thaddeus Stevens, one of the most outspoken Republicans from the area who fought tooth and nail for equality and was one of the greatest proponents of the 13th Amendment. David Strathairn, also an Oscar nominee (""Good Night and Good Luck"") as William Seward, the Secretary of State who initially fought against the amendment while remaining loyal to his Commander in Chief. Golden Globe nominee James Spader as W.N Bilbo who was sent out to recruit Democratic votes by any means possible. Oscar nominee Hal Holbrook (""Into the Wild"") as Preston Blair, one of Lincoln's faithful advisors. Oscar nominee Jackie Earle Haley (""Little Children"") as Alexander Stevens, the vice president to the Confederacy. Even Golden Globe and Emmy nominee Lee Pace, best known for his role in ""Pushing Daisies"" offers an exceptional turn as Fernando Wood, one of the staunchest opponents to the slavery amendment. Even smaller roles by the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lincoln's son and Gloria Reuben as one of Lincoln's attendants are more than worthy of noting and praise. John Hawkes is also featured in this film in an excellent performance, but he will be overlooked here, as he will already be looking at a Best Actor nomination for his role in ""The Sessions."" Then there is the writing. Written by the magnificent Tony Kushner, who is not only yet another Oscar nominee for his script for ""Munich"" but who also wrote the near-perfect Emmy-winning ""Angels in America,"" Kushner's script plays out in brilliant fashion, not only capturing the language and the feel of the era, but also manages to capture the audience while giving what could have been a long-winded history lesson thanks to a perfect blend of drama and humour.<br/><br/>All this under the direction of Spielberg (do I bother mentioning his Oscars, too?)? ""Lincoln"" is nothing short of a historical masterpiece.<br/><br/>It was fascinating to watch the debate on slavery wage on in the House, hearing people's fear that the abolishment of slavery could lead to blacks and women being able to vote and, oh the horror, possibly enter politics! And to think that all this was done by those crazy, ""radical"" Republicans. Who would have thought that a hundred years later, the tables would have completely turned on these parties with the Democrats being the party who fights for equality and the mere thought of denying women and ANY minority the right to vote would be ludicrous.<br/><br/>And yet, the needless debate of allowing two men or two women to marry rages on in the United States.<br/><br/>Let's hope Mr. Obama may find a way to be a modern-day Lincoln."

Steven Spielberg captured the climax of Lincoln's presidency with a mind set of diligence, patience, and an attention to detail. From the picture to the costumes, from the setting to the actors, all collectively added to the story of the Civil War and how it changed America ever since.

","Rarely do I quit watching a movie, but I couldn't sit through this murky, confused saga, so perhaps my review is unfair. However, credibility was shot from the get-go, as Lincoln bids heartwarmingly paternal individual farewells to departing soldiers, whilst they proceed to recite from memory his 'Fourscore' address as they march off into the distance. It was Spielberg at his treacliest.<br/><br/>After that, you get art direction so dark you can barely see what's going on. Why is everything in silhouette, even in daylight? It's all black on black. Finally, the script is awful. Conversations pop out of nowhere, there's no flow whatever. People tell random stories or deliver impassioned soliloquies with no lead up or character identification, so you don't know or care what they're trying to say. Lincoln gets to tell some of the most boring and inappropriate anecdotes of all, to the point where other characters leave the room. <br/><br/>He shares deeply private philosophical thoughts with random clerks, servants, in fact he even talks to the floor, and there's condescending background music to let you know when you should be moved with admiration. If these were genuine quotes, I'd like to see the footnotes. A particularly egregious gem is when he quotes Euclid on like things self-evidently being equal to each other. This from an ancient culture completely based on slavery! It was math, Abe, not social science! The language is formal and dated, as it should be. Now, I have no problem following Shakespeare: but characters in Shakespeare speak from the story line. <br/><br/>And finally, there's that terrible wig. Poor Tommy Lee Jones! I looked up pictures of Thaddeus Stevens and no, he did not look that dopey. I gave up on this dreary film after the Euclid story."

","I was ambivalent about seeing this picture but friends recommended it. Some people do like it, including the friend I went with.<br/><br/>Good points - Daniel Day Lewis. Cinematography. Both excellent.<br/><br/>Bad points - The story is weak and uninteresting, and fails to hold your attention. As it's a Hollywood movie you know it's not going to be historically reliable so you can't enjoy it as a documentary either.<br/><br/>Suggested Preparation - after long enough I settled down and enjoyed a couple of podcasts on my phone. You can't easily walk out if you're with someone. You can put your phone into airplane mode and still play recordings. Dim or obscure the phone screen and use earphones that don't leak so you won't distract others. The film is quite noisy at times but if you close your eyes you'll be less distracted. You'll probably want a couple of hours ready to listen to. The time will then pass quite pleasantly and if you've gone on a 2-4-1 you've not wasted too much money and hopefully like me your friend will have enjoyed the film."
"jdneukom","2","3","9","12 February 2013"," Spielberg Secedes From Making Good Movies
","This is the most awful movie I've seen in recent memory. How Spielberg can take arguably the most interesting time in American political history with one of the finest actors in modern cinema (Daniel Day-Lewis) and turn it into a 2.5 hour epic slog of pure drivel is completely beyond me. Don't directors generally try to take a seemingly UNINTERESTING TOPIC and make it INTERESTING? Why the opposite tact taken here? I nearly didn't make it through. After making it 10 minutes in (and again at 30 min), I nearly called it a night--it was THAT awful--and I NEVER walk out on movies. Sadly enough, it was curiosity about if anything worthwhile would EVER happen in the movie which drove me to sit through this rubbish pile.<br/><br/>Let me clarify. I love documentaries. I love history. I love long, thought-provoking, detailed movies. I love clever dialogue. This, however, was effective at none of those things. Daniel Day-Lewis in full make-up passed for a beautiful Lincoln, but his mannerisms and demeanor (even his audio I'd have to think) were SO far off! Here, we don't see this dour, weighty Abe Lincoln that history has handed down to us after sorting through a time that added years of emotional baggage to his figure. We see a moaning Abe Lincoln shouting his wife down, horsing around with his kids while his signature legislation is being voted on, BS'ing with his cabinet like they're trying to plan a bake sale, and basically being a giant bully (I wouldn't have been surprised at all for him to yank down his trousers and tell the VP of the Confederacy that his was bigger). I got zero sense of any gravity of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES and the specter that cast over EVERYTHING going on in 1865. I'm sorry, but this movie stripped Lincoln of anything emotional or recognizable and turned a self-educated, country lawyer turned commander-in-chief into a calculating robot or a jester. There was nothing Lincoln about this. And to what end? To hint that Honest Abe wasn't so honest after all? Well, then sue him for cutting down the cherry tree...OK, sorry for mixing presidents in mid sentence.<br/><br/>As for some of the other things, I'd have to cite terribly inconsistent performances by Sally Field (Mary Todd Lincoln) and Tommy Lee Jones (Rep. Thaddeus Stevens). I don't get the obligatory Mary Lincoln was a crazy scene, when she's shown as nothing but a competent, but grieving mother throughout. And, Jones' depiction of Stevens was a hot gumbo of Scott Baio, Bilbo Baggins, and Gary Senise's Lieutenant Dan from Forrest Gump all in one. Woo! Joseph Gordon-Levitt absolutely did not need to be in this film at all in his role, save for amassing more ""star power."" In fact, the ONLY performance I enjoyed throughout was James Spader's W. N. Bilbo. And in fact, the only story thread I found mildly interesting was the wrangling of votes. Turning this many A-List actors into such a muddled and poor pile of claptrap hints at what a gigantic waste of life the direction and screenplay were here.<br/><br/>As for the only things making this somewhat watchable (save for my curiosity about how Spielberg could actually turn out such a dreadful movie and possibly think it didn't suck) included the fact that this was a rare look at the political theater that was really driving the War. Many films opt for depicting life at the battle front (GLORY comes to mind) and it's easy to have a bunch of romance/violence to drive a movie like that forward. So, kudos for ATTEMPTING a Civil War story with NO WAR in it save for the opening scene.<br/><br/>Also, one more redeeming feature was the make-up and costume design relevant to the time period. If this wins an Oscar for that, I wouldn't be surprised. However, even my support of that is qualified due to truly awful and non-1865-vernacular dialogue. I mean, didn't people speak differently back in 1865? They seemed to be speaking in present-day English and interacting with present-day formalities, albeit more dramatically.<br/><br/>And, for Lincoln to go in and introduce himself to a soldier named ""Kevin""? WTF? Isn't it more likely he'd find a Horace or a Zeckeriah in that day? Was his domestic servant's name Beyonce too? Maybe his porter's name was will i am or Fallout Boy? Likely not....Poor attention to detail in this regard.<br/><br/>TL;DR: This movie is simply awful. I went in with an open mind, but try as I might to find redeeming qualities, even those qualities are riddled with flaws of their own. This movie was far too long, far too boring, with far too little light shed on the historical aspects of that period. It was a bad movie AND a bad documentary AND a bad play all rolled in one. It did nothing well (ok, costumes were great) and this is shocking when combining the most famous living director, an ensemble cast of Oscar winners, and one of the most interesting periods in American history. In a word, this was shameful."

Sriding through the movie,hands behind his back and head bowed ,Lincoln tosses out over written profundities like confetti. This is not a portrait of a man but a Hollywood piece of folklore,as impenetrable as granite. Lewis may be in for an Oscar, but this is history reduced to a cornball. The sad truth is that Spielberg and his writer Tony Kushner are offering a phoney, sanitised version of Lincoln.

I'm really trying to understand what makes people praise this movie. My theory is that everybody is just so satisfied that slavery got abolished. Abe is a national hero - you gotta love everything about him. I'm really sick of these issue related praise and awards. Only because slavery got abolished in this movie, it doesn't mean, it's a masterpiece and the fact that he plays Abrahaman Lincoln doesn't mean DDL gave an amazing performance.<br/><br/>Seriously, what is all the DDL hype about? NOBODY knows how Abraham Lincoln talked, walked, moved and laughed but everybody is so amazed by this pale performance. I'm not saying it was bad. It might be good if Lincoln really was a guy who was above it all and didn't really give a damn about all the concerns his team had. But if so, it is a freaking easy role play and that's all I got here. Not much acting involved, just a tall guy moving around slowly and talking without any temper. There were only 2 scenes where he actually had to show some emotions and one of them (He slapping his son) was just horrible wooden and disqualifies him for any award (especially when there is a Denzel Washington in Flight in consideration].<br/><br/>P.S.

"Kane20","10","3","9","28 November 2012"," Review - Lincoln
","Anybody searching for a biography film about Abraham Lincoln's full life and ""major"" events will have to look elsewhere. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln (which I saw in the theater over Thanksgiving weekend) has a brief battle scene at the beginning, and a few scenes near the end taking place around (and during) the time of the assassination, but most of the film (and the meat of the film) is confined to January 1865, and is about Lincoln striving to get the 13th amendment to the Constitution (banning slavery) passed.<br/><br/>If you ask me, limiting the time frame of the film like this was a very smart decision. Showing all the major events of his life is not necessary; this film, with its shorter time frame, does a great job at it. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it does a better job of it than a traditional bio-pic would. The film doesn't really want to show his life, but rather paint a true portrait of the man himself; who was he, really, as a person, president, etc.? The film is restricted mostly (although not entirely) to offices, courtrooms, Capitol chambers, and places like that, but it still does a very good job at portraying the time period, visually, politically, and in every other way, and with good detail. In fact, while I generally don't find politics interesting or appealing, I actually found the political aspect of this film somewhat interesting.<br/><br/>Another major factor that makes the film work so well is the acting. Daniel Day-Lewis put on an excellent performance as Abraham Lincoln; deep, dynamic, powerful, and very convincing. In fact, his performance is what I liked best about the entire film. He didn't just portray Lincoln, he practically was Lincoln. He was pretty convincing in terms of physical appearance, but more importantly, he was almost perfect in terms of his character (in other words, becoming Lincoln). In short, Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln is great and unforgettable, and completely Oscar-worthy (and he may actually win). All of the other actors (including Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) also put their best foot forward and deliver very good and convincing performances. They slip right into and bring out their characters.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has delivered again. He has directed several films that I like, some of them nostalgic favorites. He has made many different types of films, all across the genre spectrum; sci-fi, adventure, war, fantasy, history, serious films, fun films, etc etc. He's not perfect, and not all of his films are good, but, again, a lot of them are, and Lincoln is one such film, and one in which he again proves that he can make just about any type of film. In my opinion it's still not as good as some of his best films, like Schindler's List and War Horse, but it's still great. And once again, Spielberg has teamed up with score composer John Williams. Williams's score isn't anywhere near as good or memorable as a lot of his previous works, but it's still pretty good and it fits the film very well.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is not perfect, and it actually only scraped a full 10 from me by a little bit. It could have been better in some aspects, even some of its better aspects, but it's still a great film. Great performances, great historical portrayal, etc. In fact, if I had to label one film about Lincoln the definitive film about him, it would probably this one. The film brought me closer to the real-life figure of Lincoln than I have ever been before (literature, pictures, documentaries, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up being used in school and college history courses.<br/><br/>Lincoln is compelling and moving, and a film truly worthy of its title; it paints an excellent portrait of America's sixteenth president.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** (out of ****)<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/"
"socrates99","9","3","9","18 November 2012"," Never had a convincing image of the living Lincoln in my head until now
","I moved to central Illinois, where Lincoln road the judicial circuit, almost 30 years ago. I've been to most of the historical sites and read a fair amount of what Lincoln wrote over the years, much of it impressive and intriguing. What could the real man have been like? Few of those currently in prominence here have even faintly suggest his greatness, so living here is really of little help. The climate is pleasant though we still occasionally experience some mighty winter storms. Crops grow very well but the land is too flat for most. Could any of that have contributed to his unique character?<br/><br/>I've always had trouble imagining Lincoln making his rounds, taking my neighbor's ancestors as clients. I was sure I would die never knowing anything like the truth; for some reason we would forever be denied knowing the man.<br/><br/>I was wrong. Daniel Day-Lewis has somehow managed to bring the man to life, even for me, an admirer with a demanding attitude about any such portrayal. To be sure, he doesn't do it alone. Spielberg has recreated the period with economy and true artistry. The script is unflinchingly intelligent and many of the supporting actors give some of their best performances, ever. It's not perfect, however. I could quibble about two of Spielberg's (I presume) choices in particular, but those perceived errors pale in comparison to the whole of his achievement. It's magnificent and deserving of far more patronage than indicated by its gross receipts.<br/><br/>At its end I was amazed at how quickly it all went by; this is not that easy a movie to absorb. And yet I never once felt it getting tedious or overbearing. In short, I would have to concede, there's no question this is the year's best movie."

Its incredibly slow moving, complicated and was one of the most boring films I have ever seen.. I did make it to the end but I nearly turned it off early as it was so boring.

Sally Field was undeniably wooden in the first few scenes but by the end she had clearly grown to understand and portray the complicated and unstable Mary. Casting must have taken a great deal of time to fit the parts so well to the actors.<br/><br/>What must be noted is that this movie does not claim to be a documentary, fortunately, for the script is nowhere even close to actual events - especially the dramatic dialog. It is as though a screenplay were found about the struggle to pass the thirteenth amendment, and someone said; 'Hey, lets make it a movie about Abraham Lincoln. The viewpoint is another in the seemingly endless self-loathing Tinseltown propaganda expenditures of how evil White Men are. The most galling departure from history is the portrayal of the Republicans as being more resistant than always-loving Democrats to abolition. In fact, Democrats fought the thirteenth amendment to the end and were the majority vote to kill it."
"verna-a","3","2","5","11 January 2014"," Considerable imposition on the viewing public
","I have a moderate interest in Lincoln as a man, and a mild interest in American political history and the abolition of slavery. This film considerably overdraws the credit account in all respects. It's long drawn-out and tedious.It couldn't command my interest on a continuous basis, but I left it running and watched segments in the hope it would improve. Its subject matter is political machinations, so it's nitty-gritty dialogue mostly, interspersed uneasily with pompous little set- pieces eg the opening sequences where two black soldiers address Lincoln. I'm sorry, I find this stuff not authentic, and boringly didactic to boot. As someone who really understood film-making said, ""If you've got a message, use Western Union"". Visually the film is also heavy-handed and manipulative. There is low lighting in nearly every scene, obviously to throw craggy faces and profiles into dramatic relief. Some directors eg John Ford use this technique to great effect, but not on..and on..and on.. I nearly introduced this film review by describing this film as a sci-fi effort about what humanity does when the sun goes out! Altogether it's pretty painful, oh dear."

I don't know how deep understanding one has to have of the history of the American Civil War to really appreciate this movie. None of us did. This movie missed an opportunity to educate us about it. The basic problem is the number of characters. No introductions, no nothing. Just shallow talking heads delivering difficult-to-understand lines of dialogue. Occasionally Daniel Day Lewis as tells a story or a joke. Occasionally Tommy Lee Jones says something. Why he says stuff and who he's even playing, is beyond me.

Boothe is not shown nor is the assassination just some dude standing in front of a closed certain telling people the President has been shot & Lincolns kid reacting. The scene is like only a few seconds. Even at his death bed Now he belongs to the ages was rushed. I wanted to feel for Lincoln & his family. I did not. They left out quite a few actual events. Sally Field doesn't even really resemble Mary much because mary was plump, temperamental & Manic depressive more so than whats shown. Great Actors, terrible script & handling of things."
"MoodyB84","8","2","5","23 March 2013"," Involving and compelling. There is so much more than just Day-Lewis' excellent performance.
","Firstly, let's face it, anything that can be said about Daniel Day- Lewis' performance has already been said. The fact is that he is one of the best actors of his generation, if not of all time and his tendency to be a picky bugger when it comes to taking film roles is to be respected, well maybe apart from Nine. His performance here is as committed as ever and utterly spellbinding, you do genuinely believe you are almost watching a reincarnation of the man himself on screen. One of the things that enhance the power of this performance is the very effective depiction of Abraham Lincoln's physicality. He was 6'4"" tall with long arms and legs, and Spielberg uses this to great effect as in every scene he always towers over everyone as I am sure he would have done in real life. It is also credit to Spielberg for not simply depicting Abraham Lincoln as a saint, his weaknesses and moments of self doubt are portrayed just as clearly as those that made him such a great man.<br/><br/>I came into this film with a couple of fears: Firstly all I seemed to hear was praise for Day-Lewis' performance but very little else mentioned, a great performance does not necessarily make a great film. Also, for someone who knows only the basics of this period of American history like me, would this leave the film feeling alienating? Well, the film does actually boast a huge array of well known names in its cast such as Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Sally Field, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, John Hawkes, Jackie Earle Haley among others. Despite the nature of this being a character driven narrative, all these characters get their own individual moments to shine and all the actors excel with excellent performances. It is a credit to Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner that Day-Lewis does not appear in every scene, leaving other very important characters in this moment in history the chance to shine and for us the viewer to be made aware of their own very important individual contributions. It is fair to say that the dialogue is littered with constant wannabe Oscar speeches, however given the moment in history and the talent saying it, this is forgivable. <br/><br/>That was the first fear resolved, now the second: There is no denying that Lincoln is effort and you are certainly required to concentrate especially as it is dialogue heavy throughout which certainly includes plenty of political jargon. However, after 15 or 20 minutes when it is established who everyone is, what their place is and what everyone is trying to achieve; Lincoln is a deeply involving and thoroughly gripping political drama. Abraham Lincoln's desperate bid to persuade people of great power to vote with him is gripping and compelling, even though we all know what the end result will be. What also adds to the involvement of the drama is that Spielberg lets characters that face a real life conflict when deciding how to vote have the screen time for us to genuinely understand their conflict and not just portray them as simply against Lincoln therefore bad people. This is a film which treats the viewers as intelligent people who clearly understand that in such a dramatic situation, things are never simple or straight forward. Anyone expecting the dramatic visual set pieces of previous Spielberg period dramas will be disappointed as this is a dialogue heavy film. It is definitely true that is not the most cinematic of films, and perhaps feels a little more like a television drama at times, but this is not a criticism as though the film is dialogue heavy, the narrative for me moved along at a quick pace as there is always something happening. Even John Williams' usually dominant music is very minimal.<br/><br/>It is not until the final 20 minutes after the result we all know happens that Lincoln feels cinematic with sweeping music and dramatic outdoor scenes. However, for me it this last 20 minutes that severely lets this film down and does not need to be there at all, almost undoing all the good work in the preceding two hours. This may well sound like I am criticising Spielberg for basically being Spielberg, but the final 20 minutes is overblown cinematic schmaltz and sentimentality which is completely different from the dialogue heavy tone of the previous two hours. For me, this just did not need to be there, this is a film about a moment in history and one man paid a major contribution to that, it is not an arse licking biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life. However these last twenty minutes feel exactly like that. I of course do not want to spoil the ending, but we all know what happens afterwards to the President once peace is agreed and how it is portrayed here is embarrassingly cheesy, adding nothing to the compelling political drama we have just spent two hours watching. It almost feels like we have forgotten that we are watching a Spielberg film, The Beard has realised this and decided to remind us, and maybe trying to please the academy to make it a hat trick at the same time, very disappointing. <br/><br/>For the first two hours Lincoln is a compelling and deeply involving political drama about an extremely important moment in history. An amazing central performance is also complimented by excellent supporting performances. It does require effort but this is amply rewarded, especially if you leave twenty minutes before the end."
"menemshaman-496-447522","10","2","5","17 March 2013"," A film for the ages
","I was totally pulled into Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln. He was Abraham Lincoln! One of the finest performances I have ever witnessed on film. Creating a film faithful to a historical figure is a challenge. Spielberg met that challenge and then some. All the actors complemented one another in very believable ways. Sally Field was very convincing as Mary Todd Lincoln and added depth to the film. Historical accuracy in a film such as this is an absolute must because everyone knows about Abraham Lincoln. This is the place where Daniel Day-Lewis' performance shines. I used to think Raymond Massey's version was accurate, but next to Day-Lewis there is absolutely no comparison.Though I believe Lincoln should have won the Best Picture Oscar, the politics surrounding the balloting of the Academy of Arts And Sciences prevented that from happening. This film should be required viewing for every high school student in America. This film made our 16th President come alive. As a great, great, great nephew of William H. Seward, I came away from this movie with a great sense of pride in his support and friendship for America's greatest President."
"leplatypus","4","2","5","24 February 2013"," Bye bye slavery, welcome segregation and wage earning (screen)
","Before the screening: I'm deeply intrigued by this Spielberg's choice. For 40 years, Spielberg was the filmmaker of the simple people and avoided to deal face to face with politics. Today, he forgets his trademark and gives us a biopic of a past Potus. If he proves always his versatility, he takes a big risk to deliver an insipid propaganda. <br/><br/>Why? Just because citizens aren't dumb to believe that a politic can be a savior. History shows that liberty and human rights was the result of people revolutions. They were conquered from governments not given by them. In addition, a true democracy is a government of the people for the people by the people. So dealing with slavery, my expectations are to see if Lincoln has ever met slaves, talked with them or if his decision is just ""brilliant"" philosophy indoors with members of his cabinet?<br/><br/>After the screening: In a way, i got what i expected, that is to say? a weak Spielberg movie but it's not after all propaganda. <br/><br/>Sure Lincoln is put under the spotlight with his determination to get this abolitionist amendment. But, on the other hand, Spielberg opens the underbelly of American democracy and its guts are rather cancerous: it wasn't idealism, enlightenment and beautiful convictions (in the spirit of ""Amistad"" trial) that win the vote but party discipline and corruption of opponents! Furthermore, it's not real equality that's pursued but the simplest formal equality! Thus, calling Lincoln a hero, a myth is maybe a bit overrated because this kind of democracy is a bit shameful! <br/><br/>In movie term, the production is rather good. Without electricity and happening in winter, the picture is incredibly dark, gloomy and grey. Spielberg still manages to deliver some great scenes: his opening stunned me as it was exactly what I wanted: the chief talking with the people, hearing their needs and dreams! His final appearance is dramatically shot also (his black servant is chilled to see him leaving). To see black people taking seats for the vote was also very symbolic. Maybe the best character was the one played by Tommy Lee Jones and Spielberg is facetious with his final shot!<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie sinks some more my illusions because it's a depiction of a make believe democracy. In a way, Marx was right: this American civil war was indeed a bourgeoisie revolution that Capitalism needed to erase the previous slavery world and build another era of exploitation. <br/><br/>As in ""Munich"", Spielberg intends to awake our citizens' consciousness and don't take our old democracy for granted! For example, in France, my country, slavery was abolished in 1848 by a simple government decreed (no vote!) that was in addition totally hypocrite (colonies were exempted!). Today, we hear talks about constitutional reform but our President shelves the project because he thinks that he doesn't have the special majority in parliament to vote it! Go see ""Lincoln"" dude and you'll know then what to do!"

","I just don't get all the negativity, people say it's boring, people say it's a weak plot but i don't see that. Yes most of the film is just dialogue but it's intriguing and it really kept my attention for the whole 150 minutes. Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant as always and i feel they should just give him the Oscar now and put every other nominee out of their misery. I thought the cast was great, Tommy Lee Jones portrayed Thaddeus Stevens to a tee and Sally Field just put it all on the line with her emotions, her and Day-Lewis have great chemistry. Loved the elements of comedy, some people may not see it but when i was at the cinema it good a few good laughs. The dialogue is what really made this movie come alive, every conversation and back-and-forth was interesting and gave a lot of exposition without it seeming stupid and i like that they didn't just go lazy and really dumb it down for people. The people who complain about this movie obviously just didn't get it and didn't like it because there was no huge LOTR style battle. Overall, excellent movie 10/10"
"hardwayjuice","4","2","5","7 February 2013"," If only Spielberg was unavailable...
","Let me preface my review by outing myself as someone fairly indifferent to movies. I have no 'film studies' qualifications to my name, and my list of personal favourites would leave you pitying my very soul.<br/><br/>The casting is fine, Day Lewis is believable, history hasn't been messed around with too much. Dialogue is pretty realistic for its time, though Mary Todd sounds like a textbook passage of her life events being read out in the first person. So far, so good. It's just that Spielberg nearly ruins all this goodwill by being blunt old Spielberg.<br/><br/>Case in point: Duh, if it wasn't for the fact Lincoln was always shown in front of a fire/source of light (them dirty down low Confederates always in the half-light) that when he died he cross-faded into a lit candle, and that he conveniently stood in a Christ pose in the tag ending, I'd a thunk he was the baddie. Thanks for clearing that up in a subtle manner, Stevie Boy. Have your own directorial bag of tricks by all means, themes that run though your movie/entire canon of work, but for heaven's sake, I think the audience of a film called Lincoln, about the 13th Amendment no less, might have an inkling of who the protagonist is? Perhaps there's a pocket of the deep south on a 148-year tape delay? Need you be so doltishly blunt in stating the bleedin' obvious?<br/><br/>As has been mentioned in reviews here already, a biopic of Lincoln's early life would have been so much better than this narrowly-time-framed yet still drawn-out portrayal of one of the most pivotal moments in the history of the USA. Provided, of course, Mr Spielberg is not involved. His 'directorial genius' really brought this picture down a good 4 stars.<br/><br/>Now to wash out my mind with a proper movie, like Airplane!"

I wasn't expecting much more than another great film to round off a great trilogy of films I went to see in the theater; Skyfall, The Hobbit and finally Lincoln. So, I was never doubting it would be great, but I was not prepared for feast of spectacle and wonder I was served. This film blew me away. The acting, the writing, the classic cinematic feel of Steven Spielberg's work... all of it came together into a brew of excellence. <br/><br/>For those less well informed about the plot of this film, the film revolves around the 16th, and arguably the greatest president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) and the passage of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the US. It chronicles Lincoln's second inauguration to his assassination on Good Friday, 1865. Spielberg and the writer, Tony Kushner, handle this period piece with complete mastery. The visuals and dialogue are bare inches away from perfection, with clear blue skies and clear grand speeches making their home turf within.<br/><br/>The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as the titular role was astounding. He brought a new level of empathy to the character, something that was all but discarded by other portrayals. Most see Lincoln as a stern, deep-voiced man with a strong presence, but a kind heart underneath his quite hard exterior. However, this was not the case with Lincoln; he was a kind man, with a high, nasal voice which seemed to call to the people and their spirits. His voice, although some people complained about it due to their ill-informed view of Lincoln, perfectly fitted the role, and was handled incomparably by Day-Lewis. I'm sure ol' Abe himself would have been proud of this performance.<br/><br/>Despite my gushing over Lincoln, I enjoyed the other performances too. I was particularly moved by Tommy Lee Jones' performance as Thaddeus Stevens. He conveys Steven's motives well and carries the weight of a complex character with relative ease and total confidence. Sally Field's performance as the complicated Mary Todd Lincoln was inspired and handled with a delicate touch, along with meticulous attention towards the chemistry with Day-Lewis' Lincoln. In all honesty, all of the roles in this film were handled with, at the very least, total competence.<br/><br/>A common complaint I hear about the film is how 'painfully long' it is. To say this mere 150 minute film is 'long' is to destroy the fabric of this genre. This kind of film needs time to flesh out the characters as well as the issues floating around them at this time. If this film is too long, then why is Doctor Zhivago, a film of similar caliber in my opinion, praised by the cinephiles while they shun this one to the sidelines? This film deserves to be watched with ears and eyes to attention. This film deserves recognition and praise. This film deserves to be loved."

","Lincoln is based on a little interesting scenario despite the importance of the historical events.<br/><br/>The movie, in fact more of a (bad) filmed play, consists of a series of scenes each one more boring than the other: the staging is completely dull with heavy, stifling, little dynamic confined scenes where the ultra verbose dialogues seem endless, as the movie itself which lasts almost 2h30. A few scenes here and there arouse a certain interest but are not enough to increase the global quality of this feature.<br/><br/>As for the actors, everyone does the job more or less, but no one is exceptional and certainly not Daniel Day-Lewis whose overrated performance isn't closely worthy of an Oscar."

","I won't have any spoilers in this review. Most people who would seek out this film probably know Abraham Lincoln's biography.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film but could not. I was expecting a film about Lincoln. I got a very slow moving and preachy account of how the 13th amendment became law.<br/><br/>I genuinely cannot believe that anyone could spend this much money and talent on a drama about Abraham Lincoln, not have any drama, and get away with it. Apparently the only thing that concerned anyone in the 1860's worldwide, was American slavery.<br/><br/>This could and should have been much better.<br/><br/>This is my first review here and I won't be taken seriously, but do not be taken in, when this turgid, dumb as swamp water, single issue film wins awards. <br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is to ""John Adams"" as ""The Phantom Menace"" is to ""The Empire Strikes Back"".

"lheureuxjuliana","10","2","5","22 January 2013"," Exceptional Performances - Lincoln and the Abolition of Slavery are Distinctly American
","There's a scene in the movie Lincoln where Daniel Day-Lewis, as the 16th US President, asks his communication aides about their perspective on leadership. ""Do you think we choose the times into which we are born?,"" Daniel Day-Lewis, as Abraham Lincoln, asks two young workers in the telegraph office. This question, of course, makes Abraham Lincoln a compelling leader and an American character for the ages. He is as important to American history as Julius Ceasar is to the story of Rome. As we know, in retrospect, someone in the course of American history had to tackle the evil bondage of slavery and the scourge it continues to imprint on our nation's legacy. Lincoln's biography presents an unlikely leader, but his vision of a nation free of slavery was relentless. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. It goes without saying, this Spielberg movie is a classic. There are no embellishments whatsoever in the plot. Lincoln was driven to pass the 13th Amendment before the South surrendered, regardless of what it cost which, of course, was the root cause of his violent death by gun violence at Ford's Theater in Washington DC on April 15, 1865. It would be ideal if this movie were required viewing for all Americans; but, especially for politicians, who face the challenging decisions of their times. Other exceptional performances include Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln. My hope is for ""Lincoln"" to take its place as one of the greatest American movies ever made."

","Knowing that story quite well, and as a fan of Spielberg, I was expecting a lot from this film, that I saw after all the buzz following Academy Awards nominations. As many critics have reviewed, this is essentially a dialogue movie, people are talking all the time, sometimes in law babble. So the film is more like a theatre play, with very few scenes of real action. But it's a masterpiece in its genre. There are so much great performances in it that's impossible to signal them all. At least, I was moved a lot by many scenes with George Yeaman (Michael Stuhlbarg), Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), Molly Lincoln (Sally Field), Robert Lincoln (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ulysses S. Grant (Jared Harris), Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben), W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), and of course, Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones). Not surprisingly: in all the scenes these great actors are sharing the screen with Daniel Day-Lewis. After seeing him in so many films where he was great, it seems almost impossible that this actor may get better. He is and it's a joy to watch. You must see this film, a history lesson."

","I had to go through some articles regarding the 13th Amendment and the Civil War in order to get along with this movie. But seriously, this movie was worth the trouble I took. The last months of the great legend has been narrated so beautifully, that I realized why Steven Spielberg will always remain a great director. This is hes best biopic since Schindler's List. The movie follows a steady pace, and has a really good turn at every edge of it.<br/><br/>In such a beautifully shot movie,. the next amazing factor is none other Daniel Day Lewis. But he is never their i the movie, it is all about Lincoln. Robert DeNiro was the next who baffled me. Great casting indeed.<br/><br/>To feel the depth of a man who could change the world single handed, and to hold the key role in abolishing slavery, man, I respected the legend, and the crew behind this awesome movie. A great watch indeed."
"brent_or","8","2","5","14 January 2013"," Very Nicely Done
","The best thing about LINCOLN, to me, is how personal and intimate it is. Other than a few seconds at the very start, there are no active Civil War battles on screen, and the film does not try to be an exhaustive all-encompassing biography of Abraham Lincoln. Rather, it stays mostly in Washington D.C. and focuses on a brief, crucial block of time in history. I rather like Daniel Day-Lewis' performance; it's very nuanced, like the film built around it. The rest of the cast is quite good. I even enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones, whose manner I often find a bit exhausting. Very good screenplay and dialog. Some perfectly pitched and placed moments of humor. Personally, had I been the director, I would have ended it before the assassination, for a more even and fluid artistic conclusion. However, it's hard to fault much about this film. Spielberg adds yet another big line to his resume."
"williwaw","9","2","5","14 January 2013"," Daniel Day Lewis Towering Performance
","Daniel Day Lewis becomes Abraham Lincoln in this splendid film directed by Steven Spielberg. A sure Oscar winner! <br/><br/>I liked Tommy Lee Jones in this film but feel Sally Field was too old and perhaps too arch as Mary Todd Lincoln. The role of Mary Todd Lincoln has intrigued actresses over the years and one of the roles that Bette Davis tried to get Jack Warner to film while Bette was the Star of the Warner Bros. Lot. Ms. Field is 66 but looks ages younger but the fact is that Mary Todd Lincoln was 15 years younger than Lincoln himself. I have read that Spielberg and Day-Lewis were concerned over this fact but Field's persistence paid off and was cast. Who else could have done Mary Todd Lincoln? <br/><br/>This film has splendid art direction and is a credit to the studios that filmed this epic: 20th Century Fox, Dreamworks and Disney. Years ago one studio would be listed as producer but in today's fragmented Hollywood co productions are the norm.<br/><br/>PS One day I would like to see Daniel Day Lewis and Meryl Streep in a movie, what an acting duel that would be"

","I thought the movie Lincoln was very interesting and accurate, not to mention quite artistically done. I felt it captured Lincoln's internal struggles quite well; it seemed to create a more accurate depiction of Lincoln's personality so he still appeared human, rather than heroified as he often does in textbooks and documentary films. I liked the way Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed Lincoln as being very softspoken and eccentric, yet commanding respect without the need to raise his voice, as well as showing Lincoln's sensitivity when having conversations with his wife. The jokes thrown here and there into the film also accurately brought out Lincoln's humorous side, and helped lighten the tone of the time period. Overall, I think this film challenges our precepts of Lincoln and his presidency to see it from a more raw, close-up point of view, and shows the importance of the passing of the 13th Amendment."

","My AP US History Class and AP Language class actually went to see this movie today as a ""field study."" heh, heh, great use of class time.<br/><br/>Honestly, since Lincoln was based on Lincoln's real life, the movie's events were already spoiled for me from my History class. That still didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. <br/><br/>In Lincoln, nearly everything is extraordinary. Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner made a great story (with a couple rough edges). They described Lincoln not just as the great speaker we learned in history, but also described his personal life during the first year of his second term as well. Daniel-Day Lewis' performance was spellbinding and realistic; he actually seemed like Lincoln: a scared man, a political activist, and a powerful speaker. Not only was Lewis great, but all the other actors were wonderful too. Sets and clothes are made to accurately represent the 19th century. People talked in a modern way (not with the Northern dialect and Southern drawl), but that was unavoidable. Humor is placed throughout the movie to both make the viewers laugh and alleviate the wartime Union from the uneasiness of the war. There are clever scenes too. (Spoiler ahead!) In the end of the movie, a top hatted man is in a theater watching a play, 4 days after the war ends. A man walks up (sounds familiar?), and tension builds, but it is actually the theater Lincoln's son is in, not Lincoln! Speeches and overexcited Congressmen debating over the 13th amendment abolishing slavery add to the movie's realism and tension too, culminating in a miraculous movie.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some rough edges (which is why I only gave it 8 out of 10). Some film shots are hashed and transitions unclear. The ending was sped up; Sherman's march to sea only lasted about a few seconds, and the war was over in about 2 minutes. Lincoln's assassination was also quick and unseen, but since this movie is about Lincoln's life, it makes sense that the events Lincoln did not experience were not covered in great detail- the movie was not just about the civil war.<br/><br/>During the movie, some of classmates actually cried and gripped their seats. There was no reason why they shouldn't. This may be a biography of Lincoln and filled with political facts and oddities from the 19th century, but realistic characters and brilliant political struggles fill the movie with tension and emotion. Ordinary political events build up to be just as thrilling and engaging as an action packed war scene. The insight into Lincoln's life was deep, understandable, accurate, and emotional, transforming a tedious biography into an engaging piece of art. Honestly, Lincoln is one of my favorite movies from this year. The movie may be long, reaching about 2 and a half hours, but it certainly was worth the time."

","I give it a 9.2; I expected 10+.<br/><br/>How did I feel watching one part of the movie: uncomfortable How else am I supposed to feel in a racially mixed audience when actors are portraying people who are protesting that the 13th amendment would ""N word-ize"" the union?<br/><br/>One really gets a feel for the Lincoln family. Beautifully done.<br/><br/>The movie didn't move me emotionally at all. The biggest emotional reaction I had to the movie was feeling uncomfortable being Black in a racially mixed audience, in a red state, in a county that voted red.<br/><br/>The movie didn't have an epic treatment and, as a result, did not call for or get an epic soundtrack.<br/><br/>It didn't pull on heart strings or on the neurons of the brain.<br/><br/>The scene where Mary Lincoln was in her most beautiful dress seemed like an obligatory scene for a costume award nomination. The scene had strong writing but we didn't have the context of why she was in her biggest and most beautiful dress.<br/><br/>Why the movie didn't have any scenes in B&W is a good question I'd like to ask--if I ask so myself. More than 10 years ago, I was at 5th Avenue and 93rd or 94th Street in Manhattan where the International Center of Photography used to be. I saw B&W photos of Abraham Lincoln. Why Spielberg didn't choose some artistic rendering in that direction makes me wonder. He did show Daguerreotypes (I believe) of slaves for sale.<br/><br/>Maybe I grew up on Gandhi, Amadeus, The Last King of Scotland, The Last Emperor, Elizabeth, All the King's Men (hardly no comparison but still more engaging). Lincoln did not fill both of my hands--it didn't give me a handful. It was chosen to be that way. Case in point, unlike All the King's Men where Sean Penn has to give an emotional speech, we get in Lincoln a speech that is two sentences: I'm here to raise the flag. Let's raise the flag. (Lincoln is finished reading from the paper taken out of his hat.)<br/><br/>Was it a movie for a 9th grade American History class?"
"riethc","8","2","5","10 December 2012"," Two-and-a-half hours is simply not enough!
","After reading a few reviews of ""Lincoln"" - some of which heap unequivocal praise on the film, others which seem to come straight from the keyboards of indignant secessionists - the one major flaw of the film, I believe, has been overlooked. The main flaw with Lincoln isn't its ""wordiness"" (one could have the same obtuse critique of any of Shakespeare's plays put to film), or its hero-worship of a historical figure (Lincoln's portrayed more as a conduit for high ideals rather than himself superhuman) - instead its weakness comes from one of its strengths: the sheer number of fascinating characters which lack in character development.<br/><br/>The screen time of every character besides Lincoln (Daniel D. Lewis) and, arguably, Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) are abbreviated to the point where one senses a great void in the ""Lincoln"" back-story. While the inability to flush out these numerous characters in a single movie's running time is understandable, I still feel slightly cheated by meeting so many appealing characters yet learning so very little about them. (Interesting to note, this is a flaw which stems from the greatness of the supporting actors performances and an otherwise excellent plot.) <br/><br/>In comparison to similar works about an American President and their most intimate circles, particularly the recent ""The Kennedys"" mini-series, ""Lincoln"" does not expand much on most of the characters central to its story. With ""The Kennedys"" series, all of the main characters are flushed out to the point that a viewer may start to think of oneself as a fly-on-the-wall in the actual Kennedy household(s). Granted, ""The Kennedys"" is about six hours running time and made for TV which leaves me only to wonder if such a running time is necessary to do a film like ""Lincoln"" complete justice. (Personally, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a very extended director's cut.) <br/><br/>Yet, perhaps, this void in ""Lincoln""'s back-story was part of Spielberg's intent - to spark an interest in the mind of his audience, to spur them to learn more about the people surrounding the debate of the 13th Amendment, and, possibly, to get them to read ""A Team of Rivals"" for themselves. <br/><br/>If this is so, I applaud Spielberg's ingenuity and if he were to send me a copy of ""A Team of Rivals"", I would surely send him my ""Lincoln"" ticket stub."

","It is a semi-rare occurrence that go see a movie but when I do I usually see a movie that friends or family members have suggested that I see. The 2012 movie, Lincoln, was a great movie to see. Daniel Day-Lewis, in my opinion was a great actor to choose for portraying Lincoln. Similarly, the other actors and actresses in this movie did a fine job portraying their character. This movie was also very historically accurate. Lincoln definitely had major issues during his lifetime that he had to overcome and the movie showing these struggles definitely caused it to be a great movie. The movie also incorporates a little humor in it as well. Lincoln's struggles in real life are examined greatly in this movie, the movie includes some of Lincoln's speeches. The movie also includes the action taken by Lincoln to stop the war and the action taken by the senators during this time period.

","In this fantastic movie the struggles that faced the divided nation at the time of the Civil War are brought to light. The war has already begun at the time the movie begins and the plot jumps right into Lincoln's decision to push for the passing of the 13th Amendment. The movie then shifts to focus on the difficulty Lincoln faces within his own Cabinet as well as with certain members of Congress as he works with some humorous men to gain the support of some congressmen who may be on the edge regarding the amendment. Lincoln is constantly faced with the question of whether he should aim to abolish slavery or if ending the war should be the primary goal. Also, throughout the movie the struggles that families face, including Lincoln's, are shown vividly through the sadness and grief various characters, like Lincoln's wife, show. This movie tugs at the heart-strings as brave men fight for what they believe needs to be done in Congress as well as on the battlefields."
"TheExpatriate700","7","2","5","19 November 2012"," Spielberg and History
","Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is a surprisingly good political biography, focusing on the passage of the 13th Amendment that abolished slavery. Although it occasionally descends into hagiography like most historical films, it gives an overall nuanced portrait of arguably America's greatest president.<br/><br/>The film avoids the log cabin legend that most Lincoln film biographies gravitate toward, placing him firmly in the rough and tumble world of nineteenth-century politics. Lincoln buys votes for the amendment through offers of political patronage, and even more ambiguously extends the Civil War in order to ensure its passage. There is grist for the mills of both Lincoln admirers and critics.<br/><br/>The film features some great acting, with Daniel Day Lewis filling the title role perfectly. Sally Field and James Spader give strong supporting performances. However, the true scene stealer is Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, giving an energetic performance that merits a Supporting Actor Oscar in a film that has Oscar bait written all over it.<br/><br/>The film has definite weaknesses. There are a few too many 'cute' scenes involving Tad Lincoln, and Lincoln himself has too much of a tendency to break into folksy witticisms at inappropriate moments. One scene near the end showing Lincoln bathed in white light as he waits for word on the Amendment is just over the top. Still, it is far better than most of the dreck that passes for entertainment these days."

Before I start as most of you know I am a huge history buff and was really looking forward to seeing this so I had high expectations. I have to admit it did not let me down at all and may have actually been better then I was hoping for. Lewis was amazing in this (as usual) and this may be his best performance so far, which is saying a lot. Im my opinion Spielberg has yet to make a bad movie and the streak does not end with this one.

This comparison between laws and sausages is no more evident than in Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" an ambitious film about the principal problem facing the president, i.e., what would be the fate of the millions of slaves in the reconstructed Union. Spielberg succeeds in turning the art of negotiating into an entertaining motion picture. Lincoln the master politician and therefore a master in the art of the possible is magnificently recreated by Daniel Day Lewis whose brilliance is once again confirmed in a performance that should receive Oscar consideration. There's an outstanding supporting cast including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln, David Strathairn as Secretary Seward, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln, Hal Holbrook as an influential Republican whose support Lincoln needs and Tommy Lee Jones as Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens. Tony Kushner's adapted screenplay is a masterful imagining of Lincoln the country lawyer who possessed political genius that few understood at the time. It is beautifully photographed by Janusz Kaminski, edited by Michael Kahn and scored by John Williams. A first class production all the way and one that will certainly dispose of any comfortable notions people may have that past generations possessed some great wisdom and courage that far supersedes anything we see in Washington today.

","LINCOLN - - To start with how could you not like a film that Hal Holbrook is in ? Directed by Steven Spielberg the film at 149 minutes is a little long it starts out on the slow side then picks up the pace into a crescendo. The two themes of the film is President Lincoln's attempts to one end the Civil War and second to get enough votes in The House of Representatives to pass by a two thirds majority the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution that will end slavery the Amendment that has already peen passed by the Senate. I enjoyed that portion of the storyline immensely being a political junkie to see all the behind the scene wrangling to get enough Democrats on board to assure it's passage knowing that the exact things still goes on today 147 years later. Much of the film takes place indoors with low lighting giving it the feel of what indoor lighting was like in 1865. Daniel Day- Lewis was brilliant as Abe Lincoln as was Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The highlight performance to me was Tommy Lee Johns as Thaddeus Stevens who will do whatever is necessary to see that the Amendment passes, we find out later the ulterior motives for that Point of View. Toward film's end General Ulysses S. Grant tells President Lincoln something along the lines of ""Your appearance seems to have gained 10 years in the last 1 year"" I guess the strains of being President was as difficult today as it was then"""

The film itself is a tad anemic and bloodless with one rival politician trying to top himself in the mandates at hand yet is timeless in depicting just that - the arrogance of governing bodies with a clean screenplay adaptation by Tony Kearns based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"").

","I don't impress easily when it comes to films of the past 20 years, and I haven't liked much of Spielberg's recent work, but this movie took my breath away. I came in as an avid Lincoln/Civil War buff, and, having read volumes on the man already, was fully prepared to be let down. It is tricky stuff to attempt to portray a man as complex and significant as Lincoln, both for the actor and for the writers and directors. The tendency would seem to be to turn him into a cartoon version or to miss his essence entirely. Doris Kearns-Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals"" was the best, most inspiring book I've read on Lincoln, and I was also doubtful that even a movie as lengthy as this could capture enough of him to do it justice. Spielberg demonstrated true genius by taking this legendary, vast, mountain of a life and distilling it down to one small window of time and by showing him move through his days (with both work and family)the director manages to hone in on his subject with laser precision. Day-Lewis (as you either already have experienced, or have deduced from other reviews) BECAME Lincoln. There are not enough superlatives to describe his work as an actor in this role. Almost as amazingly, Fields, Jones, and Strathairn all met the challenge.<br/><br/>If I had any quibbles, it would only be the opening dialogue between Lincoln and the black soldiers . . . unless someone can demonstrate that conversation actually happened, I wouldn't buy it for a second. I've docked one star from my rating for that one flub, but since I'd give it an 11 out of 10, it still comes off with a perfect score! This is a must see. Forget any complaints about too many words, not enough action. If that bothers you, go see another Avengers movie, and forget about learning the meaning of true heroism."
"meeza","9","3","11","2 December 2012"," Important piece of filmmaking and DDL is once again swell!!
","I could write shorter corny pun-infested movie reviews, but when I get started I'm too lazy to stop; which in no way shape or form is related to a line in the ""Lincoln"" movie that was ""I could write shorter sermons but when I get started I'm too lazy to stop"" Relax, I am kidding! Please keep reading and do not impeach this movie review. ""Lincoln"" is a monumental piece of premier filmmaking and powerful acting that should garner mucho Award love come the season to hand out those premios. Director Steven Spielberg (yea, him) has helmed another classic historical movie that should be highly utilized by secondary school teachers to show to their students in their classrooms. Spielberg focuses the narrative during the time that Lincoln was passionately pursuing the passing of the 13th Amendment which would abolish slavery. Of course, Abe had to go through some intense legislative hurdles including getting votes from Democratic legislators that were more ""yay"" than ""nay"" for slavery. Spielberg also presents once more in a film the ravages of war with graphic depictions and human turmoil of the Civil War in ""Lincoln""; as he did in ""Saving Private Ryan"" with World War II and ""Schindler's List"" with the Holocaust. Steven is the anti-war maestro and may all Gods bless him for that. Screenwriter Tony Kushner should consider a part-time gig teaching U.S. History; because, even though it's filled with legislative jargon as it should be, his scribe was masterful in depicting Abraham Lincoln's pursuit of the 13th Amendment passing. But it's that presidential actor that is most probably the greatest thespian of this generation that was the summit of the movie ""Lincoln""; and that would be the stunning performance of the great Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. I am totally being ""honest"" when I say Daniel nailed every part of Honest Abe; the voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the passion, the charisma and on and on and on. The Academy will most certainly have a majority vote favoring Mr. Day- Lewis to collect his third Best Actor Oscar. As paramount as it was, I am still in the group that thinks that Joaquin Phoenix's work in ""The Master"" is still the tops in the Best Actor category for 2012; but not by much compared to Day-Lewis' work. ""Lincoln"" also had a fine supporting acting cabinet with illustrious supporting performances from Sally Field as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln, James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, David Strathairn as Secretary of State William Seward, and Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant. But the top one that should definitely never be abolished from Best Supporting Acting consideration was the whopper performance from Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist Thaddeus Stephens. As in many Spielberg films, ""Lincoln"" included premier editing, score, makeup, art direction, and cinematography. ""Lincoln"" is not my favorite movie of 2012, even though I envision it in my Top 10 list of 2012; however, it is the most important film of 2012. And as Abraham Lincoln states in one of the last scenes of the movie ""I would rather stay, but I must go now"". So that means I am out of here, but please remember to vote ""yay"" for ""Lincoln"". ***** Excellent"

","Having recently read ""Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer"" and O'Reilly's recent book, ""Killing Lincoln"", what a complimentary and excellent storyline of Lincoln's amazing contribution to America by freeing the slaves. Daniel Day Lewis will certainly be nominated for this role and a shame (sham) if he does not win. The Lincoln family had many difficulties going on just between them and it's no wonder depression existed in their home. The nuances were obvious in the movie. For someone who really enjoys the action movies, this had me glued to the screen and the 2.5 hours flew by. Thanks to Doris Kearns Goodwin for her book and Spielberg. Go see this movie."
"blanbrn","8","3","11","18 November 2012"," An epic historical and political film of compromise, compassion, and sacrifice.
","I for one am a history and political buff and I've read and researched ""Honest Abe"" well so it was nice and only fitting to see a big screen film of Lincoln's life. Oddly it comes from director Steven Spielberg who's branched out to more serious fare like a historical drama of this matter. Also this is not a biography of the well known and popular president. It's focus is in 1865 the last months of his presidency just after his reelection as the civil war is about to end, yet more important on Abe's radar is wanting to pass the 13th amendment thru congress so the slaves could be free thru the south and north. This film shows the blood and bodies that were fallen and shed during the civil war, yet it's focus is much more of political drama and back room dealing with compromise and words while trying to end slavery.<br/><br/>The film's detail and scenes and background shots are top notch and the performances and acting is A plus all the way it's an acting clinic especially Daniel Day Lewis who's a real spitting image of Abe Lincoln his voice and actions are southern yet done professor like mixed with human good and knowledge that can't be matched. Honest Abe as this film shows was a man and a president of thought and good nature who always thought about his next plans and treated all as equal he was a president who clearly wanted the slaves to be free, that's why his commissioners fought so hard with opposing politicians to get the 13th amendment passed. A real standout of the film is veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones(one of the best actors around)as republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens an outspoken and direct speak his mind politician who sides with Abe on the slavery issue. Aside from the back room drama of political showrooms and fancy speeches and yes and no arguments, this film shows that the Lincoln's were troubled people too. Sally Field is a shattered lady while giving a raw performance as Lincoln's troubled wife Mary Todd her emotions really came out on screen. As both were always troubled with their young son Willie's death. And to complicate matters oldest living son Robert(Joseph Gordon Levitt)wants to go off to fight for the union.<br/><br/>Overall this film is more than a history or political memory of a great man or president and the performances of Daniel, Sally, and Tommy make it a must see as cast chemistry is unmatched most of all this important film proved that in life, war, and politics things must be done with grace, compassion, and most of all you must be willing to compromise and sacrifice for the sake and good for all human nature no matter what race or sex."

","Before I saw this movie, I actually had already read the 944 page book, ""Team of Rivals"" by Doris Kearns Goodwin, that the movie was purportedly based on. <br/><br/>I actually enjoyed the book immensely and was actually regretful when I had turned the last of the book, because there were no more pages to be read.<br/><br/>So, I started watching this movie with great anticipation. And was utterly shocked at how slow and boring it was. Daniel Day Lewis seemed off, like he was acting with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He didn't seem anything like the Lincoln I saw portrayed in Goodwin's biography. To be fair, he was probably basing his performance on the screenplay, which was most likely a horse of a different color.<br/><br/>After watching it for an excruciatingly LONG 15-20 minutes, I finally gave up with a mixture of disbelief, sorrow and disgust. disbelief, because I couldn't believe that Spielberg actually directed such a poor movie. sorrow, because I had hoped for a faithful translation to the screen. and disgust, that the screenwriter did such a lousy job of translating the fidelity of the book. <br/><br/>This was probably one of the most excruciatingly boring movies I have ever watched."
"imdb-duke_nukem","2","2","6","24 August 2013"," More about voting process in Congress than about Lincoln
","Very disappointing. I had expected a sweeping story of Lincoln though the background of the civil war, covering for example his relationship with his generals and with Europe, slavery in the context of the time, and how the Union triumphed against superior Confederate soldiery by means of superior logistics. I also expected a staging of the Gettysburg address.<br/><br/>Instead we got a excruciatingly detailed and tedious account of the machinations and wheeler-dealing of passing one particular Constitutional amendment. The scenes are almost all in committee rooms or Lincoln family domestic - it seems like a budget. Lincoln himself comes over as going senile (perhaps he was), constantly telling stories from his earlier years; he does not seem focused. One set-piece speech was pathetic (""That's my speech"").<br/><br/>As a non-American, I cannot raise much interest in the detailed mechanism for passing an amendment; the fact is that it was passed. But even if I were interested, the film left much unexplained. Eg a 2/3 majority was needed, and most of the film was about the lobbying for the number needed; however in the vote some members were absent or abstained, and the film gave no explanation of how such non-votes were handled in evaluating the 2/3. This was important, as these numbers were the whole point of the film.<br/><br/>And no explanation either of how the Southern Congressmen (presumably absent, so not voting) were handled in this 2/3 count, given Lincoln's insistence that the US remained a single nation all the while.<br/><br/>This film may mean a lot, and be familiar ground, to Americans; but it ignores other audiences. Near the end, there is a scene at the Appomattox Court House (we are told in a sub-title), and we see a grey haired man in a grey uniform mounting a horse. I happen to have read a lot about the Civil War, but I needed to explain to my wife (who was almost asleep with boredom) that it was Robert E Lee signing the Confederate surrender (oddly, shown departing rather than arriving for the event); otherwise it would have meant nothing to her, nor to most other non-US viewers I suspect."

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","2","6","17 March 2013"," Absolute historical masterpiece
","Is That a saga or is it history ? We can ask the question and wonder. The inspiration from Walt Whitman is quite obvious and strong, showing Lincoln as the father of the nation able to filibuster like any other senator or representative, sacrificing his own life, his own wife, his own sons to the only objective he had in mind: to save the union by defeating the secessionists, which he did. <br/><br/>But the film centers on the crucial period after Gettysburg and the famous address, after the ""government of the people, by the people, for the people"" till his death and his funeral. Those crucial two years of his presidency and of his legacy. To finish the war he had to cast in iron the freeing of the black slaves and that could only be performed with a constitutional amendment to the constitution, the thirteenth to be more clear, and then the rest and the next two amendments are what will come after him. This battle is essential and Spielberg plays with the situation with obvious pleasure. Votes of representatives or bought up, not with money but with administrative jobs. The promise of defeat to some Democrats in the North is also vastly used when necessary. <br/><br/>In that debate in the House of Representatives in January 1865 some declarations by the slavery-leaning conservatives are funny in retrospect: menacing the House with the Black vote, with Black Representatives and Senators, and after that where will they stop? The menace of the vote of women and all other catastrophes that could happen if the Black slaves were finally freed by the Constitution. And the vote was won with a simple argument: ""I am not for the equality of all things, but only for the equal rights of everyone in front of the law."" A typical compromise on the side of the anti-slavery camp. The US Constitution cannot declare everyone equal in real terms but only in rights. Yet it will take one more amendment for that principle to become true, the fourteenth amendment that is at the core of the debate on same-sex marriage right now, the Supreme Court's decision pending on the subject. <br/><br/>This is so true indeed that what is important is not the real equality of people in material terms but their equality in rights. Then the equality in real material terms has to be built, constructed, won step by step, one step at a time. That's the American way. They do not look after every single individual case, but they state in general terms rights for everyone and then everyone is supposed to conquer the implementation of these rights. Real equality for the Black slaves was won only one century later, in 1964-65 with the laws on equal rights and the vote, one century after the full freeing of the slaves. A long, very long time and delay, but that's what it took for the slaves and then their descendants to get beyond the Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder (or Syndrome), for them to re-conquer their soul, rebuild their mind, reconstruct their self-pride and their future. And it took them more than forty more years to reach the top, and yet the President is not a descendant of slaves. The trip to equality is not complete yet, but it will be some time soon now.<br/><br/>The film insists on a picture of Abraham Lincoln as a fast aging man surrounded by personal tragedies, like the loss of a first son to the war, and then the enlistment of his second son against his mother's wish and his father's advice, and then the crazy emotional state of his wife who is constantly oscillating between headaches and breakdown, with some moments of sane political vision. She was instrumental in Lincoln's life and decisions, but not as a direct inspirer, rather as an obstacle to negotiate, and that obstacle when negotiated opened doors to the next step or steps on the road to eternal gratitude of the Black people, by the White people and for the Black and the White people. Lincoln turned Gettysburg from a deadly defeat to a shining victory, and of the whole humanity as for that. We still owe him a bundle.<br/><br/>The last element to say is of course about the marvelous performance of the actor. It is a challenge for any actor to impersonate a historical character of this magnitude. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the greater American actors in the line of the greatest like Dustin Hoffman or Jack Nicholson in the previous generation. It is so difficult to embody both the crumbling physical shape of the man and his building up resolve and stamina on the essential question that will make history, unluckily after his death. A brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Think when you see the film of what the Lincoln Monument has become in Washington D.C. and you might understand the depth of this history in the making that is only coming true today nearly 150 years after the end of the Civil War. I will regret though the fact that Grant's and Sherman's sweeping fire trail down into the Deep South in 1864 and 65 is only alluded to and not shown. The horror of the war is rather discreetly evoked with one or two strong pictures here and there but very little altogether.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","That's a pretty bad film all-around - except for Daniel Day-Lewis' part which is simply amazing.<br/><br/>Apart from that, it's a typical Spielberg'ish shenanigan. <br/><br/>Trust me - if, like me, all your interest in this film had purely to do with the lead role, it's not worth the 2 hours and a half. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>If you're interested in the historical details, everything is pretty much spot on (besides the Conneticut voting). As an European citizen though, I confess I'm a bit tired of hearing stories about ""the land of the free and oh-so-great US of A"" as often as I do. It all ends up sounding like lame propaganda with a very distinct diferenciation between good and evil - the good being the ones who history deems victorious. I dunno... not a huge fan of mr. Spielberg's simple way of dealing with the complexities of inter-human relationships."

I wouldn't recommend Lincoln to my fellow Americans in the UK or to any Brits. Sorry Spielberg but you lost the plot....<br/><br/>The scenery was good along with the costumes, but not enough to make it a good film for that alone. How does Spielberg expect everybody to know who was in Lincoln's cabinet? It was just a total muddle of characters (outside of Lincoln) and would not be of any interest to anyone except a Lincoln scholar."

","The acting is absolutely terrific in this film, there's no denying that. However, this is where my praise ends for Spielberg's film.<br/><br/>The passing of the 13th amendment was one of the most conflicting and exciting moments in American political history. So what does Spielberg do with the story? He fills it with shots of Lincoln staring out the window, staring at the floor, walking around, arguing with his family.<br/><br/>The film however should not be called 'Lincoln' but more 'The 13th Amendment"" because that is what the film is about! We learn nothing about Lincoln 'the man' except that he was an intelligent man (which I believe we all assumed anyway).<br/><br/>The most disappointing aspect of the film for me, was when Abe got shot. We suddenly hear ""THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SHOT!"" There was no build up, nor a scene to show what happened. I feel like of all the scenes to leave out of a film, he left out one of the most important ones. I understand it may disturb people, but this is what happened! If you want mushy Hollywood approved melodrama with good acting, look no further than the travesty that is Lincoln. It's not a bad film, but it could have been so much better!"

","A friend who saw this movie told me, 'There are some great scenes, great acting, and set design but the movie never really comes together.' My friend was right, but he didn't explain the reason why this movie didn't come together. Simply put, it's the storytelling that has failed here.<br/><br/>Years ago when I was taking screen writing classes in college I remember hearing from teachers (and then later on in my own study) to avoid writing scripts with only talking heads. If you're going to have a script with mostly talking then there needs to be other action going on in the background to make it more interesting. There is a reason for this in writing and Lincoln proves this perfectly. If you have a script with only talking heads and nothing else going on, what you are left with is a boring script. This is a two and a half hour movie and three quarters of it at least are talking heads. There's one scene in the movie where Lincoln is about to tell a story (Again!) and someone in the room hurries up and leaves. I felt exactly the same way. Please don't bore me with another verbose story.<br/><br/>The problem is this is a movie, and the story in a movie is supposed to be dramatized not vocalized like this is. If I had wanted to read a book about Lincoln I would have done so, but I came to see movie and expected to see a visual dramatization of the story. We didn't get one unfortunately.<br/><br/>Instead we got movie about one of the popular presidents in US history, with excellent set design and costume, and a brilliant performance by Day Lewis. People praise this movie because of this and unfortunately they are blinded by it not seeing that there is a very poorly written script underneath. Regardless of whether this movie is about a great man or that it has a great message, the fact of the matter is the storytelling is atrocious and it fails as a movie because of this.<br/><br/>Shame on all the critics who praised this garbage and the academy for nominating it for so many awards. Most importantly, shame on Spielberg. You were better than this, but maybe not anymore..."

","I felt frustrated with this film in the same way as with The Iron Lady; if I go to a film called Lincoln about such a great historical character, I really want to find out about the great sweep of his character through the most turbulent times in US history. Just as the Margaret Thatcher movie should more accurately have been called Dementia because that was 90% of what it dealt with, a more honest title for Lincoln should have been The 13th Amendment. This felt like a TV spin off from a proper movie: one action scene at the start to hook us in, then endless similar scenes of men talking in darkened smoke filled rooms to save money and fill out the interminable length of the film. A movie about Lincoln could easily fill 3 hours if we had much more about his life: but for most of this movie you could shut your eyes for fifteen minutes, open them again and you were in the same scene with the same conversation. Because of the God like status (thoroughly deserved) of Steven Spielberg, perhaps he's allowed to get away with anything, but really this is a very tedious film. Looking round the theater during that first couple of hours there was lots of seat shuffling and people dozing off; that speaks for itself.... We were even cheated at the end of seeing the great man shot dead in the theater; just somebody announcing it in a different theater. Why?!! It was like seeing a film about Titanic just showing the passengers talking about how unsinkable it was for three hours then not showing us the sinking at the end.

Let me put it this way - if Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't win the Best Actor Oscar, I completely give up on the Oscars, because it'd prove they're nothing more than a high school popularity contest. I felt like I was watching Abraham Lincoln on the screen, I felt like Day-Lewis didn't exist. I was so blown away by Day-Lewis in this movie that I actually had to see it twice to BELIEVE it.

He looked exactly like him and talked like the actual Lincoln would have. Steven Spielberg did a phenomenal job at portraying all aspects of Lincoln. Lincoln was known to crack jokes and Spielberg definitely portrayed that humorous side of Lincoln. Spielberg also brought out Lincoln's sensitive side when he was fighting with his wife, Mary. And most importantly, Lincoln's serious side was portrayed numerous times, but the most impacting one in my opinion was when he was discussing the Thirteenth Amendment at a table with other men and he got frustrated and began yelling.

And of course, Daniel Day-Lewis depicted the sixteenth president of the United States; he was a man overburdened with the issue of the emancipation of hated slaves, and you receives a clear idea of how onerous that matter was on Lincoln. It was the emancipation issue which was very much at the core of the story. The movie presented Lincoln not only as a president, but as a man as well.

While this movie was done well, it easily could've been 15-20 minutes shorter without missing anything critical (which cannot necessarily be said by LOTR or Braveheart). The other thing I mentioned was the misleading name. Obviously Lincoln is still the protagonist but a more accurate title to the movie would've been ""The 13th Amendment"" because that's the entire focus of the film. Personally, I expected this film to be more like a condensed version of the John Adams mini-series and the title and previews are the reason why. Nonetheless, this was a good movie with fantastic acting and cinematography and I think most people would really enjoy it."

","This was interesting, but overall, I am not into historical dramas. Unfortunately after the movie, my movie goer partner said, ""Oh, I knew you wouldn't like it as soon as I saw Sally Field."" That happens to be true. She has been a drama queen since she was an activist (Norma Rae), and her part seems to be cast as drama queen in everything she does since then. She once again played a mean drama queen as Lincoln's wife in the movie; however, her speech to Thaddeus Stevens was witty and most enjoyable. I do not know if Lincoln was a pensive man, but the movie portrayed him as such. I know that his wife was difficult, and the movie correctly portrayed her as such. In all, the movie was filled with older men who had a great deal of prejudices toward all types of people which truly seemed to be the atmosphere of the times. Of the few facts I've checked, the movie seems to be historically accurate (as was suggested in a review I read prior to seeing the movie) which shows the struggle to unite the US through slavery and the intended break up of the states by many including the southern states. I did not, however, feel that it was clear enough about the states' rights issues that Lincoln seemed to quell during this time. It was mentioned, but from the studying I have done of this time period, if the US was to be united, it would take away states' rights, and I believe it was a very significant issue at that time. Lincoln was effectively played, and Tommy Lee Jones aka Thaddeus Stevens was an enjoyable character that added a great deal to the movie. In life, Thaddeus Stevens was the same type of character, and Tommy Lee Jones was a great fit. I anticipate an Academy Award nomination for him as it was excellent and fun to watch his skill. It was, however, shocking to see him come home and take off his wig to a completely hairless, bald head. I was unaware that he had a relationship with an African American housekeeper. That time period was so prejudiced against that type of union and only few dared to do so thought this action (both in life and in the movie) showed his power as few would have attempted to do this during this time. It was again, historically accurate, since his relationship with her housekeeper was real. And to be able to verify the historical accuracy of the movie makes the movie more valuable. I enjoyed seeing that he took the signed bill to her to see which I think showed a great deal of affection in him for her (whether accurate or not)--showing her that her race had finally won their freedom. I found the intrigue and buying off people to be horrible practices that were done during that time with offerings to many for salaried, lifetime jobs for their votes and participation in decision making (though probably not unlike our society today). Two things about the movie were cumbersome: 1) Lincoln's character was so pensive, it was hard to get into his head, and you never really felt like you knew him; and 2) The makeup as a whole looked like pancake makeup with many of the characters having horrible looking ""skin"" that was aged by makeup too thickly put upon their faces. At times, it was distracting and unappealing. Overall, the movie was a good one, slow at times, but enjoyable for a historical drama. The complexity of language might make the movie less accessible to those who are less educated and to younger movie goers. One cannot really appreciate the lambasting that is done or the ironic innuendos in the movie without an extensive vocabulary."

","Steven Spielberg gives us a well rounded story regarding the passage of the 13th amendment to the US Constitution. It's focus is predominantly President Lincoln but Spielberg gives us a view into the politics and the performers that facilitated it's passage. He gives us a Lincoln who seems to understand the contradictions of his presidency... he wants equality, but used his war powers to declare martial law and suspend ha beaus corpus. This is more of a political drama then a morality play - the supporters of slavery(Democrats)are not portrayed as evil, vile or villainous. <br/><br/>Spielberg also gives us a caring family man who dearly loves his sons and his wife, though he is at his ends because of her desperate longing for their son Willie who died in the White House from typhoid at 12. Sally Field should be nominated, Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones probably will be as well. The film is a bit 'stagey' at times, but that wears off - at 150 minutes, it passes quickly given all the talking and little 'action'. Spielberg avoids many of his more manipulative tricks (except maybe at the very beginning when Lincoln is talking to 2 black soldiers, then 2 white soldiers) to give us a pretty direct telling of this story - based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin book ""Team of Rivals""."
"dmaboyer","7","2","6","26 November 2012"," Good but not great
","I will start by saying this movie is good but not great. It is worth watching but it will not become a classic like many other movies of the Civil War era, such as Gettysburg. What I was expecting was more comprehensive biography of Lincoln. What I got was one little slice of his life surrounded by many other characters. As many reviewers have said, this should be called a movie about the 13th amendment not about Lincoln. Almost all of it takes place in January of 1865 and involves Lincoln's fight to get the amendment passed. The movie gets very slow and tedious in the middle with all the wrangling. <br/><br/>Considering the subject it could have been shorter and ending with the passing of the amendment. The assassination seem to be a add-on which could have been left out. It is a movie you go to see for the scenery and the performances not for the story. <br/><br/>When I saw the trailer I had my doubts about Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln, but I have to say he pulls it off. He will almost certainly get a nomination for his acting. Probably the best character is Thaddeus Stevens played by Tommy Lee Jones. He pulls it off perfectly. If you look up the picture on Wikipedia of Stevens, Jones looks just like him. For a Spielberg movie I as disappointed in the special effects. Much of it was obviously green screen. The carriage rides though the city were so obvious green screen that it was distracting. The riverboat that was obvious built on a back lot and had no water under it was a big blooper. As a huge Civil War and Lincoln fan I am glad I went to see it but I would not rush out to see it again any time soon."

David Straithairn is equally impressive as Secretary of State Seward. The pace and formula of the film is very similar to that of Spielberg's earlier 19th century drama, 'Amistad.' However, the premise of 'Lincoln' is more significant, in that it deals with one of the most (if not THE most) pivotal figures in American history. Here is my outlook for this latest masterpiece from one of the world's most masterful filmmakers:<br/><br/>Oscar NOMINATION PREDICTIONS:<br/><br/>Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis, Predicted Winner), Best Supporting Actor (David Straithairn), Best Supporting Actress (Sally Field), Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score."

","It's an important film more than it's a good film. Steven Spielberg said while promoting the film: ""It's funny how the republicans and democrats have switched places since 1865.""
I don't think it is funny and it certainly isn't true. The democrats are still in favor of slavery and a society divided into ""elites"" and ""slaves"".
Democrats (slavery-jim crow-KKK-antifa-dependency-moral & financial bankruptcy - internment camps)
Republicans (defeated slavery in 1865 and then lost their spinal cord a few years later and have never regained it - they should've destroyed the party of evil and they didn't. And history will judge them harshly for that)
This movie does a good job of showing Lincoln as a man. It's easier and more fun to think of him as superhuman. Ya know why we think of him that way, because everyone else in comparison doesn't measure up. This movie helps you understand why that is true."

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","2","21 August 2016"," Steven Spielberg's biographical piece is magnificent, if a little meandering
","Steven Spielberg brings a masterful vision and storytelling to the screen when it comes to tackling historical periods. His awe-inspiring visionary shined brightly in the World War II genre when he wrestled on films like Academy Award winner 'Schinder's List' portraying the horrors of the Holocaust, and 'Saving Private Ryan' which centered on a fictional story, but with a devastatingly authentic portrait of active combat. It is safe to say this director really knows his American History. In this biographical drama set during the Civil War era, Spielberg captures an ingenious portrayal of one of the most iconic political figures in American history: Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president of United States. This iconic figure however, was more than just a president in a tall hat, he was a man who sparked a revolution on our country brought grace through his political intuition before his notorious assassination. Daniel Day-Lewis steps in the role as Abraham Lincoln in this historical piece following his final months of his presidency during the concluding year of the Civil War. In desperate measures to end slavery of African Americans, Lincoln pushes the Congress to enact the Thirteenth Amendment which was set to outlaw slavery. Fighting against the odds of the Confederate who's in favor of ending the war, but keeping slavery. Lincoln must acquire the support of his politicians including Secretary of State William Seward (played by David Straithairn) to win the voting at the House of Representatives against the democratic forces, while facing a troubling relationship with his wife Mary (played by Sally Field) and his Union Army soldier Robert (played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt).<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is tremendous at painting an uncompromising portrait of the Civil War period, and the political world that defined that era. Opening with a brutal battle sequence between the Union and the Confederate Army featuring bloody combat with countless soldiers slaughtered and drenched in the mud, the movie captures it's grueling historical subject matter with plenty of grit and spirit, and Spielberg's compelling vision of the historical period doesn't end there. From the moody production design, to the appropriately written dialogue, to the costume design; Spielberg does a magnificent job on creating an environment that feels believable the time oft he story's setting. But when portraying a story of the historical figures' presidency in the height of the Civil War, one of the biggest (if not the biggest) selling point is the screenplay written by playwright Tony Kushner who last collaborated with Steven Spielberg in the writing of 'Munich' in 2005. Driven by Kushner's script, the film presents a smart, informative story revolving around Abraham Lincoln and his significant measures on getting the Thirteenth Amendment passed to abolish slavery, and the plot focusing on his struggle against the Democratic Party who opposed his political ideas. The script makes great effort on capturing the story fact-by-fact, while supplementing a few notable liberties in the process. Although the way in which the story is executed does result in a very slow pace that tends to kill the interest in the story, particularly for those with little patience. But at the same time, it also results in a story that provides a valuable history lesson for both children (if they're even interested) and adults. <br/><br/>For a highly influential political figure, must be one of the Hollywood's most actors talented actor to step into their shoes. That is where Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis comes in place. Lewis provides a deeply enthralling performance as the titular character, delivering sheer humanity and life into the role. From the first shot introducing his character, Lewis captures a performance so believable, he disappears into his character. And the incredibly done make-up on the actor makes it more possible for us to see not the actor, but the famous figure he is portraying. Sally Field, being the fine actress she is, gives a credible performance as First Lady Mary Lincoln, the wife of Abraham Lincoln who is faced with a tumultuous relationship that threatens to tear their marriage apart. Playing his eldest son is Joseph-Gordon Levitt has some great moments on screen, but perhaps not enough to make him memorable. Along side these actors is a large cast of David Straithairn as a Secretary of State, Tommy Lee Jones as the head of House of Representatives, James Spader as the Republican Party leader who supports Lincoln on his abolishment of slavery, Tim Blake Nelson as the lobbyist Richard Schnell, and Halbrook as another member of the Republican Party in support of Lincoln, the lists goes on. These actors all give some alright performances, but the overload of supporting characters too often render their performances less memorable. After all, Daniel Day- Lewis who gives it all to stand out amongst the cast as the titular character here.<br/><br/>Lincoln is a spectacular biographical piece complete with Steven Spielberg's potent direction and a powerful performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Though the overall execution of the film is a bit meandering and slow-paced, it grants us with an enthralling story that is both entertaining and highly informative; and best of all shines a true light on Spieberg's inspiring filmmaking."

","one of films who impress for the precise use of details. because it propose not exactly a portrait of Lincoln but a way to discover him behind the hero or statue's image. and the chance of meeting between a great actor and an important director is the key for success of a film who brooks limits, remains cold, direct and touching, remake a national symbol and gives to it emotions, vulnerability, force and a wise manner to define the future as expression of high faith. a challenge - film. not real comfortable for the viewer but useful for understand the spirit of a period, the war of a man looking the right way for build a country from ashes. for many films, the story is the basic axis. in the case of Lincoln, the embroidery of performances is the most important ingredient. because the story seems be well known. because each of us has his image about Abraham Lincoln and the expectation to discover it on the screen.

","Overall this movie was pretty good.I liked the action,and how intense and accurate some of the scenes were . Also how it showed pretty much what happened to Lincoln and how he was involved in slavery.Lincoln believed slavery was immoral. Yet he also considered the 13th Amendment a masterstroke in cutting away the finanicial foundations of the confederacy. In my opinion, the Lincoln movie portrayed somewhat of how slavery actually ended. Because without the slaves determination helping slavery would've never gotten ended. On the other hand it really mostly focused on the war and how stressful it was. Also how Mary and Lincoln was always fighting. Usually though it was about the court case and how slavery was felt differently about with many people."
"mckinzihess","Null","1","2","30 November 2015"," Lincoln vs. Slaves- WHO ENDED SLAVERY?
","After watching Lincoln and learning about slaves back then, I believe that it is pretty safe to say that both Abraham Lincoln and the slaves had a role in freeing slaves. The act of freeing slaves didn't take a couple days, weeks, or months...it took a couple years and those years, were rough years. In 1865, the 13th amendment to the United States Constitution read "" neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment for the crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted; or any place subject to jurisdiction. Lincoln was able to pass the Emancipation Proclamation which said ""that all persons held slaves are, and henceforward will be free"". This aided in freeing slaves, but the slaves were able to escape their masters and go into the military to fight for freedom. Although many people believed that Lincoln freed the slaves, but you also have to look at it from the slaves' point of view and how they were able to overcome slavery with the help of Lincoln. So, I say that this movie did serve justice in saying that Lincoln freed the slaves, but I wish that they went more in depth as to what the slaves did to overcome slavery."

The effort shown by Lincoln showed how dearly he cared for the slaves and their freedom. Daniel Day Lewis played the part of Lincoln to a T. Which is not unusual for him. Lincoln was a very smart and witty man. Lincoln is a rough and noble democratic masterpiece. He had a way with the people. But he had reasons for freeing the slaves. There were many advantages such as moral advantage. Also it would demolish the Souths economy because their economy was mainly based on slaves."
"fitzgerm","7","1","2","30 November 2015"," Does it portray what actually happened when abolishing slavery?
","In my opinion, the movie ""Lincoln"" is mostly very accurate. Lincoln did, in fact, lead the fight to get the 38th Congress to pass the Thirteenth Amendment and abolish slavery. He used his political skills and his ""immense power"" (which, by the way, Lincoln DID say) to sway the votes of reluctant Democratic congressman towards acceptance of the Thirteenth Amendment.Lincoln and Congressman Thaddeus Stevens worked together, in spite of their differences, to pass the the Thirteenth Amendment through the 38th Congress. There was a lot of pressure put on Lincoln to delay the Thirteenth Amendment's passage until after the war had ended. But Lincoln was concerned that if he waited for the 39th Congress to pass the amendment after the war, his previously issued Emancipation Proclamation might be overturned by the courtsâ€”allowing slavery to continue. Consequently, Lincoln was insistent on using his influence as President of the United States to assure the Thirteenth Amendment's passage. Fortunately for the slaves, he succeeded before he was assassinated on April 14, 1865. Although it could have included more of the slaves effort to end slavery. For example, they kept trying to escape for freedom."
"gersbacm","Null","1","2","30 November 2015"," The movie was great! Missed the part on the accuracy to what really happened.
","The film Lincoln accurately portrayed the end to slavery. Lincoln freed the slaves in the rebellion before he freed the slaves in the union. As stated in source one and two ""Lincoln did not accomplish this in this manner sometimes symbolically portrayed, by breaking the chains of helpless and passive bondsman with the stroke of a pen, but by pronouncing slavery as a moral evil that must come to an end."" Thus being said without the president have a strong feeling against slavery, the abolitionists wouldn't of stood a chance against ending slavery and passing the 13th amendment. In the film Lincoln, Abraham himself is constantly stressing to pass the 13th amendment to end slavery. He spent countless hours trying to gather votes to to pass the amendment. Without his support on this campaign, the votes most likely would have favored to not pass the amendment. As also stated in source two and three, ""by refusing to compromise this policy once he adopted, and by prosecuting the war to unconditional victory, as commander in chief of liberation, Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves"" this being said Abe Lincoln did in fact free the slaves."

","Here's one to appease all the history buffs out there. Steven Spielberg's historical drama Lincoln. Here you've got a story about one of the greatest presidents in our history being played by one of the greatest actors in our current history. That actor of course is the magnificent Daniel Day-Lewis who gives an exceptionally spellbinding performance as the 16th president of the United States.<br/><br/>Lincoln chronicles one of the most tumultuous parts of Abraham Lincoln's presidency. As the Civil War enters its fourth year, Lincoln and his cabinet are stuck at a crossroads in passing the 13th amendment, an amendment that will effectively abolish slavery and will level all male citizens of the United States equal under the law. The film details Honest Abe's struggle amid a cavalcade of other characters all played by stellar A-List actors and actresses.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Lincoln is a good movie. It was made by history buffs for history buffs and the historical accuracy of the film has been widely praised. It certainly helps that Day-Lewis bares a frighteningly uncanny resemblance to Abe, and his performance more than sells the idea that we truly are watching Abe fight for equality.<br/><br/>However, if you asked me if I loved Lincoln I would have to say no. I liked it. I enjoyed it. I don't regret watching it. I didn't fall in love with it though. There were a handful of scenes I really did get a rise from. Namely, the debate scenes within the House of Representatives are some of the most enthralling and entertaining. They depict a Congress full of loud mouthed drunkards who shout and curse over one another, completely going against all of the civility we assume Congress exhibits today. (Ha, I could barely type that with a straight face). It depicts an unabashed and unapologetic take on Congress, one that was probably very accurate to the time period. Spielberg's attention to detail in these scenes shines as well, equipping almost every desk in the House with an ash tray and a bottle of liquor. It's these little things that make me smile while watching Lincoln.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is full of powerfully performed scenes of Lincoln doing presidential, and non-presidential things, and plot forwarding scenes that are lit and shot consistently well by longtime Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. These scenes, while setting an aesthetically gripping mood, also help cement the film's slow and sometimes dull pacing. I don't want to say that Lincoln is a boring film, but it does drag and doesn't always hold my interest from a plot perspective, holding me back from a love of the film.<br/><br/>At the end of the day Lincoln is a film that should not be missed if you love Spielberg, Daniel Day-Lewis, or just great performances in general, because the film is packed with them. It boasts a cast of A-Listers including Tommy Lee Jones as the sternly sarcastic Thaddeus Stevens, Sally Field in a powerhouse performance as Mary Todd Lincoln, Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a smaller role as Robert Lincoln, David Strathairn as William Seward, and the always lovable James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, a foul mouthed, cigar smoking, quick witted sonofabitch. You'll find a great performance in every single frame of this film, even if as a whole the film doesn't exactly change your life."

It was sold to a rather bigoted country of the time as a tactic to win the war. To get people to do the right thing, Lincoln's people had to bribe and cajole in ways that sound familiar today in the corrupt game of politics.<br/><br/>The movie would probably sail over the heads of most children or bore them. It's about dirty politics.<br/><br/>The are so many familiar faces, disguised under makeup and wigs, all having a wonderful time hamming it up. The movie reminds me a bit of the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston saying his lines as if every word would be recorded for all eternity with a background of soaring strings. It is not that corny, but it has that taking-itself-too-seriously feel.<br/><br/>There are hundreds of congressmen and onlookers all in costume debating in the house. It must have cost a mint to film. Everyone is doing something so incredibly full of energy. It felt somewhat phony to me, sort of metaphoric Kodachrome.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln as quite believable, with his squeaky voice and penchant for telling meandering stories to make a point rather than bluntly disagreeing. He hams it up much less than the other actors.<br/><br/>The movie leaves out most of the war, Lincoln's depression, Mary Todd Lincoln's mental troubles, the death of his son, and even to a large extent, the assassination.<br/><br/>I would like it if every adult American saw this movie.

The main focus of the film is Lincoln's work towards giving freedom for every individual, and not all the stuff before hand like getting elected or raising a family. The film does get in touch with Lincoln's character and doesn't just show how he was stressed out all the time. We see Lincoln's family relationships, the congressmen who fought for and against slavery during the time when Lincoln was trying to abolish slavery, and we get to see what it was like when he was assassinated. Abraham Lincoln was an amazing man, just this film is so bland. Not a single strong message was made from this film and it literally felt like Steven Spielberg and his fellow producers said ""hey! Let's make a movie about Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves!"" Nothing creative was put into this film except the production design and costume design that made everything look freakishly in the 1800's. As for the acting, it's good but overdone. Daniel Day-Lewis looks identical to Lincoln, and gets the voice and walk down, but he gets bothersome and overacts and gets a little ""look at me acting."" As for Spielberg, he does a decent job of visualizing Lincoln's work but doesn't deliver his finest work.

When Abraham Lincoln begins to tell one of his stories, it feels like he's telling it just to you. <br/><br/>The film takes a little bit of time to get going and runs the risk of getting bogged down with a lot of political jargon, but it takes off after that. Tommy Lee Jones also gives a superb performance and provides much of the comic relief. Sally Field plays Lincoln's grief stricken wife and her performance sheds light on a person whose claim to fame has historically been ""Lincoln's crazy wife."" <br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln has always been a larger than life figure.

","i really liked the film. the grading, the acting, the overall set, the love for detail. i had the slight feeling that Lincoln might have two or three anecdote telling scenes too many, but that is a detail. <br/><br/>i am European and more often than not Americans seem to me to overshoot when it comes to their big national themes. too much heroism, too much pathos and so forth. i found Lincoln did none of these until the very last two shots. i was so impressed by Spielberg not showing the assassination scene and then comes this resurrection in the candle flame. brr. if he had the feeling it needs something ""big"" to end the film, a silent scene of the funeral would have served way better than this""climax"". reminded me of (bad) endings in the forties. it is funny, i think no European film maker would have done that. <br/><br/>but of course doing the film justice requires more than looking at the last two shots. overall i really liked it. especially the concept of putting so much emphasis on the dirty aspects of politics, even when it is for a good cause. the praise of democracy and freedom next to betraying ones' very values. puts a humble note to everything and i for one think it was a good choice to make THIS the theme of the movie and not the liberation from slavery. because for me this WAS the actual theme. you hardly see black folks, you do not really see the tragic reality of slaves. this is - to me - a film about the morals of politics using one of the biggest political characters of all time. wonderful and tasteful choice for the movie, because otherwise the film could easily have drifted into terrible pathos. <br/><br/>Daniel day lewis did something remarkable in my opinion, but only time will tell if i am right: he formed the vivid picture of Lincoln for this and at least the next generation. because it felt like: this IS Lincoln. how more could you praise an actor.<br/><br/>one scene was absolute great film making: when his son followed the two men out of the hospital. we, the audience, expect a bloody mass of a corpse and then it is only ... legs. but that is even more terrifying in a way, yet then it is not, since it is just legs and the people without them actually ... live. this picture of the many legs is indeed in a difficult to describe way more terrifying than a single corpse, no matter how mutilated, since it makes physical injury a mass phenomenon of war and not a more severe, but less likely event. the every day labor of carrying dozens of legs out where they are obviously buried on a routine basis in order to show the shocking and terrifying reality - great, great film making. <br/><br/>overall, as in other films from Spielberg, you see the fight between European taste and American pathos. for the biggest part of the film the first won."

","LINCOLN is a masterpiece. People will praise Daniel Day Lewis and they quite rightfully should. His portrayal of Abe Lincoln is quite astonishing. He gets into the DNA of Lincoln and he doesn't come across as a cardboard cutout either. There is a overall flaw in human nature to portray historical figures as great. Without bothering to realize they are human. When it is Their Very Humanity that made them great. Lincoln fought the civil War and he suffered greatly thru out the war. He suffered as the country suffered. Here in this film you feel Lincoln's despair and his anguish at trying to end a war. And to free slaves and abolish slavery from America forever. But he faced fierce objections to his 13th admenment . This film focuses strongly on Lincoln's last few months alive as he struggles to create peace. and to free slaves and make them part of the human race. Sally Field not really my favourite actress shines as the tragic Mary Todd Lincoln. Lincoln's wife has always been regarded as Lincoln's crazy wife. And yet here she shines as Lincoln's strongest supporter as well as his wife. there are some very tender moments as Lincoln plays with his youngest son These scenes are the ones that got my attention. Simply because You never view Lincoln as a father to the world or to history he was a president. But he was a father. And this film shows his relationship with his oldest Robert and his youngest son Tad. And it shows his struggles to be both a loving father and a father who wants to do what is right by his sons. Now Tommy Lee Jones simply sparkles like a diamond. Tommy Lee Jones is one of the world's greatest actors and here he shows it. His Thaddeous Stevens comes across As a conflicted fighter for equal rights. All he wants i to make blacks equal under the law to make them free men. and he has a very personal reason to. But in the end all he has to settle for is simply the first step and that is abolishing slavery forever. I viewed this film as a snapshot of historical value because it reminds us it wasn't easy to get from there to here .<br/><br/>That one man's honest struggle with himself and his desire to right a wrong overcame so much. Spielberg should have won the Oscar for this film. He made it seem like we were there. And for people who wanted Lincoln's childhood told well that has been told. This film focuses on more then just Lincoln. It focuses on the times and the people who made it. Incredible film. It's not a action film because it's not meant to be one. You want a action film featuring Abe Lincoln go see Abe Lincoln vampire hunter. This one is about the Real Lincoln and it's so much more enjoyable."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","7 October 2013"," Informative, Engaging & Enlightening, Lincoln Is Essential Viewing
","Helmed by one of the most celebrated filmmakers of all time & starring the greatest actor of his generation in a truly iconic role, Lincoln is an elegantly crafted, meticulously detailed & patiently narrated biopic that attempts to capture on screen the legacy of Abraham Lincoln; considered by many to be the greatest President in United States history and for the most part, it simply works.<br/><br/>Set in 1865 during the American Civil War, Lincoln chronicles the final four months in the life of US President Abraham Lincoln & focuses on his efforts to pass a landmark constitutional amendment that aims to abolish slavery forever from the United States. With thousands of people getting slaughtered everyday, Lincoln races against time to secure the future of his nation by obtaining enough votes before it is too late.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the 21st century has been a semi-retirement mode for the revered filmmaker but every once in a while, he does give us a glimpse of why he is one of the best in the business for Lincoln is crafted with precision attention to detail & accuracy, is highly character-driven & technically sound. Tony Kushner's script is another little gem that's patient with its content & takes a methodical approach in bringing the story to life.<br/><br/>Production design is stellar for the story really benefits from its authentic set pieces. Same can be said about the costumes as well. Cinematography makes excellent use of lighting & camera movements. Editing is where Lincoln becomes a two-way street for its deliberately slowed down pace makes the drama more immersive for some while for others, it becomes a snooze fest. And John Williams' music is yet another mesmerising addition to Spielberg- Williams collaboration.<br/><br/>But what actually saves the film & makes it worth sitting through all the frustrating & snail- paced narrative is the breathtaking performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. Nailing the looks, mannerisms & possibly the voice as well, Day-Lewis absolutely steals the show & it's hard to look elsewhere when he's on the screen. Sally Field ends up being a bit hammy in her role of Mary Todd Lincoln while Tommy Lee Jones is as reliable as ever in his rendition of Thaddeus Stevens.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Lincoln may not be what mainstream audience like to call ""entertaining"" due to its dialogue-driven plot, glacial pace, political storyline & lack of action but it still makes up for an engaging & informative historical drama that sheds an interesting light on the legend whose oratory skills & leadership qualities has continued to inspire & influence the politics around the world. Riding on Spielberg's assured direction & bolstered by Day-Lewis' knockout performance, Lincoln comes thoroughly recommended."

","Try as he might, director Steven Spielberg cannot get the emotional rivers running beneath this portrait of the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, and his efforts to obtain passage for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in the House of Representatives in the year 1865, which would formally abolish slavery in the country. Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis is predictably solid as the story-telling Lincoln, usually undermining his political anger and frustration with wry humor and a kind of cracker-barrel wisdom, and Sally Field is quite good (if perhaps uneasily cast) as the First Lady, an emotionally unstable Mary Todd Lincoln, yet the supporting performances fall short. Tommy Lee Jones does absolutely nothing with the role of Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, and Jackie Earle Haley continues to look lost amongst the talent as Confederate States Vice President Alexander H. Stephens. Spielberg takes a homespun approach to much of the visuals (cinematographer Janusz KamiÅ„ski's camera doting on Lincoln and child in a rocking chair, bathed in a lemony glow), but the verbal standoffs between adversaries (despite some prickly dialogue) are surprisingly stilted. **1/2 from ****"

"bob-790-196018","7","1","2","24 June 2013"," You need a lot of patience with this movie
","They didn't have electric lighting in the 1860s, and there are quite a few scenes in ""Lincoln"" where you become well aware of the fact. There's no question that the movie strives to be faithful to the time and the specific historical events. Lincoln's voice is portrayed as somewhat high-pitched because by all accounts that is what it was like. His tendency to drift off into goofy or even scatological stories that may or may not be amusing to all around him seems also to be quite accurate. And of course the screenplay, based on a distinguished recent work of history, goes into great detail about the manipulations and machinations involved in the politicking over the proposed 13th Amendment.<br/><br/>The familiar saying about laws and sausages--that it's better if you don't see either as they are being made--applies here. The politicking and scheming and patronage payoffs are tiresome. Let's face it, that's what legislation is still like today. The movie has nothing new to say about such matters except--and it's a big exception--the one most involved in this sausage making is Lincoln himself. He certainly doesn't look like a John Ford folk hero here, nor a Raymond Massey demigod.<br/><br/>And that's perhaps the main theme of ""Lincoln""--that Lincoln was heroic precisely because in part he was a down and dirty man just like the rest of us. You need patience to see that out of this lowdown mess emerges a constitutional amendment that remains a guarantor of human freedom. Little by little you see the grandeur of Lincoln's vision--combined with a sly and cunning sense of how to make that vision reality, a lawyer's understanding that the Emancipation Proclamation would never be enough, and a political realist's understanding of the importance of timing. The man who tells goofy stories and is afraid to anger his wife turns out to be a genius and a true hero, a national treasure.<br/><br/>That said, the movie does try one's patience. There's a lot of speechifying, a lot of dim rooms, too little open space. It's a literally dark, claustrophobic picture."

","I'm a huge fan of bio-flicks, historical dramas, and Daniel Day-Lewis so I was really excited to see this movie. Steven Spielberg directed it, so I knew it would be good. Indeed it was! It boasted an incredible cast, script and artistic elements such as set and costumes etc. It was emotional and moving, but had moments of comic relief as well.<br/><br/>Oh Daniel Day-Lewis, how amazing you are... Every time I watch one of his movies I'm just floored by his talent and commitment to his craft. To quote a friend, ""he was more Lincoln-y than Lincoln"". I am never ceased to be amazed by his ability to transform himself into a character. He was Abraham Lincoln in this movie. He had the accent, the mannerisms, the carriage all down. He made me want to time travel and go meet the real Abraham Lincoln. I have no idea what I'd say to him but I bet it would be an interesting conversation.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln, what a guy... It's been a long time since I took United States history but this movie reminded me of what an amazing President he was. When you think about what was occurring in history during his time in office, it's miraculous that he was able to get our country back together. This movie focused on the politics in 1865, the year the 13th Amendment passed and the Civil War ended. Despite feeling a little confused because I've forgotten a lot of U.S. history, I really enjoyed the drama and conflict of the film. Politics is tricky business, in 1865 and nowadays. I thought that this film showed the issues with the bi- party system really tastefully and accurately. It was like a little history lesson, just more fun!<br/><br/>I really recommend everyone to see this movie. It was inspiring and captivating and completely worth seeing for the fact that Daniel Day- Lewis is phenomenal if nothing else. Other brilliant performances in the film: Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant and Jackie Earl Haley as Alexander Stephens."

","Obviously this is a huge movie event, but I was disappointed. Here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>1. Daniel Day Lewis really looks like Lincoln, and from what I've read, acts somewhat like Lincoln. His performance is outstanding.<br/><br/>2. The production value is impressive - sets, costumes, etc.<br/><br/>3. I believe it gives an accurate portrayal of the legislative process. All of the negotiations and back room dealings are fascinating.<br/><br/>The not so good.<br/><br/>1. It is not really about Lincoln, but about the push for the 13th amendment. In this movie, Lincoln is more of a character in the story of this legislation. This is fine I guess, but not what I expected. I would have felt the same way if ""Jaws"" turned out to be an expose on shark cage construction. <br/><br/>2. It is difficult to follow. There are so many characters (mostly congressman) that appear nameless. The dialog seems accurate for the period, but there is a lot of it. At times, it seems to erode into random conversations. I sensed some ad libbing.<br/><br/>3. It is boring. Sure, Lewis looks a lot like Lincoln, and the set is nice, but there are long periods between any significant or powerful scenes.<br/><br/>As with most Spielberg efforts, this is an impressive production. Just don't plan to go away knowing any more about ""Lincoln"""
"raphaklopper","10","1","2","16 April 2013"," Another Steven Spielberg Masterpiece and another role where Lewis kill's!
","That's what happened, Steven Spielberg asked Robert Zemeckis to borrow him the car of Dr. Emmett, went back in time by 5 minutes before the death of Abraham Lincoln and brought him to the present and asked him to act as himself in the days before the 13th amendment been approved... that's what happened (just kidding)!<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" from start to finish is fantastic, the characters and the story are in the greatest perfection, Tony Kushner should have made a very careful study to present the historical facts in the film so perfect. The film from beginning seems boring, that's because it dosen't focus attention on the civil war (although it appears to be and the reason for all the confusion) but in the political area, during the civil war, the union government was in a total chaos, in one side the Republicans who wanted the approval of the 13th amendment and thus the abolition because they thought this was the only way the war has an end, and the other side the Democrats who wanted the opposite, but after the war but slightly modified.<br/><br/>The politic in this movie it is very well built, and Spielberg can make it so exciting, and the historical picture that makes this film is fantastic, and the historical characters that make up the film are superb as Lincoln himself.<br/><br/>And another positive point on the film is that it is not a biographic film about Lincoln, but in his last days of life, but throughout the film we can deduct his past, and the characters around him. We can see a Lincoln so realistic and perfect, we see the person he was, and his values, we see the hero he was.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is PERFECT in every detail, his Lincoln is fantastic and so real, Sally Field fantastic as always, the wife of Lincoln smart and kind with a fantastic performance; Tommy Lee Jones nor comments, he indulges perfectly her character, the great Thaddeus Stevens, and the connection that Lincoln and Thaddeus has in the movie is so fantastic to see, all this phenomenal cast on their characters.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" proves four things: Steven Spielberg continues to make FANTASTIC movies; Daniel Day Lewis is a PERFECT actor; politics can be exciting, and that there existed Man and women who have fought and are fighting for equality for all, and that historical films can be fun and be true MASTERPIECES."
"ParanoidAndroid97","9","1","2","12 April 2013"," A superb political film about Honest Abe's struggle to abolish slavery
","Of all the heroes that America holds true to its heart, there is nobody more loved, more respected and more admired than Abraham Lincoln. A man symbolised both by his beard and by his will for justice, Abe has been begging for a film to be made about him since the day he died. And if Lincoln were still alive, he'd certainly tip his famous stovepipe hat to this. 'Lincoln' details the former President's struggles to abolish slavery and create an honest and just society. It features snobby enemies, excellent costumes, a brilliant script, historical and political accuracy (It descends a little into hero-worshipping later on in the film, but makes sure to compensate by showing that Lincoln was by no means perfect) and, best of all, an absolutely superb portrayal of the man himself, portrayed, of course, by Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis is, quite simply, the perfect Lincoln. He has clearly studied the former President from the way he walks to the posture he adopts whilst riding a horse, and is so convincing that you really feel as if the man himself is there with you, in the theatre- and this prompts me to call Day-Lewis' performance not a portrayal, but a reincarnation. He is so good, in fact, that people knew he would win the Academy Award even before they had seen the film. So why, you ask, does this not get 10/10? Well, despite its exemplary acting, it can become rather boring at times and, as I mentioned before, it dissolves a little into hero- worshipping and, on occasion, gets facts wrong in order to do so. However, as everything else in the film is close to flawless, I give this film an excellent 9/10."

","A film of such greatness rarely reaches a mass audience and touches the soul so deeply. There are those reviewing the film here who are ignorant enough of history to say this motion picture is inaccurate. There are those here who found it boring and to explain that, one must consider the source. Those who do not appreciate this motion picture do not deserve our contempt but only our pity. They are empty shells who are sadly blind to beauty and truth and love. Is the Pieta, Mona Lisa, or Parthenon falsely conceived or boring? For this is a film of such power that only the thoughtful among us, those of us self-reflective and open enough to appreciate the truly artful attempt by this director and screen writer to make a historical icon flesh and blood to the extent we can feel his very breath upon our upturned faces. Daniel Day-Lewis is nothing less than brilliant and in a matter of seconds becomes the Lincoln he portrays. He is stunning in a performance unequaled in the history of cinema. The supporting cast is magnificent as well, especially Tommy Lee Jones in a performance that sets the screen afire, rips one's heart from their chests, and returns it to them renewed. What a triumph for these two screen giants! Although Sally Fields is indeed excellent as Mary Todd Lincoln, one can only wish that another true artist of Emily Watson's caliber would have had the opportunity to give the character a bit more depth and life. Ms. Watson was incredibly unforgettable in The Boxer, a film in which she shared the screen with Day-Lewis and together they created a chemistry that was almost nuclear in its explosiveness. Perhaps that would have been more than an audience could bear, her eyes too soulful that they might overwhelm us, rendering us senseless. For there is only so much artistic greatness that can be absorbed from a single cinematic experience of this kind. Lincoln is a film that will enhance the world's view of an American president who is too often thought of in ways that great statues are appreciated and honored. Lincoln brings the man to life and in so doing, it reaches for the heavens and hands us a handful of stardust. There are truly no words to describe a film that touches our very hearts and souls and leaves us changed forever. It is an experience that one must gift themselves with, as those who have given so much of their being to create a cinematic gift, a creative labor of such exquisiteness that it will forever shine throughout time. Not only has motion picture greatness been given eternal definition through this film, it is the cinematic equivalent of an epic poem that echoes through the ages of humanity."

"JamesHitchcock","9","1","2","15 February 2013"," The Grand Historical Style
","With ""Lincoln"", Steven Spielberg returns to the theme of the fight against slavery in America, which he had earlier tackled in ""Amistad"". It is not a comprehensive biopic of Abraham Lincoln, or, for that matter, a comprehensive history of the American Civil War. It only covers the last few months of Lincoln's life, between January and April 1865, and concentrates on his efforts in to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which formally abolished slavery, passed by the House of Representatives. <br/><br/>The conservative British journalist Max Hastings recently seized on this film as an example of American cinematic patriotism and bewailed the supposed fact that the British cinema does not currently produce similarly patriotic offerings. With all due respect to Mr Hastings, this strikes me as a classic example of ""What do they know of England, who only England know?"" Hollywood these days is not always the bastion of American nationalism it once was- indeed, some critics, such as Michael Medved, have attacked it for being insufficiently patriotic. And ""Lincoln"" itself, although it is undoubtedly sympathetic to the President, paints a much less sympathetic picture of the American political system. <br/><br/>The Democrats are represented by Congressman Fernando Wood of New York, a fiery orator who speaks eloquently of republican freedoms but who is also a bigoted racist and an apologist for slavery and the Confederacy. (During the Civil War there were a number of Northerners, known as ""Copperheads"", who supported the South's right to secede). Conservative Republicans like Francis Preston Blair oppose secessionism but would be prepared to abandon their support for abolitionism if retaining slavery were the price to be paid for ending the war and saving the Union. Radical Republicans such as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania are sincere in their detestation of slavery and their belief in racial equality, but often show contempt for democracy and a hatred of white Southerners. <br/><br/>The Confederate leaders, realising that their cause is lost militarily, are prepared to negotiate the readmission of the Southern States to the Union on condition that they are permitted to retain slavery. Such a compromise peace would be attractive to many Northern politicians, but unacceptable to Lincoln who believes that the war will have been fought in vain if slavery is allowed to continue. He knows that his Emancipation Proclamation is of dubious legal validity and is therefore anxious that the 13th Amendment be passed as soon as possible, fearing that once the slave states have been readmitted to the Union they will be able to block it. In order to secure passage for the amendment, Lincoln is prepared to countenance underhand methods, such as offering prize Government jobs to Democratic Congressmen in exchange for their support. When asked about the Confederate peace mission he gives a reply which is, strictly speaking, truthful but nevertheless misleading. <br/><br/>The film has been nominated for twelve Academy Awards and I hope that it does well when the results are announced later this month. Although I have not seen all the films which have been nominated for Best Picture, I would certainly rate this one higher than, say, ""Les Miserables"" or ""Life of Pi"". Daniel Day-Lewis is always a fine actor, and his performance here as Abraham Lincoln may well make him the first man ever to win three Best Actor Oscars. His portrayal here is, of course, very different to his two Oscar-winning roles as the crippled Irish writer Christy Brown in ""My Left Foot"" and as the ruthless oilman Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"", but all three are equally compelling. His Lincoln here is not (as I had expected) an orator with a deep, booming voice, but surprisingly soft-spoken, a practical politician who possesses an immense moral authority despite the compromises he is forced to make in order to secure the triumph of liberty. There are a number of other performances which stand out, especially from Sally Field as Lincoln's troubled wife Mary and Tommy Lee Jones as Stevens. <br/><br/>Spielberg's early attempts at making historical dramas on weighty themes, ""The Color Purple"" and ""Empire of the Sun"", were rather ponderous, long-winded and heavy-handed. Ever since ""Schindler's List"" in the early nineties, however, this has become the style of film-making with which he has seemed most at home. His attempts to recapture the spirit of his early science-fiction and adventure movies have seemed lightweight by comparison; I enjoyed ""War Horse"", for example, far more than ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"". <br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is another example of Spielberg's mastery of the grand historical style. The action mostly takes place indoors, against the grand but sombre interiors of the White House and the Capitol, and the look of the film is generally dark, a reminder of the tragic events which form the backdrop to the action. The film is dominated by dialogue rather than physical action, apart from one brief battle scene near the beginning. Even Lincoln's assassination, although referred to, is not shown directly. Yet Spielberg handles his material so well that his account of murky nineteenth-century political intrigues becomes as thrilling as any action-adventure movie. Most importantly, we are never allowed to forget what is at stake, the question of whether American democracy means that all men are created equal or merely (as many Southerners and some Northerners preferred to believe) that all white men are created equal. 9/10"

","I have to admit this review is not so much of the movie but of the reviews. I am getting sick of these history revisionists who scoff at the traditional image of Lincoln and seek to replace it with an image of some conniving, profiteering politician. To hear the modern 'historians' tell it, the Civil War was totally unrelated to slavery; it was all about States rights and secession or maybe just power and greed. But that's like saying that ""My car doesn't turn because I turn the steering wheel; it turns because the wheel turns."" How do you separate the slavery issue from secession in 1860? Read the diaries of the day - they understood it to be about slavery even before the emancipation proclamation. ""History"" can be made to say what you want it to and there is a temptation for those writing new books to come up with ""new theories"" just to sell them. I think in the 150 years since the Civil War, the losers have re-written the history. I don't say that this is 100% the greatest movie ever made on the subject but I do applaud Spielberg pointing out that yes, Lincoln did effectively end slavery in this country - period."

After movie ends you will say Lincoln was a great Leader and visionary and of-course Daniel was his shadow.<br/><br/>Point to be noted: 12 Oscar Nominations.<br/><br/>I think this is sufficient information to rush for the ""Lincoln""."
"SchimoCro","8","1","2","7 February 2013"," Great historical drama with perfect acting, detailed scenery, excellent visual impression and great dialogues
","Spielberg worked on this project for ten years and his effort can not be disputed. Just like perfect acting, detailed scenery, excellent visual impression and great dialogues, which were, like complete screenplay, developed for six years by Tony Kushner. <br/><br/>The film deals only with the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) life, concentrating on January of 1865. when the House of Representatives debated and ultimately voted on 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, banning slavery except as punishment for a crime. Not surprisingly, a lot of historical facts and figures are idealized, and the very issue of the Civil War is simplified just on the question of slavery, although historical inaccuracy is less then it was expected. But the broader historical context is more or less historically accurate, ie about just exactly as most historians believe it happened. How much Americans find this topic important and controversial is shown by changing names of the voters against the 13th Amendment in order to avoid problems for their living descendants. With this in mind it is difficult to understand why the film did not gave time to explanation of such voting and to explanation of reason for Democratic Party to vote against immediate and absolute abolition of slavery just as it did not elaborate reasons for such pursuit of the Republican Party for its abolition. <br/><br/>There's a lot of historical figures in move and it is quite difficult to catch up with everything without any prior knowledge about topic. That's reason why to those simply not interested in history or politics Lincoln could be boring. But Lincoln is actually quite dynamic, action relatively quickly moves from Lincoln's personal life and his relationship with his wife and sons to the relationships within his Cabinet and the House of Representatives, conflicts inside Republican party and peace negotiations with the Confederation. Each segment is almost entirely based on fantastic dialogues, although it is impossible to ignore the excessive pathos inside a big amount of them, but that's not unexpected given the subject matter. There's a lot talking about acting in Lincoln, and that's with reason. Daniel Day-Lewis embodies Lincoln exactly as historical records describe him. Such performance as Day-Lewis's in this movie is rarely seen. The rest of the cast, Sally Fiel (Mary Todd Lincoln), David Strathairom (William Seward), Tommy Lee Jones (Thaddeus Stevens) and Hal Holbrook (Preston Blair) also did outstanding job. James Spader in the role of W.N. Bilbo, is maybe even biggest surprise. In every scene where he appears he draws all the attention to himself.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg himself has done a great job, this is definitely one of technically best films of his. Dialogue scenes are generally perfectly done with great camera job, he pulled out maximum form actors, every scene is visually fantastic, scenery is maximally authentic, except for a few exceptions, one of which stands out. Wrong flags of the Union! Definitely one of the most mature Spielberg's movies. From the technical part, musical background deserves negative critics. It's insipid, forgetful and sometimes completely missed. The characterization, even of Lincoln, looks kinda hasty and superficial. Actions of some characters sometimes are not explained, sometimes the explanations are banal and sometimes historically incorrect. Although in general such cases aren't big deal but while viewing it's distracting and causes some questions after viewing it. <br/><br/>Lincoln certainly isn't film for everyone. Non-Americans with no interest in history and politics could find it to be slow, boring, uninteresting and pathetic, and that's completely understandable. But technical superiority is hard to dispute and that's proved with target audience being delighted in combination with, probably far from being deservedly, number of nominations and awards."
"enochsneed","8","1","2","7 February 2013"," Well-made but strangely unmemorable
","I had been looking forward to seeing 'Lincoln' for many months but found myself feeling let down after actually watching it. It is beautifully set and photographed and the acting is excellent (although I found Daniel Day-Lewis's performance less compelling than David Strathairn's cynically pragmatic Seward).<br/><br/>And yet... the film left me empty. This was signalled in the opening scene where a black soldier questions Lincoln very closely and even aggressively about his policies towards black people. Lincoln refuses to be drawn into any debate, he keeps his own counsel rather than make any declaration of principles. We have to remember Lincoln was a politician, and a very clever one. Everything he did was timed for maximum effect. The Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 turned the war from maintenance of the Union to a moral crusade which undercut the 'Peace Democrats' in Congress. The 13th Amendment was a similar proposition.<br/><br/>The film treats slavery is treated as an abstract legal and political issue. I think 'Django Unchained' says more about the reality of Southern slavery than 'Lincoln' does.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I felt the film took a far too reverential view of Lincoln himself (no mention of his views on Native Americans, for example), and had too much of that annoying self-regard Americans have: that they always act from the highest motives and from a morally superior position. History, as we all know, shows this is not always the case.<br/><br/>Update 29 June: Just watched the film again on DVD. Maybe my first viewing was disturbed by reading the subtitles in a Portuguese cinema. I apologise to Daniel Day-Lewis, he deserved his Oscar. However my overall impressions remain. If you are not fascinated by political procedure and finagling this is not the film for you."

","This was exceptional. I feel as if it wasn't a movie, but some sort of time probe back to the Civil War and we were watching the real people. Day Lewis literally was Lincoln. The dry as dust dead men of the House Of Representatives were brought back to life. I only hope these characterisations were accurate, as they were brilliant. Tommy Lee Jones also was on top of his game, along with the underrated David Strathern who was once again a rock solid foil to the more famous actors. I even forgave James Spaader for some of his previous juvenile work, as here as a middle aged man he was brilliant. So many good scenes, but the murder seen through the eyes of the son was a brilliant twist. The inevitable Ford Theatre endgame is overused in a dozen other films and TV series and needed a different approach. Many on here have called this film boring - the usual action film buffs who have no patience - I myself didn't even notice the passage of time. In fact the weakest scene was the battle scene at the beginning which seemed to have been shot by Mel Gibson it was such a mess. The usual pell mell chaos a la 'Braveheart' we have suffered since that film. (See 'Gettysburg' or 'Glory' for how to do it properly.) Oh, and the hundred or so extras walking in the rain without inverting their rifles were in danger of a breech explosion. Did no one, not even Mel, spot that howler ?<br/><br/>When is the DVD out ?

","Steven Spielberg is a mixed blessing â€“ over the years he has given us some of the most inspired moments in Cinema history (Jaws), at other times he can be intensely sickly-sweet and overtly sentimental and obvious (The Colour Purple, E.T, The Terminal), either way Hollywood certainly wouldn't be the same without him.<br/><br/>So it was with some caution that I approached Lincoln his new, Oscar nominated, collaboration with Tony Kushner (Munich) starring the enigmatic Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>DDL is pretty much always a dead cert to be a joy to watch, so there was no fear here, but how else will Spielberg approach the last few months of one of the greatest and most popular American presidents of all time (in a weekend where apparently all I did was watch film about popular American presidents in preparation of the superbowl).<br/><br/>And as the film progressed, to my astonishment, the answer revealed itself much in the way this film does generally; with real class and subtlety.<br/><br/>It would be easy for a lesser-experienced director to just go straight for the jugular in re-telling the story of the man in charge of probably America's most tumultuous period... www.ravechild.co.uk"
"itamarscomix","7","1","2","3 February 2013"," The History Channel Presents
","A lot can be said for Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as Abraham Lincoln - it's amazing indeed. We all knew it would be the second the casting was announced. Day-Lewis breathes life into one of American history's most mythological figures, making him charismatic, larger than life, but sweet and spiteful and just human too. He's not alone - the supporting cast (special mention to Tommy Lee Jones) all do a commendable job, slipping comfortably into their characters, and delivering their dusty lines in a way that feels natural and fresh, as if you've stepped back straight into Lincoln's time.<br/><br/>And yet - unfortunately - the wonderful acting is the only thing that makes Lincoln anything more than a History Channel docu-drama, albeit a very well-budgeted one. Beneath the superb actors; the flawless set and costume designs; the high-contrast, full of pathos cinematography that places Lincoln with a convenient halo behind his head every time; there's a very dull story treatment that moves at a steady and monotonic pace, with no ups and downs, no tension and no climaxes. It deals with the loaded and painful subject of slavery, yet somehow manages to completely avoid any sort of emotion. The viewer doesn't care about slavery, or about the 13th amendment - we care because we know Lincoln was a good guy and we want him to win. Slavery isn't given a face, slaves aren't given a face, and even when the amendment does pass we feel nothing. This is jarring when coming from Steven Spielberg, the master of emotional manipulation, who pulled at every heart string with last year's schmaltzy 'War Horse'.<br/><br/>Lincoln is informative. Enough so that, if you're at all interested in the time period, the 2.5 hour runtime will go by reasonably quickly and the film will remain interesting throughout. It's also, admittedly, Spielberg's best film in years - since Catch Me If You Can, if not since Schindler's List. But one of the best films of the year? Hardly. At the end of the day, it feels like a very well-made historical reconstruction, and not a drama film. The points where it might have striven for some emotional connection - Lincoln's scenes with his wife Mary Todd (Sally Field) and son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and of course the assassination itself - are handled very poorly and feel like a lame attempt to squeeze some feeling out of the audience; again, a shocker when coming from a master like Spielberg. A film that could have been so much better than it is, but will still be shown to school children for years to come."

It didn't have what I'd describe as the usual Spielberg schmaltzy pathos and fall-back on playing emotional games with the audience.<br/><br/>As a biographical work I think it is good, painting a portrait of the man by focusing on his thoughts and action in a short period of time, rather than trying to tell his life story.<br/><br/>I don't know if the facts of Lincoln's manipulation of political events is correct, but the spirit of the film seems true to the little I know of Lincoln from his own writings.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie isn't great in my opinion - too dependent on trying to immediately impress the audience I felt - and it then changes tack into complex political discussion. Don't give up to early, as it does drag at times. It all comes together later on and gives a real feel for what the characters must have experienced in real events.<br/><br/>Good movie.

","Most historical films tend to drag on, and seem longer than their play times, however, ""Lincoln"" managed to keep the viewers interest for the full two and a half hours it was played. This movie actually portrayed the simplicity of the time, but even that back then there were still crooks who would kill just to get their views empowered, such as John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln's traits are shown throughout the movie accurately. He was plagued during his presidency with the war, slavery, and depression, and this movie emphasized these issues. He was also a people's person, and he would talk to many of the citizens unprotected, as the movie clearly shows in the opening scene. Daniel Lewis played the role of Lincoln exactly as it should be played. Since the movie was written like a play, there were some slight changes to the actual events, but most of the information in this film was correct about Lincoln. Not entirely focused on the Civil War battles, but more on the politics behind it, ""Lincoln"" showed that Slavery was a key issue that the Politicians had to address for the sake of our nation. It also focused on part of Lincoln's social life with his family, and friends. Overall, this movie was a great contribution to the legacy of Lincoln. It not only showed that Lincoln handled the issues of his presidency well, but also that Lincoln was a man who stood up for his beliefs and wanted to end the strife known as slavery."

I feel like the Congress scenes embodied these struggles perfectly. Before watching this,I didn't realize how much public opinion differed in the north, I previously assumed that most everyone in the North agreed on how slavery should be handled.I also now have the respect for Lincoln not only as a political figure but also as a person since the movie did a good job of showing him on a personal level. On the other hand, at some times the movie was hard to follow and it took awhile in the beginning to get going. But overall, I thought the movie was good."

Daniel Day-Lewis' Oscar-worthy portrayal of Lincoln was seen in appearance and attitude. The events of the time such as the passing of the 13th amendment were accurate and interesting without much change to the history.

Daniel Day-Lewis renders an Oscar-worthy acting appearance as Lincoln with his flawless gesture and voice. He is pitch-perfect to portray Lincoln's witty, firm and earthly characteristics. Besides, Tommy Lee Jones, Strathairn, Sally Field and actually the entire elite cast demand a huge round of loud laud for their ravishing performances. The voting session-- Yay--Nay seems too engaging with overwhelmed incitement. In addition, the scene where Tommy hands gift to his wife moves me most with deep emotions and pleasure.

","Spielberg assembles a top quality cast into a first class production dramatizing a key historical moment in U.S. history to create a first- class production that is the Oscar Best Picture film to beat. Oscar noms should also be plentiful among the cast most obviously for Daniel Day Lewis who demonstrates his absolute mastery early on in the film. As the title character, Lewis relates a story in Lincoln slow Midwestern cadence in order to argue a point of law and the audience finds itself identifying and agreeing with point as audiences of Lincoln era would have been swayed by the actual 16th President. James Spader may also see a Best Supporting Nom with a lively portrayal of a fixer called Bilbo whose nefarious activities help to secure the passage of the 13th amendment. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field contribute gravitas to the proceedings if not actual standout performances. The writing may also pull a few nominations as the 2 1/2 hour running time slides by quickly due nearly entirely to genuine eloquence in the script. Spielberg's cinematography yields history textbook moments particularly of Lincoln horseback reviewing the Civil War battlefields. In short, Lincoln clearly seizes the title of this year's ""The King's Speech."""

"howard.schumann","10","3","12","25 November 2012"," Freedom's a thing that has no ending
","In his two-volume biography of Abraham Lincoln, Carl Sandburg wrote, ""A tree is best measured when it's down."" Since his assassination in 1865 by the pro-Confederate actor John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln has become almost a mythological figure, an icon of American idealism. When he died and his body was carried on a funeral train through seven states along a 1,662-mile route, thirty million people lined the railroad tracks waiting for the ""lonesome train on a lonesome track with seven coaches painted black."" In the cities where the train stopped, 1.5 million people viewed the fallen President in his coffin, yet today many of his attributes as a real person have been obscured by the legend.<br/><br/>Stephen Spielberg, in his masterly Lincoln, attempts to redirect us to the man and the qualities of his leadership that carried the nation through a devastating civil war, the man that Karl Marx called ""one of the rare men who succeed in becoming great, without ceasing to be good."" Written by Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Tony Kushner (Angels in America, Munich), using Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""Team of Rivals"" as a source along with dialogue and speeches from the historical record, the Lincoln that emerges is not a statuesque hero but a man capable of folksy and often scatological humor as well as great oratory and spiritual depth, a down-to-earth man whose stories drove home his points with consummate skill.<br/><br/>As the sad-eyed, stoop-shouldered President with the soft speech but steely resolve, Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a masterful performance capturing Lincoln's speech, mannerisms, and mood swings with a rare authenticity, even though any performance can only give a hint of the mystery of his true greatness. The film is also dotted with colorful characters portrayed by a superb ensemble cast including Tommie Lee Jones as the passionate abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, Sally Field as a sympathetic Mary Todd Lincoln, David Strathairn as Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Seward, Hal Holbrook as Preston Blair, a Conservative Republican, and Joseph-Gordon Levitt as Lincoln's son Robert whose desire to enlist in the Union army is strongly opposed by his mother, still healing from the death of eleven-year old Willie three years ago.<br/><br/>Lincoln opens on a battlefield where the carnage is horrific. The President sits on a crate at an Army camp and talks to the soldiers who voice their grievances to him about pay inequality. As Lincoln offers to consider their requests, both white and black soldiers recite from memory the famous Gettysburg Address which celebrates the ""brave men, living or dead, who struggled here,"" and calls for ""a new birth of freedom,"" a phrase that, in that context, can only have meant the freedom of black people from slavery. We do not see a public speech until much later when Lewis movingly delivers Lincoln's Second Inaugural address in which Lincoln specifically identifies the clash over slavery as the most important cause of the war, and invokes the name of God in indicting America's offenses against black people.<br/><br/>Rather than revisit Lincoln's traditional biography, Spielberg zeroes in on the period from January to April 1865, the last four months of his life, focusing on the lesser known story of the 1864 fight to pass the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, a struggle that came shortly after Lincoln and the Republicans had won a substantial victory in the 1864 elections. Though Spielberg has no hesitation about Lincoln's commitment to end slavery, his own struggle with racism during his lifetime is hinted at in his conversation with Mary Todd Lincoln's servant, Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben).<br/><br/>Lincoln is correctly worried that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 will be seen as a temporary war measure and that it might be reversed by the courts after peace was achieved. He knows how crucial it is to pass an amendment outlawing slavery before a peace deal might compromise and allow the South to maintain their ""way of life."" Lincoln's advisers plead with him not to press for a vote which they believe will be defeated and jeopardize the chances to end the war. The political fight for passage shows a different side of his personality, the practical but forceful politician who is willing to take risks and is not above wheeling and dealing, yet whose policies are always grounded in principle.<br/><br/>Spielberg suggests that the President used three lobbyists played by James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson, and was not above buying votes but the verdict is out. Harvard Professor David Herbert Donald says that ""If Lincoln used other means of persuading congressman to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment, his actions were not recorded. Conclusions about the President's role rested on gossip and later recollections of those of Thaddeus Stevens."" Whatever the case (and the truth may have been stretched in giving the House news about an approaching Confederate Peace delegation), the result worked for the good of humanity.<br/><br/>Lincoln is not only a paean to a great man but a tribute to the kind of honest adult cinema that used to be commonplace but is now a rarity. It is a passionate work about a towering figure who left an enduring legacy of freedom, but one whose legacy will not be complete until no one is ever again deprived of their civil rights. As blacklisted author Millard Lampell's Cantata The Lonesome Train tells us, ""The slaves were free; the war was won, but the fight for freedom was just begun. Freedom's a thing that has no ending. It needs to be cared for; it needs defending. A great long job for many hands, carrying freedom 'cross the land."" Spielberg's Lincoln may help us to renew that journey with increased determination."

"Aldri7","6","2","7","19 December 2012"," spellbinding or boring...
","While watching Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" tonight, I tried not to get too bored and so from time to time I would pinch my arm, reminding myself that this is an important, historical epic. Fidgeting slightly, I thought to myself that what I really should have done was bone up on my history BEFORE going into the theater so that I could write a though provoking review afterwards. I mean, I don't mind films like this one as long as I can approach them from the proper frame of reference. And so let me just say this to anyone interested in going to see this film: It is deep and political. You have to actually listen to the dialogue and challenge yourself to think. Otherwise, there is no point in you being in the theater.<br/><br/>But is it worth it? Taking on that challenge? Well, the film did not succeed in stirring up a lot of emotions and feelings inside of me. I wanted to feel proud or patriotic when I left the theater, but I didn't. Scenes showing crowds celebrating after the 13th amendment passed didn't bring on the goose bumps. So, in a nutshell, all of that effort I put into listening and understanding what was going on didn't really lead to any payoff. So here's the deal...<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is about a man, and as a story about a man it excelled on many levels. Daniel Day- lewis was exceptional in his portrayal of Lincoln with all of his shrewd political talent mixed with humble roots. He truly gave Lincoln heroic qualities and succeeded brilliantly in setting the man apart from his contemporaries. it was all there: the gentleness and kindly soft spoken manner. The humor and self depreciation. The oratorial skill, shrewd politicking and occasional fire and bombast. Simply put, Day-Lewis's Lincoln was every bit the brooding, humble, towering figure we all know and love from our history books. Well done, everyone.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, ""Lincoln"" was not so much a biography as it was a film about the passage of the 13th amendment to the constitution abolishing slavery. Pretty dry stuff, in other words, which was unfortunate. I mean, as a story, there was not a lot there. OK, you need votes. You need to wheel and deal a little bit. And of course there are other players too - some of whom are on your team, and some of whom are not. So, but If you enjoy courtroom antics, politicspeak and legal debates, perhaps this might have kept you entertained throughout most of the movie. Unfortunately, I don't that much though. And the ending is a foregone conclusion despite attempts to hype it up. The amendment passes and everyone goes home, right? So now what we have is not a stirring biography about a man but a not-so-stirring story about an historically important political victory. IMHO, that was a shame. So with that in mind, how could the movie have been improved?<br/><br/>Well, to tell you the truth, I really don't know. The problem is that treating the slavery issue sympathetically but without any pandering, condescension nor ""bleeding heart"" sentimentality is not easy. To Spielberg's credit, black's appearing in the film are given understated roles and treated with great dignity and respect. White senators on the other hand are often shown to be grimy, disreputable, tempestuous and rowdy. OK, I get the point. But still, something was missing here, and to me that was context, i.e. no one really showed us what a world with slavery was like and how it would be so much better without it. We do see scenes from the civil war, and the carnage there forms an important backdrop to what is going on in the White House. But that is somewhat divorced from the slavery issue itself. The reality went sort of like this: Slavery lead to the war which lead to the 13th amendment. But in the movie we just see the war and the 13th amendment. Tie ins to slavery are there, but they are somewhat of an abstraction. You don't FEEL the tie in in other words. I think that is my point. And without a tie in, I didn't get that feel good vibe when they counted the votes in the end. Could the movie have benefited from having a more prominent black character? Possibly, but it would have had to have been handled delicately to avoid the ""bleeding heart"" problem. I guess I don't know who would have been up to the challenge here. You would think though that Spielburg would have been if anyone was. <br/><br/>But anyway, so Lincoln is a movie that is a bit hard for me to recommend and comprehend at this point. Maybe I need to sleep on it. As a portrait of a man and a time, it often succeeds very nicely, and you will smile at the humor, the sets and choreography, and the knowledge that a master of the cinema is behind it all. But the plot revolving around the 13th amendment was static, predictable, and devoid of any real tie in to the very issue it was attempting to address. Stepping back a bit and doing a better job of relating what was going on inside the offices with what was going on in the surrounding countryside would have given the plot more meaning. I mean, I'm all for senators negotiating, debating and trading barbs, but an entire movie devoted to that can get a bit tedious.<br/><br/>EDIT: and one final point - these days any movie about a world not of our own (Sci-Fi, fantasy, historical, etc) ought to include at least some CGI, IMHO. Show us a CGI panorama of DC, in other words. We do see fragments of the city, but you don't really get a sense of place here. Just my opinion.."
"suzykq5","10","2","7","3 December 2012"," Riveting
","In addition to being authentic and true to history, the movie is riveting. The casting is incredibly spot on. You never see the actor - only the role. Daniel is Lincoln is Daniel. Sally Field is beyond perfect. Ulysses played by Jared Harris exudes the essence of the General demonstrating his loyalty to his office and yet showing the struggles of the burden of leadership. Daniel does the same with his portrayal of Lincoln bringing his loving nature to the forefront along with his humility and tenderness. Daniel incredibly demonstrates the difficulty of knowing what the right thing to do is and then doing it. Historically symbolic. Well worth the time and I will most certainly see this again."
"princessabby44","10","2","7","3 December 2012"," A fabulous representation of American history.
","I thought this movie was fantastic. Daniel Day-Lewis portrays everything that I thought Lincoln would look like and act like. It was so cool to see history play out on screen in a way that felt very believable and not at all made up. I think the best part about this movie is that it didn't have to change the history too much or make the history more exciting to fit the story. The history stands out by itself. It was accurate yet not boring. The one thing that I did not like was at the beginning when it shows an American flag with 50 stars. At this time, there were not 50 states so that made me a bit mad. However, everything else was awesome. The costumes were of the times and so was the language used. Lincoln's actions with the amendment vote seemed to be correct. I loved how they showed his conflict with the constitutionality of his actions because at that time, it was a big deal having to interpret war powers. Also, I enjoyed how the House of Representatives got so mad when they suggested that women should have the vote. That made me laugh. This movie was fabulous and it provided me with a more in depth look at one of our nation's greatest presidents. If you are an American citizen, you should defiantly see this movie because it will give you a better understanding of America's history."
"nickmesafilms","10","2","7","2 December 2012"," Lincoln (2012) - Steven Spielberg + Daniel Day-Lewis = It Was Finally Meant to Be!
","The one and only Steven Spielberg has directed this historic biopic that re-tells the events taken place during the final months of Abraham Lincoln's presidency, and the troubles that he went through to pass the thirteenth amendment and abolish slavery, while dealing with family issues of his own. At a running time of 150 minutes, ""Lincoln"" is another terrific entry in Spielberg's life-long career as a film director. Perfectly casted as the determined president, Daniel Day-Lewis is a terrific method actor that always knocks the ball out of the park in every performance, whether playing a crippled writer in ""My Left Foot"", or an obsessed oil worker in ""There Will Be Blood"", and his performance in ""Lincoln"" is no exception. He definitely disappears into the character, and delivers a interesting take on this historical figure. He recreated the walk, talk, and mannerisms of this president very effectively, and he embodies the true spirit and wisdom that Lincoln was known for having, and he absolutely nails it. It's a performance that I hope will score Daniel Day-Lewis another Best Actor nomination. As for the supporting cast, Sally Field does a rather fine job playing Mary Todd Lincoln, and she stole every scene she was in. James Spader is perfect playing the sharp mind of W.N. Bilbo, and we get a few limited roles from big names such as David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley, and Michael Stuhlbarg. Tommy Lee Jones has been giving tons of Oscar consideration for his brave portrayal as Thaddeus Stevens, the one who seems to be dissatisfied with the thirteenth amendment. Although I fully believe that he wasn't in the film enough for me to truly adore him, I still thought he nailed it. There is no need for me to go into rough detail on how beautifully Steven Spielberg directs this movie. He always knows how to keep the viewer invested in the story, and delivers some stunning visuals to the piece, from Janusz Kaminski's remarkable use of cinematography, to the terrific musical scoring of John Williams. Entirely taken place in the White House and the Capitol Building, where the driving force in the film, is the interesting dialouge shared between the characters in the film, that deliver an interesting take on how Lincoln was able to pass this amendment. But although screenwriter Tony Kushner's script delivered some memorable moments for sure, there are some bloated moments that kind of let me off-guard, and although never leaving me bored, it's the moments of the political speak that left me a little dazed. When an entire movie has nothing but dialouge, it has to be very interesting, which it definitely is, but at times, kind of got me confused. There are also some moments when some characters felt unnecessary, or didn't feel developed well, and ""Lincoln"" would have been better off with a shorter running time, rather than 150 minutes. But, there was nothing bad that can affect the scope of this film. The masterful directing, brilliant acting, stunning visuals, and beautiful music, are all joined together for one interesting biography on one of the greatest American presidents. This is one of the most important films of the whole year. From the opening shot on the battlefield to the final moving speech at the end, ""Lincoln"" is one of 2012's best films. I can easily imagine Daniel Day-Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones, Steven Spielberg, and the movie itself getting nominated for a couple of awards. ""Lincoln"", in my review, ""historically intriguing and remarkable, if flawed""."
"rinconview","10","2","7","29 November 2012"," Exceptional Production!
","This was truly an amazing film about an amazing member of our human race. Lincoln (the film) remained on point though it could have run down many trails that would have diminished the value of its main character. My wife and I are somewhat knowledgeable of Lincoln's historical story which helps digest some of the film's content. We were both blown away and found ourselves holding back our emotions frequently throughout the film. I did take note of some audience members critiquing the film for its selection of cast and artistic value. I would suggest that if you attend you do so out of an appreciation of history and an interest in the story of an amazing human being, fitted for his time and selflessly sacrificing so much for our nation. It also proved that Congress has evolved little in the past one and a half centuries! This was the best motion picture experience of my 50 years."
"tracee","8","2","7","28 November 2012"," Deus Ex Machina
","This could easily work as a staged play. That was my immediate thought at some point during the opening scene in which Lincoln's oratory motivations/inspirations are espoused by first, a ""colored"" Union soldier, then a white one. And, for me, the movie continues in the same vein. Lincoln displays a grandfatherly wisdom and a ""god of the machine"" quality where the wheels of Washington spin in just the right fashion, just in time for history to be forever made. It was very well done.<br/><br/>After doing some rough Wikipedia research, it was very well cast in the physical ways that neatly match every other important casting choice. Of course, the lead actors were very good (who really ever wonders how precise and involved a Daniel Day Lewis performance will be?). My next favorite actor was David Straithairn (portraying Sec of State Seward), who I have loved since I saw him in HBO's Lost in Yonkers. If I ever saw anyone get an Academy Award out of the whole movie, it would DEFINITELY be him!!! I thought the actors that played Lincoln's two sons were standouts (one of which was Joseph Gordon-Levitt: star rising); the younger one I don't know by name but his first appearance was memorable instantly, as much as DDL's young co-star in ""There Will Be Blood"" was (which is impressive given how BIG an actor he is). Honorable mentions go to Jackie Earle Haley as the VP of the Confederacy, the actor I know as Gail from Breaking Bad as an abolitionist House rep, and Walton Goggins, whose role was quite different from the things I've seen him do lately.<br/><br/>I was more emotional than I knew I'd be, but for different reasons than I thought. I will certainly be reading the book ""Team of Rivals"", the movie's inspiring source material. The movie also makes one curious about Lincoln's recorded speeches, because he was very good at it -- and Daniel Day Lewis' Lincoln surely gives them life. After seven score and seven years, we're still analyzing his words and deeds -- he really does belong to the ages!"

"lsmail-538-3324","8","2","7","25 November 2012"," Does LINCOLN ""...belong to the Ages?""
","Without a doubt, the acting performances were first-rate. Daniel Day-Lewis was totally immersed in his role as Lincoln, and he portrayed his complex personality and ability to deal with multiple problems masterfully. Performances by Sally Field (Mary Todd Lincoln) and Tommy Lee Jones (Thaddeus Stevens) were wonderful and very dramatic (maybe, too dramatic) as well. There were a couple of times when the movie became tedious, but emotions did reach a crescendo at the movie's end with scenes showing the passage of the 13th amendment that finally abolished slavery, Lincoln's tour of the battlefield and hospitals at Petersburg, and his assassination (although we never actually see it). At times, the back-stabbing politics and personal name-calling seemed to dominate the movie, not Lincoln. I might also question whether some of the dialog used was appropriate for the 1860's (one example was the use of the ""f"" word). And did Lincoln really slap his son Robert in the face? Also, did I hear Lincoln say ""you should call him?"" Obviously, there were no phones in 1865. Then at the end of the scene did Lincoln say ""remember to call upon him."" That's more like it. I also found that the movie did not have that many interactions with Lincoln and his full cabinet, his TEAM OF RIVALS. I thought the movie would be based more on the book. On another ""note,"" the music of John Williams was very fitting, but I would not call it worthy of an Academy Award nomination. He has done better. Yes, this was a very good movie with outstanding performances. But, was it a movie that ""belongs to the Ages?"" Close, but not quite."

","I finally saw this with my mom and my sister and I'm glad I did. To me, it's a real treat to see a new Steven Spielberg film. It's like a theatrical Christmas present. With that being said, I enjoyed Lincoln: a movie that could have been very boring but carried by strong, outstanding performances.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis obviously invoked the character of Abraham Lincoln, and brings so much warmth and personality to his role that you really feel like you are watching the real Abe Lincoln. It's his story about freeing the slaves, probably the event he's most known for, and every scene is handled beautifully. You can see the passion Spielberg had in this film, and everyone in the cast, including the writers, brought in their A-game.<br/><br/>I can honestly see this film viewed in classrooms in the future. It's a great historic piece. If this film doesn't win a lot of awards come Oscar time, it's been robbed!"
"darthmatthew-442-606491","8","2","7","24 November 2012"," A Methodical and Thought Provoking Exploration Into the Humanity of Lincoln
","Touted at its arrival as a front-runner of the Oscar race, Lincoln fulfills the reputation that preceded it; mostly. This latest film by the great Steven Spielberg presents a logically based methodical view on the events surrounding the passing of the 13th Amendment in the House of Representatives. Supported by pitch perfect performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field, Lincoln gives us a composed and contemplative depiction of our 16th president. Many times in the film, Abraham Lincoln stops in the middle of political proceedings to tell a random story; combined with Daniel Day-Lewis's subtle mannerisms, this creates a highly believable character, rather than just an actor hashing out lines (I'm talking about you Wrath of the Titans!). <br/><br/>This film truly lives up to its name; although it involves the 13 Amendment, it is foremost about the humanity of Lincoln. It is about his composed nature in the face of chaos, heck he takes the time to crack some jokes. It is about when it became game time he transformed into a determined, powerful, and inspirational leader. Lincoln is about his family and political struggles and how they become intertwined.<br/><br/>Lincoln is a thorough exploration in the mind, heart, and soul of Abraham Lincoln, yet with such a personal subject, I feel unmoved. Because the struggles were viewed on an almost logical level in the house debates and in political meetings, a majority of the ordeal seemed void of emotion. It was partly because of the character of Lincoln who was forced to detach himself from the emotions that were pounding at his door. There were parts in which raw emotion escaped him, and those will be remembered as my favorite scenes from the film; however, when it was over, all I could do was nod my head, say, ""Good man Lincoln."", and leave.<br/><br/>Also, I couldn't help thinking of another film that is very similar to Lincoln. Amazing Grace was a film released in 2006 about William Wilberforce dealing with the abolition of slavery in England. Because of this comparison, Lincoln lost some points on originality as many of the House debate scenes were closely reminiscent of the debate scenes in Amazing Grace.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Lincoln was a nearly flawless production; the painstaking precision and crafting of Abraham Lincoln's character and the story surrounding him was clearly evident. As a result of the political aspect of the story, I find myself still pondering on the subjects dealt with in this film. It would take an eternity to truly explore the depths of Abraham Lincoln, but Steven Spielberg did the best that could ever be done in 150 minutes."
"webcrind","1","3","13","14 April 2013"," typical spielberg
","Spielberg never was a really great director, not when compared to Bunuel, Tykwer, Truffaut, Peckinpah, Tarkovskiy, Kurosawa, Fassbender or Wenders, just to name a few, but he's done the odd good movie. ""Lincoln"" is not one of them. It is an extremely boring movie, boring because Spielberg has white- washed history ( and that's what he always does), and by that I mean: anybody that studied history and preferable not in the US, knows that Lincoln was not a good president. He had no real concern for the black people, this war was all about giving the North an economic edge and pounding the South into never ending submission. So when you know that you are watching an unfolding lie, the monologues become torture. And torture it was since D.D.Lewis was pretty much all you saw, telling one anecdote after the other. I am a big fan of D.D.Lewis, but his part could have been played by many actors. No, this was definitely not an Oscar worthy performance, ""There will be blood"" was. I turned the movie off 20 minutes before the ending, and yes, that wasn't very smart of me since I should have done it after 20 minutes of watching, but like in countless American movies one should know that most ( not all) American directors know how to f.ck up a movie in the last 20 or even 10 minutes. And for all the brainwashed Americans reading my comment and getting upset, read James W.Loewen ""Lies my teacher told me"" and ""Lies across America"" ( that is, if you don't have a basic understanding of American history, like Spielberg). Oh, I just realised that I might have forgotten to mention something: obviously Lincoln is portrayed as a good man/ father/ president, yup, he really was such an exceptional human being and the director must have seen a need to point that out. If Spielberg would have used the script to point out that Lincoln actually was a racist and that his true interest in ""freeing the slaves"" was driven by the North to become more competitive ( and that is putting it mildly), then he would have had my attention and interest. With movies like that it is no wonder that many non-Americans look towards the US, and the way they deal with their own history, and just shake their heads. If you want ""honest"" movies, watch Australian or Spanish films."
"lmontgomery-567-352835","3","3","13","28 December 2012"," A Film Intended to Excuse Unconstitutional Acts of the Current POTUS
","I was hoping for a film about the entire life of A. Lincoln (or at least more than was covered), but was disappointed. Instead, they chose to address a short period spanning events surrounding debate of the 13th Amendment. Although costumes and language were of 1860's vintage, the story was presented in the form of a thinly veiled modern narrative that implied that the current POTUS' many constitutional desecrations are ""normal"" and ""acceptable.""<br/><br/>Lincoln was obviously made by Hollywood socialist/communist democrats for the express purpose of excusing dictator-like tyranny from the current POTUS. You'd think that Spielberg might have known better than to excuse behavior that has historically lead to very bad things, as it did in Germany and other places.<br/><br/>The bias was obvious in a number of places. For instance, when excoriating 1860's democrats for opposing the 13th Amendment, the film POTUS lumps ""conservative republicans"" in with the demos (who opposed the 13th). Implication: Current conservative republicans are ""mean"" and support slavery. Ridiculous, but we hear it all the time from the modern socialist/communist democrat party.<br/><br/>To those who aren't simple-minded and naive in their historical knowledge, this tends to come off as a film that excuses unconstitutional behavior of the current POTUS and emphasizes that any end arbitrarily chosen by a POTUS justifies any means - including bribery of Congress (sound familiar?). <br/><br/>Furthermore, the weighty issue of ""slavery"" is not interchangeable with any other given issue, but this is implied in the film - just like it is in the modern socialist/communist democrat play-book and spin-mantra.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis was fine, but the script was a preachy political commercial for BO'bama."
"EUyeshima","10","3","13","26 November 2012"," Masterful Filmmaking and a Stellar Cast Capture Lincoln During One Pivotal Month
","To say that Daniel Day-Lewis inhabits the title role feels like such a total understatement. The iconic role has been the career-peaking touchstone for dozens of esteemed actors since the dawn of cinema including Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey (who earned an Oscar nomination in 1940 for his Lincoln), Gregory Peck, and even cast member Hal Holbrook (who plays Republican leader Francis Preston Blair here), but none have come across with the deceptively casual verisimilitude of Day-Lewis in Steven Spielberg's masterful 2012 historical drama. The versatile actor is able to bring multiple layers of human dimension to a public figure known to us only through books, marble statues, or perhaps a childhood trip to Disneyland where he remains an animatronic mannequin in ""Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln"". Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") wisely do not attempt an episodic treatment of Lincoln's life but rather focus on January 1865, a critical month at the beginning of the President's second term when he was undergoing the most important event of his life.<br/><br/>Based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's superb treatise, ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"", the 150-minute film focuses on the conundrum he faced in pushing the 13th amendment, the abolition of slavery, through the House of Representatives toward legislation while facing immense pressure among all factions to end the now-four-year-old Civil War and reclaim the Confederacy into the Union. The movie's deliberately narrow focus allows us to see Lincoln as a relatable human being, someone with a determined sense of mission but also less than ideal with a surprising albeit understandable streak of opportunism that a broader biopic would have glossed over. It also means the story consists of subtle moments rather than milestone events that would signal the next historical battle. Although Spielberg bookends the film with unblinking scenes of carnage true to the period, the film relies primarily on the human drama that comes from the argument of opposing ideas and the minutiae of political strategy used to win favor among influential politicos<br/><br/>It's a story that has obvious relevance to the Washington political scene of today. The movie also examines the additional burden Lincoln was experiencing with his fractious home life. He struggles to keep the peace with his tempestuous wife Mary still grieving over the death of their third son Willie three years earlier, as well as their first-born Robert who becomes desperate to enlist in the Union Army against his parents' wishes. Kushner's superbly understated screenplay lets the plot lines intertwine organically and keeps Spielberg's tendency toward bravura filmmaking in check. Only toward the end when we recognize what is about to happen to Lincoln did I feel Spielberg's use of unspoken prescience a bit too heightened. The performances are stunning examples of what great filmmaking can generate with the right cast. Day-Lewis' Lincoln is for the ages. It amazes me that Liam Neeson was attached to the project for six years before generously abandoning it because Day- Lewis appears born to play the role. With a choked Midwestern tenor, he vividly evokes a man gifted at conflict resolution and oratory splendor but not above manipulating information to achieve the greater good.<br/><br/>Two other performances are nearly as stellar. Tommy Lee Jones hones in on his particular brand of irascibility to bring fiery abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens to life, and Kushner gives him the lion's share of clever vitriol in the script. As Mary, Sally Field is a constant presence but has probably about three showy scenes where she is able to show her considerable talent to the full. Nearly a half-century since Gidget and more than a decade older than Day-Lewis, this diminutive actress gained 25 pounds and defies the odds by immersing herself completely into all the conflicting impulses that made Mary such a complicated, controversial historical figure. There are five Oscars among this accomplished trio, and more could very well be forthcoming. Many other actors in the expansive cast are worthy of mention, including James Spader's surprisingly amusing turn as a Republican lobbyist, Hal Holbrook's avuncular bluster as Blair, Gloria Reuben's quiet fortitude as Mary's confidant Elizabeth Keckley, and David Straitharn providing a jittery voice of reason as Secretary of State William Seward. A few actors like the omnipresent Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert are not given enough time to flesh out their characters. Regardless, it's a masterful film that captures lightning in a bottle."

If he hadn't been assassinated, he might be seen now as the wildly destructive crackpot-on-a-mission he really was - a 19th century George W Bush - instead of as the wise, easy-going, deeply compassionate but pragmatic martyr this silly movie makes him out to be.<br/><br/>Because Lincoln refused to allow the southern states to secede, which they had the right to do under the constitution, nearly a million people were slaughtered and the economy was ruined. Although he won his war, the damage he caused the country still has not healed 150 years later. Anybody who believes that this is a united country has his head in the sand. The South is and always has been a separate society in every way and has NEVER fit with the North.<br/><br/>Just look at a red-state/blue-state map! The United States is made up of two distinct nations: one from the southeast westward, then up to the Canadian border and a skip northwest to Alaska; the other in the northeast, the west coast and Hawaii. It's a natural, organic division that has been here as long as there have been European settlers, and no amount of brainwashing or sappy movie-making will EVER change it. This has NEVER been a united country; it will never BE a united country. It's like trying to force Ireland to stay in the United Kingdom: it doesn't work.<br/><br/>We are TWO countries, not one. It was a bad marriage from the beginning. The South should have been allowed to leave peacefully 160 years ago, to effect an amicable divorce when amity was still possible. But Lincoln the zealot refused, and the mess he left is still tearing these unnaturally ""United"" States apart.<br/><br/>Slavery obviously was a peripheral issue, because it's long gone but the problems remain. Left on its own, the South would have eliminated slavery eventually anyway, as has every other civilized nation on earth. All Lincoln did by ramming it down the South's throat was to destroy the country, enforcing a union that has never worked, from 1620 until now.<br/><br/>Stupid movies like this just preach to the choir, reminding Lincoln-lovers why they love him so much and celebrating his stirring triumph over the bad old South, when a TRULY visionary leader would have let it go. The South might very well have WANTED to rejoin the union later, after it had learned for itself that slavery is unspeakably evil, but it never had that chance.<br/><br/>Lincoln did his best to destroy the South, and although he won his war he failed to annihilate the enemy. So now we have the South using Lincoln's very own Republican Party to wreak their vengeance on the rest of the country. Thanks a lot, Abe."

"kenpery","1","2","8","24 December 2013"," A tired story told in a predictable way
","This story has been beaten to death in schools, over and over, year after year. And after all the hype and awards that Hollywood gave itself for this, it definitely falls short. The acting was unimpressive at best, I mean anyone can portray these characters. Characters that are not interesting at all anymore and certainly not entertaining. Actually the portrayal of Lincoln was probably the worst of all. He was made to appear unassertive, quiet, and quite stupid at times. This was Sally Field's worst role ever. But that's probably due to the tired, wore out material. Nothing new was introduced in this telling and I doubt that any of the character portrayals were close to accurate. This movie was made so that Hollywood could give it self more undeserved awards. And to steal money from the pockets of hard working people. Hollywood has truly run out of ideas, and almost out of talent."

I have been an avid viewer of Steven's films. Going into this movie I had very high expectations as Spielberg's story telling is brilliant BUT the Lincoln he portrayed turned out to be very boring(provided I did not know anything about him or his works before I saw this movie).<br/><br/>Did not like the useless slow panning of cameras, long walking shots and idle face shots which consumed most of the time length.<br/><br/>Could have named it Lincoln and the 13th Amendment or just 13 or may be Emancipation Proclamation.<br/><br/>Anyway let's leave it to it and hope for something fresh the next time.<br/><br/>I rate it 2 out of 10."
"steven_torrey","10","2","9","30 November 2012"," Lincoln: a recommend
","The movie LINCOLN occurs during the time period of January, 1865 till his assassination, April 15, 1865. Specifically, LINCOLN concerns itself with discussion/passage in the House of Representative of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery. Lincoln lays out parameters of the discussion within minutes of the opening. As president he assumed the right to take property--Black slaves--from rebels; after the war--and he thought the war would be ending soon either militarily or with diplomacy--would he be obligated to return that property--Black slaves--to the rebels? A need for an Amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery once and for all from the Union was a necessity--else the carnage of the war--600,000 soldiers died, North and South--would be for naught. And it had to be done before war's end because the block of Southern States would not allow passage of such an amendment.<br/><br/>The movie shows Lincoln as a nuts and bolts politician that Lyndon Johnson would admire. Like Johnson, a person who felt no hesitation to use his size, his prestige, his office to get this Amendment passed. A person not afraid to work with the nitty-gritty politicos responsible for arm-twisting, cajoling representatives; a person counting where the votes are required and who can be counted on to deliver; a president not above politics but willing and able to walk the tightrope that politics demands.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln, Sally Fields as Mary Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as Thadeus Stevens, Hal Holbrook as Francis Preston Blair, Lincoln adviser--for whom Blair House is his heritage to the nation--all of them performed admirably--channeling the personalities. Normally, I don't think actors deserve accolades, because--after all--that's why they get paid millions; in this instance, they deserve praise.<br/><br/>LINCOLN is based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book TEAM OF RIVALS; but a movie is not a documentary, a movie is a recreation for purpose of telling a dramatic story. Did the events unfold the way the movie suggests? At the end of the movie, for example, a large group blacks are led into the House Chamber balcony just as the vote is about to be made to remind the representatives that there were flesh and blood Black people involved in this decision. Did this event actually occur, does Miss Goodwin document this incident, or is this Steven Spielberg re-invention of history? (Not an insignificant question.) In the end, one is compelled to read her book, A TEAM OF RIVALS.<br/><br/>There is a big caveat. Who was who in the drama needed to be highlighted. They highlighted the Southern functionaries negotiating for peace; it would have been equally helpful to label more frequently the players, either by mentioning their name, or naming them by highlighting on screen. Eventually, the viewer got the idea, but it took a while."
"Hello_Im_David","9","2","9","30 November 2012"," Lincoln Can Show Us The Way
","The United States is in a state of suffering. Close to a month after we reelected our first black President the nation is still bitterly divided along ideological lines. Many say that we are now more divided then we have been since the Civil War, and despite what President Obama says it is hard to believe that we are not just a collection red states and blue states rather then the United States. Especially now that hundreds of thousands of Americans have signed petitions of secession, I am beginning to believe that we are as divided as our politics suggest. It is under this backdrop that we look to Lincoln. And Lincoln delivers. <br/><br/>This is a film about our greatest President in the last months of his life as he and the Republicans in the House hastily try to pass the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery before the end of the Civil War. At the same time the old Conservative Francis Preston Blair convinces Lincoln to seek a peaceful end to the War. It's all about politics. Some may find the focus on procedure in the House of Representatives to be tedious and uninteresting, but to me it was quite fascinating(however I am a history major so that may be the reason). This is a film unlike any other Spielberg film in that it relies almost entirely on the cast. And the cast is brilliant. Daniel Day-Lewis proves again that he is one of the greatest living actors with the most realistic Lincoln portrayal that I have ever seen. Some have complained that his voice was too high pitched and didn't sound like Lincoln. To these people I must remind you that the only people who have ever heard Lincoln's real voice have been dead for a hundred years, however according to written accounts of his speeches Lincoln's voice was at a fairly high frequency. Day-Lewis is able to show us the many ranges of Lincoln, as a jokester and story teller, as a master politician who's skills at persuasion were extremely fine tuned, and as a man haunted by a lifetime of hardship including the death of many family members and his destructive marriage to Mary Todd. <br/><br/>Despite the brilliance of Day-Lewis, my personal favorite member of the cast was Tommy Lee Jones as radical Thaddeus Stevens, who's sharp wit and fiery tongue make the movie much more fun to watch. Sally Field is also quite amazing, and it is she who probably had the hardest job. Many people these days tend to exaggerate her mental illness, but Field was able to refine herself and accurately capture the severe melancholy that faced the first lady during her time in the White House. Other great performances include David Strathairn as Secretary of State William Seward, James Spader as W.N. Bilbo and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln. <br/><br/>On top of the the amazing cast Lincoln boasts a compelling screenplay written by the great Tony Kushner, wonderful production and costume design, and beautiful cinematography that brings the 1860s alive before our eyes. But above all else Lincoln serves as a lesson for our own times. We can see in Lincoln the very destructive nature of division. Pure, unrestrained ideology will never amount to real progress or change. Lincoln shows us, through the character of Thaddeus Stevens as well as Lincoln, that we have to be willing to compromise, and it can't always be about our own interests or our own beliefs, but the greater good of the society as a whole. Passage of the 13th Amendment ending the evil that was slavery was more important than political grandstanding. If only our lawmakers today could heed this message. More importantly, I think the American people should take a good hard look at ourselves and remember just what these bitter divisions we create can birth. Perhaps the time has come for us to ignore the forces of hatred and division that scream at us from the television, the radio or the pulpit and realize that politics can be messy and divisive, but it does not define us and it should not divide us. I doubt many will learn these lessons from Lincoln, but I can always hope."
"mypoint99","Null","2","9","16 November 2012"," But for Daniel Day Lewis . . .
","Daniel Day Lewis' outstanding performance as Lincoln was squandered in this film. I left the theater tonight feeling dejected that such an historical figure during such an historical time could be handled in such an uninspiring, emotionally flat manner. I think Spielberg was way out of his league attempting to dramatize what was already an extremely dramatic story. Even the John Williams score was a huge let-down. I can hardly believe how disappointed I am with this film. I am saddened because Day Lewis' Lincoln in more capable directing hands, and with a more superior screenplay, could have been the film we all needed to see after such tumult in the country these days. But no, the film barely rose to the occasion. There were a handful of well-crafted scenes, but the rest was quite superficial despite the beautiful, historically accurate window dressing.<br/><br/>Many audience members in my theater tonight walked out midway through the film (and probably snuck into the James Bond film next door, or even Twilight.) Who could blame them? As a dramatic movie, it was mediocre, and Lincoln deserved better.<br/><br/>To add to the disappointment was the frequent obscenity. I did not bring my teens to see Lincoln in order to hear him say ""sh**"" and ""g*d-d*mn"" (also spoken often by other characters in the film.) And James Spader was a joke - and confirmed that he has become a one-trick pony and a caricature of himself, and a pathetic one at that.<br/><br/>If you sense some hostility towards this film, I admit I am feeling hostile at the moment. The film is not good, plain and simple. Daniel Day Lewis was amazing, but because the film was so uninspiring and superficial, even his performance started to suffer in that context - as if Spielberg just wanted to get him on screen doing Lincoln as ""Lincoln at the table"" and ""Lincoln telling stories"" and ""Here's Lincoln walking down the hall"" and ""Oh, wait, there's Lincoln riding a horse."" Perhaps Spielberg was so mesmerized with Day Lewis' Lincoln that he forgot he was supposed to be making a movie.<br/><br/>My objective gauge is the outstanding film ""Amazing Grace."" That film deals with a similar topic, and features many historical characters, and manages to be enthralling, heart- breaking, inspiring, and utterly unforgettable. Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" falls so short in comparison. The only tears I shed are my tears of disappointment."

","I believe that the movie Lincoln inaccurately portrayed the end of slavery. I believe this because the movie might have discussed ending slavery throughout the movie, but it never really did show us how it was going to be ended. It showed us that the only way to end the war was to end slavery. In the movie there were senators voting on whether they wanted to end slavery or not. Most of the senators voted yes. Therefore slavery was ended, but it didn't really walk us through the steps they had to make in order to end slavery. It was sort of like the president getting enough to vote yes to end slavery, but in the movie the president never talked about how to end slavery. There were no steps shown on how to end slavery, it was like we have to get this many votes and them slavery will be ended. So there you have it, the movie Lincoln inaccurately portrayed the end of slavery."

"benbelfield0","8","1","3","4 January 2015"," A well acted, but rather dry movie
","Lincoln was a movie that had great acting from every key person in the film. Daniel Day- Lewis did an amazing job as the 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, especially for someone you don't hear about often in world of acting. The other acting that I thought was very well done was by Tommy Lee Jones as the radical republican pushing for abolishing slavery, Thaddeus Stevens. There was also good supporting acting by James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing the role of Robert Todd Lincoln, and Sally Field playing the part of Abraham Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. The main downfall of this movie was that until the ending where a vote is being taken for whether or not the 13th amendment is to be passed it wasn't really exciting, it didn't have much of a thrill to it. Although there is not much you can do to make a movie exciting with the type of movie Lincoln is, it still was indeed dry and a little bit too long for how boring it was. Nonetheless, Lincoln was a well acted and well done movie and it is definitely a movie for you if you're interested in the Civil War era."
"ledzepfan71","3","1","3","7 July 2014"," Politicised Movie for Intra-racial Marriage
","Lewis is one of the best actors in Hollywood today, having received more Oscars for best actors at three than anyone. His portrayal of Lincoln in the film is satisfying for the most part, but missed one known element of Lincoln's character - his melancholy. On the contrary, Lewis' Lincoln is laughing throughout the whole film in telling his anecdotes, which came across as odd. My biggest complaint with the film is that it was all done as a political message to make intra-racial relationships and marriage acceptable, as shown with Thaddeus Stevens character in bed with a black woman toward the end of the film. That ruined the film for me, because it was contrived and did not have anything to do with Lincoln, the man. The ending falls flat for not showing any scene depicting the assassination of Lincoln, rather the viewer learns about it second hand when the entire movie is shot from a first person perspective with Lincoln. Because of the political undertone promoting intra-racial relationships and marriage, the movie turned out to be little more than propaganda, and that ruined it for me."
"Prismark10","5","1","3","23 January 2014"," The race for the 13th Amendment
","The title of the film implies that this is a biography of the 16th President of the USA. It really is about the adoption of the 13th Amendment making slavery illegal as federal law.<br/><br/>The action takes place after Lincoln's re-election during the month of January of 1865 before the new elected politicians take their seats.<br/><br/>After four years of Civil War, the North might be close to victory, but before the seceded states rejoin the union, the President needs to pass the 13th Amendment or the war would had been meaningless as the Southern states would still continue to have slavery in some form.<br/><br/>So it needed to be outlawed at the federal level.<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln uses political manoeuvrings to get the law passed. The interesting aspect of the film is James Spader and his cohorts (very much the precursor to the modern spin doctors) using patronage, bribes and other inducements to get Democrats to vote for the amendment.<br/><br/>However the film becomes scenes after scenes of politicians talking, gesturing, making speeches.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is fine as Lincoln but I would not say it particularly deserved an Oscar. Although these days he just need to appear on screen to get an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Although he is about the same age as Lincoln at the time of the film's setting he looks too young to be Lincoln.<br/><br/>Some hysterical commentators even said he sounded like Lincoln without much evidence for this.<br/><br/>To give him character we have way too many scenes of Lincoln telling homespun stories that just drag and drag. At one point one of the Senators complains about his stories and leaves.<br/><br/>Even I was praying for John Wilkes Booth to show up early as Lincoln told another pointless folksy tale!<br/><br/>There is some attempt to placate the critics from the Southern states as Lincoln discusses how he might have overstepped his powers in declaring war with the south.<br/><br/>In that respect it mirrors the political machinations shown in the recent Robert Redford directed, The Conspirator which dealt with the aftermath of the Lincoln assassination.<br/><br/>To give Lincoln a rounded characterisation we have some scenes of his family life. His wife played by Sally Field mourns the loss of one of their children.<br/><br/>Lincoln is and playing in the White House with their youngest son. Plus we have scenes of his eldest son wanting to fight in the war but prevented by his parents to his frustrations.<br/><br/>This scenes are mildly diverting but Sally Field is miscast as she is too old (9 years older than Day-Lewis) and she looks botoxed.<br/><br/>The film is nicely crafted, well acted, great wigs and facial hairs. It tries to make politics interesting although the general viewer not familiar with US politics from that era would be left bewildered that it is the Democrats (the party that gave the USA, its first black President) supporting slavery with the Republicans being abolitionists.<br/><br/>I am sure Spielberg was greatly tempted to add the line, 'one day they might even be a black President!'<br/><br/>However it is a long film, not well written with too much clunky speeches, the screenplay never really catches fire.<br/><br/>Just look at the scene near the end when Tommy Lee Jones (one of the most fervent supporters of equality) walks home with the Amendment Bill and as he enters the house, most people can guess what will happen next."
"mpurvismattp","5","1","3","10 November 2013"," Honest man...maybe. Honest title...not so much.
","I remember reading somewhere that DD Lewis was going to play Lincoln in a Steven Spielberg film and thinking that's gonna be fu(kin awesome, can't wait!!! So I saw it and I had heard it was a lil slow but I'm cool with that if the movie has good writing and creates characters that are well developed and relatable, unfortunately I didn't find that to be the case in this film and I was expecting it to be more about... well Lincoln and not so much about the 13th amendment which was really all that went on in this movie. The acting was really very good and I enjoyed seeing some of these actors transform themselves in ways that I hadn't seen before (like a fat James Spader-awesome). The choice of what was left out of the film (like the signing of surrender by general Lee and the assassination to name a few) just ruined many good opportunities for dramatic excellence and left the movie feeling flat in my opinion. Also there just seemed to be some scenes where characters didn't feel like themselves or there was enough leading up to those scenes to explain things. The movie drags on for 2 hours and 15 minutes and then all of a sudden it drags itself off a cliff and ends without any pay off which kinda pis-sed me off. I realize Spielberg was trying to be respectful of Lincoln by not showing the assassination (or not giving Booth any screen time maybe)and jumping to his dying last minute (actually last second really) and I'm not suggesting that they should have shown Abe's brains splattered all over Mary Todd's pretty dress but I think most of us would agree that that there was a missed opportunity for some suspense. And we were robbed of many of the characters reactions to his death which I think could have helped give this film something. I think there are a lot of Hollywood types who are sayin' they like this movie, as well as a few people you probably know personally too. I just wonder if they felt pressure to do so. because of all the big name actors and the fact that Spielberg directed it. I think some people may feel like they will look stupid or unappreciative of good cinema if they don't say it was amazing but I don't know if they would pass a polygraph test if ya catch my drift. I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder and i just didn't this film to be all That beautiful overall. Maybe you will though. It's worth a viewing to form your own opinion that's for sure."

Being European, American history for as long as it has been sovereign, is rather unknown to me. Therefor, this movie taught me an important part of history I didn't really know yet.<br/><br/>Putting myself in the shoes of an average American who does know of the history, this movie is rather long-winded and boring. The acting is not bad, there is good music, and the costumes are great. I also appreciate there is no presence of unnecessary violence, which I often fear for in Spielberg movies.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie knows a slow build-up, there is only suspense during the voting of the amendment, and the ending pulled down the rating even more. It was, for me, an anti-climax. <br/><br/>Overall, it was too long, and rather dull. Much more could have been done with this movie."

","Daniel Day-Lewis outperforms himself again this time as Lincoln. The film focuses heavily on Amendment 13 which gets rid of slavery but serves mainly as a device to end the war. There's endless political blabbering (well written mind you) concerning the passing of this amendment and the behind-the-scenes mechanics of it. You'll get some insight into Lincoln's personal life but unexpectedly he's portrayed as a man who kicks ass for goodness, a veritable saint. As much as I enjoyed this well made film I couldn't help but think that this was a product of the Americans obsession with their own culture and history, and for me as a European it just doesn't seem all that important.

"dapadayachee","10","1","3","18 June 2013"," Some births are long and bloody
","LINCOLN<br/><br/>A review by Dr Deena Padayachee<br/><br/>The legal end of slavery in the USA occurred in Feb 1865, but it was a close run thing - only two votes secured that decision, one of them by the Speaker of the House in the American house of Representatives. Fifty six representatives did not think it dishonourable (in Stiebel fashion) to vote against this amendment to the American constitution which had been put forward to end slavery.<br/><br/>There was no secret ballot and this 13th amendment aroused a great deal of vile, racist vitriolic even from those who voted for it. These Americans did not believe that all people are created equal and were not ashamed to say so quite unequivocally. They raged, 'where will all this end, with women getting the vote?' <br/><br/>The war was fought to keep the USA united and free of slavery but in order to free the slaves and make slavery illegal, the US constitution had to be changed. The majority which was needed might not be attained if the slave states were voting again in a united USA. So the lawyer, President Lincoln, had to plan cunningly and move very fast, before the South surrendered.<br/><br/>Just think, if slavery had not been ended, it would have been impossible for Obama to become President of the USA. The British empire ended slavery almost a generation before the Yanks. For most of human history, conquered peoples and others have known the scourge of slavery.<br/><br/>Spielberg has brought to life a vital, and indeed a great and seismic time, in U S history. His characterisation of the main participants is a tour de force. Thank you so much, Steven. Lincoln is portrayed as a charming, elderly, dynamic gentleman with the ability to relate, as most great leaders are able to do, to the average human being while winning the confidence of even the most cantankerous trouble-makers.<br/><br/>At difficult moments in a debate he was wont to break the tension with a delightful homily about something that had happened in his life which might have a bearing on the subject being discussed. The actors, Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln, Sally Field as his wife, Molly, and Tommy Lee Jones as an articulate, acerbic left-wing orator in the House of Representatives give the film a rare life – a life which marked a turning point in the history of the 'land of the brave and the home of the free.'<br/><br/>Watching the film was like being in a Spielberg time-machine as we saw history unfold before our eyes.<br/><br/>Lincoln is shown as a man willing even to lie to Congress and even bribe congressmen in his desperate attempt to get the amendment passed. And all the while he has the 'everyday' problems we all have – he has a strong-willed spouse who is determined to keep her son out of the army and he has other domestic responsibilities. <br/><br/>The bloody, mud-splattered opening sequence is a trade-mark Spielberg battle-scene. If Apartheid were still legal we would not have been allowed to see it, as it depicts black soldiers often getting the better of the confederates - and even sticking dirty big boots into their muddied white faces. A black soldier speaks of how they were paid (like we were during Apartheid) less than white soldiers while both races served in the Union forces.<br/><br/>In my teens, when I was learning to type from an American tome, the typing exercise involved typing Lincoln's Gettysburg address.<br/><br/>'Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent...'<br/><br/>Soldiers quoted that address back to Lincoln in a scene and I found myself recalling those memorable words. Some births are very long and very bloody.<br/><br/>One came away from the movie with a sense of amazement that two sets of very racist, very unethical, very unjust human beings can actually be cajoled and eventually forced into giving up power over people. (It reminded one of how South Africa eventually came to be enfranchised) If there's one thing that the film shows, it is that, actually, there was not all that much difference in the racism deeply embedded in the north and the south. <br/><br/>Homo Sapiens has certainly come a long way, despite the Stiebels who still, with South African government funding, unethically discriminate against dark-skinned, historically disadvantaged human beings who triumphed despite all the odds stacked against them.<br/><br/>This is a movie full of intricate legal argument and lots of furrowed pondering on weighty matters. Sadly my experience was spoiled by my alarm company's persistent phoning me as my lounge passive was repeatedly activated. However I stayed till the end and all was well at home when I got there.<br/><br/>A review by Dr Deena Padayachee"

","Day- Lewis, of course, is terrific in this. Sally Field kind of chewed the scenery a little. It did drag some; and I got that kind of Spielberg feel.....where it seems like he did audience surveys to come up with the final cut of the film.<br/><br/>If you read history, the Tommy Lee Jones character (Thad Stevens) was not exactly the gruff but lovable curmudgeon that the movie depicts him. I doubt that the Lincolns really took their servant's opinion on civil rights into consideration, and Lincoln himself was a pure pragmatist on the slavery issue.<br/><br/>Little nitpicking, but it's a good movie."

","Born 60 miles up the road from Lincoln's birthplace Hodgenville, KY, I've been into the great man through a major in History in college and beyond. Along with the Henry Fonda 1939 interpretation, Daniel Day Lewis had me with his Kentucky/Indiana/Illinois fusion accent. It amazes me how some British can do such good American accents while our actors don't always succeed to their level. I have taught English abroad and was told that American English was easier to learn than British English because we pronounce only 3 diphthongs vs. the Brit's 12. Don't know if that's the case or valid or even if the number is right but I like having some reason.<br/><br/>Interesting insights into the 13th Amendment adoption which I had forgotten. Along with Day Lewis, James Spader gave the most engaging performance for me. There may have been some historical liberties taken but I've seen worse. Personal aside -- Met Sally Field once at a business function and I liked her -- she was very nice."
"Jackkrsk","10","1","3","9 April 2013"," ""It's one of the best films that I have ever seen about a famous historical figure!""
","I re-watched Lincoln on Bluray about two days ago and I thought the movie was so incredible. The movie is of course a historical drama flick directed and produced by Steven Spileberg. The movie is about the final four months of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis during an ongoing American Civil War in 1865.The plot mostly focuses on Lincoln adding the thirteenth amendment to the U.S. constitution that was passed by the United States House of Representatives to free the African American slaves. The movie is based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's historical book called Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. The motion picture also stars Sally Field as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln, Joseph Gordon Levitt as Robert Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, Hal Holbrook (he also played Lincoln in the 1970s TV mini-series that has the same name of the movie) as Preston Blair, James Spader as W.N. Bilbo and John Hawkes as Robert Latham. <br/><br/>I honestly thought that Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely portrayed a very realistic role as Abraham Lincoln. Seeing D-Day Lewis portraying Lincoln is like seeing Abraham Lincoln portraying himself. The two reasons that made Lincoln look like he is portraying himself from the movie is the way that they made the makeup look realistic and D-Day Lewis speaking with Lincoln's perfect Kentucky accent. Those are also the two reasons why I thought D-Day Lewis portrayed a very realistic role as Abe Lincoln. D-Day did not just portrayed a realistic role as Lincoln, it's hands down he definitely portrayed the best Abraham Lincoln ever. <br/><br/>My prediction on Daniel Day-Lewis winning his third Oscar for best actor for his role as Abe Lincoln came true and those are of course the reasons why I predicted D-Day Lewis on winning an Oscar. Even though I loved Lincoln, but my favorite Daniel Day-Lewis film will always be My Left Foot (He won his first Oscar for best actor from that film).<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg made a perfect choice of hiring D-Day Lewis portraying Abe Lincoln due to that he looks like Abraham Lincoln pretty much with his beard and the height. Before Steven Spielberg hired Daniel-Day Lewis, Liam Neeson was his first choice to portray Lincoln ever since the development of the film began but, he decided to drop out because he felt that was too old to portray the role after waiting several years for the project to start .Even though I love Liam Neeson as an actor but, his role is not perfect because he doesn't have look the Abe Lincoln look to him on his face and he especially doesn't have a beard that looks like his.Apparently, Daniel Day Lewis is only five years younger than Liam Neeson, but D-Day's age is close to Lincoln's age in the movie.So, that is one of the reasons why he took the role.<br/><br/>It was very impressive on the way they did the voting of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to end slavery in the movie. The Thirteenth Amendment was of course passed and If I was one of those congressman my vote would be yes to stop slavery. Well, Steven Spielberg did an outstanding effort on directing the thirteen amendment voting scene that it felt like it the voting session was actually recorded it in a actual film camera at The House of Representatives back in 1865 and then many years later, they digitally restored it. <br/><br/>I highly recommend that movie for history buffs and people in general. The people that have a passion on history would of course love this movie.The film in my opinion is one of Steven Spileberg's best movies. There are even other biographical films that actors portrayed their realistic look a like real person roles just like Denzel Washington as Malcolm X from Spike Lee's Malcolm X and Ben Kingsley as Gandhi from Gandhi. I give the motion picture 10 out of 10 stars."

","Lincoln is a historical drama film that features Daniel Day-Lewis as United States President Abraham Lincoln and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln.The cast includes David Strathairn,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,James Spader,Hal Holbrook and Tommy Lee Jones.It is based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.The film covers the final four months of Lincoln's life, focusing on the President's efforts in January 1865 to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives.It was directed by Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>In a nation divided by war and the strong winds of change, President Abraham Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery. Expecting the Civil War to end within a month but concerned that his 1863 Emancipation Proclamation may be discarded by the courts once the war has concluded and the 13th Amendment defeated by the returning slave states, Lincoln feels it is imperative to pass the amendment by the end of January, thus removing any possibility that slaves who have already been freed may be re- enslaved. The Radical Republicans fear the amendment will merely be defeated by some who wish to delay its passage; the support of the amendment by Republicans in the border states is not yet assured either, since they prioritize the issue of ending the war. Even if all of them are ultimately brought on board, the amendment will still require the support of several Democratic congressmen if it is to pass. With dozens of Democrats having just become lame ducks after losing their re- election campaigns in the fall of 1864, some of Lincoln's advisers believe that he should wait until the new Republican-heavy Congress is seated, presumably giving the amendment an easier road to passage. Lincoln, however, remains adamant about having the amendment in place and the issue of slavery settled before the war is concluded and the southern states readmitted into the Union.Lincoln's hopes for passage of the amendment rely upon the support of the Republican Party founder Francis Preston Blair, the only one whose influence can ensure that all members of the western and border state conservative Republican faction will back the amendment. With Union victory in the Civil War seeming highly likely and greatly anticipated, but not yet a fully accomplished fact, Blair is keen to end the hostilities as soon as possible. Therefore, in return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him to immediately engage the Confederate government in peace negotiations.With the moral courage and fierce determination to succeed, his choices during this critical moment will change the fate of generations to come.<br/><br/>Lincoln paints a powerful and compelling portrait of the man who has become an icon. We don't need to see more of his life to understand how rare a figure he was as this film is more than sufficient as it masterfully captures the dual dilemmas facing the president in the final months of his life: how to bring the war between the states to an end, and how to eradicate slavery, once and for all.Daniel Day-Lewis portraying President Lincoln characteristically delivers in this witty, dignified portrait that immerses the audience in its world and entertains even as it informs.No wonder that this is easily Spielberg's best picture since Schindler's List."

","I cannot understand why the Academy and other Awards prefer Ben Affleck's Argo than Spielberg Lincoln. It's probably the best Spielberg since Schindler's list and Jurassik PArk.- Lincoln is for Spielberg filmography almost what is Age of Inocense for Martin Scorcese. Excellent script by Tony Kushner, production design by Jon Erickson Rick Carter and Costume Design by Joanna Johnston. Lincoln also has an Iconic performance of the great Daniel Day Lewis. The supporting cast is almost equally good. Oscar nominates Sally Field (maybe too many screen minutes of Mary Todd and her family) and Tommy Lee Jones are brilliant, but Lee Pace and David Strathairn are equally good or even better. <br/><br/>Original score and cinematography, well excellent but I wanted new names besides Williams and Kaminzki. I get a little bored of them. <br/><br/>And best of all the SUBJECT. In a world that divided democracies between countries with a president with absolute power in the Congress (almost a dictatorship or an Absolute Government) and others that anullates each other. It's a pleasure to see a film, that is about consensus, and explain how to obtain the votes, without loosing the integrity. <br/><br/>From Obama to Ahmadineyad, from Merkel to Cretina Kichner, all should learn about this great president that was Lincoln, instead of complain the opposition, god or the world for their failures. The same goes for every opposition from the republicans to the Syrian ones.-"

Also, Spielberg and company missed a great opportunity to show how the civil war was made to go on for years grinding up the lives of 600,000 youth so the Unions Military Industrial Complex could make billions of dollars off the dead and wounded.

","I quite enjoyed watching this film. My family has a history with President Lincoln prior to him becoming president and the historical content of this movie was very important to me, personally. While I would have liked to have seen more civil war footage, it did strike an acceptable balance for what the film was meant to convey - the political struggle with trying to get the 13th Amendment passed. It was very interesting how they portrayed all of the elements of Lincoln's people trying to strong arm, bribe or otherwise influence the members of the congress to pass the amendment. I don't imagine things have changed much in present day politics. While Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field did an excellent job in portraying their characters, my favourite scenes involved Tommy Lee Jones in his portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens. The way he ripped into the opposition democrats on the house floor with insults was hilarious."
"cragsby_kellogs","8","1","3","4 April 2013"," Lincoln (2012)
","In the midst of the American Civil War in 1865, President Abraham Lincoln (Day-Lewis) looks to try and finally get the Thirteen Amendment of the Constitution granted in order to abolish slavery. However it leads to conflict amongst the rest of the government as his cabinet attempt to land key votes in order to ensure the amendment goes ahead. Amongst those contributing include his former opponent Thaddeus Stevens (Jones) who becomes more supportive about the end of slavery despite his initial opposition against it. But as the war rages on, Lincoln's determination is strained by his personal life involving his wife Mary Todd (Field) and his eldest son Robert (Gordon-Levitt). However he refuses to back away from his audacious plan as he looks to make history.<br/><br/>As with most cinematic biopics, Lincoln continues the trend of focusing on the personal challenges of its central character which the film does very well to highlight. Abraham Lincoln is not seen as this grand statue that historians have associated him as but instead he is depicted as a real man who questions his actions which allows the large ensemble of other characters to advise him about his tactics. In other words, you could say the film is more about the Constitution than of the actual leader which is why Spielberg chose to look at the impact the new regime could have on potential voters. When the Lincoln family aren't on-screen, the attention is switched to the many contributors that try to make a huge difference to the human race. However the theme of family, something which Spielberg has always highlighted in his previous films, is also touched upon as Tony Kushner's majestic (and dialogue-heavy) script gives us a chance to see how it affects Lincoln's personal relationships with Mary Todd and Robert. It is clear that these confrontations affect the President greatly but fortunately Kushner doesn't go too sentimental with that sub-plot and makes the amendment the main priority as part of the engaging narrative. Production value is another key factor of Spielberg's directing craft as his team rebuild a tumultuous period in American history whether it be the old-fashioned costumes or the sight of thousands of men lying dead on the battlefield. A clever piece of misc-en-scene comes from the interior scenes where dark rooms are used possibly as a symbol for the depression that Lincoln went through and some shades of light used to convey the possible hope he has of pushing the amendment. We should also not forget the important contribution of Spielberg's loyal composer John Williams (Oscar-nominated for the 48th time here) as he provides a sombre and engaging score which may not rank amongst his best but shows that he is still a composer at the peak of his powers. Talking of immense talent, Spielberg's overwhelming cast is something to marvel about as the flawless Daniel Day-Lewis delivers another exquisite performance in his titular role as the President. Given the few films he has done in a career spanning almost thirty years, Day-Lewis continues to immerse himself in his character as he inhabits a subtle performance which commands authority and at times, rare moments of anguish during his confrontational scenes with both his cabinet and his family. Sally Field gives fierce support as Lincoln's deranged wife who makes an impact as a loyal woman who struggles to overcome the traumatic loss of her son Winnie and uses that in her personal battle with Abe but also stands toe-to-toe in a more light-hearted scene where she ridicules Tommy Lee Jones's Thaddeus Stevens at a dinner party. As the third Oscar-winning member of the large cast, Jones brings his usual authoritative style to his character but also combines warmth and charisma to a man who changes his opinion on equality through his own personal life which is revealed nicely in the film's closing stages. Given the size of the support cast, there are too many well-known actors to talk about but the stand-outs range from David Strathairn's loyal secretary of state William Seward to James Spader's robust henchman Bilbo. As a fan of American television, it's also refreshing to see actors from two of my favourite shows pop up including Walton Goggins (The Shield's Shane Vendrell) and David Constabile (Breaking Bad's Gale).<br/><br/>A couple of negatives that Spielberg loses focus on is Lincoln's sub-plot with his son Robert and the disjointed ending. With the former, Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues his progress as one of Hollywood's biggest stars but his performance as the President's rebellious son is rather limited and feels more like a filler role which only attracts interest in his confrontational scenes with his father. The final five minutes also threatens to derail the film which could have easily ended with the President walking down his hallway. But instead, Spielberg opts to carry on and show Lincoln's assassination but not the way we expected to which leaves an unsettling feeling that almost takes away the inspirational mood we had experienced a few scenes earlier.<br/><br/>Despite its manipulative ending, Spielberg's fascinating and masterful drama documents a crucial time in American history with Daniel Day-Lewis once again absorbing himself in his dominant role as Lincoln while surrounded by a who's who of versatile cast members."

","Finally a movie that breaks the tumultuous roar of mainstream Hollywood. A true and honest look into the inner workings of Abraham Lincoln and his cabinet. This is not a movie of Lincoln's growth into a lawyer or even a movie about the Civil War. This movie only focuses on the final months of Abraham Lincoln's work on the 13th Amendment. Which is why it is the greatest movie to come out of Hollywood in a long time. Thank you Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>To all the those who want to see explosions and other fake renditions of historical events steer clear of this movie.

"jburtroald95","8","1","3","31 March 2013"," As they say, great cinema, but not great history
","Why has Lincoln been a much more critically successful historical portrait than last year's The Iron Lady?<br/><br/>Perhaps this is because its real-life protagonist is shown working tirelessly towards the immense, meaningful goal of universal freedom and racial equality, an ideal that's even bigger than his own towering presidential figure. It could also be because the film doesn't hone in too breathlessly close on this single man, as the title and posters suggest, and spends developing the full picture of those much less reputed – albeit white – freedom fighters whose support for the great cause was also crucial. Most likely, though, it is because the complex political intricacies of the abolishment of slavery are really quite meticulously delved into, and not emotively paraphrased.<br/><br/>The closest Tony Kushner's screenplay comes to wanting to explore ""Lincoln, the man"" is with a handful of diverting but not terribly inspired scenes with him and his two sons – sweet little Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and the stubborn adolescent Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) – and his effectively dramatic interactions with his stalwart wife Mary Todd (a fiercely terrific Sally Field). Other than that, he is explored as a politician – a godlike and all-knowing one, but still a stealthy, reasonably realistic politician.<br/><br/>The film devotes itself almost entirely to depicting many details of the work of him and his fellow republicans in passing the 13th amendment through the cutthroat thorny tangles of the American constitution. This achievement, which was arguably Lincoln's most important and tragically final contribution to American society is certainly portrayed with dramatic flair, but also a fair amount of restraint and maturity. The fact is that at the very powerful topmost levels of government, the resolution of this hideously real social issue came down to a matter of carefully swaying the necessary number of ministers one by one in order to ensure the majority vote needed to pass the amendment. No grand, heartfelt humanitarian speeches were made in the hope of inspiring enough men to look deep into the souls and see the justice of the abolishment of slavery. Lincoln's belief in the possibility of changing the law so suddenly might be idealistic, but he's not mad enough to think that he can change social values anywhere near as abruptly. He is constantly strategizing, admittedly with more poise and eloquence than the average schemer, but still as any politician would. He uses the more readily appealing prospect of putting an end to the horrific civil war as a selling point for the amendment. Most controversially, he agrees to meet with peace delegates from the South, infuriating his Secretary of State, William Seward (David Strathairn) who wasn't consulted. He is paranoid that the correspondence will be found out, resulting in huge losses of votes as it becomes apparent that the amendment won't be needed to stop the war, but Lincoln is sure that word would still have gotten out if he refused to meet with the delegates, which would have been even more fatal to their campaign. His shrewd handling of the matter is as diplomatic as any lawyer or politician balancing press and personal values.<br/><br/>Despite Lincoln constantly exuding wholesome wisdom and total integrity, he still has a game to play, and his democratic opposition, spearheaded and represented by the obnoxious but still quite humanly ambitious Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) more than once attacks Lincoln by calling him a corrupt tyrant for all the times he's taken matters into his own hands. It is curious that Lincoln never sets foot in the constitution. One does wonder how different the chaotic debates would be if he was there to bring them to a steady pace with his lengthy sermon-like anecdotes. Instead, he's the omnipresent but invisible steering force of the amendment. Director Steven Spielberg treats his relationship with his ministers as that between Jesus and his disciples, which, despite much historical evidence that suggests otherwise, does make for a very uplifting film.<br/><br/>Where Lincoln differs from his other great historical dramas is that while we are expected to sit through and contemplate the complex, austere details of the constitution, which, as adults, we're more than happy about, we are sheltered from the grisly, realistic details of the issue that is actually being dealt with. In the occasional shots and snippets of dialogue that are handed to the black African-Americans themselves, they are depicted as mere, meek, wide-eyed naïfs either waiting innocently for liberation, or grateful for being already rescued from slavery. This is purely a portrait of Lincoln's contribution to anti-slavery, but perhaps a fuller representation of the movement as a whole, which includes the many strong-willed (and female no less) black activists, would have been more interesting than something that comes across as a little too biblical at times.<br/><br/>More to its credit, though, the film is very much attuned to the atrocities of the civil war, which, like slavery, is mostly discussed on an intellectual by distanced middle-aged white gentleman, but still more than adequately documented visually. The huge loss of life is talked about in numbers, but it is also shown in very confronting, gruesome scenes. Much of their impact comes from the fact that the opening scene is of a fierce battle and one of the very last shows Lincoln sombrely and respectfully riding on horseback through the trenches piled with bloodied,tragically youthful bodies.<br/><br/>Lincoln tells a perfectly immersive dramatic story, but it is a story, not really history, and it's important to remember that this is largely an opportunity to display Spielberg's dramatic flair (especially with a very affecting portrayal of Lincoln's assassination), and the prowess of countless veteran actors (most especially the remarkably versatile and committed Daniel Day-Lewis as the great president, and also Tommy Lee Jones at his most effectively sour-faced), with some added political reality to strengthen the piece, but not ground it too solidly."

","Imagine to yourself for one moment, ""What if Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis teamed up?"" Well, this is the beautiful result of these talents fusing themselves together. Lincoln is no ordinary film. It doesn't fall into any category of biopic or historical fiction film. When you watch this film, you are watching the moment. You are there, seeing and hearing it. <br/><br/>This film is not about the life of Abraham Lincoln from childhood to the bullet at Ford's Theatre, but rather a short time span, the battle to pass the 13th Amendment. I had no idea that it was only this, so I was genuinely surprised. It is rather interesting to see Lincoln get down and dirty to get votes, but not dirty enough to lose our respect for him. All this comes down to Tony Kushner's witty, informative, and taut screenplay based on Doris Kerns Goodwin's novel ""Team of Rivals.""<br/><br/>But the sparks really come from Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. We are very used to seeing Lincoln as a deep voiced monument, unflappable and stoic. Here, Lewis makes him a very good man, but has his flaws and limited patience with failure. He's a country man who loves to tell stories (even if some people hilariously don't care for them.) He also understands how important the amendment is for future generations and for ending the war, something his cabinet doesn't fully understand because they lack his farsightedness. This is his finest performance by far, which is saying something.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is extensive. They range from actors of this generation, lost actors from old, and some you totally wouldn't expect. Tommy Lee Jones gives an outstanding portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, even better than his role in ""The Fugitive."" Sally Field is good as Mary Todd Lincoln, but not great compared to all the hype surrounding her. David Strathiarn is perfect and the others give great work as well.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is finally back on top, delivering some of his best work since Saving Private Ryan. He has been in a rut for a while, and here he is passionate, driven, and inspired to tell this story. He has one of the best ensemble casts in a recent film, and handles each with dignity, transforming them into their historic counterparts. he even wore a suit while directing this film, something he rarely ever does, signifying his commitment and dedication to the project.

Daniel Day-Lewis is obviously very good in the lead role. Having said that it's a very Oscar friendly film and I dare say that anybody playing the part would have been in contention for the Oscar.

"DICK STEEL","10","1","3","23 February 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Lincoln
","Daniel Day-Lewis is primed for another Best Actor Oscar, and the truth is it's not hard to see why, and he doesn't become the 16th President of the United States, but transforms into him, disappearing completely and immersing himself into the role. And yes that voice, somehow made the entire illusion complete, and it's hard to see how any other actor could top his effort to play Abe Lincoln, given that Day-Lewis probably gave us the most definitive interpretation to date, despite the Vampire Hunter parallel universe version being one of the most fun.<br/><br/>And with Steven Spielberg at the helm as director, quality is assured and stamped on every intricately crafted scene, that none go wasted, and will totally engage you for more than 2.5 hours, even if most of what's transpiring on screen happen to be plenty of politicking amongst politicians of the day. And you know it's done right when something so steep in one's country history, can be compelling to others who are largely at best remotely aware of the many milestone events, beginning from Lincoln's second term in office, with the American Civil War into its fourth year, and Lincoln pushing hard for the 13th Amendment in the US Constitution to abolish slavery.<br/><br/>Adapted in part from Doris Kearns Goodwin's book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln the movie fights its narrative battle on these two fronts, which is probably what has framed the Lincoln administration and set the president in his course in United States history. Those looking toward having violent scenes of war that Spielberg is capable of creating, may be a tad disappointed, though compensated with the opening scene after a short prologue, that had a bloodbath of a battle between the Unions and the Confederates, which highlighted the urgency of the current administration to seek peace rather than to have American kill American by the thousands.<br/><br/>But on the same agenda is the table to abolish slavery, and here, Lincoln and his trusted aides and advisers, such as State Secretary William Seward (David Strathairn) have to draw upon their experience in policies, compromises, sheer gut and will, and personal convictions, to fight not only what's on the battlefront, but something more challenging against lawmakers, to try and turn the tide by doing almost whatever it takes to obtain votes for their cause. It's easy to turn these scenes into boring, paint-watching where rhetoric after rhetoric get blasted from one side to the other, but under Spielberg's execution, these scenes of cajoling, influencing and encouragement, highlights the frailness of a newly formed democracy, and their emphasis to seek reunification of sorts amongst a country divided by war, and a war against one's way of life.<br/><br/>If there's a small quibble, it is perhaps this screenplay, written by Tony Kushner, is relatively void Lincoln's personal life, save for a couple of scenes in private between him and his wife Mary (Sally Field) where they bicker a lot, and through heated conversation we learn a little bit more about their married past, and those with his sons Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the latter finding it hard to step out of his big man's shadow, and finding opposition when wanting to join the many other sons who decided to leave family to take up arms for their cause. Supporting characters were also fairly one-dimensional save for Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, leaving the spotlight firmly on the titular president and his fight for just cause.<br/><br/>It's little surprise then to find that Lincoln had emerged as a frontrunner with the number of nominations chalked up for this season's Oscars. With Spielberg and his frequent collaborators in John Williams providing music, Michael Kahn tightly editing this, and lensed by Janusz Kaminski, this is one solid biography of an American President that's befitting of the man, full of intricate details and crafted with love in every aspect of its production values, and probably will set the bar with which how presidential biographies in future could be benchmarked against. A definite recommendation, even if one knows what the outcome would be, since Daniel Day-Lewis gives a one of a kind performance here, as always."
"Mohito-611-870113","10","1","3","23 February 2013"," Quietly the best movie of 2012
","I have read many reviews for this title, and the majority of the negative ones seem to have a common theme: boring. People think that because a movie doesn't have great action sequences, no passionate romance, or high suspense that it is boring and uninteresting. In some cases that is true, but in Lincoln, it is not the case. The reason for that is the script. Tony kushner recreates the more elegant dialogue of the 19th century perfectly while also keeping the audience interested through excellent pacing of the story. No this is not ""Argo"" where even know you knew the outcome of the story, it kept you right on the edge of your seat. Here, Spielberg is working with an outcome known to all Americans, but still manages to make it interesting to you, to make you root for the republicans in their quest to abolish slavery, to make you cheer for their accomplishments, and to make you groan when an obstacle comes their way. <br/><br/>The next part that makes this movie so great is the performances. Here you have an all star cast of Oscar winners Daniel day Lewis, Sally Field, and tommy lee Jones along with other big names such as Hal Holbrook and James spader. They each perfect their roles to become in my opinion the best performance by an ensemble cast this year in any movie. Jones gives a commanding and moving performance as the fierce abolitionist Stevens, a role which I hope he receives the Oscar for. Spader steals every scene he 's in as the ""comic relief"" figure who tries to procure the votes for the president. Feild is good as usual as the spirited Mary Todd Lincoln, complementing her more humble husband. And last but certainly not least, is the sublime Daniel day Lewis. In arguably the performance of the decade, Lewis inhabits Lincoln's voice, body and soul, and makes it look like a walk in the park. He has redefined what we think of the great emancipator, and this performance will live long in the soul of American film.<br/><br/>Overall, this was humbly and without the epic nature of a godfather or avatar, the best movie of the year. It is a film about what makes America the country it is, about the foundations of our system, and about the man that symbolized the good in the American people."
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","3","15 February 2013"," Worthy, insightful and often stirring.
","It's an understatement to proclaim my expectations for Lincoln were high. With two-time Oscar winner Steven Spielberg behind the camera and two-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis in front of it, expectations were through the roof. Never mind that cinematographer Janusz Kaminski has two Golden Baldies, composer John Williams has five, production designer Rick Carter has one, editor Michael Kahn has three, Sally Field has two and Tommy Lee Jones has one; the director / title star combo was enough to ensure this biopic was judged against higher standards. Does it succeed? Yes. And no. It's not a masterpiece capable of sitting alongside Spielberg's best (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Jaws, etc), nor is it even in the top echelon of movies released so far in 2013, yet that doesn't stop it from being a powerful, moving drama that provides the perfect environment for its main man to positively shine. The occasional spot of schmaltz and Field's tendency to veer into melodrama as the heartbroken Mrs Lincoln are forgotten instantly thanks to Day-Lewis' commanding performance as one of the most beloved and, as proved here, interesting U.S. presidents. A worthy, insightful and often stirring motion picture that will surely see Day-Lewis win a record third Best Leading Actor Academy Award."

","Lincoln was an emotionally moving film. Though it was extremely lengthy and slow moving in a majority of the film, the overall message was powerful. This movie is about Lincoln's life while he was president and about him trying to pass the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery. The film shows President Lincoln from the beginning of his presidency to his death. I did not realize how much Lincoln and his followers had to go through just to pass this amendment. I definitely appreciate his presidency much more. I also admire him because he was a God fearing man who tried to be Christ-like. He wanted to do the right thing so that human innocent and defenseless human beings could live a free life like the good Lord intended. There are very raw details about his life and the loss of one of his sons. The film leaves you feeling sad, but also accomplished because even thought his great man lost his life, he was a powerful man who was a Godsend who came on this earth to do a job and won. I feel that this film teaches a person to never give up no matter what the circumstances are."
"ganeshsubramanian","8","1","3","8 February 2013"," Spielberg at his terrific best with Lincoln!!
","I walked in to this movie with high expectations from Spielberg (as usual). One of his recent past movie 'The War Horse' was elegantly presented on screen by him. In this movie 'Lincoln', Spielberg gives us (the audience) a fine glimpse into the life and workings of the 16th President of the United States presiding over a period of internal strife of Civil War. Daniel Day Lewis has literally sunk his teeth into the character to portray Lincoln and all along the movie we (as audience) observe and feel that Abe Lincoln is on screen and not DDL. DDL has been ably supported by Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln in a role that shows her in sheer pain and despair owing to the death of one of their sons. Tommy Lee Jones stars as a slavery-abolition favoring congressman Stevens and perfectly fits into that role. The rest of the supporting cast is equally good and impressive including Joseph Gordon Levitt.<br/><br/>The movie gives the audience a fair understanding of the heavy polarized political environment of the day during the ongoing civil war. It also tells us on how Lincoln attempted every guile of the political trade in order to ensure that slavery of African American people is ended with, war is brought to a close and the intense wrangling and maneuver along the way. The movie also gives a glimpse of Lincoln as a grief-torn father, a loving husband apart from being a shrewd political leader. Kudos to Spielberg for bringing about the various facets of Lincoln in an astonishing manner.<br/><br/>DDL deserves to win the 'Best Actor' Oscar for his portrayal here and I see that this movie has chance to grab few more. Overall, I feel that the movie has portrayed Lincoln in all possible facets of his life, in a best possible manner.<br/><br/>My rating would be a 8 out of 10. Regards, Ganesh."
"paulwincott","4","1","3","6 February 2013"," so-so, but not certainly not the best film of the year
","I will not go into the details of the film plot, as there are plenty of other synopsis to read, instead I'll keep this review to opinions as I see them.<br/><br/>This is truly a 50/50 film; on the one hand you have excellent sets, cinematography and some top class acting - of which my favourite performance was by far that of James Spader as W. N. Bilbo. On the other hand was the turgid, drawn out, snooze-fest that was how the story was told. This film could easily be an hour or so shorter and not suffer for it, or could have (and probably should have) been a made for TV docu-drama.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this films failing is that despite the performances and the dressing up of the original media - it is still just politicians talking and/or arguing for two-and-a-half hours. The outcome of said argument is known going into the film so you leave the cinema feeling short-changed by the content, especially considering the tumultuous events that are going on in the background - i.e. the civil war! Whilst there are constant references to the war going on and a couple of scenes of Day-Lewis sitting on the edge of a battlefield, I don't feel this momentous event is made the most of and could have been used as a vehicle to inject some much needed action to an otherwise dottery film. This is why I make special mention of Spaders performance, as his brand of light-hearted relief lifts the film from poor to average, and left me wanting to know what he will be staring in next, rather than any other acting talent on show.<br/><br/>In summary, I would say that this film will be to most Americans what ""The Queen"" was to most British people – and put on a pedestal because of the subject matter. But neither films are particularly enjoyable watch's and once you've seen them once, you'll never have to (or want to) see them again."

","""Lincoln"" tells the behind the scene stories of how Abraham Lincoln had to do to push the 13th Amendment through, in order to abolish slavery in America.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" has been nominated in many categories in the Oscars, but I have not been thoroughly impressed by the film. The plot is about how Lincoln lobbied to get enough support to abolish slavery, and this means a lot of talking. The film shows one meeting after another, and there is non stop taking about boring stuff scene after scene. How they can make such an emotional topic of slavery so boring is beyond me. There is not even an action scene to balance the predilection for sedentary activities. There is one scene where Sally Field shines with her emotional outburst, but this one scene is not enough to carry the whole film. I was bored with ""Lincoln"", because it is far too long and lack emotional poignant scenes. Even the supposed emotional climax falls quite flat, as the voting scene is simply chaos. The ending scene where we suddenly see why the guy took the original amendment away is not as effective as it could be, because there was no buildup to it. I was disappointed and bored by ""Lincoln""."

The use of the language of the time was a pleasure to hear, unfortunately it would be lost on most ears today I fear. Lincoln was a feast of quality acting but was done in a style that many might not enjoy. I expected a different kind movie in terms of the time span of his life and did find a few boring bits here and there having said that Daniel Day Lewis ""WAS"" Lincoln and all the other supporting actors did a great job.<br/><br/>Gave this a 7/10 because I personally did not overly enjoy the film (too many closed room scenes), but anything less would be an insult to effort involved in making this film."

","The movie genuinely demonstrates the ignorance of the Democrats in their attempt to bring down the 13th Amendment from coming to fruition. But history has dictated their ability to manipulate African-Americans with the use of African-Americans to fall for their ideology. Just as Western African sold off other Africans as slaves. The acting by Daniel Day Lewis is worthy of an Academy Award, and though I am not a fan of Sally Feld, her portrayal of Mary Todd was nothing less than awesome. Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones was spectacular, and a surprise integrate role within the film. This is a must see in the theater."
"kdnor2011","9","1","3","23 December 2012"," Great Movie
","Earlier this year, a film was released directed by Timur Bekmambetov called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. And it was a boring, cheap looking film that took itself way too seriously. Now Steven Spielberg has released his movie based on the greatest president in the history of the United States (in my opinion). And do I even have to tell you it's a lot better. But what surprises me is that not only is this film better, but it actually has more humorous moments than Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Yes, the drama about Lincoln actually has more humor than the movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, how is that possible? OK enough about comparing it to that film, there are a few things that didn't work in this film. For one it takes a while to really get going, the first twenty-five minutes or so can drag a bit, yeah I know it's meant to establish the characters and start the story, but I really didn't get invested until around the twenty-five minute mark when it started. And there are so many characters in this movie that I forgot some of their names, I remembered their faces, but sometimes it could get confusing, especially since I'm not a historian, or even that into history. I only know some stuff, so at times I got a little lost and would have to catch up quickly.<br/><br/>Basically everything else in this film is great. The acting all around is fantastic. Daniel-Day Lewis plays Lincoln so well, he was so likable, like a grandfather, and I had to keep reminding myself that he was Daniel-Day Lewis. He played it so likable, but also somewhat flawed, as his performance and the make up showed that he clearly hasn't been sleeping much. Everyone else from the veterans to the the boy playing Lincoln's youngest son were all great. The film also has an interesting plot, like I said it could get confusing at times, but I found some of the stuff it brought up to be interesting. Like are they technically stealing property by abolishing slavery. Production value wise it's amazing, the costumes, the make-up, the set design, lighting, everything looks great, but that's Steven Spielberg for you. And I like that it has a sense of humor, that's one of the reasons I don't plan on watching ""Shindler's List"" again, because it was just so depressing. And since I'm not a history nut, I can't say how well this informs on the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, but at least this film acknowledges that Lincoln had more than one son.<br/><br/>Lincoln is a great film with fantastic acting, amazing production value, and and interesting story. It's only downfalls are a few pacing issues and being a bit too confusing at times. But those problems don't stop this from being one of the best films of the year, and a great film on Steven Spielberg's resume."

","Overall, I thought this was a great movie. The actors did a phenomenal job embracing their roles and making it feel real. The elaborate costumes and sets definitely helped that. Probably the most profound thing i took away from the movie is a new perspective of Lincoln as a person. Previously, I always thought of Lincoln as the president, or even as the concepts he promoted. This movie, however, does a great job on highlighting the personal struggles Lincoln had to deal with during this tumultuous time, and it really made me realize there is a ""person"" behind this famous presidency. Moreover, as a student in US history this year, I felt that the film was very accurate in comparison to history. I feel the film did a great job of highlighting the turmoil happening between the northerners themselves during this time, which is largely unknown. Many more were against what Lincoln was doing as president than we may realize and the scene with the couple in Lincoln's office along with the scenes regarding the passage of the amendment are prime examples the writers use to show the turmoil. I also think they did a good job of portraying Lincoln's cabinet and it's differences. Lincoln purposefully chose a cabinet that held ideas that did not totally agree with his own, and the movie portrays this accurately. The only complaint I have is that I went in to the movie pretty much knowing the story line since I have studied it this year, and I felt it was hard to follow at times."

","I finally made it to the cinema to see ""Lincoln"" with Daniel Day-Lewis. It's compelling, I want to see it again. I'm pretty sure you'll be like me, you'll learn more about the 13th Amendment to the Constitution than you ever knew. The amendment is surprisingly concise:<br/><br/>Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<br/><br/>It was speedily endorsed by the states and was finally approved on December 6, 1865, when Georgia ratified it. It was the first step of Lincoln's plan for ""reconstruction"" of the South after the Civil War.<br/><br/>Too bad he never had the chance to implement the rest of his program, which would have been considerably more reasonable than the harsh and careless policies adopted by the Radical Republicans after the assassination. A side note about the movie: Wow, it was dark at night in 1865. Gas lamps and candles don't throw much light. It was shadowy indoors after sunset, and, to our modern sensibilities, gloomy.

Having said that, I WAS blown away by the intensity of the overall scope of this film. I could only imagine that the writers and directors maintained a very large and detailed flow chart that kept tabs on all the minute and seemingly insignificant events that surrounded the well-documented incidents of this immense watershed moment in history. Every detail of the sets, props, locations, and wardrobe... everything, just immersed me in the film's absolute verisimilitude. I was captivated, enthralled and beleaguered by an immediate desire to see it again soon. I walked into the theater hoping to see a fairly good representation of Lincoln and his final days in office and ended up being thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>As to another reviewer who decried the entire film as boring and meaningless I submit them this small challenge.

Overall it was a great film I think that they may have overdone the language just because of the era they were in, but this is something very minor. I also felt that they did something very unexpected by on how they represented his death. It is not a side of the story that is ever thought about. This was also a nice break to the either constant extreme violence or rated R comedy that has been going on for the past few years.

","Now I can completely understand how some audiences was bored to tears while watching this movie and I can understand how some audiences actually enjoyed this movie for what it is. It's kinda like the movie ""Citizen Kane"" how it can come off as a boring movie but you might have to ponder upon it to appreciate it. If your expecting some good amount of action you will be very disappointed. Since this movie is just filled with dialogue that inspires but mainly it's the performances and the cinematography/production is what drives this movie. Steven Spielberg is one heck of a director and this is hands down a very well directed movie. The cinematography with the backgrounds and costumes makes it kinda seem your with the characters as they tried to get the 13th amendment passed. In fact this whole movie isn't a biography of Lincoln but about a big part of his life. When him and some of the members of his cabinet tries to push for the 13th amendment to get passed. I will admit for some parts of this movie I was bored but it did have it's moments, actually it had a lot of them. Although I was bored during some parts of this movie. As it progresses I started to get more immersed into what was going on. And even though most audiences will know how everything goes down there is a bit of tension and that is fine directing. All the cast did a amazing job with there roles which is the main part of this movie and it would take way too long to type all the positive things about there performances. But since Daniel Day-Lewis plays Abraham Lincoln...He was just perfect for this role, especially with his soft spoken manner in this. Since that is how I pictured Lincoln to talk like, cause sometimes the soft spoken manner is more effective than talking with a booming dominant voice. Although it can be effective as well sometimes like when it came to Thaddeus Stevens(Tommy Lee Jones). And although I like Liam Neeson, I am glad Daniel got this role and he most definitely deserve awards for this performance. It would have been a huge waste if this movie was not made because of Daniel Day-Lewis. And I give respect to Steven Spielberg for at least trying to stay in touch with history instead of throwing a whole bunch of stuff that didn't even happen. At first I was gonna give this movie a 7.4 but after pondering about it I personally think this movie deserves an 8/10.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>8/10"

The battles it did reveal were the ones in the congress and in private and governmental meetings between Lincoln and others, and between Lincoln and his wife and sons. The most interesting story, and the movie's focus, was Lincoln's push to get the 13th Amendment accepted and ratified by the soon-to-be reunited USA and how important that amendment would be to the future of the USA and especially the slaves freed by war decree.

"Peloquin_T15","8","2","10","26 November 2012"," ""Lincoln"" Review: Day-Lewis Transforms into Lincoln On-screen
","If you are looking for a biopic focused on the monumental life of the sixteenth president, ""Lincoln"" is not for you. Stephen Spielberg's latest film focuses on the last four months of Abraham's life and his struggle to pass the 13th Amendment, the abolishment of slavery. This movie teams arguably the best working director in Hollywood with the best working actor in Daniel Day Lewis. Day-Lewis gives a monumental performance as he always seems to do. I found myself forgetting that I was watching a movie, and focused on what I believed to be Abraham Lincoln. His performance is tender and heartfelt. He is convincingly wretched and weighed down due to the pressure of his presidency. He shows a human side of a man that is commonly worshiped as a hero. He is rarely portrayed as a godly figure and is on the same level as everyone else. Day-Lewis has already won two best actor Oscars, and I believe he is on his way to a third. His performance is subdued, but never tiresome. The rest of the ensemble cast does their job with efficiency. Sally Field and Joseph Gordon-Levitt star as Mary Todd and Robert Lincoln. However, James Spader nearly steals the show with impeccable comedic timing. Another bright spot was Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens. After War Horse and The Adventures of Tin-Tin, Spielberg returns to historical drama – a genre he found great success in through Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Overall, Lincoln is very dialogue driven, and anyone looking for a war movie will be disappointed. At the core of it, Lincoln is a movie about how a bill is passed, and the struggles that come with it. At the end of the day, Lincoln brings something new to the character that has been immortalized in American history. It shows a president who is continually at conflict with his family and his nation. ""Lincoln"" proves to be a history lesson and a drama. John William's score is as toned down as ever and feels reverent and subdued. The overall tone of the movie fits the story brilliantly. However, I believe that Lincoln's flaws lie in the writing. The screenplay is based off Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"". The problems lie in the screenplay which is written by Tony Kushner. The writing is tedious and sometimes the lines seem fit for a historical book than a dramatic film. If you have no other reason for seeing it, Daniel Day-Lewis is worth the price of admission. Despite its flaws, Lincoln is a monumental film deserving of much praise. Grade: B+"
"PWNYCNY","8","2","10","23 November 2012"," Interesting attempt at capturing the essence of an American icon.
","The life and career of Abraham Lincoln has been written about so often that to make yet another movie about him suggests that the movie maker has something new to offer on the subject. But that is not the case in this movie. Instead of offering a biopic, the director chooses to limit the scope of the movie to Lincoln's political maneuvering during the Civil War, depicting Lincoln as a crafty politician who is willing to circumvent the rules to establish a personal legacy, a depiction which diminishes Lincoln's greatness. The fact is that Lincoln wanted to transcend partisan politics, not lead it. His career was more than about counting votes or pressuring politicians. For Abraham Lincoln was more than a great president, he was a great man. Working under the most oppressive of conditions, and with the odds of success stacked way against him, he successfully led the nation through its most harrowing time. To portray such a larger-than-life person in a movie without diminishing the legend is a tricky proposition, and in this respect the movie fails because by diminishing Lincoln it diminishes the strength of his story as a drama. The drama of Lincoln's career lies in the very fact of his larger-then-life persona. It is true that Lincoln was a politician, but he was a lot more than that. He had uncanny personal qualities that set him apart from those around him and made him singularly unique. That a man born in the South, with almost no formal education, who started out as a laborer, who had a history of losing elections, had a difficult marriage, lost three of his children, and was despised by a large segment of the population was able to muster the energy and will to lead the effort to preserve the union and abolish slavery is amazing, but also is empirically inexplicable and thus defies dramatic interpretation. In this case, the facts need no embellishing; they can speak for themselves."

It is hard to tell how much of it was actually accurate and how much embellished. From the perspective of someone who may not know a lot about Lincoln or how the government worked, this movie explained things fairly well.<br/><br/>The long speeches made by Lincoln were slightly boring but humor lightened it up. In my opinion the character, Representative Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was the character that kept the movie going. His one liners and humor were funny yet they stuck in the audience's mind, allowing them to remember important facts that were used later.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a pretty good movie, one that historians will enjoy when they want to relax.

","One of the most celebrated United States Presidents, Abraham Lincoln was able to take the nation through a divided time, you did not have blue and red states but rather Union and Confederate States. The major division was the issue of slavery and carnage of the war between the states it caused. In the movie Lincoln, you are taken into the complexity of doing the right thing versus the most convenient. Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day- Lewis) is a folksy, smart, country lawyer who understands the shrewdness of politics. This movie takes one thread of the time, the passage of the 13th Amendment and chronicles the passage of legislation that would set the country on a different path. A talented cast of actors create a remarkable movie directed by Steven Spielberg and you will not want to miss Lincoln.

But still a good film, brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg, well acted by Daniel Day Lewis, he really gets in the role to the point, you'll forget he's British. Tommy Lee Jones is also good, a scene stealer in spots. Sally Field is also good as Lincolns suffering wife, a possibly Oscar nomination. This film has a great 1865 setting. Although i thought the film was great, it should have been titled something else."

","Straying from the conventions of a true biopic, Lincoln, the newest film from director Steven Spielberg presents a detailed view into the divisive state of American politics during the waning days of the Civil War. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner depict the monumental challenge and vast political opposition President Lincoln faced while fighting for the passing of the 13th amendment into the Constitution. The film is sharp and focused, concentrating less on Lincoln's personal and family life, in order to fully portray his tenacity and drive to have the hotly contested amendment passed before the official conclusion of the war. While this approach largely benefits the film, there are instances in which Lincoln could have benefited from a closer examination in to the President's more meaningful personal relationships. In particular, the scenes between Lincoln and his oldest son (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) seem to lack a certain emotional punch and ultimately seem fruitless and ineffective.<br/><br/>The always-stellar Daniel Day-Lewis brings a calm, subdued sensibility to the title role. Day- Lewis does well to depict Lincoln's humanity while maintaining his larger-than-life stature. He's seen in the film as a man of immense power and influence as well as immense charm and wit; always equipped with a joke or anecdote, but commanding and fiery when the situation demands it. As the film approaches its conclusion, Day-Lewis deftly paints the picture of an exhausted Lincoln feeling the full weight of the immense burden he is carrying. It's a brilliant, nuanced performance that further solidifies Day-Lewis as Hollywood's most gifted leading man. <br/><br/>In addition to Day-Lewis in the lead role, Lincoln is overloaded with perfectly cast character actors that breathe considerable life in to Spielberg's Washington. Much of the films humor derives from the trio of James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson as slippery Washington lobbyists tasked with securing across-the-aisle votes in favor of the new amendment through various under the table dealings. Sally Field gives a solid turn as the volatile Mary Todd Lincoln. Anguished by the loss of one son to typhoid fever and the dread of losing another to the war, the film's First Lady is portrayed as someone forced to put on a deceitful smile for White House guests while suffering privately. Tommy Lee Jones shines as Republican Congressional leader and devout abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, one of the many characters in the film faced with the alternative of betraying their own convictions in service of a greater good. <br/><br/>Despite Spielberg's reputation as the master of on-screen spectacle, Lincoln confines itself to a platform more fit for a stage play than a motion picture epic. At times the film seems like nothing more than a collection of mostly static scenes depicting men sitting in rooms talking. Despite its few visual flourishes and a brief battle sequence that opens the film, Lincoln could certainly be considered the least purely cinematic picture in Spielberg's illustrious canon. Even with these hindrances, the powerhouse performance of Day-Lewis makes Lincoln a captivating experience, if not quite a classic."

","It is altogether fitting that this film is playing to packed theaters this very special Thanksgiving Day. A film dealing with Lincoln, a leader killed in the 19th Century in a loss to the United States that took away a leader who had saved the country. That is because this November 22nd marks 49 years since the United States lost another leader in the 20th Century who was the last leader who had a great vision for what this country could have been- John F Kennedy. The difference is that in the 20th Century we lost the leader too soon to ever realize their vision. Lincoln's loss was after he achieved it.<br/><br/>This movies main theme deals with Lincoln achieving his vision, a Union with free men, not slaves. A country of peace for the United States did achieve a time of peace after the Civil War. Ironically that peace would not last into the 20th Century. The end of slavery is what did. It did take until the 20th Century during John F Kennedy's short Presidency that Martin Luther King would vocalize Lincoln's true vision when he made the ""I Have A Dream"" speech.<br/><br/>Politics aside, this film is a land mark for Steven Spielberg. He achieves something daring for the first time in his career, a mature themed historic drama. He pulls this off magnificently. He has a lot of help. The portrayal of Lincoln is top notch. The cast performs at a very high level. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of his life. From what I have seen and read about Lincoln, his performance is spot on with that. Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, and 87 years young Hal Holbrook are just amazing in support. Amazingly the script makes you feel like you know Lincoln and understand the politics. <br/><br/>The thing that makes this special for Spielberg is how he uses visual story telling with camera angles that remind me of Alfred Hitchcock in the later stages of the film. The scenes at the Hospital Lincoln visits, and especially the departure of Lincoln for the last time from the White House for Fords Theater illustrate the maturing of Spielberg as a Director. These visuals have rarely been seen in films and for this Director these sequences are 2 of the best he has ever filmed. It gives me hope that young filmmakers today will study these scenes and start doing more visual story telling like this film. These scenes raise the bar for Spielberg and he should use them to teach his students how he achieved them.<br/><br/>There are great script dialog like the conversations between the Lincolns bring their characters to life. the imagery of Tad on his dads lap. The shattering image of Tad in a theater hearing his father is dead. Fine film making to be sure as it conveys a human realism into the story.<br/><br/>The script is crafted in a way to remind us how dirty politics are and show us how corrupt a system and a country even Lincoln had to deal with. In a way the 13th Amendment is the main subject of the film, but that amendments star is Abe Lincoln. That is why this movie is correctly titled. It portrays too how smart Lincoln was as a negotiator. He faced more than any leader in US History yet."

","""Lincoln"", is well executed without straying too far away or over- dramatizing it from the historical and realistic beauty of the actual story of Lincoln. I walked into the theater expecting this film to be quite boring and over run with exaggerated drama however, I was proved wrong. Each character was done tastefully and grasped my attention. I felt sorrow, shame, happiness, excitement, and worried; although I already had an outline of the story of Lincoln, I still felt anticipation and curiosity of what the outcome of the 13th amendment vote would be. Daniel Day-Lewis preformed his roll as Lincoln phenomenally, by grasping Lincoln's elephant-like demeanor of strength, wisdom, and power beautifully. The film also did excellent work of incorporating humor without it seeming to fish for laughter from the audience. The only reason this movie did not receive a perfect score of 10 from me is due to the ending camera work. At the beginning of the last speech I instantly though of A Christmas Carol because of Lincoln's figure in the flame, I became irritated because of this holiday-like feel. Along with this, the transitioning was too slow and therefore became annoying to where I, unlike before the ending speech, wanted this movie to be over and done with so I did not have to sit there and wait for the screen not to look like a middle school student put this together like a slide show. The camera work felt like the makers of the film were trying to drag on the movie, I felt bored for this sluggish and lazy approach for what could have still had me at the edge of my seat in tears and clinging onto each of Lincoln's riveting speech. Despite the ending camera work, the rest of the film is wonderful and I highly recommend it for those who don't quite get history because this film will bring interest to that and many other kinds of audience members."
"deloudelouvain","6","1","4","19 April 2019"," Interesting but too long.
","I would have scored it a seven if it was not so long. It's an interesting story but they could have made this movie at least one hour shorter. Interesting to me, for an European, as in school we never learned about the specific details of the American presidents and the American history. In fact I thought in the Civil War the ""bad ones"" were the republicans and the ""good ones"" the democrats but it's just the other way round. Strange to see that the republicans are the racists now or at least that's how I see them after Trump. So as an historical movie ""Lincoln"" is interesting, even though it's more about the thirteenth amendment than about Lincoln. Great acting of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. The rest of the cast is also very good what makes Lincoln worth watching, even for someone like me that hates politics and everything that has to do with it."

If you want to learn about the American Civil War, stay away from this. If you want to cry about how terrible slavery was, this is perfect.

"noelcox","5","1","4","18 January 2014"," over-rated ponderous paean
","This film is well-made and on a superficial level enjoyable. Day-Lewis as usual dominates and deserves recognition for a great performance. But the weakness of the film - and I believe it is a serious one - is that it is so serious. It is a monumental paean of praise of Lincoln and the amendment abolishing slavery in the United States. There is precious little entertainment value in it.<br/><br/>I won't comment on the fact that the practise of slavery was never recognised in English law, and that the slave trade was abolished generations earlier in the British Empire (and it didn't take a bloody civil war to achieve that). Nor will I comment on the excesses of the Federal Government in the so-called Reconstruction Era, which saw the systematic destruction of what remained of the confederate economy and social structures, thereby condemning southerners, both black and white, to generations of poverty. <br/><br/>The film does show Lincoln's weakness as well as his vision. As a period piece it is quite successful, though at times it does suffer from the common problem of portraying events through modern eyes."
"acecomicscollect","3","1","4","5 December 2013"," Typical Hollywood, just can't help themselves
","Spielberg, remember when he directed good movies? It's been awhile hasn't it? This is another in a long run of mediocre yet critically overrated movies. The acting was pretty bad. I didn't think Sally Fields could have over exaggerated her emotions & facial expressions anymore than she did in The Amazing Spider-Man but she certainly managed to do so as Mrs. Lincoln. Daniel Day Lewis has been hailed as giving us a great performance. If you believe grinning & smirking dictate a great performance then you'll like him here. He portrays him physically as slow, calm, cool, with deliberate movements. Then he inexplicably blows up a couple of times to such an extent that he curses G-- D--n! Tommy Lee Jones (whom I usually love) came off as pompous & self righteous in his role. The title of the flick is even misleading, it's not much about Lincoln but much more about the once great 13th amendment which has subsequently been bastardized by the Supreme Court many times since. The opening scene where a Negro(as called in the movie) was giving Lincoln the riot act complaining about the lack of Negroes doing this job or that job, pay, etc. While that certainly falls in line with more modern times, it rings hollow & unbelievable in this scene given the time period. There were a couple of other idiotic scenes given the time period but I honestly don't want to discuss them. my review is long enough without them. So called conservatives take yet another Hollywood hit here. They still voted the correct way even though they didn't get what they wanted but yet, we can't make a political movie without a conservative bash, now can we? The amendment had already passed the Senate but I guess we're to believe no conservatives existed in that chamber of Congress. Wrapping this up, Spielberg has his money so like all other liberals that have their money to, they just can't resist bleeding all over the viewer while conservative bashing as well. I don't get it! I will always think back to Michael Jordan when asked why he didn't comment on political subjects, he stated, ""Republicans buy tennis shoes too!"" Thank the God that this Lincoln kept damning that I didn't pay to go see it. I watched it on Netflix."

","As with every Spielberg picture, the trappings are here. Gorgeous sets, costumes, lights, angles, and yes, acting. But the guts of this film are truly awful. This isn't about Lincoln, it's about slavery. When Spielberg dealt with the senseless killing of Jews in Schindler's List, he was on firm ground. Here, he plays PC, goes for the obvious, with no moral grounding other than, well, slavery is bad. All the drama in the world isn't going to convince that handful of rednecks still out there otherwise. This picture is a real waste of talent and money. A true disappointment, given the visual and acting treats that are signature and obvious. I waited for this to hit cable to see it...glad I didn't waste the 10 bucks."

","Review: Man, this movie took me all night to watch because I kept on falling asleep. The film is nearly 3 hours long and I found it to be quite boring and one toned. Nothing exciting really happens in the film and it seemed like an extremely long political debate about abolishing slavery. Steven Spielberg portrayed the period well and the acting is top class by the all star cast, but the movie just seemed to drag. Daniel Day-Lewis was an excellent choice for the lead, alongside Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Fields who also make the film more believable. The movie reminded a lot like War Horse because its not a badly made movie, but it just didn't work for me. It seemed like the director spent most of his time getting the story correct and true to his findings than wowing the audience which us a shame because I was quite excited about watching this movie. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Steven Spielberg seems to be coming up with average movies lately, compared to his old days when he was smashing the box office and he couldn't seem to do anything wrong. With movies like War Horse, which I totally didn't like, and Tin Tin, which was another average movie, I think that he need another E.T or Colour Purple to make the audience get there faith back in his movies. Daniel Day-Lewis is another one of those actors that always gives 100% to his roles and its never his fault if a film just doesn't work. Although the film is called Lincoln, it didn't really give an depth look into the man. It concentrated more on the debate about slavery more than his legacy, which was a shame. I'm just glad that I didn't watch it in the cinema because there is no way that I would have stayed awake.<br/><br/>Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $275.3million (Speilberg smashes it again!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there period dramas about abolishing slavery in America. 4/10"
"antagonist117","3","1","4","17 June 2013"," An unsatisfying hagiography rife with creaky one-liners
","Historical accuracy is not a necessity in movies, but one would have thought we had advanced beyond hagiography in our biopics. When Lincoln speaks, the slow zoom and the swelling music give the obnoxious impression that God himself is speaking through the 16th president, a man whose racial views were, though arguably progressive for their time, far from egalitarian or inclusive. Daniel Day-Lewis looks and by all accounts sounds the part, but the cheesy script leaves much to be desired. The historically-fascinating character of Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) is mostly wasted on laugh lines, as are side characters like James Spader's Bilbo. On the plus side, it is always nice to see Hal Holbrook, and David Strathairn shines as a grave-faced William Seward of ""Seward's Folly"" fame."
"bobbynear","3","1","4","5 May 2013"," Right movie but wrong title
","To say this is boring is beyond obvious. I stayed more interested during my history classes in high school. But beyond that is the fact that the title of the film is simply dishonest. As many people have posted, this is not the life story of Lincoln and Spielberg certainly never intended it to be. It really is about the fight for passage of the 13th amendment and Lincoln's part in it. It should have been titled ""Lincoln And The Battle For The Thirteenth Amendment""<br/><br/>It's obvious why it was not titled that way. How many people would have gone to see it with that title? You have to be interested in political history to want to see it. Calling it Lincoln surely got it a much wider attention before it played for even the first time and people knew little about it. From a marketing standpoint that was a brilliant decision. But the fact is that this should have been on TV on cable's History Channel and not on the Biography Channel."

","It's the type of movie that people think should be done, the type of movie you know the man playing Lincoln will get the Oscar if he's any talented... Again, it's Spielberg up to the task, and it's getting old... It's full of good feelings, of great actors, of drooling music... Frankly, we're tired of this.<br/><br/>Anybody who rates this movie so high has never seen the HBO TV series on John Adams, because THAT was good. That was unpretentious, and despite the overall historical accuracy, you could understand it. Here, ""Lincoln"" is full of boring political dialogs and useless secondary plots (the one with his son Robert is so badly executed...), and you can clearly see Spielberg didn't know how to end it. So he just did a speedy shot of his youngest son hearing the news in a theater, just to confuse the audience. What's the point ? If you refuse to show the assassination, or to talk about it, then just don't show it at all... There's nothing wrong in ending the movie in Lincoln still alive, we all know what happens next...<br/><br/>And the music, God the music... It's everywhere, ever seen a European or South-East Asian dramatic movie ? You don't need to use this Hollywood music so much to tell the audience what to feel... Spielberg is one of the best directors of the 20th century. In the 21st, he's just a parody of himself. He doesn't evolve, hence we all pity him. He's making the same movies, they just don't talk to us anymore, don't mean anything.

Finally, it came out on Blu Ray. My husband and I started watching it the other night and we both fell asleep about an hour into it. I was going to finish watching it, but my husband was not up for it at all and he already returned it to the video store. I've read several other reviews though and I think it would have been a snooze to continue watching this movie. I agree that it should have been called ""Ammendment 13"". I was hoping that this film would have been more about Lincoln's life as a whole, but from what I saw, it was just about this one snippet of his life. Lots of long, boring speeches. I felt that Daniel Day Lewis seemed tired and lethargic from what I saw. Not charismatic at all. This may upset some people, but Hugh Jackman should have won the best actor Oscar. Lincoln is my favorite president and I'm sad that this movie did him no justice. What a wasted opportunity."

HOWEVER, underneath all that, this is one BORING film.<br/><br/>What do we go to to the movies for? Mostly entertainment. Spielberg and this film seems to totally forget that element.<br/><br/>It's obvious the screenwriter is more of a playwright than knowing the smooth flow, dramatic transitioning, and pacing translating it on film.<br/><br/>The film is just talking heads the entire film and seems better suited for a stage performance or TV series.<br/><br/>In the making, they mentioned the first draft of the screenplay was over 500 pages (generally, one page is worth 1 minute of screen time); so, originally, it would have been over an 8 hour film.<br/><br/>Spielberg had to cut it down a lot, and he decided the most important part of the book adaptation was the ""13th Amendment"" section.<br/><br/>The title of the film ""Lincoln"" is very misleading. It really should have just been called ""13th Amendment"" but of course that would be a horrible marketing title.<br/><br/>I mean, there's a few scenes where they tried to show the personal side of Lincoln and his family, like the relationship with Lincoln and his son (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but it really doesn't go anywhere and feels totally incomplete.<br/><br/>If one really had no idea or ever heard of who Lincoln was, they really wouldn't get much out of this film either.<br/><br/>The whole film just focuses on trying to pass the ""13th Amendment"" with Lincoln hiring men to convince Democrats to switch their votes. It's extremely boring and frustrating to watch and listen. You might as well watch C-Span.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is really horrible and it drags the entire time from start to finish - there really is no high point -- yet the ending feels completely rushed.<br/><br/>This is by far the most boring film Spielberg has ever produced. Don't be fooled by high production visuals/set and performance.<br/><br/>This may be enjoyed by history critics (whether they agree with its accuracy or not), but for people who are looking for a full pleasurable movie-going experience, this film is not it, especially if you don't care for politics.<br/><br/>I also feel Denzel Washington was robbed for Best Actor in 'Flight' for the Oscars; his performance was much more powerful throughout the entire film than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln.

This was an amazing story waiting to be told, but the screenplay does a very poor job of telling it. There is so little character development that important characters -- and even some leads -- are often not identified at all, and even if they are, you are told little about their role in things.<br/><br/>Parts of the film become really boring with excessive banter that seems to have little relevance.

","I've been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln my entire life. I'm sure it has to do with the fact that he was assassinated and there's quite a bit of mystery and intrigue surrounding his presidency and personal life. He did so much in his terms in office and changed our nation for the better while overcoming all sorts of political opposition. I knew I would need to see Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" as soon as it was announced in production.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" focuses on the man's obsession with getting the 13th Amendment pushed through Congress before the Civil War ended. Abe was honest, but would see his mission of obliterating slavery accomplished by any means necessary. His drive and the toll it took on his family life are explored in great detail.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg takes what could have been a disastrously boring two and a half hours of non-stop dialogue and somehow makes it engaging and tolerable. The success of the film is based around Spielberg's casting of Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role. Day-Lewis owns every moment he's on screen and demands your attention with every word he speaks. He's merely the cherry on top of a brilliant and dedicated cast that includes James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Fields, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, David Strathairn, and many more.<br/><br/>Although they only took up a few moments of screen time, the scenes of the Civil War battlefields bore a lasting impression on me. The savageness of hand-to-hand combat was hard to watch. These soldiers fought hand-to-hand, which made it more personal. It wasn't a faceless war like today's, where we just drop bombs on each other and never have direct contact with the people we're fighting.<br/><br/>The fact that I stayed awake through two and a half hours of talking is a true testament of how well-paced and captivating ""Lincoln"" is. I'm really not one for talky and long-winded movies, but Spielberg's devoted obsession with the historical figure and Janusz Kaminski's masterful cinematography make the movie stand out and demand your undivided attention. It's a movie that requires multiple viewings, as there is so much being said so quickly that you're guaranteed to miss something important."

But when I had to choose I would always prefer Carpenter to Spielberg, as much of his cinema suffered, in my opinion, from melodramatic tones I used to consider unwanted (and I still do).In the passage of time, Spielberg moved on, showing his expertise as a director in movies like Schindler's list and, especially, Munich(maybe his best film), but it was only with the last Indiana Jones that he entered my pantheon of most beloved directors.From that point on I experienced his series of movies(Tintin, War horse and now Lincoln)as pieces of pure art, in the way we talk of art when we refer to great painters.In my opinion, Lincoln wasn't simply worth all Oscars;it deserved to be out of competition, as its director has moved to a sphere of his own, there with the great masters.The movie glows from beginning to end with perfection and makes us happy and proud to be human if such an accomplishment can one of us achieve."

","Last year USA-born Meryl Streep won her third Oscar for the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY (2011, 7/10), this year the academy will (seemingly) reciprocate a third Oscar to Brit Daniel Day-Lewis in his rendition of Abraham Lincoln. It's a fair trade, both represent the highest echelon of acting supremacy, a biographical piece of world-known historical figure is the safest touchstone.<br/><br/>But LINCOLN is directed by Steven Spielberg, an industrial tycoon who has nothing to lose and at the same time nothing could surpass his previous accomplishments. Last year WAR HORSE (2011, 7/10) and THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN (2011, 9/10) didn't exactly restore his capability as a superb director, but leading this year with 12 Oscar nominations, no one can argue it is the best chance for Mr. Spielberg and his team to attest their credentials and may be exulted with the glory. <br/><br/>I watched this film in a local cinema, being an non-American and a politics apathetic, the film doesn't grow on me as it should, it has its undeniable merits (an intimidatingly detailed script from Tony Kushner and a first-rate collective work from all the thespians, to name a few) and if its ultimate goal is to reach a more geographically diverse demography, call me pessimist, the outlook seems bleak.<br/><br/>Since the plot is a no-brainer, this is a battlefield for brilliant thespians, like a Shakespeare play, everyone is howling and bellowing, inveighing and swearing, with a scattering of bons mots and repartee. But how much viewers can feel in Lincoln's bones while watching this film? History is always written by the winners, since Lincoln is a valiant winner, whose conscientious endeavor to abolish the slavery may seem to be more like a political decision other than out of a visceral compassion as a human being, his stratagem can out-wit all those brains around him, the film, is well-positioned as a paean to American's beloved leader, Mr. Spielberg has been never so unassuming since his extraordinary career path. <br/><br/>The almighty Daniel Day-Lewis will be an insuperable crest for any actor in the drama range, whose congenital talent and meticulous preparation for his roles can spontaneously set up a bona fide paragon in actor's kingdom. His Lincoln is a mystery, a distanced role-model of the generations, a ""perfect man""in almost every aspect, but his struggle and ordeal still penetrates from within. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones, luckier than other supporting roles, clinch their showboating emotion burst and excavate their Oscar-worthy depths in their characters, two textbook supporting nominations are well-deserved. <br/><br/>The film is a high-caliber biographical flagship, but film should serve us a bit more than being a (politically) fly-on-the-wall machine to recount what had happened (who can tell what is the truth anyway), and highlight some uplifting moral triumphs, if it can spike its main course with some unexpected cinematic wizardry, then it will be a huge bonus. Nevertheless, supposedly no one will grudge too much if it wins big (e.g. BEST FILM & BEST DIRECTOR apart from DDL's third naked Golden stature) in the upcoming Oscar battle, afterward, Oscar is profoundly USA-tagged, it has its proverbial boundaries, but who doesn't?"
"Hitchcoc","10","1","4","22 January 2013"," Inner Workings of the Government
","I have to admit that despite my cynicism about government, I loved ""The West Wing"" and enjoy so much a movie that digs into the real politics of a time. While there are a couple of schmaltzy moments in this film (like Lincoln's first appearance to the young soldiers), I was able to forgive that and allow them to start their story. I think that Daniel Day-Lewis has again become the character that he is portraying. I've read that there are numerous descriptions of Lincoln's dialectic and his voice quality. I'm sure the technicians worked hard to create as much authenticity as possible. I stopped thinking of actors nearly a quarter into the film and began to see them as well-developed historical figures. Sally Field is one of America's great actresses. She has proved that. Her Mary is troubled but played with restraint. She is not the howling nut case that is how she is unfortunately portrayed. She is fragile and deserves pathos. The politicians are intriguing and flawed in their own ways, just as all human beings are. Tommy-Lee Jones creates an unforgettable figure. The real hero of this film is a script that pulls and tugs at people who carry the baggage of the nineteenth century with them in their decision making. The Union is at a pass that could cause it to come tumbling down. It is LIncoln who sees this and begins to strong-arm those who have the ultimate say. He isn't kindly old Abe in these circumstances. Greatness requires one to leave a few bodies along the way (figuratively, of course). He also is seen as a man who understands the world he is cast into. One wonders why he took this on; what was in it for him? This is a splendid film. The acting is unparalleled. The battlefield effects show a person who has a deep understanding of pain and violence. I was not disappointed in this for a moment."

","From the opening scene to the final monologue I was astonished at this masterpiece of a film. Spielberg has done it yet again, but let's get something straight here, this isn't a Saving Private Ryan crazy action, edge of your seat Civil War movie. This is a dialogue driven drama on one of the greatest men our history has ever seen, and his emotional and internal struggle to change the course of American history forever. Now, moving on...<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis. Wow. I can't say enough for his performance as Lincoln, from his emotional, heartfelt monologues to his comical stories, he was absolutely magnificent. Every time he was on screen I found myself wanting to just hear him speak or go off on a rant or say another one of his poetic monologues. I've heard complaints from people that his voice wasn't deep enough and that took away from their experience watching him. I thought his higher pitched take on Lincoln's voice was a.) more accurate, and b.) more fittingly portrayed how Lincoln wasn't this intimidating, fear striking leader, but more of a gentle, humble, and respecting giant of a man. In all his interactions with the other characters, this is outstandingly portrayed by Mr. Day-Lewis. It would be an absolute shame if he doesn't win the Oscar for this.<br/><br/>Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln was quite amazing herself. Her range from a strong wife and mother to a low, outrageously depressed woman is acted spot on. You could see the pain in her eyes as well as the effort to hide it as well.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt, though in a minor role, also had his moments of greatness in the movie as well. Overall, there wasn't a single actor who lagged behind the others, and this made Day-Lewis's performance all the more mesmerizing.<br/><br/>John William's score was subtle yet excellent, though I must say there were many important and impacting scenes without his score at all, which I found interesting yet incredible as well, which just shows how rich the dialogue is and how the music of their words are all the audience needs.<br/><br/>The sets and the wardrobe were so good they became simply second nature, which is what I believe to be an accomplishment when you are transported to another time, and it achieves it finely. The look of it all with the photo worthy shots had sort of a dark-esque dreamy look to it, reminding me of something of a new dawn approaching. Something I found appropriate for the film.<br/><br/>The story was executed brilliantly, as it is no easy feat to make a memorable climax to which everyone in the audience knows the ending to. We all very well know how this movie ends, but the film shows the path, the toll, the hardships it took to get there. And as in many things, it is not the destination that matters, but the path it took to get there, and such is the case with this great movie for a great man."

","As the Civil War continues to rage, America's president (Daniel Day-Lewis) struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.<br/><br/>Focusing on the passage of the 13th Amendment rather than the Civil War or any other aspect of Lincoln's life, this is a powerful film that could be seen as the epilogue to Spielberg's ""Amistad"". An epilogue that surpasses the earlier tale, no less. No other film that I am aware of (and I admit I may be simply ignorant) has put the focus on the freedom of the American slave, an event of importance almost rivaling the revolution. (Also, a story that continued long after Lincoln -- the amendment was not enacted until December 1965, and Mississippi actually held out ratification until March 16, 1995!) <br/><br/>I think Spielberg deserves credit here for a strong direction, and I would be fully supportive of him taking the Academy Award for Best Director. His dedication to this production, from the script, to the casting, to making sure things like a watch and wallpaper were historically accurate... if the director's job is to steer the ship, I find it hard to believe anyone steered any ship better than Spielberg did here.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is also walking away with the Academy Award for Best Actor. Do I know what the real Lincoln's mannerisms and voice were like? Of course not. But I do know that Day-Lewis puts himself 100% into all his projects, and he certainly did that here. From ""My Left Foot"" to ""Gangs of New York"" to ""There Will Be Blood"", Day-Lewis has proved himself to be the greatest actor of his generation. Anyone who is competing with him... well, they picked the wrong year. Denzel Washington or Joaquin Phoenix could walk away with an award if they were not up against Abraham Lincoln himself. This portrayal is the best since Henry Fonda's take on the man in 1939.<br/><br/>The other acting nominations are more questionable. Although I would rather see Sally Field win than give the award to Helen Hunt or Anne Hathaway, to say she was 2012's best supporting actress is questionable. The same for Tommy Lee Jones. He was probably better than Alan Arkin and certainly better than Robert DeNiro, but better than Christoph Waltz? I doubt this -- he seemed to be playing himself with a wig. He stuck out like a sore thumb in the 1800s... which is too bad.<br/><br/>This brings me to Best Picture, and I am torn on this. Spielberg, as I said, put a great deal of work into this picture and I doubt any other film required as much preparation. However, I did have some issues with it that I did not have with the other contenders. While we all know that Lincoln was assassinated, I feel like it should not have been in the film. This broke up the narrative arc, and had they cut off the story just before, as Lincoln walks away triumphant, I think that would have left a stronger mark on audiences. The last ten minutes of the film are extraneous.<br/><br/>There is also some question as to the historical accuracy. Spielberg's Abraham Lincoln is a man who lives to end slavery, who avoids a peace offering in order to free the slaves, and who is passionate about the Thirteenth Amendment. Of course, Lincoln did push for the amendment and he did sign it and the end of slavery is his legacy. But he also supported the Fugitive Slave Act, proposed the idea of deporting all freed slaves to Haiti, and said, ""If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it."" He was a complicated man.<br/><br/>Perhaps historian Joshua Zeitz sums it up best: ""Lincoln is not a perfect film, but it is an important film."""
"homevices","9","1","4","20 January 2013"," Steven Spielberg's brilliant historical imagination vividly captures the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln
","Who can't help but love Steven Spielberg? Spielberg, one of the most creative minds in Hollywood, has all made films of high historical importance. After making films about World War II and the Holocaust, Spielberg has gone on to another high area of historical importance: Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln's last three months (with a little bit of his four years altogether) as President.<br/><br/>The result is Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as our sixteenth and, as most people agree, most beloved President.<br/><br/>As director, Steven Spielberg takes Day-Lewis and a powerful ensemble cast (most notably Sally Field, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Spader). Viewers are shown by Spielberg what was going on in the Civil War in early 1865 and, in the meanwhile, the House of Representatives as its members were in the process of deciding either for or against slavery. The stresses of President Lincoln around this time are shown, not only in his job, but also in his personal life, most notably with his wife Mary Todd (portrayed by Sally Field) and son Robert (portrayed by Joseph-Gordon Levitt). Viewers are given a ride inside of President Lincoln's mind, a mind of faith, humor, and sometimes darkness as it was and as it evolved through the most trying times of President Lincoln's life. As a Lincoln scholar, I can tell you that the way Spielberg documents all of these personal traits about President Lincoln—and the way that the personal traits appear themselves—are impeccably portrayed in both quality and quantity. Daniel Day-Lewis, even if his heritage is the polar opposite of President Lincoln's, brings the beautiful talent that we all know and love him for right into his performance as President Lincoln. Every mannerism of President Lincoln, every trait of President Lincoln, is present in Day-Lewis' performance of him.<br/><br/>My only real beef to pick with Lincoln is the fact that it does not document the entire life of President Lincoln, which keeps it from (in my opinion) being the ultimate Lincoln biography (compared to the biographies that record all of President Lincoln's life). However, given how many limitations on time filmmakers have, I can't hold it against Spielberg. In ""making do,"" so to speak, Spielberg succeeded in giving viewers a whole glimpse of Lincoln in spite of covering a small (but largely important) part of his life.<br/><br/>Recommended for ALL, especially those who are and want to be Lincoln scholars."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","4","13 January 2013"," Perpetuates the myth
","The focus of screenwriter Tony Kushner and director Steven Spielberg's Lincoln biopic is very specific, following the presidents administration for a short period of around two months in early 1865. It is a significant moment in Lincoln's term as president, not just for the passing of the 13th amendment to the United States constitution, that would free the thousands of black slaves, but for a change in Lincoln's opinion of the black population. It is also a significant period for American culture as a whole. Lincoln's image and reputation are wholly constructed from this short time. In the opening scene, Daniel Day- Lewis' Abraham Lincoln, discusses the black experience, and a previous speech he conducted, with two black soldiers on the front line in the civil war, still raging five years since it began. This opening is critical to the change that he experienced when he saw young black men fighting for the Union against the Confederate army. Before this face- to-face encounter, Lincoln had been involved in the Emancipation Proclamation (passed in 1863), but actually had plans to deport the blacks out of the United States, if slavery were abolished, as he felt that blacks and whites could not co-exist.<br/><br/>It is typical of all adaptations of Lincoln, ""The Great Emancipator,"" is that the 16th president has been mythologised even by many history scholars since his death in April 1865. Spielberg is no stranger to revisionist historical cinema, of course (Schindler's List (1993) and Saving Private Ryan (1998) instantly come to mind), as the director tends to hold onto an idealised sense of sentimentality, a heightened range of emotions. It's often a cheap trick in Spielberg's cinema, but in Lincoln, the screenplay does hint at a man who is a little ambiguous on the subject of race. Day-Lewis, in a scene on a porch with his wife's ex-slave confidante, Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben), he plays Lincoln with an awkwardness. He asks her what he thinks will happen to the black population if slavery was abolished. Is he uncomfortable because of his views on deportation, or is he exploring the idea of absolute freedom?<br/><br/>Lincoln focuses it's attentions on the debates both in congress and behind the scenes within the seemingly cavernous rooms of the White House. The arguments and anecdotes about the meaning of freedom, and the race differences. The film attempts to show the bureaucratic and labyrinthine nature of policy change, let alone the grievances of changing the constitution written out in 1776. Tommy Lee Jones plays Thaddeus Stevens, a staunch opponent of slavery, and advocate of total freedom for blacks. As his story unfolds in congress, his secret personal life reveals itself almost revelatory in its conclusion. <br/><br/>The American civil war was a brutal war, mechanised by the rise of the industrial revolution, leading to hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded. Whilst the scenes between son and wife are well scripted and acted, their presence seems secondary to what will, in part, contribute to awards heavy adulation of the Day-Lewis performance. Not only does he portray a president adored throughout history, but the script gives the actor a series of hyperbolic and anecdotal monologues. In practically all of Day-Lewis's performances, he has a moment in which he orates a lengthy, passionate speech, bringing stories to their emotional peek. In Lincoln, he almost explicitly has one of these fervent, impassioned moments, in every scene in which he is sitting. They are often humorous, but after a while, the obvious pleas for Oscar recognition, and fundamentally, to over emphasis the man as a great orator, and a man of complete honour and tolerance.<br/><br/>Undeniably, the film is sumptuously beautiful to look at. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski conjures up a dark, candle-lit and fire- lit image when photographing inside. The minimal light, and contemporary decor, produces a palate of ochre's and earthy colours. When shooting outside, the grey of January winter bleeds from the sky into the skin of the characters, and the spacious clutter of buildings. The film juxtaposes these primitive images of the mid-ninetieth century surroundings with the very modern debates of morality and enslavement. There is a clear reason why Lincoln has been made in 2012. Lincoln's status as the emancipator of the black population, his image and his outstanding myth, were used during current president, Barack Obama's, presidential campaign in 2008. His myth is enduring (his Washington D.C. monument being the sight in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke publicly about the failure of the Emancipation Proclamation to truly free black people in America), but his (and Day-Lewis's) performance as a saviour and saint, would always win over a nation of people whose emotional attachment to their history can be easily manipulated and perpetuated through mass communication and fact and fiction merge to create an acceptable narrative.<br/><br/>Lincoln is an interesting film. The machinations of politics are a subject that should be relevant to most people in this period where nefarious politics are happening in plain sight, but whose unknown activities are most likely darker and fundamentally scarier than is possible to imagine. This Lincoln has very slight moments of enigma, his character is at times inscrutable, but the film doesn't offer insight into these confusions of intention or social outlook. However, when these ambiguities present themselves, they are soon reversed by ever- present adoration of the historical figure, this is perfectly illustrated in the closing moments. The film uncomfortably and unnecessarily attaches Lincoln's death scene at the end (which occurred two or three months after the time period the film is set). A tactic that opens the film into stomach churning celebration and lionising, where his famous speech lingers over the ghost on Lincoln, the generic emotional music of John Williams echoing into the credits. It's a shame the filmmakers perpetuated the myth instead of penetrating a character whose true identity is clouded in over a century of storytelling, and pseudo-religious worship. <br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"sddavis63","7","1","4","12 January 2013"," It's Good, But A Bit Of A Surprise
","There can be absolutely no doubt at all that the highlight of this movie is the superb performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. I've seen a number of his movies, and this is without a doubt his best piece of work. He becomes Lincoln in every way. Yes, the makeup is great. He looks the part. Physically he comes across as Lincoln. From everything I've read about Lincoln, he was tall and gangly and a bit awkward in his gait and stride. Day-Lewis got all that. But it was more than just that. I thought he captured the essence of the man. He was quiet and gentle; a soft-spoken story teller with a sense of humour. That was there. He was a political animal, making deals and dispensing patronage freely. This really was a fine portrayal of the man by Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>And yet, strangely enough, the movie didn't overwhelm me. It was good, but I didn't think it was great. It surprised me a bit. I was expecting it to revolve around the Civil War and military matters. Instead, it was almost entirely focused on the fight to get the House of Representatives to pass the 13th amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery. It's primary focus was the political struggle involved with that. In a way, it struck me as a sort of American version of ""Amazing Grace"" - which dealt with the fight to get a bill outlawing slavery through the British Parliament. All the major figures were included in the movie, but the point seemed to be that it was the minor players who aren't much remembered by history who gave the votes to pass the amendment, usually because their support was purchased by patronage appointments. There's also a brief but interesting portrayal of the River Queen Conference with Confederate leaders. With that focus, be aware that this movie isn't about Lincoln's life. It's really about the last four months of his life, focusing mostly on the last couple of weeks of January 1865.<br/><br/>There were some good supporting performances, especially from Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln, and some hints of the Lincolns less than perfect marriage. Less impressive to me was David Strathairn as William Seward. Another interesting performance in a limited role was Jackie Earle Haley as Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.<br/><br/>This is a good movie by all means, and worth seeing if you're interested in Lincoln or this period in history. It's also a must-see just for the performance of Daniel Day- Lewis. Hype aside, is it the best movie of 2012? Personally I wouldn't go that far. (7/10)"
"hotchicklove","8","1","4","12 January 2013"," Helps to understand and appreciate that period in time
","Lincoln is a movie that is obviously character driven, and that driving force is Daniel Day Lewis. Is in a sure win for best actor, well, I'm not a professional critic or more importantly a member of the 'Academy' who everyone thanks when they win, but he will be difficult to beat, and the 'Academy' does like him (he's won two already) and Meryl Streep shows that playing a historical character doesn't hurt come nomination time. With that said, you really have to understand and appreciate the period in time and what was surrounding America. There are two reasons I'm not giving this film a 10 rating. The first is that it seemed a little too politically correct at times, and I mean this in the sense that it's just that. Kind of when someone makes a re-make nowadays and they go out of their way to change the original casting concept of the old film and now they feel the need to put in one white guy, one black guy, one Spanish and Asian character either male or female, and then a person who's sexual preference is either bi-sexual or gay. Trust me, I have nothing against any of the above, but when a film tries to hard to be politically correct it's a point off for me. At times, I feel that Lincoln gets a little politically correct at times, and I think this is a result of social pressures or expectations. Things have thankfully changed for the better over time, but there's that 10% politically correctness that knocked a point for me. The other point knocked off is for the pacing. They could have chopped off 10 or so minutes very easily, maybe 15. The reason that I still give the film an 8 is that it is well done, top notch, felt like I was in the mid 1860's, and the acting was amazing. Spielberg has a gift and I hope he never stops making movies."
"fivesticks","6","1","4","12 January 2013"," Cloying
","Spielberg's Lincoln is a good film and most will love it. For me, however, the movie is annoyingly pious, melodramatic, and hard to swallow. It opens with the black and white soldiers unbelievably reciting the Gettysburg Address and never lets up from there. Spielberg's Lincoln moves throughout the film like he's in a medieval religious painting with a halo painted around his head. He's portrayed as more messianic than Jesus, and looks as if he's pulled straight from the wax museum. Thank goodness one of the characters in the film finally tires of Lincoln's stories for I certainly did.<br/><br/>While I'm confident most of the movie is based upon well researched historical facts, a little more balance would have made the movie better. The best movie heroes are flawed characters, not saints. Yes Lincoln was a renowned storyteller and he rightfully deserves his place in history for his achievements. I have little more than a schoolboy's knowledge of the man but it is known that he entertained shipping the slaves out of the country and some report that he saw blacks as racially inferior. He was a man of his time, however, and while it does not detract from his great achievements I feel the film could have knocked the great saint down a peg or two.<br/><br/>They needed an annoying overly-emotional actress to portray Mary Lincoln so they looked no further than Sally Field. Like others report, I feel the movie should have ended a few minutes earlier, before the Theater shooting. Stevens taking the 13th Amendment home is unbelievable and though it was reported his black housekeeper was his mistress, the movie portrayal here is pretty cheesy and more an ode to white guilt than historicity. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt this movie was much more Ron Howard/Penny Marshall than Steven Spielberg."
"michaelRokeefe","9","1","4","8 January 2013"," Outstanding movie experience!
","Steven Spielberg directs and Daniel Day-Lewis plays maybe the role of his life; Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's most revered presidents. The Civil War is drudging along, but the end is near. Lincoln has a struggle on his hands trying to end the war, end slavery and bring back the Confederate States to the Union. The 16th President's uphill battle is very cinematic. And the cold hard facts are a definite asset that helps prove the genius of Lincoln. There is not enough scenes of the Civil War, but one of the most gruesome sequences is the dumping of amputated soldier's limbs. The film mostly deals with getting the 13th Amendment passed, by hook or crook. In some historian views, the Emancipation Proclamation defined Lincoln. I rather liked Spielberg's ending the president's life off screen. When you see a sequence beginning in a theater, you automatically think you know what is coming; but it is not Ford's Theater and the only Lincoln in the building is his youngest son. Thanks, Mr. Spielberg for side stepping the assassination. Daniel Day-Lewis is exceptional. Can we talk Oscar? This film stars a who's who: Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, James Spader, Bruce McGill, Hal Holbrook and Jackie Earle Haley. An outstanding movie experience!"
"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","4","7 January 2013"," This year, the Academy Awards will be drooling over a movie that is worthy of getting the gold
","About a month before the release of Steven Spielberg's newest movie ""Lincoln,"" one of my fellow students in the film course I was taking at the time made what he perceived to be a very funny joke. We were discussing the pre-release hype for the picture and he, obviously not having seen it, said he was going to give away two spoilers as to what would happen: the 13th amendment would be passed and the president would wind up being shot in the head. The only profundity to come out of my colleague's remark (which only got token-chuckles from a few other students in the room) would, ironically enough, tie into one of the movie's ultimate strengths: the way it relies upon and bases its power upon the audience's pre-existing knowledge of its subject matter.<br/><br/>Like any audience member over the age of ten, I knew walking in that Abraham Lincoln was the president who oversaw the end of the Civil War, the abolishment of slavery, and who ended up dead before the American South underwent Reconstruction. Mr. Spielberg, the director, and Tony Kushner, the screenwriter, obviously expected this of their audience, hence why their immensely powerful movie plays not as a history lesson but as a psychological study of what President Lincoln and the people he was associated with underwent during those heated years of 19th century America. We already know that slavery ends and the president dies, so what's the point of talking down on us about it? After all, this is not the story of some obscure man, but the most-loved president of the United States.<br/><br/>Mr. Kushner's screenplay gains most of its strength in the backstage material: the politicians from both sides debating with each other, trying to win over the other side. This is a movie that is equally reliant upon supporting roles as well as the titular lead. As acted by Daniel Day-Lewis (virtually unrecognizable underneath all the make-up), Lincoln is presented as a cipher. An emotionally inspiring and coercive cipher, but a cipher nonetheless. And what he ciphers are the actions and reactions of the people underneath him: a sobering reminder that nothing in dictator-free politics, good or bad, can be achieved by one person alone. He makes the decisions and gives the oft-quoted speeches, but does not actually work the miracles himself. In fact, he's shown to be somewhat ignorant of what's going on around him. He knows there is a war and he knows that it is resulting in the deaths of many, but it is not until late in the third act, when he personally looks over the results of the Petersburg Campaign that he understands just how horrible things have become. Mr. Day-Lewis also makes the right acting choices by being restrained, not going for the cheap teary-eyed gimmicks for sympathy. So much more is accomplished with so little.<br/><br/>One of the best performances in the movie is the one by Tommy Lee Jones, who plays Thaddeus Stevens as a withering, somewhat arrogant dreamer forced to deal several blows to his pride (in a marvelous courtroom sequence regarding the interpretation of slavery and freedom) to see an issue even opened up for debate. And this is just one example. It is refreshing to see a movie about achievement in which the victory is obtained by a team as opposed to just one man. In the passing of the 13th Amendment (again, giving this away is no spoiler, contrary to my former colleague's would-be funny remark), I felt a big wave of emotion rushing through me. But it was not emotion from having seen the amendment pass (as I knew it would happen all along) but as a sort of reminder of one of my country's most important landmarks.<br/><br/>If only I could feel that good about what politicians in American do today.<br/><br/>Some of the opening segments of ""Lincoln"" are a little stagnant. Good-looking as the interior art direction (White House scenes) is, I was beginning to grow tired of seeing every political and intellectual conversation being set in an ostentatious, glowing room with the camera zooming and dollying from spot to spot. Surely Lincoln must have had a few interesting powwows with somebody in the outdoors. I was also growing a little weary of every scene culminating with Honest Abe telling somebody a story. One of his anecdotes resounds with a very funny joke about George Washington, but for the sake of pacing, I would have recommended Mr. Spielberg to excise it and cut straight to the subsequent sequence of Lincoln being informed of the war casualties. For the former scene was only filling space before the latter.<br/><br/>However, as the movie progresses (and many of the scenes shift to the outdoors) the momentum begins to pick up. And the silent stretches are even more fascinating as the dialogue-packed monologues. For Mr. Spielberg has yet to lose his ultimate gift: his acknowledgement that film-stories are told visually with the camera. That we can get dialogue from books and plays, but only movies can give us moving pictures.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" is not one of Steven Spielberg's masterpieces. The narrative structure is a tad uneven (Lincoln does not seem to have a real connection to either of his sons in the picture) and, again, the start is a little slow. But the film does have plenty in it to admire. After all, it goes on for 150 minutes and is much more gripping than any of Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" pictures, which were just as long and packed end-to-end with ear-stuffing explosions. This could very well be the best picture about Abe Lincoln's life since John Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" from 1940 and will most certainly be drooled all over come time for the Academy Awards. This time, however, they will be drooling over a movie that is worthy of getting the gold."
"bhaveshbhatia","8","1","4","7 January 2013"," Spielberg's Lincoln is not a history but the present in form of truth and politics
","If you think that Stephen Spielberg's movie Lincoln is a drab and dull biographical sketch of the sixteenth president of the United States then you are making a big mistake! The story line of the movie moves in and around only one-month period of the president's life; and that one month period happens to be the month of January, 1865. Through the reference of Emancipation Proclamation and Gettysburg Address, Spielberg has been able to portray a compelling and powerful figure of the iconic man, Lincoln. The movie vividly depicts the public as well as private struggle for emancipation of serfs. The movie gives a kaleidoscopic view of the person, Lincoln; we really do not need to look at his whole biography to get a vivid idea about the sixteenth president of the United States. Lincoln is a person who took the sole responsibility of saving the United States. He is an idealist who wanted America to be a land free of slaves and serfdom. His opportunism lay in the fact that he built in the quality of playing game called politics in a cool manner so as to accomplish what he dreamt for the Union. Daniel Day-Lewis has acted wonderfully to portray the passion that Abraham Lincoln possessed for America. The alteration of the flow of history made by Lincoln, who outwitted his opponents, has been depicted on screen fabulously. He also tells stories to his supporters to induce the policies of politics in them. <br/><br/>If you really want to know what politics really is, and how good a politician Abraham Lincoln was, then you must go to watch the movie Lincoln. You can consider the policies of politics to be very dirty and horrible, but the tactics adopted by Lincoln in terms of politics has finally forged the necessary coalition among parties in the House of Representatives, that led to the passing and hence enactment of 13th Amendment. The movie all along represents the battle intelligent and opportunist Lincoln has to fight for 13th Amendment. The movie, apart from presenting the politician, presents the man Abraham Lincoln and gives a clear picture of the 1860s government. While watching the movie, audience will surely inhibit the idea that though it is Day-Lewis who is performing Lincoln, Day-Lewis came to the world as a re- incarnation of Abraham Lincoln, only to show people what Lincoln actually did for the emancipation of serfs. Spielberg has returned to his very own form of direction and gave us a fantabulous movie that makes us to sit and ponder and thank Lincoln for what he did to save his Union. Lincoln has been able to eradicate the gap between history and present; what the movie presented is reality, struggle, politics, achievement and death; all are constant factors of life from time immemorial."

","How is it that Daniel Day-Lewis isn't one of my favorite actors?<br/><br/>He was brilliant in There Will Be Blood. He elevated that movie from a very good movie to a great one. He did the same for Lincoln.<br/><br/>If you don't believe him as the 16th President or as someone who cared more about everyone being equal or as someone who wanted the bloodshed over during the Civil War, then, I'm sorry, you're blind.<br/><br/>The movie, Lincoln, is not only Director Steven Spielberg's return to greatness, it's a very sad statement that after over 150 years, very little has changed. Of course, aside from the Republican/Democrat political change-over, it's the same back then as it is today. Heated debates, strong views and uncompromising votes still plague us today as it did back then. Mercifully, we had pure-at-heart Lincoln to do all he can for the better of all mankind.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is slow. Sure, it's riddled with heavy dialogue most of us, including myself, couldn't understand. And it contains just as many characters I could possibly keep up with (or learn about) as about three times the number of Dwarfs in The Hobbit. It didn't matter, to me. The movie was so elegantly made, so beautifully shot, I was enthralled so much I trusted everything they presented to me as truth of what really happened back then.<br/><br/>As long as Lincoln was alive, all that he did, learned and accomplished was not highlighted here in this film. The movie focuses on Abe's plight to ensure the 13th amendment gets passed so that both the Civil War ceases and that all slaves are set free.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved his intelligence, his compassion and his drive to ensure his vision of where we should be gets accomplished. He knew the game, the political one. He knew how to play everyone like chess pieces, but that didn't mean it would come out right. He took chances, sweated long and hard and without showing it, I know he prayed as hard as he could to make sure the just way prevails.<br/><br/>You cannot help but look up to this man. It's sad to say, but he was so ahead of his time, his views still aren't completely felt today. Maybemake that, hopefullysomeday soon, all humans will be treated equally. I pray to God that happens in my lifetime.<br/><br/>If I can get all this out of a movie, I know it was done right. It was acted and presented to me in the best possible manner. Though it's not my favorite movie of all time, or even, in 2012, it's still a great movie and if it does end up winning the Best Picture Oscar, I can certainly understand and not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Now, if Mr. Day-Lewis loses the Best Actor Oscarthen there will be blood, indeed."

","This is an excellent film. I anticipate an Oscar in the near future. Brought tears to my eyes. THe film was so Spielberg in presentation!!! Wow, amazing how politics hasn't changed... Fighting, slander, bribes, treason, lies, lobbying. I know I learned about Lincoln in school but never saw him to be the sensitive man this film portrayed. I loved his interaction with his sons and his ability to maintain an even tone while in a word battle! Mrs. Lincoln - had no idea she lost a son while in the White House. I have to hand it to Tommy Lee Jones in his portrayal of Stevens. If you are wanting a true history lesson, this is more a basic approach historically. I think there are enough books on the subject; however, if you want to get a personal glimpse into Lincoln's life, this is the perfect film."

","A magnificent film. It almost seems like it's divinely inspired. Most of the best films are about love, be it love between two characters, love for an idea or principle, love of a lost time or place, or a film- maker's love of subject. In this case, Spielberg's love for one of the few Americans all reasonable people can agree was a truly great man is palpable (and when love in art is deeply felt, audiences turn out; no mysteries here about its success). The care with which he shows Lincoln facing his greatest test as a man, a president, and historical figure is spine-tingling in its intensity. <br/><br/>Funny, in a year when the other film about Lincoln presented him as a vampire hunter, this one is shot and told much like a ghost story. A bold but fitting approach as there is something mystical about the way Lincoln goes about procuring the last crucial votes needed to pass the anti-slavery amendment. On the surface of it, logically, if one watches closely, he should fall short. And yet of course, against all odds, it passes. Perhaps only a magic-minded film-maker like Spielberg could bring this out. <br/><br/>My only quarrel is with the ending. As with A.I. (a botched and vastly inferior film) Spielberg doesn't quite know how or when to end his story. <br/><br/>Once the amendment is passed, there needs to be a more poetic way of pointing to Lincoln's assassination and fading to his stirring flashback address than showing his son and wife's bawling, hysterical reactions to the news, then cutting to Lincoln lying on his deathbed surrounded by loved ones and cabinet members. There, Lincoln looks so small and pitiful in contrast to the meticulous legend building of the previous 2 1/2 hours that it breaks the spell. It belongs in another film, the assassination story, not this one. <br/><br/>And the haunting final line - which may or may not actually have been uttered by Stanton, but surely should have been - ""And now he belongs to the ages"" is curiously all but thrown away. <br/><br/>But I'm more than willing to forgive 5 ill-advised minutes in an overall great film (in the great cinematic year of 2012)."

","If you love action movies and can't stand high drama, historical movies do not see this movie. You will have wasted your time and money and definitely will not appreciate the value of this film. However, if you do have a love of history and/or drama this movie is going to enthral you. Let's start with the cons: At some parts of the movie you may feel lost as to what is going on if you do not have a thorough knowledge of the political system in the US or if you weren't paying the utmost attention. Certain incidents were not well explained which led to a five minute period of annoyance as to what happened. The Pros: The movie at most parts is fast paced and does a great job of making a very accurate and gritty depiction of the last days of Lincoln The Verdict: If you are looking for a movie with good educational and dramatic value you should definitely see this movie. However, if you are hoping to see people say ""yippie kay yay"" and blow stuff up you may want to just rent Die Hard."

","There is no question of the extraordinary portrayal of the title character by Daniel Day-Lewis. It is forceful, nuanced and absorbing. He is truly a great actor. The misgivings I have are the telling of the story, which kind of veers toward political correctness. Besides Mr. Day-Lewis, most of the other roles are underwritten. Tommy Lee Jones has shown himself to be time and again a wonderful actor, but he is not in this film enough for us to consider his role in the passing of the 13th Amendment. Sally Field, as Mary Todd Lincoln,barely needs to be in this. The film wants to please everyone, which is fine, but it reaches too far. It is at times way too much talk. However, watching Daniel Day-Louis is worth the price of admission. So, a little conflicted but recommended."

","Lincoln (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's telling of the last four months in the life of Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) focuses on him trying to get the law passed to free the slaves. I will probably be in the minority on this one but while LINCOLN contains some brilliant acting, wonderful costume designs and there's no doubt that Spielberg nails the look of 1865, I still found this film to be somewhat of a disappointment. For starters, the film itself really isn't about Lincoln, although it certainly wants people to realize that he's just a good old boy who did great things. There's no question about that but we really don't get to learn too much about him because the main focus of the film is various people trying to free the slaves. That's the main focus of the film and I think at times this here really drags the film to a halt because of Spielberg's handling of it. There are many, many sequences that just drag on to the point where it really does seem like you're watching them in slow motion and it appears, to me anyways, that it's a director having issues with what to do with dialogue scenes. The majority of them really don't build anything except for some annoying cinematography that constantly has the camera swinging around. There are scenes with added bits of life and exciting, like the eventual vote, but these scenes are far between. Even scenes where we get to see Lincoln struggling with his troubled wife (Sally Field) are far more exciting. Still, the performances here are so great that it's impossible not to get something out of the film. Day-Lewis is almost ghostly in the way he can just float into this role and there is never a time where you feel like you're watching an actor. The actor makes you feel as if you're really watching the real Lincoln. Field is also good in her supporting bit as is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader and we get exceptionally strong work from David Strathairn and Tommy Lee Jones. The look of LINCOLN is also incredible and especially the terrific costume design and set design. Still, I was expecting a lot more from the film so while there's some great stuff, I still must say that I found it a bit disappointing."

"Kingslaay","Null","1","5","25 April 2017"," Not bad but a bit of a let down
","I had high hopes for Lincoln, one of most respected figures in American History. We know there was a lot of material that could be dramatized regarding this great man's life. However I was quite disappointed. The film only focused on a certain part of his life. Now if you direct it with enough finesse and make it captivating then it could be a great film. This has been done successfully with 13 Days about the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. However this period of Lincoln's life was dramatized in quite a dull manner as it followed the legislative hurdle Lincoln faced. It was disappointing to take such a large figure like Lincoln and make a film about his battles with Congress when there was so much more that occurred in his life that was more eventful and entertaining. <br/><br/>If one were to make a film today about JFK with the tag line JFK or Kennedy one would expect a more complete and eventful dramatization of his life. We would not expect Kennedy spending most of the film fighting with Congress and observe a 100 days worth of this legislative battle. Therefore it follows that a film called Lincoln or about him should have been more complete and eventful or if it were about a period, choose an interesting period. Congress and political battles are not worth dramatizing. Perhaps the title should have been renamed to 'The Bill' or Emancipation Bill or something specific. <br/><br/>Besides the big flaws the acting was very good and DDL deserved an Oscar for his portrayal. <br/><br/>6.5"

Flat movie, full of stereotypes, all the common worn out pathos tricks, even DD Lewis which I adored in other movies disappointed me as a tired uninspired Lincoln. Strange scenario that puts so much emphasis on the vote of the 13th amendment, some poor attempts to depicts aspects of his private life, nothing about his life prior to his election, the most awkward being the last scenes - his assassination - being rushed in 2 minutes. So sadly, absolutely no relief coming from this movie. May be Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter would have done a better job!"

I argue the plot because they could have made it more dramatic, more interesting, more uplifting with the most historic event in the history of the United States. Sally Field was terrible. The worst is that it dragged on, for 2.5 hours! The entire movie is summed up in one scene; when the military generals are strategizing in the war room and Lincoln interrupts to tell a story. Edwin Stanton interrupts and yells ""NO! Not one of your long boring stories again! I can't take it!"" and then Stanton leaves. It was at this point of the movie I nearly walked out of the theater, and I should have. This movie sucked and I don't know why we praised it.

"jeff_ray3","4","1","5","24 November 2013"," Lincoln - Out of the Dark
","People mumbling history books in near darkness. I couldn't even call it a period piece as the darkness seemed to be a dodge to avoid having to make realistic and detailed sets and costumes. Well, they got the stark and emotionally impacting silhouette of Lincoln, but that's it. Good performances? Couldn't tell because it was like watching a play with no lighting. Any film that requires such close attention be paid and then makes it visually unwatchable shouldn't be rewarded for being obtuse. I even checked it in several formats to be sure it wasn't just the DVD.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, the attempt was to emulate the lighting conditions of the time, however, human eyes are sensitive to a huge range of luminosity. EVEN BY CANDLELIGHT, WE CAN SEE VERY FINE DETAILS IN OUR SURROUNDINGS. This film's dark field with very small bits of light on it feels like the paintings of the time, but doesn't effectively communicate the period and certainly gets in the way of enjoying it. Even in my dimmest memories there aren't huge areas of black. I doubt there was more hatchet lighting and inverse silhouetting in the past as very few of their light sources would produce such hard edges..<br/><br/>So, it felt unrealistic or at least not at all like humans see. The only conclusion I can draw is that people had decided they would like it solely because it's about Lincoln and is a Spielberg film. When released they were blinded to it's faults by the subject matter and poor lighting.<br/><br/>The truly sad thing is these were probably decisions made in post while designing the color feel, the original exposures were most likely fine. When someone decides to remaster this film for humans, I'll be right there waiting to finally see it."

","Oh,what could have been. Steven Spielberg is a great director,but he got bogged down in showing a two and a half hour movie about the passage of the 13th Amendment. It was like watching C Span. The dialogue was pretentious and staged throughout. The endless haggling and vote-seeking put me to sleep more than once, but I diligently pressed the rewind button. Spielberg's genius showed briefly at the beginning of the film when fierce hand-to-hand Civil War fighting was vividly depicted as opposing forces tangled in a shallow creek.I had never before seen such a realistic battle sequence. His brief depiction of Lee's surrender at Appomatox was also memorable. The horror of the all-to-common practice of amputation was shockingly delivered. Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln was uncanny...I had read from a primary source that Lincoln's voice was indeed high-pitched. Other than that, this movie, which should have been titled, ""The 13th Amendment"" was an unrelenting,sleep inducing bore. What a waste of time and money.They should have made a film about Lincoln's White House years, including the death of his son, his hands- on military decisions and the firing of Gen. McClellan,the Emancipation Proclamation, the Gettysburg Address, the passage of he 13th Amendment, and Lincoln's assassination. Instead, the focus was only on the 13th Amendment....utter boredom."

I just didn't like this movie, what I thought would be an inspirational and powerful story in the same vein as Schindler's List turned out to be a shallow, politics-drenched snoozer. Perhaps it was my limited grasp of American history and politics that led to my limited enjoyment of the movie while other people seemed to appreciate immensely. Plus, we all know what happened with Lincoln anyway, so the movie doesn't really shed any new light on the man. Either way, in my opinion, Spielberg should stay away from movies based on the American Civil War or most importantly Slavery - neither The Color Purple or Amistad did very well."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","5","9 February 2013"," The Legacy of Honest Abe ...
","When I learned that Spielberg, the greatest director of his generation, made a biopic of Lincoln, the greatest American President, played by Day-Lewis, the greatest actor of his generation, I could bet my house, my car and all my DVD collection that the film would swap as many Oscar nominations as Razzies for the last Adam Sandler movie. If anything, the film screamed to the Academy: ""Give me the Best Picture Oscar!""<br/><br/>But don't pay attention too much on this sarcastic tone, it's only meant to emphasize my pleasant surprise after having finished ""Lincoln"". And by 'surprise', I don't mean I didn't expect a great film, but perhaps I was mislead by the title and thought it would be an epic chronicle of the life and death of the legendary President. Actually, the film focuses on the year after his second re-election and his three-month struggle to obtain the vote of the Thirteen Amendment, which would abolish slavery before the end of the Civil War. Like John Ford's ""Young Mr Lincoln"", the film spans a period of time, but probably the most significant of Lincoln's life, the one that cemented his status as one of America's greatest President, the most historically significant after George Washington.<br/><br/>And it's precisely because the narrative is concentrated on the last four months of Abraham Lincoln, that we're able to measure with a higher extent, beyond the profound humanism, the remarkable intelligence of a man, who understood that timing mattered more than motives. <br/><br/>Now, I expected the good man, the noble-hearted, the visionary and ahead of his time Lincoln, and I was certain Daniel Day-Lewis would be so resembling the man to the most subtle details, on that level, the lighting, the photography did one hell of a job by always keeping a shadow of mystery on Lincoln's face, exhausted, sculpted like a marble bust, in such a towering body that it looks like floating in the own light of its humanity. You forget it's Daniel Day-Lewis but truly a myth in march. Never since Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, has an actor transcended the legend of his own character, allowing him to resurrect on the silver screen with never looking like a movie character; Oscar-worthy performance? That goes without saying.<br/><br/>Still, THAT, I expected. And Spielberg being a director who loves to touch the heart of viewers, it wouldn't have been difficult to do it, with a character such as Abraham Lincoln. But the genius of the film, where it caught me totally off-guard is to show me a new facet of Lincoln's personality: a political tactician and a genius on that level. Since John Ford's 1939 biopic, I knew Lincoln was a man of modest education but great humanism, he believed in people's goodness rather than placid codes and writings, and his experience as a lawyer forged his capability to be fair, honest and wise in his judgment. And one thing he knew was that Slavery was unfair, inhuman, unjust and had to be abolished, that was his intimate conviction, his mind wouldn't be at ease until he got the abolition.<br/><br/>And what the film demonstrates is a brilliant display of Machiavellism for the good cause, in a sort of political chess-game whose mastermind is Honest Abe. The dilemma is quite easy to grab, Lincoln freed slaves during the Civil War but a precocious Peace wouldn't have been without collateral damages. By reintroducing the Confederate states to the Congress and give them enough weight to vote a massive 'no'. Lincoln must act and quickly, no one like him wants the peace, but if the peace threatens his project, goddammit, peace would wait. The delight of the film relies on the whole tactical choices, postponing, bribing lame duck Democrats, even using some ""lawyer's dodge"" to make history, and how delightfully ironic it is that Lincoln's greatest accomplishment was achieved through corruption.<br/><br/>The film doesn't feature many battles, there are lost of closed scenes and some intimate moments between Lincoln and his wife Molly, played by Sally Field, but the core of the film is the political conflict between Lincoln, the Republicans and the Democrats, in order to get his vote, pinnacling in the climactic vote during which many Congressmen realized they were 'making' history, and were like graced by the greatness of the project. Tommy Lee Jones steals the show with his performance as William Stevens, the most extreme abolitionist of all, a mysterious character who'd have probably sunk into oblivion without Spielberg's masterpiece. <br/><br/>Well, you read it, I used the word 'masterpiece'  I've been very critical toward Spielberg, but it allows me to remain impartial and call a masterpiece when I see one. Like some of Spielberg's best, ""Lincoln"" doesn't feature any of his archetypes: Spielberg has always been talented to push the right emotional buttons, and he could have easily fallen in that trap while handling the 'most beloved' of all the Presidents, the purest American heart. But never sentimental, ""Lincoln"" is instead a gripping and intelligently written film, with powerful performances and a very un-Spielberg like austere directing painting a new portrait of the political arena, more confined and claustrophobic à la Capra , except that this time corruption is for the good cause.<br/><br/>And when Lincoln explains in details why the slavery must be abolished, instantly, he has the aura of a prophet, of someone who knew he was meant to be President for a reason, and that's the material great men are made on. After the vote, he walks away to the theater while his servant looks at him with admiration. His job on Earth was finished and after his assassination, he belonged to time, and I suspect he became an immediate legend. <br/><br/>Maybe the film didn't need the assassination part (despite a clever twist) as the silhouette of Lincoln walking away was already a powerful symbol, echoing the ending of John Ford's classic."

","From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), this was the film of the year 2013 that got the most Academy Awards nominations, receiving twelve nominations, and the image of the actor in the guise of the leading true-life character was spot on, so I had to see whether it was worthy after the awards it won. Basically it is 1865, the American Civil War may be coming toward its conclusion, having lasted four years, and U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Daniel Day-Lewis) has started his second term in office as a successful leader, and he has an endeavour to bring peace and prosperity to the nation. He wants to change the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which will mean the abolishment of any kind of slavery in the United States, and with African American black people mainly being the people who are looked at as being different and most only fit for slavery it is a controversial subject. Lincoln was already successful with the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, so all he needs to do is secure a higher amount of voters for the supporting rather than opposing side to pass the amendment, and he believes it may be an answer into helping ending the war sooner. While the President and Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) work on confirming Democratic votes, the issue is eventually brought to the courtroom, with many people, including the President's wife Mary Todd (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sally Field) watching the events unfold, and Thaddeus Stevens (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Tommy Lee Jones) is fighting to defend racial equality and pass the amendment. After many political discussions, numerous arguments amongst politicians, Lincoln having to battle a crisis of conscience whether to end slavery or end the war, but whatever decision getting the support of Mary and his colleagues, until the court case reaches its conclusion, everyone casts their vote on whether to have the Thirteenth Amendment changed and slavery should end forever. In the end all are happy with the final decision that, many votes ahead of opposition, the constitution is indeed and slavery comes to an end, but on the night April 14th 1865 Lincoln attends an evening at the theatre, and it is announced that the President has been shot (the shooter was John Wilkes Booth), all who knew him gather round his body in bed after being pronounced dead, and it quickly sees a flashback of the second term inaugural speech by Lincoln. Also starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln, James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, Hal Holbrook as Francis Preston Blair, John Hawkes as Robert Latham, A Nightmare on Elm Street's Jackie Earle Haley as Alexander H. Stephens, Bruce McGill as Edwin M. Stanton, Tim Blake Nelson as Richard Schell, Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant, Lee Pace as Fernando Wood, Walton Goggins as Clay Hawkins, Gulliver McGrath as Tad Lincoln, The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as Corporal Ira Clark and Witness's Lukas Haas as First White Soldier. I am not going to pretend I know a lot about politics and everything that was being said during the film, I was mainly going to see it for the deservedly Oscar winning performance by method actor Day-Lewis, he really does get into the mind of the great man and with the fantastic makeup you forget it is the actor inside, and he made history becoming the first actor to win three leading actor gongs, the supporting cast members Field and Jones are fantastic as well. The plot was easy to understand, it was just everything around it, there was thankfully not too much war material to confuse you or slow down the pace, the feel is calm but with the right amount of engaging scenes, especially between Lincoln and his wife, and in the court room, you can ignore the hard to follow bureaucratic gobbledygook being spoken and just go with it, it is an enjoyable political biography drama. It won the Oscar for Best Production Design , and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound Mixing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Costume Design, Make Up & Hair, Original Music and Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Original Score - Motion Picture and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. Very good!"
"3xHCCH","6","1","6","13 January 2013"," More About Emancipation of Slaves Than About Lincoln Himself
","Ever since I saw the first poster of Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"", with the intense Daniel Day-Lewis in excellent Lincoln make-up, I immediately knew this would already be seriously in the running during the Oscar Awards. And this was confirmed recently when this film garnered Oscar nominations in 12 categories. This is really a must-see film.<br/><br/>This film was only about the political (and some personal) travails Lincoln experienced as he was trying to pass the 13th Amendment or the Emancipation Proclamation through Congress. This is not a biographical film at all as I was expecting. There were no scenes of his birth, childhood, education, rise in politics, etc. I felt this movie was deceptively titled. <br/><br/>The technical aspects of this film were excellent as the cinematography, production design, costumes and make-up (not nominated!) were flawless. The color palette was muted to give it an authentic historical feel. Spielberg's obsessive attention to details and sentimentality, known from all his former films, was in full display here.<br/><br/>The acting was so perfectly attuned to the time period the actors were set in. Daniel Day Lewis IS Abraham Lincoln! He was amazingly real, I did not see him as acting as much as he was being Lincoln. I initially felt Sally Field was miscast, but she eventually redeemed herself in her effective portrayal of troubled Mary Todd Lincoln. Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens had his big moment when he delivered a fiery speech against those opposing the amendment.<br/><br/>I think the main problem with this film was that it dealt with events which entailed showing people merely involved in a lot of long-winded conversations. The whole film was about 2 and a half hours long, and more than half of that time was just showing politicians talking about their pro or con views about the proposed Amendment. Admittedly for non- Americans (and maybe some Americans too as I can read on some reviews here), these scenes will seem very dry, tedious and meaningless. <br/><br/>I was disappointed that this was not exactly the biography of Abraham Lincoln as I had been expecting. So gone was the opportunity of comparing the real way Lincoln grew up from the version I learned from another Lincoln film released in 2012 where the good President was a Vampire Hunter. Ironic too that we also did not also see the assassination we all knew would happen. Spielberg decided to present that event in another way, which I'm sure disappointed many people, including me."
"mformoviesandmore","6","1","6","11 January 2013"," The opposite of Duel
","Duel is a great movie.<br/><br/>We get tension, excitement, action. We get taken in to the movie. The story is expressed with few words but no one misunderstands what is happening.<br/><br/>Lincoln, the movie, is dull. Verbose; isn't sufficient to described the deluge of words. At no point is there any involvement. I heard some people were teary eyed over the opening scenes when soldiers quoted from Lincolns speech/address. I saw schmaltz.<br/><br/>DDL certainly looked the part of Lincoln, or at least resembled the caricature I am familiar with. But after 45 minutes I had had enough of his role as it seemed to be the same scene repeated over and over again. The scenes that are meant to be more important were clearly labeled by the generic music that starts up - the same horns and orchestra that we heard in SPR, among others.<br/><br/>From what I have read of American history it is also not a necessarily accurate movie.<br/><br/>The weirdest part for me was the ending. The movie started with Lincoln already president and having won a second term. The ending was of his son at a theatre where it is announced the president had been shot at another theatre. Perhaps I missed what the point of that was. Having missed 99% of his life by the time the movie started, probably because of how it could have portrayed him in a different light, his death was unnecessary other than for tear jerking.<br/><br/>The movie could have been called The Vote, or The Thirteenth Amendment - as a better description of the events covered. It certainly wasn't a 'warts-and-all' story of Lincoln."

","I am a Swede and so a ""foreigner"" to the people of America. In practice I have as little to be proud of that fact as any people for in my country as in all other countries today slavery is not abolished. It has simply become ""wage-slavery"". Compared to open slavery there is however a little difference. You cannot as easily kill a wage-slave as a slave that is your property. You can as easily starve a wage-slave and make his or her life as miserable as any slave's but you cannot go forth and simply openly kill a wage-slave as easily as a slave which is your property.<br/><br/>To most foreigners there is a mystery about Americans, especially poor Americans. How could they ever vote Republican? This movie provides no answer to that question and does instead add another question: ""How can a poor person ever vote Democrat?"".<br/><br/>As the example of the Soviet Union clearly demonstrates Communism or Socialism is not the final answer to Capitalism. They are however failed steps in the right direction. We must find other steps in that right direction of abolishing all kinds of slavery.<br/><br/>What did all the poor people of the South fight for in the civil war, one might ask. That is the same American mystery as stated above. The answer provided so far to us ""foreigners"" is that they fought for the American dream, which means to be a millionaire before the age of thirty, by any means possible, one might ad. In competition with others, which means as much as animosity to others when you come down to it, you are supposed to get that million and that abominable action is worth dying for? Is that America? Yes, so it seems.<br/><br/>Communism and Socialism, when set in practice, did not abolish competition. Their theories were not strong enough to hinder a malpractice but these theories were not as silly as ""competition at all costs"".<br/><br/>So far, Anarchism has never been tried and maybe there are other ""isms"" out there that could maybe be tried. We must not give up and even if it is not plausible that we will survive if we continue with capitalism - that is really not the question. Abomination should never survive and if the species ""human"" finds no other way than that, then that species belongs exterminated and we should not grief its demise.<br/><br/>So, how do we arrive at ""total material equality"" as a first step to decency, because that is what it all boils down to for the present. Can you see your most hated enemy having the right to never stand before you with ""hat in hand"" begging? Can you do that, then you are ready for a life in decency."

","Well I've taken my time getting to this review. I've seen the picture twice and I'll probably see it again before it leaves the theaters. Part of my delay has to do with feeling somewhat inadequate to comment on a film of such tremendous scope and impact. It's almost as if a few words can't do justice to the exemplary talents of those involved and for the important event in our country's history that's related on screen. So I'll do my best.<br/><br/>The movie is simply a tour de force of film making. Attention to period detail and dialog makes for a rewarding viewing experience, and the players selected for their individual roles couldn't have been better. The accolades for Daniel Day-Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field and David Strathairn go without saying, but even the lesser supporting roles lend an incredible authenticity and drama to the story. Particularly effective are the machinations involved by the political heavyweights of the day to secure passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. One doesn't attribute such shenanigans to historical figures of the past, and this film is a reminder that back room deals and bribery were as commonplace as they are today, right down to the role of influence peddlers like Bilbo (James Spader) and Latham (John Hawkes).<br/><br/>Aside from the main story, the scene that gripped me the most had to do with President Lincoln's heart wrenching argument with wife Mary over their son's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) insistence on joining the Union Army. What little I know about Mrs. Lincoln's struggle with mental illness was dramatically showcased here in a very tough scene that almost overpowered the main story. I can't stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>With the benefit of a few weeks gone by now since the picture opened, there's another perspective I'd like to bring to the fore. Like many other movie goers, I caught ""The Hobbit"" yesterday, and even before the opening weekend has been completed, that picture has over forty eight thousand viewer ratings and over three hundred reviews already. Here ""Lincoln"" sits with just over seventeen thousand ratings and two hundred plus reviews as I'm writing this, and I think that in itself says something about priorities or lack thereof. Already ""Lincoln"" is fading in theaters with limited show times and for what it's worth, that just seems a little troubling to me.<br/><br/>One final thing, and that's in the interest of full disclosure. My best friend happened to answer an open casting call for ""Lincoln"" and wound up with an uncredited appearance in the movie as one of Lincoln's 'radical' Northern Congressman. It would be easy enough to describe him as the one with the long white hair and beard who resembles Santa Claus, but that would cover most of the radical Northern Congressman. His name is John Dever and he appears primarily in crowd scenes, but if you pay attention you can catch him during Senator Thaddeus Stevens' impassioned speech in support of passing the Thirteenth Amendment. In one of Tommy Lee Jones' facial close-ups on screen, John can be seen right behind the senator's left ear. Every actor has to start somewhere."

","In this historical biopic directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, we follow a specific time during Abraham Lincoln's life, particularly the passing of the 13th Amendment which is the abolishment of slavery.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great things about this film, and what I'm going to praise first is the screenplay. Tony Kushner presents us a very dialogue driven story of the great President, which was a nice surprise. Nearly every scene, every conflict and argument is pushed forward by a lot of dialogue, and if you aren't on board with it from the beginning and cannot keep up with the politics, then this film isn't for you. I'll admit I myself couldn't always follow some of the dialogue, but still managed to be riveted by the performances that were speaking the dialogue, from Sally Field to Tommy Lee Jones and Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, of course, as the Mr. President.<br/><br/>We already know Lewis is objectively speaking the greatest actor of all time, and he is fantastic as usual here. From his presence and command to the makeup on his face, Lewis completely DISAPPEARS in the role and plays a hero with vulnerability, conflicts to face, and an entire nation to run.<br/><br/>On the negative side, LINCOLN does suffer from a poorly executed ending, with Spielberg doing a dumb switcharoo, showing a stage performance at a theatre with a man coming in and yelling the President has died in the OTHER THEATRE, and then the film cuts to him on the bed as he dies. Rather than choosing to end the film before Lincoln's assassination or properly show it happening and developing it, Spielberg does neither.<br/><br/>Overall LINCOLN is not a film for everyone, but if you can sit through 2 1/2 hours of slow burn and lots of dialogues about politics, then you're in for a delightful treat."

For such an important moment in our history I feel it is important to provide greater context, understanding that the director was looking to tell a different story. It is also difficult to hear the president use curse words or to hear others use curse words in his presence. It may have happened, who knows?

All of the actors and actresses help to convey the emotions behind this event and make it seem very realistic. The acting was the movies overall strongest feature, as it seemed as if the movie was filmed directly when this happened in 1865. The movie depicts Lincoln during this time as many other historians do and emphasizes the specific qualities that we learn to be his defining characteristics as a successful president. Everything, from the language to the setting, was how I imagined it would've been in 1865. The relationship between men and women and blacks and whites was an accurate representation of what was occurring during the nineteenth century as well. However, one thing that I didn't like about this movie was the ending. Instead of showing the scene at Ford's Theater where Lincoln died, Spielberg showed a different theater where someone runs on in the middle and announces that Lincoln had been shot and killed."

That's particularly true of his more recent fare; for every MUNICH he makes a WAR OF THE WORLDS, so he's become a really hit-and-miss director these days. Sadly, LINCOLN can be chalked up as a miss, purely because it's so very dull.<br/><br/>This film is something of a biopic of Abraham Lincoln, although it only focuses on the most important parts of his life, inevitably those surrounding the American Civil War and the 13th Amendment. My question is, why does this film need to be two and a half hours long? Politics can be a dry topic to make a film out of in any case, and all Spielberg succeeds in doing is boring his viewer with one boring, talky, drawn-out scene after another.<br/><br/>It's hard to fault Daniel Day-Lewis, who brings his version of Lincoln to life with seemingly effortless ability; the star-studded cast are also fine and give performances that seem realistic, fitting well into the era. No, it's the dry script and too-large cast that make this hard to sit through.

","Right at the beginning of the movie, they show us the harsh and cruel side of war with people stabbing and trying to drown each other in the mud.

In the further course of the movie there are a few other war scenes but the majority of the film is Lincoln trying to get 'yes' votes for the 13th amendment. This is the part where it starts getting a bit boring for me because Lincoln sends people to do the talking for him while he sits at home trying to stop his son from signing up to join the army and listening to his wife complaining.<br/><br/>But the way that Daniel Day played as Lincoln was, to me, extremely good. He was humble and friendly but also quite severe and steadfast in his actions. He starts most of his answers with a little tale that mostly contains the answer they're looking for, but Lincoln refuses to tell them directly. This intrigues me, because this is one of the only movies that utilizes stories with life lessons to help solve some problems.<br/><br/>In the end this is a very good movie with some interesting things to tell, but it was a bit tedious at some parts and that made it boring.

It often uses dark colors for no other reason that I can find other than to put the audience to sleep. I think that the same story could have been told in less than 150 minutes, considering how much of the movie I thought was entirely pointless. As soon as the climax finished I was ready to fall asleep, even more so than the rest of the movie. I saw no reason to continue, and yet I did, and every last minute droned on and on until it finally ended 30 minutes later. <br/><br/>The characters are decent. Most of them aren't too interesting, but that's just thanks to the pacing, so it's hard to care when it's so hard to pay attention. Abraham Lincoln himself is the most interesting character. Danial Day-Lewis does a great job playing him. He's consistent in both the way he talks and the way he moves. The other actors were all just fine, but most of them were barely as important as Lincoln himself. The list of secondary characters would actually be pretty long, considering the only character who consistently and often shows up is Lincoln himself. <br/><br/>Overall Lincoln is well-made with a good lead actor and character, but it's far too boring to fully appreciate. I found myself rewinding on multiple occasions because I'd doze off or zone out and have no idea what was going on.

"paul2001sw-1","8","0","1","19 April 2016"," Hagiographic, but Day-Lewis is predictably excellent
","Americian opposition to slavery in the south was initially mainly founded on the fears of northerners of economic competition, rather than lofty thoughts about the rights of man. As a politician, Abraham Lincoln had to broker compromise with many factions to win power, stay in power and (after a refusal to compromise led to civil war) to ultimately lead the country on a path back to peace. As ever when compromise has to be made, one can question whether the decision has been made for the best. Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' explores some of these questions but in a not altogether satisfactory manner: the President we meet in this film is unquestionably both good and wise at all times. One would learn more respect for Lincoln in a story which at least offered us alternative narratives, ones in which Lincoln's behaviour or motives could be faulted. That said, Daniel Day Lewis is (somewhat predictably) excellent in the lead role, although it's not the first film I've seen him dominate while the rest of the cast genuflects. For a long movie, it's bravely talk-y, and as someone with a strong interest in politics, I liked the film. What it doesn't really do is explain why anyone else (whether abolitionist or confederate) was ever opposed to him.<br/><br/>A final point: to convey Lincoln's death (he was shot in a theatre) with a scene which shows news of his assassination being conveyed to another theatre seems a decision so strange I find it impossible to understand."
"Mobithailand","6","0","2","18 April 2016"," This pivotal event in American history deserves something a little better.
","This is not so much a bio-pic of Lincoln's life or indeed his four odd years as president of The USA. It is purely an account of the last few months of his life, during which he succeeds in achieving the passage of the landmark constitutional amendment, which forever banned slavery in the United States. It is the story of Lincoln's incredible battle to get this amendment passed, with the requisite two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, seemingly against all odds. The background to this event is the final months of the brutal civil war, during which no less than three-quarters of a million people were killed. The amendment must be passed before the peace treaty is signed as the southern states would then vote against it. The president is torn. An early peace would certainly save thousands of lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience – end slavery or end the war.<br/><br/>You could hardly have more epoch-making subject matter, and it is not surprising that Steven Spielberg chose this as his latest blockbuster – clearly inspired by one of America's greatest ever Presidents. It seems to me also timely and appropriate that today's American audiences should be taken back to a time, less than 200 years ago, when slavery was still part of their nation; and when they had leaders as brilliant, inspiring and selfless as Lincoln to lead them down the right path. With such an inspiring story, such a legendary director and one of the 'greatest living actors' it could hardly fail – and by all accounts it didn't. Lincoln was released to wide acclaim, and it won the best actor Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis. <br/><br/>As is often my want, I go completely against accepted wisdom and declare that I found the movie quite boring. I was also singularly unimpressed by Day-Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln. I know I am being a philistine and maybe I'm letting my prejudices subvert my good judgement. I simply didn't find the 17th Century political machinations engaging - and this was the basis of the story. Neither was I impressed by Lewis' whining, mock 'hick' Yankee accent. It just didn't ring true to this movie watcher. I get more worked up watching Washington partisan intrigues on cable news than I did by watching Spielberg's Lincoln. Maybe I've watched too much American political news – but either way, the film largely left me cold.<br/><br/>And before my American friends accuse me of not treating this pivotal event in American history with the respect it deserves, let me just say that I have recently finished watching the wonderful PBS documentary of the entire Civil War by Ken Burns – all 12 odd hours of it; and I was totally mesmerised by the entire story – particularly Lincoln's part in it. I am a very interested and a 'concerned' student of this part of American history and I am a huge admirer of Lincoln, but for me, this movie just doesn't do him justice.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Steven Spielberg is one the world's finest living filmmakers, and 'Lincoln' is not a bad film. It is well acted - but not superlatively so - well directed and well filmed. It is a thoroughly professional job that is adequate, but no more. In my humble opinion, this hugely important story at a crucial time in American history deserves something a little better."

","I suppose the use of a harsh word like 'boring' is only excusable for an amateur review writer, and so, there I've said it, boring! There has been so much hype about this film with the Oscars and all and all the meticulous period-detail involved (no denying that), but it came across as such a let down to actually sit down and watch. It is over-laden with turgid dialogue, one found that wheezy voice Day-Lewis gives the character quickly became rather annoying and the pomposity of the production as a whole was unbearable. So little humour, so much obsession with procedural motions of government! In such momentous times one would have thought something exciting or thrilling might be portrayed, but alas! This movie takes itself far far too seriously and ends up becoming less anthem, more anaesthetic."

","I had a friend who's brother worked in Hollywood. He told me that the rumours were that they were going to turn Doris Kearns Goodwins novel into a film directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. A small part of me started to suspect that my reason for being on this planet was for this. What an utterly incredible film that would have been!!!!! Raised by his mentally backward and physically abusive widowed father on the plains and then, with his little brothers and sisters abandoned over a savage winter with pumas growling at the door to fend for themselves and found 6 months later reduced to practically animals themselves. Uneducated and in poverty, leaving the ""house"" at 18 when finding out he was no longer under his fathers yolk, learning to read and write by reading a bible lent to him by a friend, going on to practise law, moving into politics and eventually going on via many political setbacks to defeat the almost invincible William Seward, (who actually had the victory guns at his house ready to boom as his nomination was announced) and Edwin Stanton and then- if that was not enough!!- to become the greatest President of all time through a savage civil war that united the country. In my humble opinion, it would, at great length admittedly- have knocked Gone With The Wind out of the park. Someone, somewhere, as we say in England, ""lost their bottle"" and shaved it down to the 13th amendment fight. What a wasted opportunity from a country keen to take risks in movies. This film is finely acted and yet again DDL shows he can turn up and put in a performance worthy of an Oscar, just as people are starting to forget who he is! and only The United States could be so comfortably at ease by putting a Brit in the role of one of their greatest citizens, could we here in Britain be so comfortable with someone American playing Churchill? The debate in the House of Reps might be a bit drawn out and long for some even for me, who could happily drown in American History. I could understand how some could get bored by it! Sally Field playing his increasingly troubled wife is fine but a bit over-dramatic at times but the dialogue between the two over their dead son and Lincoln's opening up of his pain, and his wife's obvious descent into depression over it is a terribly beautiful scene. The ending seems rushed. Not a word about what happened to Seward who became his loyal and doting Sec. Of state at the same time or the aborted attempt on the life of the VP Johnson. I personally have issue with Stanton's remarks of ""now he belongs to the ages"" as I believe this is pure Hollywood spin and what he really said was Now he belongs to the ANGELS"" but this is something that has divided debate for over 150 years! This is a beautiful film pure and simple about a kind man who altered World history. If you into action avoid it, if you appreciate history and love the magic of a brilliantly acted film, see it."
"C22Man","3","0","2","1 March 2016"," Exceedingly Unengaging
","As far as films go Lincoln had a lot of potential. Spielberg has shown that he can aptly handle dialogue-heavy, historical films in the past and Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent in pretty much every role he's ever done. The teaming of these two for a film about one of the most influential Presidents in American history should have been a gripping experience. Yet it ends up being a major let-down, brushing aside any of Lincoln's rise to power or his first term and solely concentrating on the passing of the 13th Amendment which even the film struggles to understand the reasoning for. As a result of that why not call the film '13th Amendment' or something along those lines, inside of leading people to believe it is about the man himself.<br/><br/>I'm fine with dialogue-heavy films, but here the dialogue is handled and delivered in an incredibly dull fashion. There is no tension or emotion to anything anyone says throughout, which results in the speeches being flat and the lines coming off as if they were rehearsed to death instead of sounding naturalistic. All Lincoln does is tell analogies or stories that sound nice but have little to do with driving the film forward.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis is brilliant as always in what is a reserved but authoritative portrayal of Lincoln and he looks the part, though again he's let-down by the shoddy script. The problem with the cast is that there are simply too many speaking parts and most people get lost in the shuffle. Great actors like Sally Field, James Spader, Jared Harris and Bruce McGill get nothing of note to do or character of any substance. Only Tommy Lee Jones stands out as the no nonsense Thaddeus Stevens, but even then he's just doing what he always does.<br/><br/>Visually the film is tough to fault. The lighting is very natural and the costumes look fantastic, helping to create a real sense of another time. The make-up is again very strong especially on Day- Lewis. I would have liked more shots of the area and towns to create more of an atmosphere, because just watching people talking in rooms for long periods does get boring. Spielberg's direction is nothing special either, he keeps everything very basic and concentrates on the actors instead of any stylish shots. <br/><br/>The lack of any engaging quality is the films biggest downfall. Most people will know what takes place on the night of April 15th and in order to keep the audience invested despite that the film really had to try its hardest to give the characters strong emotions or make the dialogue interesting which it fails to do. By the time we reach the end of the film you don't really care what happens to anyone once the Amendment has been passed and the film just sort of ends on a flat note.<br/><br/>So for me Lincoln is yet another example of failed potential. A real gripping and thought-provoking piece could have been crafted here, and we know that the likes of Spielberg could make that possible. There's nothing wrong with Day-Lewis' Oscar winning performance and you can't fault the films visual authenticity. Yet it is massively let-down by its ponderous, uncertain script and a distinct lack of urgency or drive to the narrative. This isn't the type of film that can almost grind to a halt at times, which it proves is its biggest issue. It's better to think of what could have been than be bored by this underwhelming effort."

","In the movie Lincoln (2012) I believe it did not accurately portray the steps that led up to freeing the slaves. The movie provided great evidence from Lincoln's stands that he took with his Emancipation Proclamation, but words on paper itself did not solely free the slaves. The African Americans had to take action also...for example Frederick Douglass started an anti-slavery newspaper, called The North Star. Douglass made people aware of slavery, he did everything in his power to try and end slavery. Other African Americans saw the Civil War as a potential war for abolition way before Lincoln did. The slaves escaped and went into the military. Lincoln did certainly help with the process of freeing the slaves, but he went off of the ideas of other African American abolitionists. The movie should of showed views from both points...Lincoln's and African American's instead of only showing Lincoln's stands that were taken, because with out the initiative of the slaves/African Ameicans themselves they may not have been freed at that time."

","The film Lincoln, in my opinion accurately portrays the end of slavery. There were multiple things that happened in history in the movie in order to show the end, for example, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation that he set in order to help the slaves become free. It also showed the struggles that came with the decision of ending slavery as all the men had to vote on whether they wanted the amendment or not. It showed how Lincoln kept his mind on setting them free while attempting to become lenient with some men who did not want it to happen although he knew ultimately what he should have done (free them). Although the slaves themselves also did a lot in order to be free like attempting to escape and go into the military but the movie Lincoln really shows how Lincoln tried and succeeded at freeing them."

","In the movie Lincoln, they did not accurately display who freed the slaves. Abraham Lincoln may of helped, but the slaves helped too free themselves too. The slaves saw the civil war as a potential war for abolition well before Lincoln. Don't get me wrong Lincoln helped by signing the proclamation, but the slaves did the most too ensure their freedom. They escaped their masters to union army camps in the south, this was dangerous which just proves how much they were willing too do for freedom.The movie Lincoln talked more about his family and life than about the slaves also. In conclusion, Lincoln freed not a single slave who wasn't entitled to freedom under legislature."

But by pronouncing slavery a moral evil that must come to an end and then winning the presidency in 1860's"". If president Lincoln was not against slavery then the slave states would have grown into larger slavery. Also, slavery would have spread throughout the north and new states. By refusing compromise of the expansion of slavery , Lincoln helped ensure the freeing of slaves. I feel like the movie did not portray the struggling life of a slave and the life of a slave who is fighting for their freedom.

","In my opinion, the movie ""Lincoln"" accurately portrays the end of slavery. There are, of course, some things in the movie that aren't true to history, but for the most part I would say it sums up the actual events that took place. ""The dramatic core of this remarkable four months of trying to pass the 13th amendment (which banned slavery) is true. Is every word true? No...but this is not a documentary"" (We Ask A Historian).<br/><br/>One fact about the movie that is true to history is that Lincoln did actually often have a recurring dream before a major event. Lincoln often spoke of a mysterious dream about a ship, just like in the movie. However, Lincoln usually interpreted the dream as being not about the 13th amendment, but instead as being an omen of military victory (Lincoln Historical Accuracy). Either way, the dream excellently portrays what happened. Lincoln started war to save the Union, but freeing the slaves became a big purpose for him when he realized he could no longer move forward without a true understanding of liberty and union (We Ask A Historian). Therefore, freeing the slaves was a big motive of his, just like in the movie. The over-the-top drama from the House debates in the film also portrayed the debates in real life. Now in time, you don't really hear anything in the House anymore, but back then there was a much more active Congress."

The first scene you see is of two black soldiers talking to president Lincoln, talking as equals about what would happen if they won the war. It is very moving at the end of this scene when one of the black soldiers walk away reciting the Gettysburg Address. <br/><br/>Before watching this movie I had set in my mind that this movie would portray how Lincoln ended slavery, not the family issues he had to deal with. In this movie you watch a few different scenes where Lincoln is arguing with his wife and his eldest son.

That scene in the movie never truly happened in real life, Lincoln was never confronted by a slave and given a speech of such manner. The text presented on schoology show how much the slaves fought in war to help free themselves, in the movie it was barely even apparent that many slaves fought and how much of a difference they made in gaining their rights to be equal and free like the white men.

"jrhart-07508","6","0","2","30 November 2015"," Lincoln did free the slaves.
","The movie Lincoln accurately portrays the end of slavery. Lincoln did and wouldn't give up on passing the 13th amendment. In doing this he teared apart his family, mostly his relationship with his wife. Abraham Lincoln's negative view on slavery is one of the central issues in history. Lincoln often expressed opposition to slavery in public and private. This is shown in the movie as he is alone with his wife expressing the negativity of slavery and him out and about making speeches about slavery. Initially, he wanted to bring about the extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into U.S. territory, and by proposing compensated emancipation in his early presidency. Lincoln stood by the Republican Party in 1860, which stated that slavery should not be allowed to expand into any more territories. In the 1850s, Lincoln did not consider himself an abolitionist, but was attacked as one in his presidency. He did not call for the immediate end of slavery everywhere in the U.S. until the proposed 13th Amendment which became part of his 1864 election. During the American Civil War, Lincoln used the war powers as a president to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which stated that all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free. At first the Proclamation could only be enforced to free those slaves who were already on the Union side. However, millions more were freed as more areas of the South came under Union control. Lincoln pursued various plans to colonize free blacks outside the United States. Lincoln the movie is very accurate to what happened. Lincoln's people did employ the equivalent of today's political lobbyists to try and persuade reluctant Democrats to support the amendment to ban slavery. In doing this they gathered enough votes to pass the 13th amendment which abolished slavery. so therefore Lincoln did end slavery and that was all shown in the movie, so Lincoln the movie accurately portrays the end of slavery."

","The movie Lincoln accurately represents the history of the end of slavery. One example of this is in the movie, Lincoln and his followers tried getting as many votes as they could in order to pass the 13th amendment. Opposing viewpoints could say that the slaves freed themselves because they gave Lincoln no other options than to free them. But other historians think otherwise, Barry Bradford says ""in general terms, that Lincoln is quite accurate"". One reason that is accurate is because the director researched the steps in history Lincoln used to free the slaves in order to make the movie just the same as history.

"sydclouddancer","7","0","2","29 November 2015"," Did this movie accurately or inaccurately portray the end of slavery
","After watching the movie Lincoln, I firmly believe that the movie inaccurately portrays of ending slavery. Many people believe there is only ONE side of ending slavery; the Emancipation Proclamation or the blacks themselves. Why does it have to be one or the other? This movie shows one side, and that side is the Emancipation Proclamation (13th amendment). Its shows the struggles of getting the votes to get it passed and the struggles along with it; like Lincoln's wife unstable mental state and family problems. The problems are that they do not show the blacks side, but it make sense because it's called Lincoln and it's about Lincoln. A professor Eric Foner points out that ""slavery died on the ground as well as in the House..""(http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/149664). Foner explains that slavery ended on the fighting ground of the civil war and also in the House with the voters. Another reason why it was inaccurate is because it doesn't mention Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Keckley, and Mary Todd. These people were big black roles of ending slavery but were not mentioned. I wish they opened up a little more or even make a movie of the slave ending slavery and I bet there is and I will find it and will watch it.<br/><br/>One example of inaccurately from movie is the first scene, when Lincoln is sitting under a tent and is talking to the two black solider. Then two white young soldiers come over and start saying his speech and then one of the black soldiers finish as they marched away to go to call. This scene never existed in real life, but I believe they created this to show a ""bond"" between him and blacks, but it never happen.<br/><br/>Even though the movie had many inaccuracies I believe it was great movie to watch, but being a firm believer I do not believe the Emancipation Proclamation/13th amendment/ Lincoln fully ended slavery."

Don't get me wrong. I am a great fan of the long overdue 13th amendment to abolish slavery. I also like many of Spielberg's other films. But not this one. Too many people patronize Spielberg for his fame. Not the quality of his work or lack thereof. <br/><br/>This movie should have been named ""The 13th Abolition"". It certainly wasn't about Lincoln except for his efforts to get votes & some family moments intercut & at the end. I would much rather have seen the story of Lincoln's life & childhood & his political climb to the White House. And how their son had his mother committed to get her money. When she smuggled out a letter to the press, her son was found out & she was released. The public was incensed. This would be the story of Lincoln & family. <br/><br/>Not this 13th Amendment drumbeat which hops from random scene to scene without sensible direction or continuity. The beginning is so bad that few people are still watching after 20 minutes (or less). <br/><br/>Spielberg or not; this was a badly written, poorly directed inappropriately titled hodgepodge, migraine provoking excuse for a film; wasting a stellar cast. This should have been organized, directed & written differently to tell the 13th Amendment story. Lincoln's story should have been about Lincoln like Truman's film. The audience felt cheated. Lincoln & the 13th Amendment should have been 2 separate movies about 2 major events.<br/><br/>The real crime is the waste of such a cast of impressive actors. This is not a movie about Lincoln. It is a patchwork about the 13th amendment. There is no flow to the film. It is as if they filled a bucket with scene numbers & randomly pulled the scene numbers from the bucket & glued them together. There is no story. No continuity. No story about Lincoln or his presidency or his life. Although Lincoln's character appears, it is not about him. So this movie is misnamed. The scenes jump around disconnected. It is unwatchable to the point of making the viewer physically ill. <br/><br/>All they do is argue about how to get votes for the 13th Amendment. Nothing but arguing politicians & a vote gathering theme like ""Legally Blond II"". Or the political arguing of the first Constitutional convention.<br/><br/>Certainly not about Lincoln. This is an awful, unwatchable movie. I have never understood why people trash wonderful films (such as Independence Day) and praise truly rotten films like this. This is the worst screen writing & worst directing & worst editing & worst story I have ever seen.<br/><br/>If you want an excellent historical film, I recommend John Adams. Another excellent film on historical presidents was Truman. This movie was not about Lincoln as it should have been. They should have hired the crew of Truman to rewrite & redo a movie about Lincoln from scratch. Or given it to HB0 to redo.<br/><br/>The producers of this bad film must be hiring relatives of people associated with this film to stack the votes & stuff the comment boxes to create a false impression of this movie.<br/><br/>Regardless of these false votes & commentaries...

","OK, first, I am an avid student of the Civil War though by no means a historian. No, I NEVER go to a movie expecting 'historical accuracy'. The film maker has to engage the audience, and side business and composite characters are the norm. And it works, see ""Glory"" e.g. A very compelling tale told in a compelling way. Of course, I ""had to see"" this movie, for the above reason and I heard about DDL's amazing meticulous portrayal of the 16th President. And Holbrook, Jones, Sally Field... wow! Well, I got my chance to see it last night. It seemed like I was waiting for the movie to start all the way through. What was the point? Anti slavery? Cohesion/dissolution of the Union? The questionable (and highly common) political tactics of the time? What was the point? There was none. Our 16th president was not so concerned with the well being of blacks in America, everyone who's studied it all knows that. He wanted Liberia to be a place to colonize them TO, away FROM the USA. But, you know, dramatic license etc.... OK, OK, I can live with that. DDL's performance left me dead flat. Oh it was as accurate a portrayal as you could get - his incessant jokes and stories, he really annoyed the pee out of Edwin Stanton, who thought it undignified. I don't know that Lincoln used the word ""ain't"" except intentionally when he wanted to patently lapse into colloquialism. But Hollywood... you know. I expected more from Jones, and Fields, but Gordon-Levitt turned in one of the finest performances in the film. I can only say that specifically, I can't point to one complaint but instead feel that the film is flawed in so many ways. My gosh, the last time I heard this much speechifying in a movie like this was the hideous ""Gettysburg"", a 90 minute docudrama that was extended to 4+ hours of inane drivel. I feel that the most engaging and yes, entertaining take on Lincoln was Waterston. It was even better that he had done Lincoln's voice in the super epic ""The Civil War"". I give two stars for effort. The script was terrible. Some of the plot devices were cute, but thats about 6 of the 150 interminable minutes of this movie. A real let down for me overall.

","Lincoln can definitely be seen as director Steven Spielberg's pet project, starting with him telling author Doris Goodwin in 1999 he wanted the film rights to a book she was planning to write on Lincoln. 13 years later, the film is finally here. The film focuses on the many difficulties (both political and personal) Lincoln encountered while trying to pass the Thirteenth Amendment.<br/><br/>Lincoln can easily be categorized as a biopic, but I'd say it's more of a political thriller with some biographical elements. This can be seen in the decision to only focus on events surrounding the Thirteenth Amendment, thereby avoiding things like Lincoln's youth. This is not to say the personal elements are not there – quite the opposite – but that some of the character-related scenes feel out of place. The film struggles in juggling both the political and the personal and because the political overshadows the personal, scenes featuring Lincoln's son Robert feel a bit unnecessary for me.<br/><br/>What to say of Daniel Day-Lewis who is scarily good as Lincoln, as expected. One need only know he read over a hundred books on Lincoln to realize how much effort he put into this performance. Day-Lewis might represent the ultimate in method acting today, choosing to stay in character in between takes, etc. Only after his final scene did he revert to using his normal voice upon which Spielberg burst into tears.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I read a lot of criticism directed at Sally Field with some comments calling her performance 'annoying'. I can see why they'd think that, but I think the character of Mary Todd Lincoln (her personality, history, etc.) more than justifies this and that it might have more to do with a lack of empathy and patience on the audience's part, perhaps.<br/><br/>Speaking of patience, the film is challenging to watch and not because of the amount of gore. The opening battle is the only action scene, leaving nothing but talking (in all its many forms) for the rest of the film. This might scare off the 'adrenaline junkies' among us. I confess I struggled to keep up during the first half hour during which we are mercilessly thrust into long, complex conversations (see, for instance Lincoln's monologue on interpreting the law). Afterwards, however, the film wasn't so hard to follow. Despite the difficulties in watching Lincoln, it seems like a sign that things have not been simplified for the sake of 'watchability'.<br/><br/>Lincoln has received a fair amount of flack on the historical accuracy front, although it's usually about rather minor details, but overall, it is seen as a historically accurate film. And given my lack of knowledge on the subject, that's all I can really say But for me, in the end, little historical errors aren't as important as bringing the past to life in an effective (and affective) manner and Lincoln, despite the considerable effort required on the audience's part, does just that."

","The movie Lincoln demonstrates some superb acting all around. The movie portrays the few months before the end of the civil war and Lincoln's efforts to abolish slavery.<br/><br/>It's a hard film for modern folks to watch because of the speed with which stuff happens. Lincoln spends time talking to his cabinet, to people, to soldiers, to politicians, to his kids. The movie demonstrates his unique political skills, and his efforts to abolish slavery at all costs. But all that movies along a bit slowly, compared to the internet speed pace of today.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic as Lincoln. His voice, cadence, mannerisms, walk, and look really put you in Lincoln's shoes. Sally Field delivers a strong performance as his wife who really gives him back all he can take. My favorite though was James Spader, who assists in getting votes for Lincoln's initiatives. He is a hoot to watch. On the other hand, I did not enjoy Tommy Lee Jones, who seemed a bit over the top as a major liberal within the Republican party.<br/><br/>The costumes and scenery were also very realistic, adding to the mood perfectly. If not for the pace, and the somewhat inevitable Hollywood ending, I would have enjoyed this movie even more. Still, it's a strong film with superb acting and a terrific cast. Enjoy."

","I had stupidly convinced myself that Spielberg is currently underrated. I was toying with the idea of giving War Of The Worlds and Minority Report a try. Lincoln was mostly a terrible movie. I admit I didn't understand parts of the history being shown. That doesn't make my opinion valueless.<br/><br/>I have been able to like books and movies that I don't understand in full. Not understanding a movie and giving a movie one star are sometimes not related. I loved e.g Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and rated it 10 stars. After I rewatched it a few times, I understood it completely. That moved the movie's ranking to my 2nd most favored film. What would have happened if I had watched Lincoln to the end? I would have been so irked at myself for wasting my time. My review would be hateful. I'm convinced Lincoln would have floundered at one star.<br/><br/>My skills for evaluating actors and rate them are blunt and not trustworthy. I cannot find greatness in Daniel Day Lewis' performance. Like American Sniper, and Captain America, this film is imbued with American patriotism. It's a label that doesn't wash with me. I didn't go far trying to read David McCullough's John Adams. History, when combined with fiction, condenses into a different genre. After having seen Lincoln - for one hour - , I'm more amazed that so many people dare not retell what happened as it happened. Because I abandoned this movie, I cannot be very erudite on the subject at hand. But I'd be glad if some found my review helpful."

He certainly did his research including getting the Lincoln voice just right (Those who insist that Abe should be portrayed as a booming bass-baritone ought to do their own research!) and completely inhabited the part. Sally Field, who has been criticized for being too histrionic in all her portrayals is here playing a histrionic part and could hardly have done it differently. And she too didn't just fly-in her part. (ow!)<br/><br/>I really, really liked her! (Sorry, couldn't resist!)<br/><br/>The other parts were all carefully cast.<br/><br/>Tony Kushner's script about the original ""Angel in America"" was properly inspirational and John Williams'score evoked every musical Americana cliché he could get his hands on especially Copland's ""A Lincoln Portrait"".<br/><br/>But Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Kushner's often falsified the facts at times in order to build the suspense for the 13th Amendment voting scene. If I remember, one state voted yea in fact (Massachusetts?) but, in this film, they voted nay.<br/><br/>The final scene was rather perfunctory, even if necessary, but I won't say what it was in order to avoid giving the ending away.;-)<br/><br/>But, for me, the main interest of the film was the light it shed on present-day politics with a direct parallel between the machinations Lincoln had to go through to get the Amendment passed and the current administration has to go through to get anything done at all.

"hall895","6","0","1","29 April 2014"," Lincoln movie needs more Lincoln
","Lincoln is a movie with a rather disappointing flaw: it's not actually about Lincoln. This movie, which purports to tell the story of this iconic man, is not about the man at all. It is a movie about the process of getting an amendment through Congress. Two and a half hours of that unsurprisingly leads to quite a bit of boredom. Abraham Lincoln led such a fascinating life. None of that fascinating stuff makes it into the movie. Instead Steven Spielberg focuses solely on the last four months of Lincoln's life, focuses on just one of the many accomplishments of this great President. Yes, the passage of the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery is hugely important. But the story of the amendment's passage is not nearly enough to sustain a movie of this length. There has to be more to the story. A movie about the life of Abraham Lincoln would never be boring, would never fail to captivate. Unfortunately this is not that movie.<br/><br/>The best thing the movie has going for it is undoubtedly the stellar performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Such a shame then that so much of the movie is spent away from the President, following others working on his behalf to get the amendment passed. This Lincoln movie desperately needs more Lincoln. It quickly becomes a movie more about political machinations than any sort of biography. And Congressional procedure does not make for a particularly interesting movie. Other actors, most notably Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, do their best. The movie is very well-acted, everyone in the enormous cast does a fine job. But you don't go into a movie titled Lincoln hoping to see some nice supporting performances. You go into it to see Lincoln. And the wonderful performance of Day-Lewis is largely wasted as there just isn't enough for him to do. The narrow focus of the film robs us of the opportunity to really see the story of this great man. Day-Lewis could have done so much with this role if given the chance to truly cover the breadth of Lincoln's life. A tremendous opportunity missed. In the end Spielberg has produced not a bad movie but surely a very frustrating one. You go into this movie hoping to really get to know Abraham Lincoln. You don't get to know him at all. Instead you learn more than you could ever want to know about how Congress works. There's a reason nobody makes movies about the House of Representatives."

Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible as Lincoln, and all of the supporting cast is truly great as well.

There are some good choices in the writing, but I found myself caring less every second, even if it's Spielberg, which is probably the most disappointing thing about this movie.<br/><br/>When you think about Spielberg, you think about cinematic triumphs like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws or Jurassic Park. Forget those exciting films, but films like Catch Me If You Can or Minority Report, films with a good GRIP.

"Pedro_H","5","0","2","24 February 2014"," Worthy, but ultimately dull and draggy, portrait of a great American icon.
","President Lincoln has two things in his mind and on his plate. Bringing to an end the costly and bloody civil war and find a way to pass the 13th Amendment: In broad effect, to end all slavery on American soil.<br/><br/>It seems churlish to summate any great (in the sense of important or historically relevant) statesman in a paragraph. Like trying to summate the impact of The Beatles in such a couple of lines. A film has to do something similar in under two and a bit hours. A bit more room for doubt and complexity and ambiguity, but essentially not much.<br/><br/>Besides, very few films can survive or be a success where the central character isn't a hero. Or at least a flawed hero. This is a film of selected facts and even some bizarre fictions.<br/><br/>(Why are the details of the final deciding vote wrong?) <br/><br/>Here we have a very modern Lincoln who sees blacks as equals and is moved to tears by the sight of men in chains. Or at least he says he was. Strange that he later wanted to export freed slaves to other lands where their conditions would be similar. Maybe it was the actual seeing it that he objected to? <br/><br/>A film is allowed to have an opinion that isn't mine. To take as fact what may be only interpretation or biography. That is fair enough, but to carry a morality film the central character has to be seen as - at heart - fair minded. A man who would be the right thing, even at personal cost. Reading his own words doesn't lend me to think that. Indeed he seemed to believe that the future America would become be formed as part of an apartheid system. Mixed marriages to be outlawed.<br/><br/>(And maybe they would have been if Lincoln had lived long enough!)<br/><br/>Politicians have stayed the basically the same since the dawn of time. Two faced, corrupt, self-serving and deceitful. They understand only two thing: Themselves and money. Using this information most things are possible now and then. There isn't any subtlety in this story, the politicians were simply bribed for their votes. So much for democracy or even an interesting storyline.<br/><br/>The best thing here is Daniel Day-Lewis. Indeed he saves the film from being unwatchable. What fantastic acting it must be to keep a straight face while a grunting front-line soldier recites the Gettysburg Address from memory! Doesn't matter how many years you work on a script (Tony Kushner), doesn't mean you won't come up with cripplingly bad scenes like this! <br/><br/>After a modestly interesting opening - including some basic battle scenes - we are in the smokey and half-lit rooms where corrupt politicians and lobbyists do their dirty work. To be frank I was soon bored with it all. But it just goes on-and-on in the gloom.<br/><br/>In a crass finish the final vote is played like a big game with close-ups of faces and the gnashing of teeth. All we need is an excitable commentator on the PA. We (those who don't generally live in caves) know what is going to happen so there isn't even any intrigue or tension.<br/><br/>Spielberg has made some great movies and some great flops, but I'd rather sit through one his flops (1941?) again then sit through this all over again."

It was a little slow in places and I was confused as to why some characters were introduced when they provided little substance to the story.<br/><br/>And yes I must agree that as other reviews have mentioned this is not a movie about Lincoln. Although I do wonder if maybe people have put too much pressure on his legacy as a great leader. Maybe he was just a man who did one exceptional thing in history and was dull in every other aspect of his life. Isn't that all we can expect from a great leader, that they affect change and implement one great thing. The way the system works we are lucky if they accomplish anything during their time in power.<br/><br/>All in all I did enjoy this movie and maybe I might watch it one more time to pick up anything I missed.

"axel-koch","8","0","2","17 February 2014"," It's an outstanding portrayal of Abraham Lincoln, but wouldn't have deserved the Best Picture Oscar
","Having Steven Spielberg, the mastermind behind many of the films with the highest budget and the biggest scale in the last 40 years, direct an entirely dialogue-centred portrayal of Abraham Lincoln doesn't seem like your first choice. However, it proved to be an excellent one, as Spielberg's vogue attracted some of the most talented people currently in the business to his project, both in the acting and general filmmaking cast, and thereby obtained twelve much deserved Academy Award nominations.<br/><br/>Two of this dozen actually resulted in wins of the golden statuette – one for the meticulously crafted production design and one for the unforgettable performance by the great Daniel Day-Lewis, losing his British accent and displaying what is the most mesmerising on-screen portrayal of a President of the United States I've ever seen. The all- star supporting cast is similarly outstanding, most of all Tommy Lee Jones's radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens, a wonderfully articulate character with a feel-good revelation near the film's ending. This articulacy comes from a script giving tremendous focus on an authentic recreation of the diction people, especially the politicians, had in this period and being the basis for all the sparkling, sophisticated, and incredibly fast-paced conversations in Lincoln that are quite a lot of fun to watch. On the downside, this nonstop gabble becomes extraordinarily exhausting over the film's two and a half hour running time and is likely to be, to some extent at least, the reason for me to not have been able to watch it in one go both times I've tried it.<br/><br/>I don't see that as a much of a flaw though, since many a good motion picture surpassing a length of 120 minutes is too long to watch without a break for me and Lincoln highly impressed me with an array of other features, such as its magnificent visual look or John Williams's beautiful score. The few real nuisances to be found in this epic would be the over the top attempt at depicting the 16th President of the United States as the charismatic old storyteller everyone pictures him as and the unnecessary tension created and the awful amount of time spent on the vote in the House of Representatives as every halfway educated person should be aware of its outcome.<br/><br/>Even so, Lincoln is an excellent biographical film, informative due to the information it brings up about the real-life figures working as supporting characters in the film and entertaining with an immensely talented acting ensemble and an enthralling way of storytelling, even though we're all familiar to the story."

","I'll say from the off that I have a fair knowledge of Lincoln, having read much on him and seen numerous respectable documentaries on the great man. One thing you learn fast from all that is that the truth is a lot more complicated and not as rosy tinted as the legend has it made out to be.<br/><br/>So it's thankful that Spielberg chose to avoid the hagiography and concentrated on a pivotal moment in his political career, the repeal of the thirteenth amendment which would emancipate the slaves in his country.<br/><br/>The whole strength of this film lies in its story, but sadly as a film it kind of drops a level. It can get quite dull and confusing, which is a shame as it is trying to say many good things. It is a very long film, and the attention to detail is wonderful but it does drag.<br/><br/>Notably, there were few black characters in this film (mostly minor supporting). This was possibly on purpose as it was a establishment battle and the establishment was wholly white. Nevertheless, would have been greater if we had seen more of a black person's perspective here, and in that sense it kind of dropped the film.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully shot and avoids any unnecessary action sequences just to prop up the film. It's easily Spielberg's finest for many a year.<br/><br/>Must add about the cast of actors. This film has probably the best cast list for a film in many a year, and possibly one of the best ensembles I've seen in any movies. Daniel Day Lewis is great as Lincoln, and nobody fails in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>I liked the film, but just didn't love it. A good effort.

"rmax304823","7","0","2","14 November 2013"," He Belongs To The Ages.
","It's a more demanding film than you might think. Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States, ruled for a bit more than four years during a period of turmoil unparalleled in American history. And he pulled is through it all until he was cut down by an assassin.<br/><br/>I'm not at all sure he'd be allowed to do it today. I kept thinking, while watching this rather long, dark, complicated movie about Lincoln's struggle to pass the law that would free all the slaves everywhere -- not the weak Emancipation Proclamation but the Constitutional Amendment -- that he may well never have been elected to national office of any kind.<br/><br/>In Mike Nichols' ""Primary Colors"" John Travolta is running for president and when he falls behind in the polls he dithers over whether his campaign should ""go negative"". That was 1998. Today the question would never be raised because everything is negative and the ""opposition research"" is phenomenally effective -- hated by everyone and it works like a charm.<br/><br/>The specialists of today would have made mincemeat of Lincoln's candidacy. They would begin with the big ears, the hint of villainy in his features, his warts. In his youth he experienced what today we would call a major affective disorder, which would unquestionably be called ""bipolar."" His minimal political experience would be a major stumbling block -- a few years in the state legislature. Everything he ever wrote would be examined for a misplaced comma. He was tall, gangly, had the appearance of a hick, and was unphotogenic. The tale of his sneaking into Washington disguised as a woman would be accepted as fact by many. He'd have a mountain of trouble being elected today.<br/><br/>Yet he was arguably the best president the United States has ever had. Aided by his secretary, he wrote his own speeches and they were marvels of lucidity. The Gettysburgh Address, which isn't his most compelling, has been compared to Pericles' funeral oration. He successfully managed to walk a political tightrope with abolitionists jeering from one side and an outraged audience of Democrats throwing objects at him from the other. It's hard to imagine how he could have done it without going nuts all over again.<br/><br/>Spielberg's movie captures the familiar figure of Lincoln -- the awkwardness, the tall folk stories, the absence of bombast. (At Gettyburgh, the man who preceded Lincoln spoke for more than two hours; Lincoln's address was less than 250 words long.) Daniel Day-Lewis could hardly be better. The torment is there but Day-Lewis keeps a lid on it. Everyone else is professional, though the movie belongs to Lincoln.<br/><br/>It was a curious decision to focus the story on the struggle to pass the fourteenth amendment. It's not usually thought of as an illustrious moment, only as a footnote to the winning of the Civil War. But the writers dig into the issue and it's a little like turning over a rock and seeing slimy little white things wriggling for cover. Votes in favor of passage were happily bought by Lincoln's administration. If there's a lame duck Democrat you can buy his vote by promising him that he will be appointed postmaster somewhere. It's all taken for granted.<br/><br/>Nothing here about Lincoln's more celebrated and arguable actions. He used a flimsy excuse to throw the politicians of Baltimore into jail without habeus corpus. He was under Confederate fire on the outskirts of the capitol. Nothing about his delegatory sins. The astonishing disappointment of some of his appointments -- MacClellan (twice), Burnside, and the rest -- don't come up. His first cabinet, he filled idealistically with his political rivals, with the expected results -- chaos.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie is in some ways confusing and dull. Not the fault of either the performers or the director but the script is a mish-mash of personalities and conflict that are hard to keep straight. And almost all of it seems to take place in sepulchral interiors. Lincoln was as good as they come but the movie isn't. <br/><br/>In the end, concentrating on the fourteenth amendment may have been a wise choice. It encompassed most of the awesome and terrifying dynamics that surrounded Lincoln during his entire period in office. And I'd like to shake Spielberg's hand for sparing us from still another trite staging of the assassination at Ford's theater.<br/><br/>It's in some ways a challenging movie. The kids will wonder what all the fuss was about. They may even say, ""So THAT'S who Lincoln was."" But overall it's quite a spectacle and maybe an object history lesson."

","It didn't seem like I could go wrong with this movie, and I didn't, not exactly. It's a good movie for me. I don't mind a deliberate pace for this sort of thing. I have a strong interest in politics, and I don't at all mind watching power players do their thing; frankly, I thought the backalley deals and the House speeches were very good and quite entertaining, certainly a subjective taste but doubtlessly well done from a cinematic perspective. And after you get past some of Spielberg's sentimentality, you can enjoy that the movie is well produced, with a fairly honest perspective on people's perspectives from the time. This is not a populist movie. It is the story of a man in a leadership position making a moral call, even against the institutional controls which are supposed to limit his power; I can appreciate that, as I am not a legal fundamentalist. <br/><br/>But this is Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis. I expected something far greater than a good movie. And there are some missteps. <br/><br/>Some stylistic elements of filming, particularly towards the end, were simply bad. The kid in the theater reacting to the news was a poor way to show the impact, and later, after Lincoln has been pronounced dead, his image in the candle flame was the kind of film school amateurishness that seemed deeply out of place. And the ending, showing Lincoln speaking his famous reconciliation speech (after he was already dead, in flashback) came off surprisingly flat.<br/><br/>And the personification of Lincoln through his homespun manner with people seemed either contrite or outright fake. I have never said anything bad about Daniel Day-Lewis as an actor, and this is rather difficult now, because technically, he did everything right. The voice and mannerisms are historically accurate and for playing someone who we have no video footage of, his improvisations were sensible and well thought out. But the illusion was not complete. I saw him under the character. Everything seemed scripted and it was more of a performance than it should have been, too unnatural, too stage-y. The only thing worse was the way that people often reacted to him in the film, which is also, at times, extremely stage-y and reflective of a reverence that, even given his popularity and office, seems far too distantly awed to be genuine. <br/><br/>Beyond this, the story and script were okay, as was the cinematography, but just okay given the quality they were working with. There was certainly a choice going on to not show too much of life at the time and the differences that mark out a period film. Why? Because Spielberg tried to make it feel like something much more contemporary than it was. He wanted to show that these kinds of dealings are gritty but necessary government work, and in the process, maybe impart a bit more tolerance to our own discussions of policy today. These kinds of machinations could be going on with health care or immigration now, and that was in the mind of writer or director somewhere. I don't really think it worked that well and I would have preferred a more period feel.<br/><br/>Sally Field and David Strathairn are very good, Tommy Lee Jones is enjoyable and very Tommy Lee Jones-ish, while other actors like Joseph Gordon Levitt aren't given much to work with. In all, it's a good film. Not great, though. I can't get past the feeling that there was a lost opportunity to make something truly excellent."

This is definitely not his best effort--by a long shot. Throughout most of the film I found myself muttering out loud (à la Lincoln himself!) that I felt as though I was watching public television. <br/><br/>I worry that the film overly glorified Lincoln and may have painted his intentions as more noble than they were.

I have to say also that Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were great too.<br/><br/>I don't know much about Lincoln but the little I know is pretty accurate in this film. It is also beautiful film and it has very good settings. Problem is the script and frankly it is little bit boring. It is also too long. I think it would be better if it would be 30minutes shorter. So in conclusion, a decent film, worthy of watching but not at all the best work of Spielberg and you have to be interested in history."

","Daniel Day-Lewis was not the right man for this job. Lincoln was a president and a leader. That role does not call for a wimpy, pleading goofball, seemingly in his 70s, scrabbling around on his knees, relating ineffective and evidently tangential tales. The ""astute politician"" alleged by e.g., Wikipedia often seems rather to be a thin-voiced weakling and a shaky, emotional beggar devoid of gravitas.<br/><br/>But maybe casting wasn't the entire issue -- as in, for example, the haunting music behind scenes in which ""Lincoln"" fails to say anything firmly convincing: when does that get tiresome? Or how about the scene in which Lincoln is a bystander while his wife holds forth: is that a plausible representation of a formal reception at the Lincoln White House? Is this movie really about Lincoln, or is it rather a 2012 yuppie revisitation of a nice dad who somehow made it to the big time? It's a rhetorical question, as Tommy Lee Jones (nicely cast) might put it: this is, after all, a Dreamworks film."

I was so bored that I got onto IMDb to see how long it was, saw that it was 2.5 hours, and stopped the movie before finishing it. It was so boring that I felt compelled to create an IMDb account just to review this movie much lower than the 7.6 it currently has. It was SO BORING.

","Unfortunately this movie is far from the book in which it was based. The proper name for the movie should have been ""The Passing of the 13th Amendment"" a great piece of history, however to name it Lincoln is a stretch because if you have read the book you will be very disappointed. Ms. Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote a grand piece of literature on the bravest and most intelligent President this country may have ever had or at least in the top 3. My greatest wish would have been for it to have been more like the book but alas it was not. The best part of the book was left out, his Team of Rivals (The Cabinet). These characters were so alive you felt like you were there. Lincolns political savvy was unsurpassed by any previous President and it certainly showed during the Republican Convention in Chicago in May of 1860 and in his handling the men in his cabinet.

Very little was about Lincoln and it focused mainly on the passage of the 13th Amendment. It would be similar to titling a movie MLK and then focusing the Congressional debate behind the passage of the Civil Rights Act. It just seems that the marketers thought that a movie about the passage of the 13th Amendment wouldn't get good ticket sales, so they decided to name it ""Lincoln"". Well, if you name it Lincoln try to spend a little more time on the complexities of the man and not how dysfunctional the House or Representatives has always been.<br/><br/>Also, it was peppered with politically corrected history, which seemed to be forced into the movie (the black soldier being allowed to complain to Lincoln seemed out of step with 1865 America; large parades and cheering by white citizens when the Amendment passed; Thaddeus Stephens black mistress/wife). I just have a hard time believing that 1865 America was that cheerful about black's rights (even in the north). <br/><br/>The worst part is that many of these faults could be forgiven if it wasn't such a tedious chore to watch."

","LINCOLN is one of those films that defies anyone to say anything negative about it. It seems that Steven Spielberg joining hands with the national hero Abraham Lincoln and the racial equality issue is a sacred marriage and to offer dissident views of the film as a film approaches sacrilege.<br/><br/>The film is basically the last four months of Abraham Lincoln's life and the manner in which he struggled to end the war and pass the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery only to be assassinated at Ford's theater For this viewer the strongest aspect of the film is Tony Kushner's magnificent script, a script that places words befitting the times in the mouths of the men and women surrounding the final days of the war and the contentious governmental debate about slavery. It is pungent, poetic, inspiring, both raw and refined, and captures an era and a time in this country's history that will be difficult to match.<br/><br/>Yes, the cast is strong - massively collected from among some of the finest actors in film today. Everyone has crowned the head of Daniel Day-Lewis for his portrayal of Lincoln and Sally Fields as his borderline adjusted wife Mary and Tommy Lee Jones as the acerbic and convincingly committed Thaddeus Stevens, but the others in the cast deserve listing: David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Robert Latham, Bruce McGill, Tim Blake Nelson, Lee Pace, Boris McGiver, David Costabile, Stephen Spinella, Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, Lukas Haas and on and on.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are as atrocious as war is atrocious and the lighting and camera work throughout the film capture that dark period in our history magnificently. Doubtless the film will always be regarded as perfect, but for some it is overly long, occasionally pretentious, at times trying - but always rescued by Tony Kushner's fine screenplay adaptation of Doris Kearns Goodwin's novel 'Team of Rivals'. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"bob-rutzel-1","10","0","4","29 March 2013"," One of the best historical stories on film ever
","Hey, if you are looking for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer, that is another movie (not bad btw).<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) needs to pass the 13th Amendment (abolishes slavery) to the U.S. Constitution because he feels his Emancipation Proclamation will not have the power of law when the Civil War is over. <br/><br/>If things didn't happen this way, well, they should have. This is probably one of the best historical stories on film ever. I almost got the impression that Lincoln came back and inserted himself into Daniel Day-Lewis or if that is too unbelievable: maybe when the DVD is inserted we actually go back in time and see how things unfolded. Or what about this: Daniel Day-Lewis channeled Lincoln and there you are. Take your pick. <br/><br/>However it happened, I really believed I was watching the real Lincoln, and I was riveted. Slow, draggy? Not for me and it shouldn't be that for you. And, as Lincoln was a master story-teller you will especially like the one about Ethan Allen visiting England, and he needs to use the Water Closet (bathroom) and sees a picture of George Washington hanging within. You will LOL at his reply when the British asked him if that was an appropriate place to hang the George Washington picture. <br/><br/>We have heard a lot about the Emancipation Proclamation but almost nothing about how the 13th Amendment came to be. This movie takes care of that for all time. <br/><br/>I put Daniel Day-Lewis on a par with Woody Harrelson because both always give Oscar winning performances and should be given the Oscar even before the movie is shot. That's how good each is. I guess you can tell that I am in awe of both. Daniel Day-Lewis did win the Oscar for Best Actor. Kudos. <br/><br/>All the cast members should be given some kind of award that not only serves to uplift this version of history but also allows them to say they really and actually were a part of our history. I cannot emphasize too much how real this was for me. Kudos to director Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>There is a scene where Lincoln is sitting, thinking and looking at his watch. You hear the watch ticking. This is the actual watch that Lincoln had and it was borrowed from the museum for this shot. You can actually hear the ticking as Lincoln heard it. How good is that? Spooky, eh?<br/><br/>The cinematography, dialogues were spot on. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only two F-bombs and not much soft stuff: GDIs and the S-word."
"japamo","8","0","1","27 March 2013"," Lincoln's Noble Selfishness - A Template for Modern Politicians
","Historical movies, in general and even the most effective ones, are inevitably daunting and biased affairs. No matter how objective a director thinks they are in presenting a historical figure, the period and themes they choose in depicting the figure often betray the director's subjective purposes and interests about him. We can never learn ""the truth"" about anyone, especially historical figures we cannot witness first-hand. Despite the lofty mountain of research he has inspired, this is true of Lincoln himself. Spielberg certainly realized this and focused his saga on the final, fourth year of the Civil War, on the beginning of Lincoln's second term in office, and most specifically, upon efforts to ratify the 13th amendment, which basically abolished slavery and by extension all forms of servitude. In reviewing ""Lincoln"", I will not relate all the specific characters, settings, and details; so many reviewers, Amazon and otherwise, have thoroughly seen to that (and more authoritatively than I ever could). I wish to narrow my focus on what I see as one of ""Lincoln""'s most ironic and prominent themes - the ""ideal"" of noble selfishness.<br/><br/>I believe that, at heart, we are all selfish, or if you prefer the euphemistic adjective, ""self-concerned"". Even when we do things for and help others, our primary objective is ""what do we get out of it?"". This is not to detract from charitable, magnanimous, and self-sacrificing deeds. What I am saying is that, in my opinion, no one can achieve pure altruism, e.g. complete selflessness. But, I think we can achieve the next highest ideal: noble selfishness, that benefits many others besides yourself.<br/><br/>""Lincoln"" argues that successful politicians adeptly use noble selfishness to achieve their objectives. Even in our current period where revisionist Lincoln scholars have striven to demythologize and ""humanize"" our 16th president, presenting that theme takes no small courage. Lincoln's efforts to compel a 2/3 majority of obstreperous, ""self-concerned"" Representatives (2/3 of the Senate had voted in favor) - many of them Democrats (not Lincoln's party, the Republicans, who ironically, to many, resemble today's Democrats) revealed traits that have negative connotations for many of us.<br/><br/>For example, as the movie showed, Lincoln exhaustively chatted up, or had lackeys chat up, many 13th amendment dissenters, even to the point of quid pro quo. Early in the movie, we see throngs of supplicants and job seekers waiting to see Lincoln to seek favors, patronage, and legal advice, in order to show that conciliatory, compromising, manipulating tone was part of Lincoln's character. Although historically shown to abhor slavery, arguably Lincoln had another, perhaps paramount, purpose for passing the 13th amendment - to disenfranchise the South, weaken their fighting morale, and accelerate their surrender and the Civil War's end. In the movie, some representatives claimed that a Southern delegation from the Confederacy's president Jefferson Davis wished to see Lincoln to discuss peace terms. The claim seemed dubious but did threaten some representatives' resolve to pass the amendment. In the movie, Lincoln hastily pens a letter and has it delivered to the House, stating that ""as far as I know"", no delegation was forthcoming, which some representatives denounced as a ""lawyerly dodge"". Lincoln was even willing to use a type of ""eminent domain"" to thwart the South by seizing the slaves as ""property"" from the South, then employing the Emancipation Proclamation, enacted earlier, to set them free. Lincoln even tries mathematical logic, stating that if two things are individually equal to a third, then they are equal to each other. This, which incorporated with Thaddeus Steven's assertion in the House that even if all men were not really created equal in nature, they were equal under the law, attempted to circumvent those representatives that thought that African-Americans were fundamentally inferior.<br/><br/>And so it goes. The movie shows Lincoln employing every political, legal, and logical weapon to flatter, wheedle, coax, intimidate, persuade, and entice as many representatives as possible (especially the 20 House democrats necessary to achieve the 2/3 majority) to vote for the 13th amendment. Again, some audiences may have been shocked by the seemingly base, hypocritical, self-contradictory, and unscrupulous tactics the 16th president used. Basically, it's a concession to the old adage that ""the end justifies the means"". In any case it worked, of course, the amendment is passed. Tellingly, the deciding vote, by the House speaker, stemmed from his desire to ""make history"".<br/><br/>Of course, ""Lincoln"" has its other virtues like Daniel-Day Lewis's spellbinding portrayal of the President, Tommy Lee-Jones tour-de-force as the savagely but amusingly brusque, candid, and insulting Thaddeus Stevens, and the re-creation of the oppressive, anxious Civil War zeitgeist. But above all, I think, ""Lincoln"" will have relevant, enduring value because of its assertion that compromise, however superficially distasteful and beholden to the innate selfishness of others, is really the only way to get grand political accomplishments. I hope Obama and congressional members see the movie and retain that message."

Yes, there is singing in this movie, but not my favorite Broadway kind.<br/><br/>Jefferson Davis is missing. In his place is dorky Jackie Earle Haley, whom I remember as having played a goof-ball would-be-rapist in the movie Little Children, where a major scene is of Patrick Wilson and Kate Winslet ""visiting"" each other, in the altogether, over-top equipment in a laundry room. That said, upon Wiki research I find Jackie did an excellent job in portraying the physical looks of the real Confederate vice president. Who would have played old Jeff Davis? Hmmmm, let me see, maybe -- oh yes, a good one, in the craggy anorexic male department -- might be Harry Dean Stanton -- he of Big Love fame as the scary, creepy faux-LDS patriarch.<br/><br/>Going to the end, Tommy Lee Jones, bald, in bed, with his housekeeper/lady friend, was quite interesting. This was quite an interesting denouement to the movie.<br/><br/>I DID think of Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, during the Lincoln movie, Bill of Gangs of New York. In GONY, Day-Lewis went mano-a-mano into his own fighting and even butcherings and torturings. In the end, Leonardo DiCaprio made mincemeat out of Day-Lewis (spoiler). You can see Bill when you look at Daniel as Lincoln. Ironically, GONY takes place during the Civil War Draft Riots, where tons of men did not want to go fight Lincoln's war, and they were all YANKEES.<br/><br/>Mary Todd Lincoln was not crazy. Her detractors, jealous as they were, spread these nasty rumors. Even her oldest son bought into the mayhem, locking her up in an institution. That he had Mary's maiden name as his middle name, later showed his unappreciation for Mama's loving upbringing.<br/><br/>No John Wilkes Booth, Mrs. Surratt, Dr. Mudd, Laura Keene, Julia Dent Grant and others remotely or directly associated with the assassination? Of course, that was a totally different story. All of a sudden, in this movie, President is shot, with no back-story of that particular incident. I realize that, yes, days earlier the Civil War had actually been drawn to a peace. Laura Keene ran the theatrical company playing at Ford's Theatre during the fateful evening. General and Mrs. Grant had also been invited to the show at Ford's, but did not attend. Many of the cabinet members shown in the Lincoln movie had ALSO been assassination targets, but due to multiple ineptitudes of Booth's motley crew of assassination doofuses, our dear Mr. Lincoln was the only one who lost his life.<br/><br/>The kid who played Robert Lincoln looked like Heath Ledger, although I knew that would not be possible. The boy who played Tad Lincoln was very good, and the character appeared to be very intelligent and caring.<br/><br/>Sally Field did a great job as Mary. Remember, Mary predicted Lincoln would be president. This may have been from a premonitional dream, and I think also that another premonitional dream predicted his assassination. Like other women of the day, Mary became involved in séance activity, especially after the death of her dear son Willie. Death was a way of life in those days, not just on the battlefield but during women's childbirth, children's pre-adolescent diseases, etc. Surgical washing of hands was not even practiced until after the Civil War. A woman could have 12 children, and have 5-6 live to adulthood.<br/><br/>Lots of African Americans making their entrance into the congressional chamber was very heartening. Seeing African American soldiers in the Civil War was very good.<br/><br/>I will research other Lincoln movies, including the one with Henry Fonda."
"JohnWelles","9","0","2","13 March 2013"," Daniel Day-Lewis and Steven Spielberg Combine to Make Movie Magic.
","""Lincoln"", directed by Steven Spielberg, was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Tommy Lee Jones) and Best Supporting Actress (Sally Field); it won two, Best Actor, Daniel Day-Lewis and Best Production Design, Rick Carter. A film so weighed down by awards glory has to stand tall to meet expectations. It does so magnificently. Steven Spielberg is arguably one of the most assured and consistently great directors in the modern cinematic landscape; his career stretching back to the beginning of the nineteen-seventies has produced classic after classic, from adventure in ""Raider's of the Lost Ark"" (1981) to the Holocaust drama ""Schindler's List"" (1993). His extraordinary versatility serves him well again, transforming a potentially dry historical drama of interest only to Americans into a riveting examination of democracy, of the inherent compromise and double-dealing to pass what was then a controversial and contested bill.<br/><br/>Yet Spielberg is not alone: Tony Kushner has excelled himself in writing one of the most intelligent, literate scripts in years, providing fantastic dialogue and characters for Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Strathairn and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. All these actors clearly relish the opportunity to be part of this incisive drama and give superlative performances. However, Daniel Day-Lewis gives not only the performance of the year, but one of the best of the past decade. From his historically accurate whiny, high-pitched voice to his bowed walk, wearied by years of war, grown old before his time, this isn't a matter of impersonation: Day-Lewis exhibits all the best virtues of method acting; there is no trace of him as an actor. We have a real performance and an in-depth examination of a few crucial weeks and months that changed the history of a nation.<br/><br/>It's the moral assessment by Lincoln as to what to do and crucially, how to do it, whether the ends justify the means, that helps make it universal in appeal. Spielberg looks lucidly into the events and spares nothing. No glamorisation, no white-washing: Lincoln, an all-American icon, is distraught, indecisive and watches as his wife is mentally affected at the prospect of losing a son to a dying war and the way public and private lives intertwine seamlessly.<br/><br/>Only the ending, showing the aftermath of his assassination by John Wilkes Booth (an event that avoids cliché by not showing it) seems unnecessary. It had found the perfect ending ten minutes before, as Lincoln sets off to see the play where he would meet his killer. It's a rare misstep made more jarring by the fact that the film has so few of them.<br/><br/>However, it is not enough to stop this film from being a superb union between Kushner, Spielberg and Day-Lewis who create one of the great movies of this still young decade."
"seaview1","10","0","2","10 March 2013"," LINCOLN Comes Alive
","The subject of many films over the decades, Abraham Lincoln has been portrayed to great effect by such top actors as Raymond Massey, Henry Fonda, and on TV by Hal Holbrook. Steven Spielberg has assembled a great cast headed by Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, a chronicle of the last weeks of his presidency and his final important accomplishment before he was assassinated. As a slice of history, it is a fascinating insight into the political challenges that went into the 13th Amendment. As a portrayal of a historic figure, it could not be any better.<br/><br/>In January, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln (Lewis) has been just re-elected and must contend with major issues particularly the ongoing toll of the Civil War. Amid the inequality of the 'colored' soldiers and a growing personal conviction that was marked by his landmark Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Lincoln is passionate about getting the 13th Amendment (which would unequivocally free all slaves) passed in Congress. At odds with his headstrong wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), and surrounded by a doubting cabinet and strange bedfellows, Lincoln's challenge is to secure enough votes in Congress amid powerful opposition. With the potential of a Confederate signal for an end to the war, Lincoln must weigh the political fallout of ending a costly conflict and achieving lasting freedom for all Americans.<br/><br/>Lincoln is not intended as an all encompassing biography but rather a microscope into the President's last great act of his administration, and it illustrates his sheer will and unshakable faith. It demonstrates his disarming sense of humor and philosophy, and he is depicted as an imperfect human whose relationships are depicted as often dysfunctional whether it is with his paranoid wife Mary Todd over the loss of deceased son or his rebellious older son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).<br/><br/>Unwilling to compromise on his beliefs, Lincoln realizes that his legacy will be tied to this moment forever. It is revealing how the political challenges in Congress are dealt with in bold strokes or subtle, delicate wording. His battles with Congress have direct parallels with the current political climate.<br/><br/>Lincoln had the foresight to look ahead and anticipate his legacy and how the world will look on to this moment in history including the proposed Reconstruction of the South once hostilities ceased. The behind the scenes cajoling and arm twisting make for an interesting insight into the political process. As the momentous day for the important vote arrives, each congressman places his vote in a manner not unlike the founding fathers of 1776.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis has become the Paul Muni of our generation. By being selective with his roles, he has played larger than life period figures that have transcended their respective films. He inhabits this role perfectly, and the makeup work and vocal inflections are outstanding. When the war winds down and has taken an emotional toll on Lincoln, you see the President's line worn face.<br/><br/>Sally Field is the perfect foil as Mary Todd, his opinionated wife. Tommy Lee Jones is a standout in an impressive cast of well known actors (including Holbrook as an influential citizen). His Thaddeus Stevens, whose support was instrumental in Congress, is an intimidating figure with an imposing demeanor. He gets some of the best lines. James Spader makes a fine, slimy operative for Seward, who is played with stern conviction by David Strathairn. Spielberg consistently gives a slave's point of view to put things in perspective. The war and the amendment are seen through the eyes of former slaves particularly Gloria Reuben's servant to Mrs. Lincoln.<br/><br/>The film is magnificently shot by Janusz Kaminski in a manner that emulates the iconic pictures of the period. You feel at times that you are witness to actual, historic events. We don't actually see much of the Civil War battles but rather the aftermath in the bodies and limbs that are testimonials to the horror of warfare. Indeed, such themes recur in Spielberg films depicting World War I (War Horse) and World War II (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Empire of the Sun).<br/><br/>There is a certain reverence and awe when you watch this film because the details are recreated vividly. Tony Kushner's screenplay is the blueprint that enables Spielberg to add to a body of work that contains some of the best documentations of American history (Amistad). There will be future film versions on the life of this remarkable historic figure, but it is difficult to imagine a better impersonation, period."

","Why you shouldn't see it:<br/><br/>Talking. If you aren't a fan of having dialog in your movies, then Lincoln probably isn't for you. So if you're one of the folks who voted for The Artist last year, you may not be too fond of this one. But, good thing for this movie, only two films lacking in dialog in the history of the Academy Awards have ever won best picture, and if all of the dialog was removed from this movie, it would probably just consist of opening and closing credits. And that would be a shame, because these are some old school credits without any entertainment value on their own.<br/><br/>Politics. It's not that they're spending the duration of the movie talking about anything. They spend the whole time talking in, about, and around politics. Even in what you would think would be personal family moments, there are still at least strong political undertones to the conversation. So you can imagine the scenes that are set in the political arena, where political discourse would make a good deal more sense. There are lots of men with funny hair saying lots of things to posture themselves in the debate.<br/><br/>History. In case you hadn't gathered, the plot of this film takes place in an historical setting, a little less than 150 years ago. And no, it's not an historical fiction, where they just take the setting and then add in a really crazy plot, a la Wild Wild West. It's a straight up history, 90% of which takes place within landmarks such as the White House and the Capitol Building (the one in Washington, D.C.). So if histories make you uncomfortable and/or bore you to tears, this one might not hold your interest.<br/><br/>Why you should see it:<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis. This part is probably obvious. Or maybe it isn't obvious. If I'm going to be honest with you, I'll tell you that I watched this entire movie trying to convince myself that I was, in fact, watching Daniel Day-Lewis and not Abraham Lincoln. Try as I might, I was laughably unsuccessful. I could look the man right in the beard and not tell him from the man who lived a century and a half ago. I'm not sure what to say about Day-Lewis, other than the fact that I'm glad his method acting didn't lead him to demand that they film Lincoln's assassination using a real gun. With real bullets. I want to see more movies with this man being someone completely and totally not himself.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones. He plays a supporting character (congressman Thaddeus Stevens), obviously, so his role isn't quite as prominent as Day-Lewis', but that doesn't mean he isn't essential to the film. And it's good for you that he is, because every time he shows up on camera, he steals the scene. His ornery attitude and the fact that he's a representative from Pennsylvania may make you think he's from Philadelphia, but he shockingly is not. His witty, sarcastic characterization frequently brings a much-needed lightness to the film.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg. I'm not sure there was a person I was more disappointed in last year than Steven Spielberg. The fact that he would ever even think about releasing a movie as terrible as War Horse just makes me sad in my heart. The good news is that he has acquitted himself nicely here. He takes a moment of American history, finds the story behind it, and creates a gripping, expertly told tale. Much like Affleck with Argo, Spielberg is somehow able to make the audience feel suspense over the outcome of a plot that it already knows. It's not like Congress skipped the 13th Amendment. He's also done a fantastic job of casting, from the notable (and award- recognized) efforts of Day-Lewis, Jones, and Sally Field to any of the rest of the ensemble cast. Every time you turn around, there is another face that you recognize giving their hand in telling this important tale (keep an eye out for James Spader, who is excellent).<br/><br/>History. America hasn't always gotten everything right. Actually, they've gotten a lot of things wrong, but sometimes it's good to be reminded of the things it has gotten right. The 13th Amendment is one of those things, and I'm not sure many people realize just how close this country was to not passing it for many more years. It gives you a whole new appreciation for the will of a few extraordinary men and their clarity of vision to pass such an historically significant piece of legislation in the face of tremendous bigotry.<br/><br/>In Short:<br/><br/>Spielberg takes a part of history and makes it more. What could have been a drab exercise in the telling of the passage of a bit of legislation is instead a front row seat at one of the most important moments in US history. The whole film is shown in an almost dreamlike quality and pulls the audience into a powerful script featuring an iconic performance and generally excellent ensemble cast. I really want Abraham Lincoln to tell me another story, but sadly he's dead going on 150 years now, so instead I'll give this a 9 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who can appreciate moments of historical significance.<br/><br/>Exceptions to the recommendation: anyone who would prefer to remain doomed to repeat history due to their lack of knowledge thereof; states' rights advocates who would be subject to high blood pressure from any increase in the power of the federal government; anyone who may just get confused that it's the republicans fighting on behalf of the minorities; people who were expecting to see Daniel Day-Lewis in a movie instead of Abraham Lincoln; people who are tired of the white-man-as-savior version of history; anyone who was expecting vampires or hunting thereof."

","Daniel Day Lewis is Abraham Lincoln. The amazing actor makes history as he wins his third Oscar for best actor in a leading role. Lewis gives possibly his best performance to date as he plays the aging Lincoln as he enters his second term and tries to pass the 13th amendment which would abolish slavery. This best picture nomination had a strong cast in Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and of course, Daniel Day Lewis. In my opinion this movie deserved the best picture over Argo, but this was still an excellent film, easily the best I have seen in a while. <br/><br/>I always pictured Abraham Lincoln as a tall strong man with a deep and powerful voice. Steven Spielberg teaches me a history lesson with how Lincoln was. Lewis portrays him as a gentle and kind human being with a soft and subtle voice. He is charming and smart and the way he talks gets people excited. He provides humor and charm when he talks and it is factors like these which could possibly make him the greatest president this country has ever seen. The most amazing part of this movie is Lincoln himself and how it was an uphill battle to abolish slavery. He knew in his heart that it was wrong. He believed in the idea that all men are created equal and he also knew the only way to end the Civil War and unite the country once again was to end slavery. He gave countless speeches and monologues throughout the film and every time I would stop and just listen to his voice. Not so much what he was saying but how he said it. His delivery was perfect and I felt like I wasn't watching a move but I was actually there. It is rare that a movie actually does that for anybody. <br/><br/>During that time some people considered Lincoln to be a tyrant. A tyrant is easily the wrong word but he was a larger than life character. He can be a little arrogant at times saying he is the most powerful man in the world and the leader of the United States, or something to that extent. He was a larger than life character but Sally Field keeps him in check as she plays Lincolns wife almost too well. I love Sally Field because she tries so hard in every role from Mrs. Doubtfire to Forrest Gump. She goes into a role and feels the character and nails it. She always gives it her all, but in Lincoln she gives a little more. She makes Lincoln more human. She does not want her son, Joseph Gordon Levitt, going to fight the war. This brings a small conflict that fits really well in the movie overall. Lincoln has enough on his plate and now he has to deal with his crazy family. My favorite scene is when Lincoln tells his wife that their son will be going into war but he will be safe. Mrs. Lincoln just loses it and Sally Field pours all of this emotion out and Lincoln reacts and gets angry, and even starts to yell. This scene is my favorite because it shows that Abraham Lincoln was a human being with emotions and flaws. This scene shows his flaw and that he cannot always keep himself in line and he can lose his temper. We dig into the past history as he says he should have sent his wife to the crazy house. Mrs. Lincoln just snaps back with a perfect comment saying if he wanted to he would have just done it. This scene shows some of the best acting in the entire movie with the emotion and humanity shown in the larger than life characters in American history. Steven Spielberg spent years researching Abraham Lincoln and the time when the 13th Amendment was struggling to be passed. He wanted this movie to be as accurate as possible and he delivers once again. Everything this man touches to gold. He is such a dedicated director and he deserved his nomination for best director at the Oscars, but I'm not surprised he didn't win. He makes sure his actors portray his vision in the best way possible and the years of hard work paid off. He presents another amazing movie about American history to the world and brings a fresh and new aspect to this time period. This movie needs to be seen by the American people. It surely isn't for everybody because it can be boring and drag but people need to know what this movie is about. This movie has no action scenes, no battles, all the actions is done n the acting and the words. Even the music was almost nonexistent. John Williams does the score but some scenes have very little music in them. This is rare for a movie but knowing Spielberg he wants the music to relate with the time period, as any director should, but it's hard to find out the types of music that was playing during that time period so no music works. Overall, Lincoln was the best movie I have seen in a long time. Everything works. I saw this twice in the past few days and I'm tried to find flaws but there really were none. The only thing I can think of is that it can be boring at parts but the audience needs to know what they are getting into. Any student who loves history or a movie with incredible acting and dialog will love this movie. Any scrub who wants a Michael Bay explosion-fest will be disappointed. This movie needs to be seen, it is very educational and real. Show it in schools, force kids to watch this movie because it shows the darkest part of our history. I'm reaching my 1000 word limit so Lincoln gets the WillyT Seal of approval. See you next time!"
"marcin_kukuczka","8","0","2","10 March 2013"," Refreshed Portrait of Heroic, Righteous Man of History
","""Whatever you are, be a good one"" (Abraham Lincoln)<br/><br/>""Moving and honorably high minded film"" (Peter Bradshaw, ""The Guardian""); ""about statesmanship, politics, the creation of the world's greatest democracy"" (Phillips French, ""The Observer""); ""a movie of confidence"" (Allen Guelzo) which ""brings past vividly to life"" (James Berardinelli). Goodness! Doesn't it occur suspicious that such a difficult undertaking as bringing an eminent historical figure to screen is appears to be widely praised by both film critics and historians. A historical movie which satisfies such a vast majority of 'eggheads' is, strangely, a lucky one. Yes, you do have the right to have doubts until you decide to see the movie. The leading performance makes most of them perish.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert memorably states in his November 2012 review that what, perhaps, Steven Spielberg's movie has done best is the fact it introduced Lincoln as ""a plain-spoken, practical, down-to-earth man from the farmlands of Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois."" Indeed, Spielberg's movie deals with issues galore and, as Allen Guelzo, the director of the Civil War studies at the Gettysburg College, points out, ""the pains taken in the name of historical authenticity are worth hailing,"" but it FOREMOST supplies the viewer (more or less acknowledged historically) with a truly refreshed, humane portrait of this righteous, heroic man of history. Since it is impossible to focus on a variety of the film's virtues, let me highlight the persona of Abraham Lincoln herein depicted within the context of his supreme decision of immense significance for the history of the USA and its worldwide spread ideal of freedom.<br/><br/>Inevitably, there are two concepts of the 16th president of the United States as a historic personality adapted to the screen (and, presumably, one cannot exist without the other and, essentially, one cannot occur superior to the other): seeing him politically as a nation's hero in the turmoiled times of Civil War and seeing him socially as a man, a husband, a father. These two must co-exist. While the exaggeration with the former concept will inevitably result in Utopian idealism, historical glorification and means of cold marble stone hardly applicable to modern viewers, the overestimation of the latter concept will rescue Lincoln of history and display a solely individual drama. Spielberg with his screenwriter Tony Kushner who based the script on the literary source by Doris Kearns Goodwin and echoed some notions developed by Gore Vidal in his novel LINCOLN, do not make a masterpiece. Kushner could write shorter script but he, presumably, got started and was too lazy to stop. The film's flaws, therefore, lie in its length and wordy script (which, on the other hand, Guelzo calls ""high quality talkiness""). But what they skillfully aspire to is the emotional combination of political, national, social and individual contexts. Here, one can agree with Peter Bradshaw that, in this way, the producers manage to ""dramatize the formality."" <br/><br/>While the Civil War remains in the background and the time span of the considerably lengthy film depicts a chronologically short period, the two aspects, immense in their significance, appear at the core: one supplies the film with masterful acting and the other one with masterful tensions: Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln which displays an actor who does not just ""play"" the character but ""inhabits"" him (James Berardinelli) and these few weeks in January 1865 known for the 'incendiary' (Phillip French, 'The Observer') passage of the 13th Amendment in the House of Representatives, with the sequence that Guelzo accurately calls 'courtroom drama.'<br/><br/>DANIEL DAY-LEWIS - LINCOLN SCREEN MEMORIAL: Hailed as a ""towering performance"" by many, ""unparalleled"" (Daniel Walber) ""a Shakespearian figure somewhere between Caesar and Prospero"" (Bradshaw), Day-Lewis handles the role with tremendous sophistication and quintessential abilities of an actor. Solely his portrayal of Lincoln makes the film worth seeing. Such 'lifetime roles' can never be duplicated. The actor's supreme achievement is a combination of the inner and the outer, the hints of thoughts and the means of communicating them. Therefore, Guelzo rightly observes that the actor ""captures Lincoln's canniness and his awkwardness, his external simplicity and his internal complexity."" With reference to Lincoln's quotation which I entailed at the beginning of the review, he is a man whose approach is rather based upon inspiration than imposition. He is neither a hero not a god, an idol but himself a man of contradictions. As a result, the Gettysburg Address, in one of the most powerfully incorporated scenes of the movie, something that Bradshaw calls ""Sorkinian scene"" is not spoken by Lincoln but by simple soldiers. The family relations, particularly depicting Lincoln's wife (played skillfully by Sally Field) makes Lincoln a man with his personal torments. He is a man among others, misunderstood by others in both the family and the government. A performance that deserves the name 'masterpiece.'<br/><br/>The SUPPORTING CAST deliver something deliciously unique. Who stands out as ""the moral center of the film"" (Daniel Walber) is Thaddeus Stevens played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones. He is the abolitionist of the movie, he 'dramatizes the formality' in the House of Representatives sequence where, as Guelzo points out ""unholy political means obtain holy political ends."" Ambiguously, through this 'incendiary' and significant issue, the movie clearly addresses the nature of politics and places certain controversial notions at the center of attention. Jared Harris does a marginal yet memorable job as General Ulysses Grant, David Strathain plays a tricky game as the secretary of state, Seward and Hal Holbrook, the actor who already played Lincoln in the 1980s, highlights an interesting personality of Francis Preston Blair.<br/><br/>Everything along with the finale seems to correspond to the unique personality and a timeless example. Although the opening dream sequence has set the tone for the sentiments herein developed, the finale brings us to a highly timeless and profound conclusion. Embarking towards an unknown shore, this time, to see his Jerusalem and to walk the way of righteous 'kings.' 8/10 for the entire movie, 10/10 for Day-Lewis 'towering' performance."
"vinsond21","7","0","2","10 March 2013"," A time in history well worth recalling and remembering
","Here is a time in history that's well worth recalling and remembering. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln focuses on the final months of the great president's life, when he worked with rivals and supporters in government to pass the 13th constitutional amendment -- that's the one that emancipates the slaves. It's a handsome well-mounted production, with the drab look reflective of the period. Once again, Spielberg extracts superb performances from his mostly celebrated cast. Daniel Day-Lewis portrays the beleaguered president as a dignified and at the same time, very human, figure. However, my favorite character was Tad Lincoln played by the young Gulliver McGrath; amid all the (necessary) conniving and manipulation taking place in the capital city, he comes across as so innocent and carefree... until the tragic moment at the end. See this movie as a lesson on how clever political maneuvering by the wily president enabled the successful passage of a controversial bill."

He buys votes from racist Democrats or send people to just humiliate them.

Great handicraft from Steven Spielberg."
"Al_The_Strange","7","0","2","3 March 2013"," ""If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.""
","With all the praise and accolades Stephen Spielberg's latest film received, I was compelled to watch Lincoln and see for myself how great it is.<br/><br/>The film definitely has its bright spots. History buffs might relate to the film the best; those who actually take an interest in the politics, the history, and the characters involved. The film seems to do decent justice to everything. A few scenes stand out, and the dialogue is quite sharp (although it is quite old-fashioned as well).<br/><br/>The main problem is, this film is a long and slow-moving affair, built entirely on politics and dialogue. There's maybe a minute of war scenes in the opening shot, but from then on, it's straight-up talking. The vast majority of the film takes place in the White House, or in Congress, or in some other indoors setting, with very little variation. Conflict is strictly political; people struggling to get the 13th Amendment ratified, and lots of debating ensues. If the political battle for the 13th Amendment is something that really interests you, then maybe this film will speak to you. For me, however, I found it quite dry, and I found myself nodding off and losing interest on a few occasions.<br/><br/>In spite of that, I think the actual plot of this film is thin and flat, lacking in significant conflict or structure. The best that can be said is that it's populated with quality characters, who seem to adhere to historical depiction and fact quite well. I was relieved to see that the actual political stance of the film is appropriately neutral; the film never slanders or puts a spin on Republicans or Democrats, but portrays them objectively. With the 13th Amendment as the sole subject of the film, the film digs up a lot of themes to reinforce Lincoln's ideals of equality and freedom.<br/><br/>As expected, the cinematography and editing are top-notch. Acting is effectively perfect, especially from Daniel Day Lewis, who provides an appropriately nuanced and enjoyable portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. Writing is excellent, especially in the way it provides sharp and witty dialogue, with a proper 1860s style. This production has great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is not bad either.<br/><br/>Watching this film reminded me a lot of watching JFK, but without the conspiracy theories or freakiness. Both films are basically political to the core, and I find them both rather tedious to watch. Regardless, Lincoln is a well-crafted film, and is definitely worth watching. Recommended, especially for history buffs, fans of political dramas, and fans of the cast or the director.<br/><br/>3.5/5 (Entertainment: Marginal | Story: Average | Film: Perfect)"
"dndcullens","9","0","1","2 March 2013"," Could have been better
","I like the movie and the acting was superb but it lacked drama. We all know what happened but the movie needed something more. Take for example, Ron Howard's Apollo 13 which was based also on a real event but never faltered on the drama. Lincoln needed that. Anyone who ever read the book on which this movie is based will remember that there was a lot more drama involved. Having said that, Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely mesmerizing as Lincoln no more so when he is explaining why he wants the 13th Amendment passed. BTW, in my opinion, the opening and last scenes in the movie are redundant. The battle sequence is out of place and Lincoln's death is unnecessary. The scene where is walking away should have ended the movie."

"valadas","8","0","1","26 February 2013"," Bad means for a good cause
","This movie is not a biography of Abraham Lincoln. It elapses only during the last years of his life in the course of the Civil War and the political fight to obtain the approval of the 13th amendment to the Constitution which would end up slavery. The 2/3 majority necessary to reach that approval in the House of Representatives is finally got through bribery and corruption of the marginal few members still needed to make those 2/3 and that is widely shown in the movie through a succession of scenes and sequences of confrontation between partisans and adversaries of the amendment. Bad means for a just cause of course. These scenes, dialogues, speeches, disputes and discussions are shown with great realism and force and occupy the largest part of the movie which leads some viewers to consider that part very dull. On the contrary I think they are very important to make us understand what is really going on and are also well shown and acted. Of course the real motives for the north to wage a war against the south were not so humanitarian (notwithstanding President Lincoln's humanitarian personal motives). We don't see easily that the Federals would wage such a bloody war against the Confederates with the sole purpose of getting the slaves emancipated in the south. There were economical motives behind it such as the competition between the industrial north and the agricultural south whose advantage was precisely the cheap slave labour which had then to be suppressed to enhance northern economic superiority. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln is wonderful, one of the best movie performances I have ever seen. All the other performers do their job very well and are extremely well chosen and made up. All the sceneries, dresses and attires create a real and true atmosphere of the epoch. It is undoubtedly one of the best 2012 movies."

","Let me start by saying something: I am Brazilian. I came to know Lincoln and other figures like him in the history books and films, as everybody else. I remember watching the original The Day the Earth Stood Still and see Klaatu have his first contact with the statue of the US president, with his declaration of rights, searching by a leader. The metaphor works for me quite well, 'cause like Klaatu, I'm an alien under US people's eyes.<br/><br/>But even that didn't stop me to seek inspiration by this great man who fought against injustice and the differences of his days.<br/><br/>So yes, despite I don't have a deep knowledge about US history and about US presidents, I know very well what is common knowledge to the world. As I began being fluent in English language, I could search even more things about all the subjects relating to English language countries.<br/><br/>With that said I felt inspired by this movie. And all the actors who joined forces with Spielberg, like Day-Lewis, Gordon-Levitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Jacky Earle Haley and the others did a truly amazing job portraying very important characters of US history to us living a monumental moment on their history.<br/><br/>The message of equality lived by Abraham Lincoln and his allies reaches out the boundaries of the American continent, both north, center and south, and becomes universal!<br/><br/>So yes, people from all over the world should check this out!

"pwrusselluk","9","0","1","25 February 2013"," An Excellent piece of Cinema
","Who would imagine that a film almost entirely about the political process (the passing, in 1865, of the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery in the United States) could be quite so gripping and dramatic? It is both of these things and more, though in fairness, it does take a while to get going. The success of the film is largely due to the incomparable performance of Daniel Day-Lewis in the eponymous title role, but also to the excellent cast around him (notably Tommy Lee-Jones as the radical Abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, and a wonderful performance by Sally Field as Lincoln's grief-stricken wife). And of course, there's always Steven Spielberg's superb direction! <br/><br/>It is a dramatic story, set against the backdrop of the American Civil War. There is a microcosm of the larger conflict within the Lincoln family itself. Abraham is at odds with his eldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is desperate to quit Law School and join up and do his bit, totally against his parents' wishes. Lincoln's 'favourite' is the younger son, Tad, and there is much talk of a middle sibling who has died from illness – the reason for his wife's grief and mental instability, and a source of great conflict between the parents, leading to some of the most dramatic scenes in the film. <br/><br/>The central theme though is the moral and political dilemma around slavery. In 1860s America, this is definitely not a black and white issue (pun intended). Abolitionism is one thing, but enfranchising freed slaves? Something completely different. But the imperative, for Lincoln, is to get the Amendment through Congress, and the film deals largely with the skulduggery and politicking necessary to persuade (bribe?) various Democrat Congressmen to switch sides and vote for the Amendment, not to mention those Republican Congressmen who could not bring themselves to vote in favour either. There's an excellent performance by Tommy Lee-Jones (when does he ever give a bad performance?) who perfectly embodies the thick-skinned, pragmatic, two-timing Congressman. The irony being that, despite this, he is one of the very few highly principled men in Congress and was a fervent abolitionist all his life (there is a nice twist on the day the Amendment is passed when he returns home from Congress). <br/><br/>The film is atmospherically shot through a filter with a slight sepia tinge, and with much of the political wheeling-dealing done in darkened rooms and at night, thus enhancing the clandestine nature of Washington politics. Lincoln himself, whilst being portrayed in glowing (even hagiographic) terms, was certainly not above using dirty tricks to achieve his ends. There is, in fact, much humour surrounding three agents brought in as 'fixers' to secure, usually by offers of lucrative government posts, the votes needed. On the day of the vote itself, Lincoln is not averse to downright lying (he's reminded that this is an impeachable offence, but there the similarity with Nixon definitely ends!) in order to carry the day, which, of course, he does. There is not, however, much of a Hollywood ending for as soon as the War is over and Lincoln appears to be at some kind of peace with his wife and himself, and full of plans to travel to the Holy Land he is, of course, assassinated. <br/><br/>This film pulls off a remarkable feat. On the one hand, it glorifies one of America's greatest Presidents, still widely revered by the American people (though probably less so south of the Mason-Dixon Line!), whilst at the same time, portraying him as incredibly human, strangely fragile and distinctly flawed. Lincoln appears to have been the consummate politician (the film is based partly on Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln""), but was undoubtedly a principled, fair-minded and popular (with exceptions) President. Some of the warmest scenes in the film are when Lincoln tells anecdotes (often funny) to the close coterie of men around him. It illustrates his folksy wisdom, but also his considerable intelligence and wit. ""Lincoln"" is an excellent piece of cinema that, I suspect, will have (particularly American) audiences blubbing in the aisles."

","Lincoln (2012)<br/><br/>Okay, so this movie isn't exactly what I'd call entertaining. More of an extremely well put together and extremely well acted reenactment of the passing of the thirteenth amendment. The newest movie from Steven Spielberg stars Daniel Day-Lewis as the man in the hat, Abraham Lincoln, and let me tell ya somethin', Danny did good. He did real good.<br/><br/>Before I get into this amazing piece of acting, let's discuss the story. This film isn't about Lincoln's life as a whole. It only focuses on a few select weeks from Lincoln's life. These weeks happen to be the few leading up to the vote on the 13th amendment of the United States constitution. This decision was pure genius on the film maker's part. These few weeks are filled with so much activity that even this 150 minute film couldn't fit it all in, but it definitely does a good job of helping the audience along these complicated politics. I admittedly have a very limited knowledge of American politics, but I was on the same page as the characters in this movie the entire running time. At no point was I left behind. Good for you movie, good for you.<br/><br/>I'm really tempted to talk about the acting here, but 'tis not the time as of yet. Now is the time for script! This script is simply put, excellent. The dialogue is very believable while being filled with exposition. So much exposition! This is kind of needed though considering that Lincoln himself never exposizes at all. (by the way, thats my new word. exposizes) Abe likes to tell anecdotes instead of addressing the issue at hand. These stories were fascinating, to me, and the supporting characters. Whenever honest Abe started talking, people would shut up and listen. He was soft spoken, yet respected by almost everyone. Of course there are a few exceptions of this, and that's where the other politicians come in.<br/><br/>I'm not going to discuss the politicians too much in this review, but there are a few worth mentioning. Tommy Lee Jones does an excellent job in his role as Mr. Stevens, and I very much liked his character. The other fellow that I liked a lot was the fellow who played Preston Blair. I don't know the actor, but I appreciated his role here.<br/><br/>This is it. This is what you've all been waiting for. The big one. Now we come to the acting of my good buddy, Danny Day-Lewis. Wowza! This fellow's interpretation of the 16th president of the United States was just.......wow. That's really the only word I've got. He doesn't choose the route of the deep voiced, confident man that we all think of when we think of Lincoln. Instead, he chooses a man who is soft spoken. A man who feels responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. A man. That's exactly what he is. He is a man. A man going through one of the hardest things that someone can go through. I could just watch Abe for hours and be totally absorbed. This is sure to win the Academy award for best actor. If it doesn't, I will lose a bit of faith in the award ceremony itself. It's THAT good.<br/><br/>Okay, now that I'm done swooning over my new non-homosexual man crush in the form of Abe Lincoln, let's grade this baby, shall we? This movie is great.

To simplify the story the film focuses on the struggle to pass the 13th amendment which outlines the abolishment of slavery and grant African Americans equality in American society.<br/><br/>Of course the best performance came from Daniel Day Lewis who was perfectly cast for Abraham Lincoln. His acting mesmerised and captivated the audience in the cinema.<br/><br/>The script was perfectly done creating 2 hours 30 minutes of dialogue but never boring the audience.<br/><br/>I think this film should win best picture at the Oscars and that Daniel Day Lewis should win best actor making him the first actor to win 3 'best actor' Oscars and it would be well deserved"

","When a 03 time Academy Award winning director teams up with a 02 time Academy Award winning actor one should anticipate a mesmerizing cinematic experience in whatever motion picture they conjure up. The outcome indeed is 11 nominations at the 85th Academy Awards which is simply a few hours away from the moment this is being written.<br/><br/>The late president Abraham Lincoln is considered by scholars as one of 3 greatest U.S Presidents. Abraham Lincoln was elected into office as president in the year 1861 as the 16th president of the United States of America and is the first U.S president to be assassinated. A lifelong dream becomes a reality when finally Steven Spielberg after many years of different screenplay adaptations found the perfect script in the works of Tony Kushner (Who is nominated for an Award in the category of ""writing –adapted screenplay""). Thus Spielberg unveils the chronicle of carnage of the American Civil war and the political battle fought by Abraham Lincoln in passing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and thereby abolishing slavery.<br/><br/>Heavy subject matter isn't it?<br/><br/>How does Spielberg fair?<br/><br/>Spielberg as always has many a tricks up his sleeve. A man who is known to explore and push the boundaries of movie making surprisingly changes his styles in direction. Those who know the works of Steven Spielberg will go into the movie LINCOLN expecting to experience the American Civil War with award winning style set pieces much like in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (Spielberg won Best Director in 1999 for this movie), instead I truly became one with the vision of Spielberg as he narrated the humble drama of the man; Abraham Lincoln. He had a vision of telling the story of this great president and sharing with this generation who LINCOLN truly may have been. It is appropriate to say he succeeds. <br/><br/>The first choice for the lead had been Liam Neeson (Who was nominated for an Oscar for SCHINDLERS LIST) and for reasons unknown with time the choice moved to Daniel Day Lewis. Words cannot do justice to the utterly implausible feat Lewis puts up in portraying LINCOLN. I have seen many performances but this by far is the best performance I have ever seen by an actor up to this day and I am certain he will walk away with the award for the best actor at the awards this evening. After being cast for the part Lewis requested for a period of one year before shooting began and it seems that he may have done some extensive study on his own. The posture, the body language and the shrilly voice made me believe that I was truly looking at Abraham Lincoln. There are no tapes nor were clips of the actual president therefore growing up it was only a face to a name every time I heard the name LINCOLN. How accurate it is or how appropriate it is I cannot tell, but Daniel Day Lewis puts up the most passionate and convincing performance of a life time.<br/><br/>LINCOLN is a movie that progresses at a tremendously slow pace with moments of humor induced by random cameo appearances. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field do not fall behind Lewis by far. Whilst this cannot be considered as a careers best for Jones and Fields their performances yet again are timely, appropriate and most importantly passionate and hence lacks nothing which the motion picture requires for sustenance.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Performances that I consider I am privileged to have watched. 5 stars for Daniel Day Lewis and his supporting cast. A slow paced and humble tale of one of the greatest men ever lived.

"BharatSamra","8","0","1","23 February 2013"," A greatly told story, of the story told the most frequently in American History
","Steven Spielberg's Lincoln consists of a unique quality, in that you know the outcome of the film before you even pull the handle of the door to the cinema screen the film is playing in, and yet the filmmakers still manage to keep the audience engaged, enthused and frequently amused. Just as scholars have praised Abraham Lincoln's political leadership as the key factor in accomplishing abolition, this 21st century film adaptation of the same man's life is primarily accomplished by the strong performance by Daniel-Day Lewis, in addition to an absolutely impeccable supporting cast. <br/><br/>The first half is certainly not without its dull moments, though it is difficult to argue that the 150 minute feature-length needed to be shortened, due to the fact that every second of Lincoln is relevant, important and well-paced. Furthermore, the historical epic has been so incredibly produced and cared for that the film has a particular power of you; it grips the audience and transports each cinemagoer back to the 19th century, and you feel inferior and helpless to the situation that these historical figures must deal with. The climactic scene is the greatest example of this. Everything the film has led up to, everything these people have worked for (or against) and the defining moment in the political career and life of Abraham Lincoln is presented, edited and felt as nothing else but masterful. The only sound that can be heard in the theatre is the clasping together of hands in hope that history will translate to the outcome of the film. Of course, you know it will and yet the intensity that the writer, director, editor, actors and more create is of astounding cinematic quality.<br/><br/>To attempt to articulate the sublimely outstanding acting performances throughout Lincoln would result in failure to accommodate those words with justice. Though now I feel the irony as I have very briefly attempted to do so. Though some cast members protrude more than others, not one role or performance can even be considered faintly weak or unconvincing. Subjectively speaking (as all reviews do), Tommy Lee Jones' phenomenal portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens is the greatest and most intriguing to have the privilege of witnessing, not just in this Spielberg epic, but in recent cinematic history. From his inception on the screen, you just continue to wish for him to reappear again in the next scene, and in the scenes he does, his superior feat as an actor, almost makes the others around him languish, though they most certainly do not. <br/><br/>Lincoln is most definitely not the most entertaining of films, but it has no intention to be. On storytelling techniques alone, it reaches for the highest of quality while grabbing the audience and making us vulnerable to the powerful nature of the drama."

","The audience has already being warned of what is to come before the film officially begins. Like it would be the case before it would show at times throughout the course of the film of the mentions to the names of the prominent scenes it is showing and the people involved, a short introduction for the international audience who are not tuned in into what the film is going to be about.<br/><br/>It might have been about Abraham Lincoln's final months in office starting at the turn of 1865, which is how the film begins, but there were two things Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) was attempting to grapple with before he officially begins his second term later in the same year. The effort to negotiate an end to the painful and bloody American Civil War, and persuading a divided House of Representatives to vote for the passing of the 13th Amendment which is to abolish slavery once and for all. The opening scene after the introduction gives a glimpse of what Lincoln has to deal with, a battlefield of white and black men fighting and casualties from both sides before his meeting with four young white and black men (Lukas Haas, Dane DeHaan, Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo) waiting to join their companies while they recited excerpts from what he said at the Gettysburg Address from two months before.<br/><br/>After that, it is dominated by scenes of where the American soul, identity and psyche are to be fought and form the basis of this film. Private meetings with the likes of one of his closest advisers Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) and his family and meetings in his office with ordinary people like a Mr. and Mrs. Jolly (Bill Camp, Elizabeth Marvel) which he termed it as his 'public opinion baths', cabinet meetings with his administration in the likes of Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Bruce McGill) and Secretary of the Interior John Palmer Usher (Dakin Matthews) along with the Republican congressman often present at those meetings in James Ashley (David Costabile), the verbal battles between the House of Representatives members at the chambers over the debating of the 13th Amendment with Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) and leader of the Democrat opposition George Pendleton (Peter McRobbie) representing the Democrats and Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) representing the Republican Party which is controlling the House at that time.<br/><br/>Lincoln the politician and president is a consummate one at best in terms of trying whatever means possible, even on the verge on doing arm-twisting deals for the procurement of votes for the 13th Amendment from especially the lame duck Democrat congressmen who had lost the re-election two months before via the lobbying group Seward had organised consisting of people like William N. Bilbo (James Spader), Robert Latham (John Hawkes) and Richard Schell (Tim Blake Nelson), giving illustrations to tie in with what he is to talk about and telling seemingly irrelevant stories on cue which before Lincoln did led to his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton not able to tolerate him as they were waiting for news from Wilmington at the War Department. But Lincoln the family man is a different matter altogether in terms of his relationships with his eldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his wife Mary (Sally Field). The death of one of their younger sons in Willie three years before the film begins had complicated the husband-wife relationship between the president and the First Lady and that also influencing Mary on her insistence of not wanting to see Robert on the battlefront. Even despite studying at Harvard at that time and coming home to see his family at the White House, Robert has always insisted on wanting to serve in the Union army.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day for all the procurement of votes and the verbal battles between the Democrat and Republican congressmen, Lincoln is still trying to figure out what the black population signifies to the United States of America as a whole should the 13th Amendment be passed in the House of Representatives after all. A conversation with his wife's black dressmaker and seamstress Mrs. Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben) would provide food for thought.<br/><br/>While the likeness and voice for the 16th President of the United States is there for Day-Lewis which does feel at times it is the real president himself speaking, special mention has to go to Tommy Lee Jones and his portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, for his performance and the wit he has always especially reserved for his Democrat colleagues at the House of Representatives in Wood and Pendleton which provided some of the best scenes in the film, apart from when Day-Lewis's character nearly lost it in front of his cabinet colleagues after they were squabbling among themselves.<br/><br/>Keen observers of American history and/or politics will know what the final outcome of the 13th Amendment was, but it is something when director Steven Spielberg is able to pull off the suspense almost to the end. Still, it is something to have the audience at the edge of their seats, wondering whether the amendment is able to pass or not. Politics was never meant to be a glamorous thing in the first place even in the 19th century United States of America, but it is a glimpse of what can be made possible despite the various strong challenges and obstacles along the way."
"dario_malic","8","0","1","21 February 2013"," The simplicity of greatness
","I don't know many details about Abraham Lincoln's presidency so I came into ""Lincoln"" unburdened by historical facts. There were some expectations though, considering the director is Steven Spielberg, and they ended up completely fulfilled. The film begins in the midst of the Civil War and follows Lincoln's attempt to bring an end to it, as well as to slavery, and the difficulties he faced doing it, ending with his death after the assassination at Ford's Theatre.<br/><br/>The real focus of the film is on Lincoln's battle with slavery. While most of the other politicians just wanted the war to end, he postponed the peace arrangements, risking their failure, in order to get the thirteenth amendment (which abolishes slavery) passed by the United States House of Representatives (also known as the House). It is in itself a controversial decision and the means which he used in doing all of that are even more so. He stalled the Confederacy negotiators, made some members of his party lie about their beliefs and even bought votes from Democrats promising them better positions. It was interesting to see the most loved American president doing things for which anyone would be condemned today. The other unusual and refreshing thing to see was portrayal of the Lincoln as an ordinary man. Although (as I later learned) he came from a poor family and was mostly self-educated, it was surprising to see a man of such importance presented as a funny storytelling commoner. Of course, his decisive nature and strong leadership weren't omitted, which only contributed to the impressiveness of the character.<br/><br/>Most of the credits for making Lincoln as compelling as he is nevertheless go to Daniel Day-Lewis. Once again he proved his versatility and ability to become one with the character giving a performance so minute and delicate, and at the same time so powerful that one could easily watch just him for 150 minutes (film's running time). He's aided by a brilliant cast of supporting actors including James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, John Hawkes, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jared Harris, Jackie Earle Haley and Michael Stuhlbarg among the rest. Sally Field's performance as Lincoln's wife Mary was not so good as the hype suggests but still helped keep the standard high.<br/><br/>The technical side of the film, as was expected from Spielberg's work, is flawless. Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), editing (Michael Kahn), production design (Rick Carter), costume design (Joanna Johnston) and of course, music by John Williams, all made the long film as easy watch as can be and a pleasing experience for both eyes and ears.<br/><br/>Spielberg made a film about a very well known, but also a very important, character and an equally known and important episode from American history. It was a safe bet from the beginning and the screenplay from Tony Kushner, his Munich collaborator, just solidified it. However, it feels more as an exploration of the way politics work than as an ode to freedom, and the question remains whether this was Spielberg's intention. The main problem of the film is that it doesn't bring anything new. There is a little bit more humor than expected but other than that all classic Spielberg characteristics are in place: strong characters, simple plot, a touch of melodrama, great acting, impressive visuals, touching music, and so on. Unfortunately that stopped being enough some time ago.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that ""Lincoln"" is a very good film. If only Spielberg had the courage of his main character to impose a change where it is an absolute necessity it would have been great. This way we have nothing to do but to enjoy Day-Lewis' magnificent performance and hope that the great director's next film won't be just for the people but also for the history.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"
"jtindahouse","8","0","1","21 February 2013"," A classy showing by director and star
","Biography films almost always struggle with finding the balance between showing off their portrayals of historical figures and focusing on the actual story being told. Lincoln gets it about perfect. We are treated to both a riveting performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, and the rest of the cast for that matter, whilst stealing absolutely no focus from the amazing tale about the end of the Civil war and how Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is known as being a modern-day master of acting. He doesn't appear in many films, but when he does it's a real treat. He immerses himself in his characters and the audience reaps the rewards. He was so convincing as Lincoln I often had to remind myself I was watching a movie and not a real-footage documentary. Tommy Lee Jones' unflinching performance was also a real treat and the pair of the them should nab themselves an Academy Award for their performances over the weekend, with Christoph Waltz being the only possible exception to take home Best Supporting Actor. Sally Field is also nominated for an award but I have to say she didn't blow me away, even though I hear her performance was a fairly accurate depiction of Mrs Lincoln. I just feel she didn't nail her emotional scenes and really make me feel for her over the lose of her son.<br/><br/>After a slightly slow start the two and half hour film does tend to race by. Director Steven Spielberg's beautiful film-making style shines through and the story is told at a wonderful pace, with magnificent performances. There will always be those that nit-pick over a few historical inaccuracies, but I can't see even them bringing this film down at all. It will probably just lose out to Argo in the Best Picture category this weekend, but if it were down to just these two I'd have to narrowly give my vote to Lincoln."
"lagudafuad","7","0","1","21 February 2013"," Wonderfully done
","Lincoln is wonderful and Daniel Day-Lewis performance in this movie is worth his academy award nomination as Best Actor, Day-Lewis has twice won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the movies My Left Foot in 1989 and There Will Be Blood in 2007.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg put his mastery directing skills to work in this future classic, he also produced the movie. This movie shows the final moments of Abe Lincoln in office as the president of the United States. At that time the country was at war and at the very edge of change, Lincoln was in the driving sit against all oppositions to end the war and bring an end to slavery. The movie also depicts the steps taken by Lincoln and his party to get others at their side so as to win the necessary votes needed to end slavery.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Daniel's portrayal, his voice and also his movements. Spielberg didn't fail to add the aspect of Lincoln story telling into this movie, as we get to hear many of his stories as he used them to pass his message across.<br/><br/>This movie is very great and wonderful, and I'm glad I got to see it. I'm not an American never had it in mind to be one, but the singular act by Lincoln abolished slavery and made it possible for the Negro race to be seen as equal, although years of more battles and more assassinations led to the freedom that we see today, down to the point that a Black Man is now the President of America and he even won a second term in office.<br/><br/>For historical purposes, this movie did have its inaccuracies but not withstanding it is a nice documentary drama for those who want to know the battles that engaged when Lincoln was trying to end the war, from the battles at the war front, to the one at the senate and then not to mentions Lincoln's battle at home, here is a movie to see.<br/><br/>Did I enjoy this movie? Yes I did, but if you are not into history nor documentary you may find this movie a bore; Lincoln is a critical and commercial successful movie and it is one for the record books that I am sure of.<br/><br/>After seeing Silver Lining Playbook I believed that none could match up to what Bradley Cooper delivered, but this acting by Daniel Day-Lewis matches up to it and even surpasses it from my view, so my Oscar winner for Best Actor should be Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"dfle3","8","0","1","19 February 2013"," Yes, President... 77.5%
","Found this movie rather dry yet often witty. This true story concerns the closing days of the American Civil War, where President Abraham Lincoln was keen to abolish slavery and make it no longer possible to ever practice it again via an amendment to the American constitution (the Thirteenth Amendment). It is a wordy movie, often seeming stagey or as if written by a playwright...although sometimes it does go for farce. Initially I was going to say that this movie reminded me of ""Yes, (Prime) Minister)"" but that it was more lowbrow...but then I remembered that whilst the satirical British sitcom was often wordy and witty, it too went for populist laughs.<br/><br/>Not being American, I can't say that I've had a lot of exposure to representations of Lincoln, but it would be easy to believe that Daniel Day-Lewis brings great verisimilitude to his performance. Lincoln here, as represented as Day-Lewis is a fully realised human. Sometimes he looks like what I remember Lincoln to look like, in pictures...as in you see him, and think, ""Yes, that's Abraham Lincoln"". Day-Lewis' Lincoln has the look/sound of an Amish-apothecary-Anglican minister about him. He has the amusing trait of always willing to tell a story...which would sometimes befuddle his audience or drive them elsewhere (as in that scene with a general, I think). Lincoln here is an obscure chatterbox, making points that some may not understand or just bore some. Perhaps a bit like Sir Humphrey Appleby in ""Yes, (Prime) Minister""?<br/><br/>Seeing Lincoln in this light, you also sometimes wonder what on Earth he is talking about and how it relates to what someone has just asked him, but, lo, it does relate. Then there are the farcical stories he tells...I enjoyed his anecdote concerning an American politician, I believe, who was in an estate of the landed gentry in England...their toilet had an unlikely artwork in there. The punchline is most amusing (presumably the story is true...or at least makes for a great story!).<br/><br/>There are other farcical elements to this movie. Much of the movie is taken with the project of getting the numbers to pass the Thirteenth Amendment. Strategies which would now no doubt be seen as corrupt are presented here as farce here, at times.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis' Lincoln is an heroic figure here. He verbalises his internal struggle with the great conundrums he must face...often involving choosing the lesser of two evils. Perhaps the movie portrays Lincoln through rose-coloured glasses? I did read an article before watching this movie (""Lincoln sheds little light on some of history's dark deeds"" by Chris Berg, in The Age newspaper...07/02/2013?). The author is with the I.P.A. organisation, a right-wing think tank here in Australia. Actually, it seems that they are secretly funded by big tobacco and - surprise, surprise - they advocate for them. Anyway, from memory, the article mentions that many innocent Americans were tortured or murdered by Lincoln's orders. You don't see stuff like that in this movie, if it is true.<br/><br/>Despite this, the ""lesser of two evils"" that Lincoln chooses seems justified...unlike, say, the justifications President George W. Bush gave for his policies after invading Iraq. In that case civil liberties were were trampled underfoot after a country which had nothing to do with the attacks on the Twin Towers was invaded by the U.S. The president knew that his business partners in Saudi Arabia were implicated in the attacks on the Twin Towers. So, for me, what I see Lincoln do in order to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed seem justified on the basis of it being ""for the greater good"".<br/><br/>Sally Field as Abraham's wife Mary shines in some scenes and she would be a worthy winner of any best actress award, along with Naomi Watts in ""The impossible"" or Helen Hunt in ""The sessions"".<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones as the Republican Thaddeus Stevens is interesting as a character. There is a nice pay off with his character in his final scene where he arrives home. Didn't see that coming! An unkind person might say that Tommy Lee Jones is playing Tony Mokbel. Not sure what that is all about (pop cultural reference...excuse me!).<br/><br/>Another surprise was the suggestion in the movie that the theorems of the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid influenced the Thirteenth Amendment! <br/><br/>When watching the parliamentary (?) debates in the movie, it did have a very English feel to them. A modern viewer would no doubt be most amused by the ""slippery slope"" argument against abolishing slavery...no doubt stuff like that was said, but it does give the movie a very lowbrow feel as far as the humour goes.<br/><br/>When watching the movie, I was thinking what to score it...75+% was my first move. Ended up giving it 77.5%. Maybe this movie has some repeat viewing value and a score of 85% wouldn't be out of the question in any case. Daniel Day-Lewis would be a worthy winner of any best actor award. The script might deserve an award too. The dryness of the movie makes my scoring less than extravagant though. Like I say, it is a very wordy movie. Lincoln's tug of war between principle and effective governance is compelling viewing though (the whole theme of how Lincoln defines his presidential powers).<br/><br/>* Random observations...<br/><br/>The credits mention Kevin Kline in one scene...didn't notice!<br/><br/>Sometimes the artifice of the movie intrudes being lost in the moment...from the score sometimes trying to manipulate your emotions to that scene with Sally Field where a jarring change of camera angle detracted from the moment.<br/><br/>Right near the end of the movie, I suddenly remembered what ultimately happened to Lincoln...the movie did not delve much in to that."

","Lincoln solidly portray the time at the end of the United States' Civil War, specifically concerning the costumes, the decor, and probably the political proceedings. However, idealization of this important historical figure taints the result.<br/><br/>The visuals are just perfect, to the point of giving the pellicle a light grainy quality to get you in the mood. The closeness of the 19th century architecture as well as it lighting capabilities are well represented. You get an almost cozy feeling. The acting is excellent. I particularly liked Tommy Lee Jones' character, although it wasn't much of a stretch for him, it was funny.<br/><br/>If you're a US citizen, it's probably a must.

"davidgee","8","0","1","19 February 2013"," The importance of being earnest
","Much as he did in AMISTAD and SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg gives us a history lesson. This is an earnest film that requires serious concentration from the audience, given that it mostly consists of temperature-raising debate in Congress and arm-twisting meetings in the Lincoln White House. There are some scenes of the Civil War raging beyond Washington which are as visceral as the Normandy landings at the beginning of PRIVATE RYAN. Spielberg is equally brilliant at the broad canvas and the close portrait. The cinematography in Lincoln is almost painterly, like one of the Dutch masters: dimly lit rooms filled with dingily dressed people. I was reminded of the scenes inside Don Vito's house in the original GODFATHER.<br/><br/>The movie belongs, as the shower of awards is proving, to Daniel Day- Lewis. This is the most convincing portrayal of a historical figure since Ben Kingsley's Gandhi. When Lincoln shouts a reminder that the role of President invests him with ""awesome powers"", you feel that Day- Lewis himself is invested with awesome powers. His make-up is a tad overdone: there were moments when his beard and deeply furrowed brow gave him the look of a Klingon. As Thaddeus Stevens and Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field give career-best performances. Costumes and sets give the whole movie the look of an authentic window into the past. <br/><br/>If this is an accurate account of how the Thirteenth Amendment came to be passed, then the abolition of slavery was almost a fluke. We are only showed the House debate, not the Senate (which had already passed the amendment), but very few of the parliamentarians seem to have acted out of conscience or from principle; the waverers (of whom they were many) were won over by bullying or bribery (jobs for the boys).<br/><br/>However narrowly the Thirteenth was passed, US democracy was stretched in 1865 to encompass all its citizens. This is a fine, a noble, movie about one of the key moments in America's history."
"The_Furry_Menace","10","0","1","18 February 2013"," Spielberg's Commitment to Storytelling Pays Off With a Resonant Film for the Ages
","When it comes to ranking a Best Picture for 2012, I cast my vote for ""Lincoln."" Some complained that the movie should have featured more of the Civil War, but they miss the point. The film masterfully depicts the amazing balancing act performed by the 16th President of the United States as he fought his own battle for the abolition of slavery, a different battle and a separate - though connected - story from the bloody battle that was raging between the North and South. While some may consider it slow, to those who stop and really listen and sit back to appreciate the quality of the acting - particularly by Daniel Day- Lewis - and the impact of the events portrayed, the action unfolding on screen is positively captivating. I couldn't look away. That's not even to mention the tremendous cinematography and perfect sprinkling of humor that beautifully humanizes the characters and lightens the weight of Tony Kushner's screenplay. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's technical genius is pushed to the background as he allows the actors to carry the day, which they do in a most admirable way. That decision to forgo much of the technical prowess crowds typically expect from him highlights one of Spielberg's other great strengths: his brilliant devotion to story-telling. He allowed nothing, including his directorial ""trademarks,"" to get in the way of delivering a powerful, dignified, touching, and dramatic portrayal of Lincoln's fight during the last few months of his life.<br/><br/>While Argo has stolen a lot of awards attention by being a crowd-pleaser with the popular face and name of Ben Affleck attached to it, the reality is that it is little more than a glorified popcorn flick. Another cookie-cutter thriller, but the sort that Hollywood loves to give awards to because it is unabashedly patriotic and Hollywood itself is a main character in it. Lincoln is the movie from 2012 that will stand the test of time and be looked back upon years from now as a tremendous achievement."

"dmurilloroman","10","0","1","17 February 2013"," Of the people, by the people, for the people...
","I went to go see this with my family with high expectations and they were exceeded. Obviously the performances were all exceptional with Daniel Day Lewis not only acting but being Lincoln. The film was always tense as well even though you already know what happens with humor here and there, not too much yet not too little. The characters all came to life, not only Lincoln and the main supporting actors but also most of the representatives. Personally I have yet to see Argo and expecting it to win best picture but when it's goes in comparison with best pic nominees as Django, I'd slightly prefer Django just due to energy and personal taste yet on the emotional meter Lincoln triumphs. Going against films such as Zero Dark Thirty, Lincoln would be my selection, it doesn't fall victim to dullness over long periods of time, Lincoln keeps up its energy all the way to the credits. Lincoln is the most nominated film in the oscars(12 nominations) and I expect it to win half of them, with a lock in the best actor category and a strong performance by Tommy Lee which I believed that in the supporting actor category waltz had it in the bag but without jones the film would feel like its something missing, in humor and intensity. Lincolyn has all the elements going for it with extremely high notch performances, a script by kushner worked on in a 6 year hiatus, and an Oscar nominated original score which is a cherry on top on one of the years most important films. On a last note, when my family was driving back from the theater my dad commented that he almost slept through it due to very little action, I thought to myself that the debates/conversations brought more intensity than any action might and trust me the film brings out the brutality of the war without these types of scenes."
"DubhDoo","8","0","2","17 February 2013"," Spielberg and Day-Lewis team up to deliver a potential classic
","Historical biopics such as this can often fall victim to feeling somewhat like a monument, where the viewer is acutely aware that they are watching a big important film about a big important person. This can cause the audience to possess a sense of admiration towards the film, yet retain a distance as they would a monument. Oliver Stone is a director who has become known for making historical biopics that never fail to herald their importance, yet this is something which has not always worked in his favour, as some of his more recent work has shown. Thankfully, it is safe to say that, despite occasionally feeling like a monument of significance, 'Lincoln' largely avoids this, presenting an engrossing and often personal portrait of a man who's frequently viewed in a larger-than-life manner.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a man no stranger to the biopic, having made films such as the multiple Oscar-winning 'Schindler's List' or 2002's 'Catch Me If You Can'. He's also well-accustomed to delivering his fair share of historical drama – 'Amistad' (which also dealt with slavery), 'Empire of the Sun' and of course, 'Saving Private Ryan'. One common thread throughout all these movies and more of his was that they were unmistakably the work of Spielberg and when it came to 'Lincoln', this was a slight cause of worry for me. I'd enjoyed most of Spielberg's work, but for this film I felt that heartstrings being pulled at every opportunity and sweeping, rousing scenes in abundance would have been too obvious a direction to steer it in. The trailer didn't help; it made it look like 'Glory' with its dollop of sentimentality and glimpses of epic battles. This turned out to be a complete misrepresentation of the film itself, as with 'Lincoln', Spielberg has made what is quite possibly his most uncharacteristic movie yet; yes, some of the trademarks are still there, but not as much as they could have been, had he wished. <br/><br/>It is a very interior film; the Gettysburg battle scene depicted in the misleading trailer occurs within the first five minutes and aside from the occasional exterior shot, 'Lincoln' stays indoors for the majority of its 150 minutes. Those expecting a stirring and epic biopic will be sorely disappointed and possibly bored; we get nothing of his poor childhood in Kentucky or his rise to greatness; hell, we don't even hear him deliver the Gettysburg Address. However these are not complaints, as this film is primarily concerned with politics and history. Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, it's largely set during the last four months of the 16th President's life, centring on his efforts to get the Thirteenth Amendment in the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives, thus ending the war that was raging throughout the country and subsequently abolishing slavery. This means there is a large number of in-depth political discussions and debates that always demand every bit of your attention. If you have no interest in history or politics whatsoever, there is a considerable chance that 'Lincoln' may indeed disinterest you. With the presence of Tony Kushner, some critics have dubbed it 'The West Wing' with beards and they're not far off.<br/><br/>The film looks as if thought has been put into every frame; Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is consistently beautiful and has a richness and texture to it that makes every frame a delight. Each shot also appears as if it was pondered over and is all the better for it. The camera-work in 'Lincoln' is relatively restrained, but additionally it is visually lyrical possessing a lovely fluidity, coming to life even in the finer moments, such as the sight of cigar smoke wafting through the darkened rooms. Given that Day-Lewis is involved as well as Spielberg, it's unsurprising that 'Lincoln' exemplifies the very definition of what it means to give attention to detail, bringing a huge sense of depth to the film. This concentration on details was so strong that the ticking of Lincoln's watch was rendered by recording his actual watch, which is housed in the Lincoln Presidential Library, in Springfield, Illinois.<br/><br/>There's no denying that Daniel Day-Lewis is an extraordinary and versatile actor, having proved himself to be such in works like 'The Age of Innocence', 'The Last of the Mohicans' and Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece 'There Will Be Blood'. After Liam Neeson left the long- mooted project, Leonardo DiCaprio convinced Day-Lewis to take the role and what a magnificent performance he has delivered. His slightly twisted physicality and croaky voice may take some adjusting to, yet vitally you never doubt for a second that you are watching Abraham Lincoln, instead of a performer. He is an enigmatic and endlessly engaging presence on screen. It is a truly impeccable troupe of actors that Spielberg has so expertly assembled. There's Sally Field's great support as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee-Jones' brilliance as the fervent Thaddeus Stevens, the sneaky operative trio of John Hawkes, Tim Blake Nelson and a delightfully-moustachioed James Spader, David Strathairn's reliable impressiveness as William H. Seward, Lincoln's right-hand man, Lee Pace's rivetingly fiery performance as Republican Fernando Wood, and the list goes on.<br/><br/>For better or for worse, Steven Spielberg is a filmmaker known to schmaltz thins up and when it came to 'Lincoln' he had an ample opportunity to do this, but aside from the final five minutes, he doesn't and delivers something that is much more than men with whiskers discussing politics in darkly-lit rooms. It is an intelligent, personal and surprisingly thrilling piece of work that is his finest film since 'Saving Private Ryan'."

If president Lincoln was alive now, it would have been nobody but Daniel Day-Lewis! This performance is more perfect than perfection. (I could have watched a monologue running for 3 straight hours by him!). This is when democracy truly was born and you experience through the movie that it sustains itself by withstanding all complications and PEOPLE (themselves) make it what it is!

","Around 150 years ago, 600,000 Americans died in a bloody civil war that was essentially fought over the issue of whether to abolish slavery. It almost tore the United States apart. The man who kept it together was Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>This is an important and intelligent historical-political drama about Lincoln's efforts to free American slaves. Even in the free North, it didn't happen after a single glorious speech. It was a determined, rancorous, highly political and sometimes nasty effort to get two thirds of the US Congress to vote in favour of the 13th amendment. The vote could easily have been lost.<br/><br/>If you like historical dramas based on true events, you'll enjoy this movie. It certainly felt historically accurate. Spielberg has succeeded in bringing Lincoln, and city of Washington DC during the Civil-War years, to life.<br/><br/>I cannot really explain it, but at times I was deeply moved while watching this film.<br/><br/>I am not particularly a Daniel Day Lewis fan, but his performance in this movie was astonishing and most certainly Oscar-worthy. Sally Fields shows us exactly what Mrs Lincoln must have been like. The casting and acting of all the actors was superb. Not a false note anywhere.<br/><br/>Even though this is a Hollywood blockbuster, it is not a sensational action film. It is a discourse-oriented and rather didactic movie that presumes a certain understanding of American history. The dialogue and events were a little difficult to follow at times, even with subtitles. At the screening I was at, some people were apparently unable to handle it, and walked out.<br/><br/>Spielberg remains a movie-maker of the highest order. In making a movie that came into existence as a classic, he demonstrates most convincingly that he has not lost his touch. <br/><br/>He has shown the world why Americans consider Lincoln to be a great man, despite the horrors of the Civil War."

Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of his best performances, and is complemented by an excellent performances by Sally field and Tommy Lee Jones. If you love politics then this gives you plenty of time watching debates, and makes you feel like you are actually in 1865 watching a debate. The sets and clothes are also excellent, the acting is solid all the way through. I have no complaints about this movie. It seemed liked the time just passed by when you were watching it.

","""Lincoln"" is the kind of movie that it's easy to admire but difficult to love.<br/><br/>It would be easy to dismiss the film as pure Oscar bait, and the Academy predictably ate it up, making it the most nominated film of 2012. But to give Steven Spielberg his due, though his films have frequently been tailor made to the tastes of the Academy, I've never felt like winning awards was his primary motivation for making films. A passion for the story he's telling has always come through, sometimes so much so that it works at odds to the film's success (""Amistad,"" ""War Horse."") In ""Lincoln,"" Spielberg restrains himself admirably, and mostly chooses to leave out the emotional manipulation that can make his films so unbearable. The acting is the star of this movie, particularly that of Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. What Day-Lewis does isn't even acting as the term applies to pretty much any other person in the movie business. He becomes Lincoln, and if the performance isn't as showy as his transformation into Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood,"" it's no less amazing. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones are the other two principals who copped Oscar noms, and both are terrific. Nearly everyone else in the world (and that includes James Spader) is in the movie -- you never know who's going to pop up next.<br/><br/>It takes a considerable amount of talent from all involved to make a movie about the ratification of an amendment 150 years ago -- considering we all already know the outcome -- not only engaging but downright suspenseful.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","Finally caught up with the magnificence that is LINCOLN. Tony Kushner's script is a masterclass in finding the universal in the particular and the humanity in the history. Spielberg's direction captures every nuance, aided by a cast of America's best actors at the top of their game inspired by a towering central performance.<br/><br/>For, make no mistake, Daniel Day Lewis delivers a Lincoln that is totally convincing from the first moment he appears on screen and dominates throughout, often without speaking or even moving. He just IS Lincoln from his high-pitched Kentucky voice (spot on according to Harold Holzer's research) to his idiosyncratic walk. His last exit from the White House is astonishingly moving.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of method acting myself but it works here so well that I am utterly convinced that I have seen the real Lincoln. Many times I found myself in tears and utterly rapt in a long film that is both preachy and talky and yet works as well as an Aaron Sorkin political drama (or BORGEN, for aficionados).<br/><br/>I even came to understand the complex difficult Mary Todd Lincoln thanks to Sally Field's full-on interpretation and sensitive playing between the two leads in their scenes together.<br/><br/>It's said we get the Lincoln for our times and this one is aimed so directly at Obama as he enters his second and last term it might as well be gift-wrapped and sent registered post. Don't miss it because it's the Leading Actor performance not just of the year but of the decade."

","The film was originally pitched as showing Lincoln, warts and all, rather than as an untouchable icon. That's what I wanted to see. I think Lincoln was a great President, but there's no way around it, he was still a man of his time, and no president is without blemish. Slavery was not just a moral issue, it was an economic issue. It'd be like making a movie 100 years from now about bin Laden and the whole reason we went to war with him was because he was anti-woman rights. I mean, he is, but that's just a fraction of the picture.<br/><br/>The Civil War was NOT just about the morality of slavery, as this film mostly shows. Lincoln himself, to his dying day, believed that the two cultures could never truly live together, and he had thought about ""transporting"" all the slaves back to Africa. He made racist jokes and for the majority of his term as president (arguably all of it) his main goal was to keep the country together, not to establish a moral precedent on how to handle slavery and racism. The 13th amendment was a way to try and avoid the same conflict sprouting up again, since the various ""compromises"" over the years had all horribly failed. Oh, that's another thing, this film shouldn't be called Lincoln, it should be called The 13th Amendment. We only see the very end of Lincoln's presidency, let alone anything before he was president, and the film has very little going on psychologically like the truly great biopics such as Lawrence of Arabia or even Raging Bull.<br/><br/>Lincoln also did some very controversial things. He suspended habeas corpus, which is mentioned once in the film by one of the clear villains of the film and never brought up again. That's vital to understanding how he approached the civil war. People were arrested without trial for saying negative things about the country. Do the ends justify the means? It's a good question to ask, and it'd make for a good film. Lincoln seemed to want to ignore this as a film and mostly focus on the moral dilemma of slavery, which is an aspect of history, but not the whole truth, especially since the film begins with slavery as a moral debate and doesn't grow into it.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the first 15 minutes of Lincoln were the best in my mind (including his dream - which to me worked better as an idea for being President than the 13th amendment specifically, in that when you're a leader, things are moving forward whether you want them to or not). I'm not saying any of this to disparage Lincoln, it's to show what the conflicts of that era were. As I said, imagine a film made 100 years from now that is all about bin Laden's stance on women, or America's stance on global warming as if that were the single biggest thing on people's minds during this recession. It's an issue, but it's just one aspect of a much bigger picture. However while my problems with the film were related to the narrative, I thought all the performances were incredible, especially Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones, who has the best and most historically accurate and complex character in the film. Thaddeus Stevens really did see slavery as a moral issue, and he was a big influence on what happened in the 1860s.<br/><br/>Of course, there was another hundred brutal and oppressive years after the civil war before the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Brutality and segregation lived strong in a very institutionalized manner and all the extreme racists loved Lincoln because, until our recent era, he was not seen as the anti-racism president but as the president who kept America together. And that's still, ultimately, his true legacy, and because of his strengths as president now a lot of credit is given to him that really should be saved for other figures who are more obscure but who did the real legwork for equality both before and after the civil war.<br/><br/>It is disappointing to me that Americans have gobbled this film up so happily, because it really is a lie in many ways, and it's also not that entertaining of a film, nor does it question the very nature of truth like, say, David Fincher's Zodiac."

","I've read some other comments in the forums about how non-Americans would probably not ""get"" this movie. But I am not English yet I've thoroughly enjoyed English historic movies, especially those involving Churchill. <br/><br/>Further, I feel that since Lincoln was the one who saw to abolish slavery, that alone may draw the interest of others outside of the US to want to watch it. He, like many English historic figures was a well known hero. This movie will make him more real to you.<br/><br/>It didn't feel like a movie -- it felt more like actually being there. I could almost feel the mud on my shoes, and smell the death of the war. It moved me so to witness a leader of integrity and conviction -- and I'm far from a history buff!<br/><br/>When that last vote count came in that abolished slavery, seeing how the house was assembled up in the balconies during this critical moment, (I can't give this part away because it was so integral to the feel) it brought about tears. If he hadn't had the courage to go against the wind to get this done, I shiver to think what our current situation would be like. It seemed nobody wanted to support him but he persevered.<br/><br/>You can usually identify politicians and leaders who are in it for the right reasons because they go against the grain and support real human issues such as Lincoln did."

","First, the good part: As everybody says, the acting (and not only DDL's) is excellent. The production values are first class. The film effectively explores an important moment in US history, the Republican attempt to gain congressional approval of the 13th amendment abolishing slavery -- the Emancipation Proclamation applied only to the states in rebellion, and it was feared it would lose its legal standing after the conclusion of the war. The film makes clear the complexity and sometimes corruption of Lincoln's efforts to gain approval of the amendment. Best of all, the facts as presented seem well researched and in accord with history, a rarity in movies such as this.<br/><br/>However, like so many of Spielberg's recent films, this one is long on quality of manufacture and short on inspiration. Every emotional moment seems carefully and obviously planned for effect. This suffuses every scene -- the staginess and artificiality of direction constantly defeat the actors' best efforts to breathe life into their characters. And the first segment, especially, is unbearably crass and false -- fortunately not repeated to the same extent anywhere else.<br/><br/>I'll give Lincoln a 6/10 for its production quality, clarity, accuracy, acting, and the importance of its subject matter. But it could have been so much better with a bit of ""magic."" And really, that's why we go to the movies, isn't it?"

","Many film directors stick to one broad genre or style; some deliberately try to range across genres; and then there is Steven Spielberg who makes two very different types of movie: thrillingly entertaining works usually aimed at young audience, starting with ""E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial"" and ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", and serious, worthy, usually historically-based pieces, such as ""Schindler's List"" and ""Munich"". ""Lincoln"" falls squarely in the second category and, like others in this grouping (such as ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad""), has the issue of slavery at its heart, in this case the struggle by the 16th President of the United States to persuade the House of Representatives to pass the Thirteen Amendment to the Constitution in January 1865. the 'lame duck' period between his re-election and inauguration.<br/><br/>The restrained direction of Spielberg and the historically-laden script of his writer Tony Kushner expect a lot of non-American audiences who will not be familiar with the Congressional politics of the time, when the Republican Party was actually the liberal wing of the political spectrum, in a narrative which assumes some knowledge of a host of characters and deploys over 100 speaking roles. Those who know little of the iconic Abraham Lincoln will be surprised, maybe even shocked, at the dubious legality of his Emancipation Proclamation and the skulduggery that this wily lawyer deployed to win the necessary two-thirds majority for the proposed Amendment (as a change to the Constitution, a simple majority was not sufficient).<br/><br/>In the eponymous role, Anglo-Irish Daniel Day-Lewis totally inhabits the part and gives a towering performance with his stooped frame and high-pitched voice. The support roles are played by a strong cast, including Sally Field as Lincoln's troubled wife, David Stratham as his loyal Secretary of State, and Tommy Lee Jones as the ultra-liberal Thaddeus Stevens. The only lightness in a heavy work comes from three political fixers who act as reminders that lobbying has always bedevilled American politics. The cinematography is superb with many scenes shot in bleached-out colours and even dark shadows. In the end, however, ""Lincoln"" feels more like a rather pedestrian exercise in political education than a work than excites the emotions or entertains an audience."
"johnmcc150","7","0","1","5 February 2013"," Highly detailed, well acted but sometimes tedious
","Firstly, Daniel Day-Lewis gave a great performance, worthy of an Oscar. Leaving that aside, the film can be described as a reconstruction in great detail. This was necessary because many Americans already know much of the story and would rightly complain if Hollywood simplified this bit of their history with its quasi-religious overtones. However there were occasions when you would have liked them to just get on with it. Despite this precision, the anachronistic recitation of the Gettysburg Address by the soldiers is so obviously clunky that it is a wonder that Spielberg didn't spot it. With Lincoln himself available, it seems that he should have given his own speech. The apologies inserted at the end for things that Lincoln wished he hadn't said also seemed to be a blatant piece of Band-Aid. Interestingly, instead of scene in Ford's Theatre, they had a scene in another theater reminiscent of Erich Leinsdorf's announcement of the assassination of President Kennedy.<br/><br/>For me the film highlighted the fundamental flaw with the American Constitution that is still with us today. To get things done the proverbial 'pork-barrel' is still needed. There often has to be something in it for everyone, whatever the merits of any given proposition on its own. Vested interests still rule and in an era of fiscal cliffs, this is worrying."

","Although titled 'Lincoln' this Spielberg movie is not a biopic but the story of the passing of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery. In so far as it focuses on the culmination of Lincoln's life and political career it might indeed be said to be hagiography, a piece of hero- worship which presumably will have more appeal to American patriots than to others. We actually learn very little about Lincoln's background , early life and rise to power, which is a pity as they make a fascinating story in themselves.<br/><br/>Visually it is an absorbing film, replete with period detail and atmosphere, and Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of the beleaguered President is stunning (although his accent reminded me of Walter Brennan's 'Stumpy' in Rio Bravo, an incongruous comparison). But for me the man who steals the show is Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, the rabble rousing leader of the Radicals, whose performance is ever watchable.<br/><br/>Although there are a few battlefield scenes and glimpses of Lincoln's family life, the movie revolves around the debates on the Amendment on the floor of the House of Representatives. I was struck by the resemblance to those court-room dramas beloved of Americans, punctuated by cries of 'Objection!' and 'Clear the court!' 'Lincoln' could, perhaps, be seen as a scaled-up courtroom drama, with Lincoln the man on trial and the congressmen the jury. A noticeable weakness in the dramatic structure, however, is that the 'accused' himself never appears in the 'courtroom' (presumably that would be un-Constitutional) so that the 'trial' is conducted through intermediaries. Dramatic tension is further weakened because we already know the outcome - the Amendment is passed, slavery is abolished, the War is ended.<br/><br/>Many of the interchanges between congressmen, although passionate, are perhaps overly-long and complex unless you are a keen student of American history. On that point, there are several scenes which would presumably resonate much more strongly with a US audience (e.g. the surrender at Appomattox) than they did with myself. It also did not seem clear quite why abolishing slavery and ending the war were in direct conflict with each other, the raison-d'etre of Lincoln's personal and political dilemma. <br/><br/>The movie's ending is baffling. We all know that Lincoln was assassinated by a gunman while watching a theatre performance. Fine. We see a theatre performance and expect to witness the ghastly deed. But no - the central character is absent once more. A man rushes onto the stage to announce that 'The President has been shot!' Where? We're in the theatre but we didn't see it! What's going on? Did I miss something? Cut to scene of Lincoln on a bed, being pronounced dead by a physician. Seems we were in some other theatre where his young son is in the audience so that we can witness his pain on hearing that his father is dead. We've been fooled but not in a good way.<br/><br/>The movie is not without clichés - swelling music as the Amendment is passed, some rather self-absorbed story-telling by Lincoln, slightly sycophantic admiration from the younger generation, and a kind of beyond-the-grave finale. It's all a strange mixture.<br/><br/>Not one of Spielberg's best movies but some patience and a little preparation on the historical background may enhance enjoyment. Even so, still worth a look.<br/><br/>(Viewd at the Odeon, Westbrook, Warrington, UK 04.02.13)"

","Steven Spielberg. I'm sold. Daniel Day Lewis. I'm sold. Sally Field. I'm sold. Tommy Lee Jones. I'm sold. So when I heard that all four of the most influential people in Hollywood were going to be in a movie about probably the greatest president ever, I knew that I had to see it. Now all four of them have Oscar nominations, and Lincoln, the movie, is nominated for 12 much deserved Oscars.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the sixteenth president of the United States in his last months. In his last months, Lincoln (Lewis, of course he's not playing a side role) fought to abolish slavery and to end the war. The movie mainly focuses on his fight to get the amendment passed, in hopes that it may not sway those who love him away. Sally Field plays his wife, who blames him for the death of their son Willie.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is going to win an Oscar, and Jones is a possibility for his role as Thadeus Stevens. Sally Field will not win because the academy loves Anne Hathaway's fantastic performance in Les Miz. Hathaway is great in that movie, but she doesn't deserve it because she is only in it for about 40 minutes. It belongs to Field, who really knocked me out.<br/><br/>Lewis is, lets face it, the greatest actor in the planet. When he gives a speech or tells a story, he makes you feel like you're in the room with him. If you've ever wondered why Lincoln was so great, Lewis shows you why. You really love him, and his performance makes you feel like you voted for him and like you're living in that time. That's the sort of actor Lewis is. He knows how to freak you out (Gangs of New York), or make you cry (My Left Foot). He always makes it authentic.<br/><br/>Now, will this win Best Picture? I don't know. I still have yet to see Argo, Amour, and Zero Dark Thirty. But until then, this has my vote. Spielberg deserves an Oscar just for being Steven Spielberg. He has made so many great movies and only ONE has won Best Picture? It's outrageous. Ben Affleck and Kathryn Bigelow aren't nominated for Best Director, so he has another shot and he should get it. This is the first great Spielberg film since 2005's Munich. I liked the past few, but none of them were as thrilling as Munich.<br/><br/>John William's score always helps. This is also his best acted movie since Schindler's List. The script by Tony Kushner is extraordinary, considering a lot of the movie is talking. Lincoln does feel a little slow. I know i'm the only one who is going to say this, but I kind of had fun. It's kind of fun watching them gather the votes. I don't know, don't ask. This is a great movie, and if Spielberg doesn't win an Oscar i'm going to gather an angry mob.<br/><br/>A+"

Everything from the voice, to the hair, to the attitude, to the stories - it was all there in beautiful detail like never before. This movie will go on to be the 'be all and end all' of Lincoln. <br/><br/>Many of the other characters were excellently portrayed as well. Mary Todd Lincoln for example was displayed brilliantly by Sally Field - we see her torn to pieces over the news of her son joining the army and the contrasting 'brave face' that she so often has to apply. I would also highlight Tommy Lee Jones (Thaddeus Stevens) as a stand out performance in this cast of excellency. The scene in which he convinces Alexander Coffroth to vote for the amendment was, I felt, a turning point for his character - the moment from which I really focused on Stevens. <br/><br/>Overall, this is an incredible movie - definitely worth watching at least once - I may be back to see it again.

","moviestoenjoy.wordpress.com<br/><br/>To be honest, as I bought the ticket to watch Lincoln, I was thinking that this will be a movie which will show us that Abraham Lincoln was the best president of the best country and that kind of bullshit. But, that was not the case. The movie isn't about the president, nor is it about the Civil War, it's about the 13th amendment that abolished slavery. Although we all know the story, the movie brings us details most of us don't know, helping us to complete the picture about Lincoln's last few months.<br/><br/>As I previously said, the movie is about Abraham Lincoln's fight to abolish slavery. The most important thing about the movie is that it shows us that Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) didn't do it alone. The fight was fought by many people, including The Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones). In addition, the movie gives us a deep look onto Lincoln's personal life, and an overall look over the Civil War.<br/><br/>The film, from beginning to end, is a visual masterpiece. Everything that was needed to present an accurate 19th century setting was there: the costumes, the decoration, the landscapes, and the accents. Director and producer Steven Spielberg -who spent 12 years researching for the film-, as well as screen-writer Tony Kushner delivered us the 19th century America as it was.<br/><br/>""Chapeau bas"" for the acting. The actors did a job well done, perfectly portraying their historical characters. Tommy Lee Jones gave us one of the best performances of his career, making us love his kind-hearted badass character.<br/><br/>The overall performance was great, with a really good job by the supporting cast, but Daniel Day-Lewis was on a different level. The dude is an unsung miracle. During the whole 2 hours 30 minutes of the movie, not once have I thought of the actor. He made me believe he was Abraham Lincoln, portraying the deeply in-pain family man, yet the strong and responsible president. And personally, the fact that he played Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting in Gangs of New York, who opposed Lincoln's political plans, makes me appreciate his performance even more.<br/><br/>Better than history books and lessons, this movie brings us details needed to understand Lincoln's last months. Honestly, even though I knew how the movie will end, I didn't want it to end that way. That's probably due to the Daniel Day-Lewis effect, making us love a president from a foreign country and a different century. The movie is definitely a 2012 must watch."

It is evident, as in all the world, not only the need for discussion with legislators, but to negotiate their vote with threats, jobs offerings for the next government, electoral tricks to achieve the required votes, last-minute anxieties, the President's emergency pressure to the undecided or weak of character and the final achievement and success.

The resemblance is uncanny.<br/><br/>A large audience, not young people, but a more mature, knowledgeable and thoughtful audience, sat in a large hall, to see this film. A film which is not an action film or a war film, but is a film about history and politics.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a place called the United States of America, but one very different from the one we know. In this USA, civil-war has been raging for four years, a long bloody war. The issue at the core of this war is that of slavery. Lincoln is the President. He is a war-time leader. He is a Republican. In this USA, the Republicans are on the left, their support is in the north in the big urban centres and they tend to support the abolition of slavery. The Democrat Party support is rural, is in the south, is King Cotton, and thus is more supportive of retaining slavery.<br/><br/>In other ways, this USA is also very different. It is a very primitive society compared to today, certainly in communications. The politics too is somewhat different to today. It is much more face-to-face. More up close and personal. More raw and immediate. The film concentrates on the Capitol, but small-town politics always intrudes too. Perhaps this is like it still is in small towns everywhere or perhaps how it was in Athens and Rome long ago.<br/><br/>The film is essentially about President Lincoln at this time as he deals with the issues of slavery and the war, and how he goes about his business. We see more of him than this however. We see Lincoln the family man, we also see a plain-speaking folksy man at home in small-town America, at home talking to the ordinary people, and the exalted. Lincoln the storyteller. Little is seen and heard of his oratory, what there is, is enough. What is seen clearly is Lincoln the lawyer. The film demonstrates why the profession of lawyer has always been intertwined with politics from the earliest days. Clearly there was no one better than Lincoln at using his lawyer's mind to weigh the argument, to define precisely, and to take what has been said and to balance that with what needs to be done.<br/><br/>The central part of the film deals with the attempt to try to abolish slavery while the war itself is still raging. All of the different, and competing, arguments are heard as the issue is debated. The film has an all-star cast. DDL is great. He is Lincoln. The film is very emotional, but perhaps the most moving, most noble and most poignant scenes were those with Tommy Lee Jones. He plays an extremist, unswerving in his views, who plans and plots to try to achieve his objective.<br/><br/>This heavy-on-the-mayo, epic, Hollywood, blockbuster-film is a must see for all constitutional, historical and political anoraks everywhere. After the first few minutes the film is gripping. It would be churlish to mark this film down for the first five minutes, hence it has to be a 10/10."
"MadEden","7","0","3","29 January 2013"," A small great film
","It's an enjoyable movie. But it stays at that. <br/><br/>Now I am putting down these words with immense fear. Rarely do I walk out of a widely-acclaimed film unsatisfied. Most of time, I find the critics' praises and the moviegoers' lauds very reasonable. When it happens that I don't, I always question myself: ""Did I miss something?""<br/><br/>And I've been asking myself that over and over after Lincoln. I've read reviews. And my conclusion and perception has not changed. It's an incredible film, and an unbelievably small film.<br/><br/>Lincoln had the look of a truly grandeur historic piece. With an incredible cast led by Daniel Day Lewis in front of the camera, and an all the more fantastic crew behind with Spielberg at its head, Lincoln, from its birth, seems destined to become not only a film about history, but also a film that will stay in history and become a part of history. <br/><br/>But it hasn't. Despite Daniel Day Lewis' brilliant portrayal, Lincoln isn't a deep look into a great man's life; the story lacks the necessary complexity. It may be an effort at completely accurately recreate history, but that's left for historians to decide. <br/><br/>It isn't a pensive and analytical look at politics either. Some will say that it is, and that Lincoln has presented the dilemma a great politician faces: should one do the little evil for the greater good? President Lincoln, as portrayed here, has tried all means possible to pull votes onto his amendment, aka, the right thing. Some will say that this is Spielberg's message, that when facing such dilemma, just go for the frigging greater good.<br/><br/>I find that hard to believe. At least, if that were his intention, it was not very well conveyed. Those segments - when Lincoln was pulling votes, that is - were presented in such a playful tone (with such playful tune by John Williams) that I cannot draw any serious thinking out of it. According the film, it is all but a game. The ending vote segment especially. Yes, yes, it was all very moving and full of tension when each vote was counted and the amendment was finally past.<br/><br/>'Tis all a game, where one (or a couple) man's diligence, discretion, and intelligence rightfully trampled over other noble politicians' laziness, carelessness, ruthlessness, and stupidity. 'Tis all a game, where the fate of the people hangs in the hands of our not-so-decorous politicians. Where are the people, by the way, in this historic film (except for the beginning)? <br/><br/>To be fair, Lincoln has its great filmmaking. The one thing that has lingered in my mind is its breathtaking visual presentation. Every scene is so well lit and framed that sometimes I find myself wondering if I am watching a Aleksandr-Sokurov-directed film, or a Gordon-Willis-shot film. But of course not; it's Spielberg and Kaminski's great works. Equally brilliant are the art direction and John Williams music.<br/><br/>Sadly, despite both the cast and the crew's efforts in achieving the film's amazing looks and feels, the story just isn't right. It was fascinating in the watching, but once I started thinking about it, its magic stopped. It's a great small movie only for entertainment."
"TheSquiss","10","0","3","27 January 2013"," A powerful, riveting film with an Oscar-baiting performance at its centre.
","Ask the ordinary bloke in the street to tell you something about Abraham Lincoln (one that isn't an American who learnt about him at school), and he'll probably mutter something about the Gettysburg Address, his assassination at the theatre and the battle to pass the 13th Amendment to end slavery. Two of those momentous events are only lightly dealt with in Spielberg's epic, and that immediately sets him apart from other directors and Lincoln from most biopics.<br/><br/>Where other directors skim through the highlights of a subject's life in a moving scrapbook, The Iron Lady being a prime example, Spielberg has focused on a few short months in the 16th President's second term with intense detail and little action to sidetrack the viewer from the issues at hand. We might expect the Gettysburg Address, but Spielberg settles for giving us just a hint of the power and the effect it had on the American citizens in the 1860s. Instead, the focus of Lincoln is the debating, heckling, arguing and frustration in the House of Representatives and the resulting vote.<br/><br/>Yes, Lincoln is a film where little more than talking occurs. And it is absolutely riveting because of it.<br/><br/>But Spielberg doesn't patronise us with a stilted history lesson. Our ignorance is our own fault, not his duty to rectify, and it is a rare pleasure to be left to work it out rather than given a paint-by-numbers lecture. I found the final vote unexpectedly emotional and tense, despite history telling us the result. But it shouldn't be surprising that the director who made a man driving a car, in Duel, a nail-biting affair should make a vote such a thrilling event.<br/><br/>We see democracy at work, we witness the struggle to achieve one of the greatest moments in a great country's history and it isn't always pretty. Honest Abe, though a hero and a truly great man, was clearly not above manipulation, bribery and threats to achieve what was right and just. In Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal we see a man who wouldn't, and didn't, take no for an answer: ""I am the president of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me those votes!"" We don't accurately know what Lincoln sounded like but from now on he sounded like Day-Lewis. His performance is as measured as we have come to expect from the ultimate Method actor. He is always controlled, restrained, whether contending with his bleating, unstable wife, Mary (Sally Fields), or laying beside his sleeping younger son to kiss him, his movements and speech are deliberate and precise. This is a man who, though anger at injustice bubbles within him, is not reactive but always considered. There is very good reason why the smart money is on Day-Lewis to collect his third Oscar.<br/><br/>Likewise, Fields powerful presence as the wife who is patient and strong for her Presidential husband, while frequently being a thorn in his side, is one that quietly demands plaudits. She remonstrates with him over their older son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who wants dearly to join the ranks of the soldiers fighting the Civil War and who cannot earn his father's blessing or kind attention, and she delivers an ultimatum that makes even the most powerful man in the world stop for a moment to appreciate the gravity of the situation.<br/><br/>Yet again (after my comments in The Sessions review), Lincoln is a film that benefits hugely from a fantastic ensemble and it is perhaps unfair to highlight one performer from the supporting actors that include David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, John Hawkes and James Spader. They bring humour and variety to what is a very intense film, but none of them is merely a foil for Day-Lewis to play off. Tommy Lee Jones, as the irascible Thaddeus Stevens, transcends his usual crusty persona as a man that made others quiver in his presence, an attribute Jones knows all too well, and the actions of the man, as well as the performance of the actor, stay in the mind long after the film has ended.<br/><br/>Lincoln is a fine film. It is a detailed, thrilling film that excites and enthralls because of its intensity and not for its action. It is a film that will stand out as one of the best of the year and will earn a great many awards before the season is over. But it isn't for everyone, as was proved by the two teenage girls who grumbled loudly throughout, ""God, this is sooo boring..."", but lacked the intelligence to stand up and leave.<br/><br/>But for those who appreciate Spielberg as much for Munich as for ET, I'll give the final word to one of my companions for the evening, a man who refuses to listen to reason and believes Daniel Day-Lewis is a most overrated actor: ""I only remembered I was watching Daniel Day-Lewis in the last ten minutes and I have never wanted to applaud a performance in the cinema before tonight.""<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"

","Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' is amongst the finest films of 2012. Its A powerful, patriotic & highly engaging historical-drama. The biggest merit of the film, as expected, is Daniel Day-Lewis. He delivers A Tour-De-Force Performance as late/great United States President Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>'Lincoln' Synopsis: As the Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves. <br/><br/>'Lincoln' is masterfully written by Tony Kushner. His Screenplay Adapted from the novel Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin, is powerful & leaves a tremendous impact. Its historically accurate & progresses most arrestingly. Kushner's Writing never falters! Spielberg is a legend & 'Lincoln' is amongst his greatest films to date. He has handled the film with absolute flourish. Janusz Kamiński's Cinematography is top-class. Michael Kahn's Editing is sharpness, personified. Music by John Williams, like always, is mesmerizing. Art & Costume Design are excellent.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is my favorite actor since Al Pacino. An impeccable, incredible actor who has proved his status time and again. The 2-Time Academy-Award-Winning Actor is stupendous as Lincoln. He owns the film, in a performance, that is most likely to go down in cinematic history. He doesn't perform as Lincoln, he is Lincoln. Day-Lewis IS The Greatest Living Actor Today! <br/><br/>Also terrific performance-wise is Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the potty-mouthed, Radical Republican Congressional leader Thaddeus Stevens. Jones is marvelous in here, standing 2nd only to the mighty Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Lincoln' is a winner all the way! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"denis888","10","0","3","27 January 2013"," An Awesome Masterpiece by Spielberg
","I was waiting for this movie eagerly, since I am a huge Civil War buff and am a great Lincoln admirer. Then, I was a bit suspicious - will it be a kitschy pastiche? Or a bloody gory mess? Or a costume sweet nothing? My fears were dispelled after almost 3 unforgettable hours at the local theater. Steven Spielberg has made a truly amazing masterwork of art, and his hand of genius is impeccable here. The film is never boring, never drags, never stuns in a bad way. It is a mature, deep, decent, daring step into seemingly slow territory of an Amendment hearings and private life of the most beloved US President. This is not a war film like Private Ryan, or Gettysburg. Do not expect grand battle scenes. But, this is a great film about how terrible any war is. The anti-war sentiment is so vivid and strong here. The very topic of the Congress hearings could be dull and boring, but a great array of great actors made this thrilling and captivating. The casting is perfect - Daniel Day Lews, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones and many others made this film a feast for eyes and ears. The historical background is also very accurate and precise - you almost feel the coolness of White House rooms in winter, or a deep smell of blood in a battlefield, or a sweet smell of flowers on a table in the Mansion. The film is a big winner and a must-see for all clever people. 10 out of 10 - must be 100 out of 100"

","Lincoln is the story of President Abraham Lincoln's continuing struggle to get votes to pass the 13th amendment. Which, upon being passed, will abolish slavery.<br/><br/>I think the title was very-aptly conceived. Lincoln. It seems like it may be a biopic, or the life's story of him, and yet, it's only merely about one month in the man's life. However, that one month is so influential and plays such a huge part in history, they can make a 150 minute film on it, and maintain my interest throughout. Job well done.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg directs and Daniel-Day Lewis stars. An intriguing combination. Normally I disapprove of Spielberg, especially his latest works, but I have to say, I really did enjoy this film. It had a lot of great scenes, great dialog. Fantastic direction and above all, amazing acting from everyone, even the minor characters. It seemed like a lot of work was put into the film, and it really paid off.<br/><br/>Not once throughout the 2 hour and 30 minute movie did I feel it dragging, felt it necessary to check what time it was. It was just a well-rounded film with great acting, directing the whole shazam. I can understand people complaining of boredom or emptiness though, because as I already stated. It picks up with a month of his life, it doesn't really give you much back story or any other dimensions to the character. But to me, it was just fine. Steadily paced. And a great watch. Not the best film ever, but certainly far from the worst.<br/><br/>A great 8. Out of 10."

","Well, I really don't know. This film really didn't move me. Somehow, the impression I'd got of Lincoln the man was more than what Daniel Day Lewis could muster for him. Nice casting for the film but it still struck a wrong note with me. Lewis too often portrayed him as a diminutive hunched and tired of life man. This is a pity because it may be because he was trying to capture the essence of the 19th century president whilst being surrounded by healthy, equivalently tall peers. The voice too is forced and squeaky. This is not commanding and domineering. Lincoln, a giant, immovably straight thinking juggernaut isn't to be found here. Sad, so you'll just have to keep your eyes closed and listen to the dialogue. This is mostly fair enough with the occasional trip into the preposterous. You know the story and know how this ends so you can leave before the end and not miss anything. Shame really that something better couldn't have been made to celebrate the absolutely extraordinary achievements of this unique man."
"theredraylives","10","0","3","26 January 2013"," Nothing short of a masterpiece
","Lincoln, through every second of its runtime, evokes such an overwhelming array of emotions that it is nearly impossible to explain exactly how one feels about the film, only that one truly feels the film. The film centers around the last year of the Civil War, in January, during which President Lincoln was attempting to get the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution passed through the House of Representatives.<br/><br/>At the center of this is Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th President, with a performance so fully realized and engaging that it won't be hard to see DD-L winning his third Oscar for it. His Lincoln is a humble and quiet man, wrapped in untold strength and charisma, loving to regale his cabinet, staff, and anyone who'll listen with stories. Huge, huge chunks of the film are little more than Daniel Day-Lewis telling stories, but each and every second his Lincoln is on-screen he demands the fullest attention. The brilliance of his performance lies in its subtleties, his posture, the way he moves his hands, the way he crafts every single word and sentence as if it is the most important he'll say in an entire lifetime. For a period drama with no action the runtime is in no way a hindrance at almost 2-1/2 hours; in fact it only lends more time for the audience to fall incontrovertibly in love with the man and the entire film.<br/><br/>This is so easily accomplished because of the attention to detail on the part of everyone in the production, from the actors to the director, to the costume and set design. Spielberg's attention to detail on historical pieces such as this is nothing short of perfect; he brings the audience right back to 1865 in the film, completely immersing the audience. Yet the comparisons to modern day are unmistakable; a largely political film, it spends a great deal of time on the floor of the House while Democrats and Republicans attack one another over the cause of ending slavery. This immediately draws comparisons with modern politics. Yet it goes to educate audiences about American political history, in that it has always been a dirty game, a hard-fought battle in the trenches of the houses of Congress and the White House. Indeed, the modern political scene isn't the only one of gridlock, of impassioned arguments on both sides of the floor, of favors and political grandstanding.<br/><br/>Spielberg assembles a masterful cast here alongside DD-L and each choice was made brilliantly. Beside him is Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln, her performance a whirlwind of strength and fragility wrapped into one. It is with Field's Mary that DD-L's Lincoln has many of his best scenes, from quieter moments to continued mourning over the death of Willy Lincoln, to angry and explosive fighting. Their performances together are simply brilliant, each character exhausted from fighting so many battles separately and together, but at their core there is a tenderness and love that is irreplaceable.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is absolutely magnificent in the film as abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens. His speeches and his moments in the film are by far its most passionate offerings, with Jones infusing his Stevens with so much life and hostility at the very notion that freedom and equality are not the rights of every man. His words are chilling, with Jones delivering them with such power and depth. Also standing out in the amazing cast as Secretary of State William Seward is David Strathairn, who gives a fantastic performance as Lincoln's main confidant and friend.<br/><br/>Yet the biggest praise must go to Spielberg for his absolutely incredible direction. This is a man who has received a great deal of flak over the last decade, with many suggesting that he has lost a step. This film, make no mistake, is the master returning to what makes him great. Spielberg is such a brilliant and masterful storyteller; his images on the screen tell stories that words never could. In a particular scene, Lincoln is pulled in two different directions: end the war, or end slavery? An impossible decision to make, but Day-Lewis pulls off the tug-of-war going on inside of the president with such beautiful precision, each facet of those decisions cutting him like a knife. He sits alone in the telegraph room with two other men, telling a story that will inevitably lead him to his decision. Spielberg shoots it from a very high angle, with the president and the two men in the very corner of the shot, the remainder of the room completely empty- it represents the solitude Lincoln feels in his decision, as many in his cabinet feel that ending the war is the more important course of action. Few directors know how to tell a story with the camera so well as Spielberg, and when he gets it as right as he does in Lincoln, there are simply no words of praise adequate enough to heap onto him for the incredible work.<br/><br/>Let it be said, in no uncertain terms, that Lincoln is a masterpiece. Spielberg weaves together such a complex set of narratives, directing every single one of them through the masterful performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, whose utter strength of character is spellbinding. It reminds us that Abraham Lincoln, for all that loved and hated him (and kudos to all involved for showing us both sides of that coin), was a president who was tasked with impossibly mountainous tasks, and yet with the help of great people around him he completed them. Lincoln's narrative is so moving, and demands such an emotional investment that by the time it all ends in the way that every single American knows the life of Abraham Lincoln ended, there is little more to do than sit and stare transfixed as the final credits roll, tears falling, overwhelmed in ways unimaginable.<br/><br/>Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!"

","Spielberg's latest shows Lincolns attempt to pass the 13th amendment with many attempts to block the bill in the end days of the civil war.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly this is a more than solid film from Spielberg whose name alone will get people into the theaters to see the film. The cast is great across the board with special mentions to Jared Harris, Tommy Lee Jones and of course Daniel Day Lewis who should be making space for his 3rd Oscar already. This film is a slow drama which may deter a lot of people who'd prefer a lot more action but don't let this put you off with such great actors and wonderful writing the story will grip you and hold you to the end leaving you wanting to know more about the story. <br/><br/>Being from Scotland I only had a general idea of Lincolns time in power but this film has taught me and motivated me to learn more about the 16th President of America, I feel I won't go wrong in purchasing Team of Rivals which Spielberg and Kushner used as a guide to the film."
"fredschaefer-406-623204","10","0","3","25 January 2013"," Maybe the best film ever about American politics...and history as well
","There is nothing I can say here about the incredible work of Daniel Day- Lewis that has not already been said; his Abraham Lincoln is truly one of the finest recreations of an historical figure on film ever. And not just any historical figure, but next to George Washington, the greatest icon in American history. All great praise as well to Sally Field, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, James Spader, Jared Harris, Bruce McGill, Lee Pace and all the rest who bring the varied historical figures of 1865 Washington D.C. to life again.<br/><br/>But I want to give my praise to Director Steven Spielberg and screen writer Tony Kushner for giving us a wonderfully realistic, and at the same time, positive portrayal of how the American political system worked. And hopefully still does. The story of slavery and its demise through the adoption of the 13th Amendment is one fraught with heavy history, yet Spielberg and Kushner lay it out in a manner that is fair and at the same time, gives us an understanding of the context of 1865 and a nation weary after 4 years of a bloody Civil War. Differing figures, like Jones's Thaddeus Stevens, wanted to end slavery at any cost, while others like Holbrook's Preston Blair, who only wanted to end the bloodshed at any cost, are portrayed as sincere in their desires, if flawed in their means. Those on the wrong side of history, like the Confederate negotiators, are not the racist buffoons that pop culture demands they be, but merely patriots in service to a very bad cause. I seriously doubt that revisionist historians, like the late Howard Zinn,would care much for this movie. <br/><br/>That having to bend the rules, if not outright break them and suffer the consequences, is sometimes necessary for the right cause to triumph is not something taught in a civics class, but the right lesson to be learned in the real world. That Lincoln knew this and acted upon it, as shown in Kushner's script, is proof of our 16th President's genius. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is the cinema's master storyteller and his Lincoln is one of his best efforts; a masterful and illuminating look at a man, a moment, and vital part of our history."
"octopusluke","8","0","3","25 January 2013"," The Frame Loop's review of Lincoln
","Yes, Lincoln has certainly pandered to the awards academies, racking up a formidable 12 nominations at the Oscars next month. Most of it's gong chances are debatable, but there's one performance that is more than worthy of a 13″ inch golden fella.<br/><br/>Let's just get it out of the way, Daniel Day-Lewis is the beating heart of the film, the commandeering force behind it's successes. His stalwart depiction of Lincoln is awe-inspiring and unparalleled, even by his own legendary standards. Think back to his moustachioed villain Bill the Butcher in Scorsese's Gangs of New York. Flamboyant, erratic, and equally Oscar tipped, that knife wielding maniac is the antithesis of Lincoln, and Day-Lewis is equally unrecognisable. He plays the president of towering stature with a reedy, borderline warbling tenor, yet incongruously still embodies Lincoln's well documented charisma and affability. It's difficult to attest how historically veracious it all is, but the performance is so astonishing in fact, that it is rendered invisible; as if Spielberg has stumbled upon a time machine and gone back to pick up the bona-fide bearded lawman.<br/><br/>Usually such a consummate performance would render any other performances obsolete, but not here. Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as the po-faced and silver tongued radical Thaddeus Stevens, the staunch opponent of slavery who helped reach the momentous verdict with his political prowess. It could be quite a dowdy slog to the attested outcome, but the appearance of James Spader and John Hawkes as conniving spin doctors gives the film some desperately required levity.<br/><br/>If Day-Lewis is taciturn, Sally Field is the portent thespian, portraying the psychologically perturbed first lady with raw emotional impulse in a performance that borders from the cerebral to the melodramatic. It's far from a romantic film, but Spielberg doesn't cower away from presentation of Lincoln as a complex family man, torn between doing what is good for the country and good for the home (which includes a bit-part from Joseph Gordon-Levitt as reluctantly drafted son Robert).<br/><br/>The sole issue Lincoln suffers with is it's smacks of self-effacement. A worthy picture on a worthy subject – from the quotidian American populist filmmaker, no less – some of its' plaudits are more akin to tokenism than genuine merit. John Williams' drab and utterly forgettable scoring, Kaminski's mundane cinematography, Michael Kahn's serviceable editing. None of these aspects are particularly bad, but they're hardly gong-worthy. It also comes woefully close to a bore whenever Jones or Day-Lewis aren't lingering in the frame. Fortunately, that isn't often enough to dampen your engagement in the story, or the peculiarly nail biting amendment verdict.<br/><br/>While the film won't go down in the history books, it's handling of a difficult subject matter, and that awe-inspiring central performance certainly will. While I much prefer Spielberg in 'fun for all the family' mode, this adult chamber drama has a profound resonance, which makes it well worth watching.<br/><br/>Read reviews, interviews and the like over at www.theframeloop.com"

How could any other guy than Spielberg just make a movie with such a massive cast and yet make it a grand epic? <br/><br/>The opening scene of the movie, Lincoln meeting the soldiers, was a perfect start which itself marked it an exceptional class movie.Few history related dialogs were confusing\puzzling and I needed Wikipedia's help for those. Else that, every other scene was spectacular. Especially Lincoln's anecdotes, the voting speech, the search\hunt for supportive Democrats and the Euclid theorem parts were awesome!<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis, man what an actor are you? Couldn't simply co- relate his performance and role in 'There Will be Blood' or 'Gangs of New York' to this one. He has just devoted his heart and soul for this lifetime role. No one else could portray Lincoln in such a honest yet witty way. A President, a philosopher, a family man, a caring father, a fellow companion, a funny guy, Daniel was everything that Lincoln actually was. There should be no other nominations for Best Actor this year when DDL is there. And Tommy Lee Jones, I had seen few of his movie earlier, but never never never dint know that he could act so really well. Sally Field and Joseph Gordon did their parts quite well. <br/><br/>The screenplay was brilliant as usually people tend to doze off during a movie with so much war history. A right mix of humor, thrill and emotion in the drama filled all the gaps to present such a neat movie. As always John Williams' background just blended beautifully to their respective scenes. <br/><br/>I haven't seen all Oscar nominated movies yet, but I hope and guess that this one will win big!

Daniel Day Lewis gives a truly remarkable performance, he, almost like no other, commands the big screen, you simply can not take your eyes of him. You know, while watching the film, that you are watching a master, honing his craft like no other.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis has this almost unheard of ability, to take on a admittedly bizarre, unusual and complex role, and simply nail it. He is a true icon and genius, and Lincoln is no exception.<br/><br/>The entire film is beautifully shot. It doesn't move at a frantic pace, and certainly doesn't rush. Spielberg delivers one of his finest masterpieces, and i think that statement alone, speaks volumes for the brilliance of Lincoln.<br/><br/>8/10"
"diac228","7","0","2","19 January 2013"," Spielberg's dream come true.....?
","One of Spielberg's ultimate dreams was to be able to make a Lincoln film. And after over a decade of speculation, we finally see the master director's vision come true---albeit in a manner we didn't really expect. While the film focuses mainly on Lincoln it narrows the structure down to his final months of the presidency and his life. Instead of the log cabin child to lawyer to president timeline, we get the end of war to 13th amendment timeline. But although it is masterfully acted and directed, it's a tough pill to swallow because of the length and because of its focus on the bare-knuckle politics of the time period.<br/><br/>To keep it simple: if you dislike politics this will not be your cup of tea.<br/><br/>This film however isn't without its assortment of strengths. For starters, let's please give the Oscars to Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones, because they did phenomenal in their perspective roles. The rest of the cast did outstanding, ranging from Sally Field to James Spader to Hal Holbrook. Arguably the best ensemble cast within the past year, Lincoln is a movie that could have posed as a Broadway show because it was the acting that stole the show and maintained the film.<br/><br/>However I can almost bet you anything that Steven Spielberg would have preferred a superior script that focused much more on Lincoln's life and less on the politics surrounding it. Nonetheless, he did a grand job with the script on the table and doesn't overdue or overblow the film with an abundance of style. It was framed like a high-budget play, and was paced like one. And this is where the audience can become alienated; in terms of content politics covets about eight-tenths of the movie.<br/><br/>And this is where the film becomes to unravel mildly. If Lincoln had found a good balance between the president's personal life, political life, and life dealing with the war, we would have had ourselves a loaded movie that will push for the Best Picture prize. Instead, we have a movie that doubles-down heavily on politics and the maneuvers done to accomplish what Lincoln set out to do---while sacrificing a few key moments in the president's life. The ending in particular comes off as awkward because of the clunky catharsis and unique editing choices.<br/><br/>After a slow start and a grand second act, Lincoln winds up mere inches from becoming one of the better movies of 2012 because it stumbles towards the end. Great performances and simplistically quality directing was marred by questionable editing choices and a final act that couldn't decide what ending to choose from. This most likely isn't the Lincoln film Spielberg wanted, but nearly crafted a diamond out of coal.<br/><br/>A few Oscars are in place here, but Best Picture isn't one of them. Nonetheless, it's still an entertaining political drama that is sure to cement Day-Lewis and Spielberg as among the best in their proper craft."

","Like most, I came into Lincoln hearing much praise and anticipated a quality film. I also had heard about its runtime and I expected a long ride, but I did not expect this long of a ride. To my surprise ""Lincoln"" is approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes, but watching it, it felt like 3 very long hours. Simply put, I do not think Spielberg had the proper pacing for this film. As the film starts, you get a sense of framework for its development, the problem is: when does it stop? As a result of focusing on one key issue I believe Spielberg leaves much underdevelopment...which doesn't balance well with what is seemingly an abrupt ending. In my mind DDL owes history books for much of his success. When I really think about it, does ""Lincoln"" really convey a message of our 16th president, or was the instinct to accept whatever morals he stood for? This, in my opinion, leaves me wanting more. Spielberg insists on using the same formula to send the film's message; time that could've been spent utilizing the talents of Sally Field, JGL, and others. I received nothing new out of a film that dragged on. What ""Lincoln"" pushes for is something we already know. Effective, but the idea gets old."

","Set toward the conclusion of the U.S. Civil War comes this gripping portrait of a beloved and iconic U.S. President.

Although assured of support from his own party, he struggles to procure enough votes from the opposition while also balancing out his tumultuous relationships with his wife (Field) and eldest son (Gordon-Levitt). A rich and compelling portrait of a man who sought change, with well-defined characters, an enlightening look into old American politics, and leisure, masterful direction from Spielberg allowing viewers to feel like they were there as it happened.

","As he did in There will be Blood the art of Daniel Day Lewis simply overwhelms intriguing plot, solid production values and the lumbering direction of Steven Spielberg in Lincoln. Summoning his inner Henry Fonda Lewis once again proves with authority that he is the finest English speaking actor working in film.<br/><br/>Lincoln concentrates on the final year of the war and the political struggle to end slavery in the Senate. Now just as then politics can be very surly and Spielberg does not spare Honest Abe when considering the stakes and he consents to whatever means possible.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction is deliberate and stodgy with beautifully lit compositions that hang around too long. He also stumbles with his jarring attempt to bring a comic relief to the sober theme regarding a trio of shifty con men displaying too much stooge slapstick working in concert with Lincoln's cabinet.<br/><br/>Sally Field's Mrs.Lincoln does not hold its own with Lewis because no one's performance this year and most others don't but she does supply a fair share of powerful moments. Spielberg gets competent performances from the rest of his cast save Spader's manic hipster con man but with all the performances as well as director Spielberg's meandering pace you will hardly notice since Daniel Day Lewis has your complete attention from start to finish."

This film does neither, the pacing of this movie was slow, slower and slowest. I didn't learn anything about Lincoln that I didn't learn in 5th grade history class, and I certainly was not entertained.<br/><br/>This movie will win a lot of Oscars simply because Hollywood likes to think of themselves as something more that entertainers, and movies like this make them self-important.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who finds themselves with a bad case of insomnia this will put anyone to sleep"

The acting was the best part of the entire film with superb performances from all, but Daniel Day-Lewis shone out like a beacon. When I watch any film I want it to create emotions within me of one sort or another. This was so slow burning, that I struggled at times to retain concentration.

","Daniel Day-Lewis has yet to make a sub-par movie because he gives absolutely everything to each movie he's in, and Stephen Spielberg is an overall fantastic director, so it's safe to assume that this movie will be amazing. But you have to be a hardcore history buff to enjoy it because it's all technicalities and few sparks to speak of. It also gives mean more reasons to hate the two-party system. My father and I agreed that this is the type of movie that will be shown at school because movies garner more interest than text can.

"estebangonzalez10","7","0","5","3 January 2013"," Daniel Day Lewis and Spielberg bring the icon Lincoln back to life
","¨I could write shorter sermons but when I get started I'm too lazy to stop.¨<br/><br/>Lincoln is without a doubt the most iconic figure in America's history and for that fact alone this movie is worth checking out considering it is a well researched biopic directed by one of the best contemporary filmmakers: Steven Spielberg. Lincoln may not be as entertaining as it is informative, but none the less this is a film that will stick with you and help you understand perhaps a bit more why Lincoln remains such a beloved and respectful figure in our society today. This film will win several Academy Awards and perhaps even Best Picture thanks to a wonderful lead performance from Daniel Day Lewis, a great supporting cast, and a brilliant screenplay from Tony Kushner, who had previously worked with Steven in Munich. What stands out about this biopic is the way in which Spielberg presents it by deciding to focus on a specific period during Lincoln's second term as President. The film doesn't have flashbacks or tell us anything about Lincoln's past life, but rather focuses on a specific period in time where the President is trying to abolish slavery by getting the 13th Amendment passed in the Constitution. All this occurring while the Civil War is going on of course, as we see how Lincoln brilliantly manages to maneuver both things at once. By deciding to film the biopic this way we can focus on an important period in Lincoln's life, without having to go through his entire life. I felt that this way we were able to learn much more about the President and his actions than we would have if we were given every specific about his entire life. By focusing on this specific period we really learn and understand the person that Abe is. I thought this was just a brilliant way to approach the film and it worked wonderfully. <br/><br/>The film takes place during Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day Lewis) second term as president in 1865 while the Civil War is nearing its end. Lincoln knows that if he wants to abolish slavery once and for all in America he will have to do it before the Civil War is over. Concerned about the little effect his emancipation act will have on the slaves after the war he begins to push for the 13th Amendment to be passed before peace is reached. The Senate has already passed the amendment, and now it is up to the House of Representatives to pass it. He knows he has the votes from the Republican Party, but he still will need about 20 Democratic votes in order to get the amendment passed. In this political game that Lincoln begins to play he tries to extend the Civil War as much as possible in order to get the amendment passed, although he knows that the longer he extends the War the more innocent lives will be lost, including that of his son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has decided to join the War. This crisis of conscience that Lincoln faces begins to take a toll on him and his family, although he manages to maintain his serenity through these troubled times. Sally Field plays his wife Mary, while David Strathairn is William Seward the Secretary of State. Tommy Lee Jones is Thaddeus Stevens, one of the Republicans in the House of Representatives who highly favors the amendment. <br/><br/>From the moment that the film begins you get a sense that you really are seeing Abraham Lincoln, the icon himself come to life. Daniel Day Lewis immerses himself completely into his role in such a way that you forget that you are seeing a portrayal of Lincoln, and actually begin to see Lincoln himself. Daniel is a tremendous actor, he surprised us all in There Will Be Blood, and once again he outdoes himself. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins his third Oscar for his tremendous performance here. He is the highlight of the film. The rest of the cast is also brilliant: You have Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, John Hawkes, Jackie Earle Hayley, and Jared Harris among many other great actors. The entire cast here is magnificent as they transport us into the past in such a way that you forget you are watching a film. Everything about this film works really well, but I felt it worked more as a history lesson than as a piece of entertainment. This is not an action film, it doesn't focus on the Civil War, but rather it takes a more personal approach as to the persona of Lincoln and the strategic politic mind he had. This is a film that will help you understand more about the man and how he managed to end the Civil War while at the same time abolish slavery. This is perhaps the greatest historical American political film ever made. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of politics and I did find this film a bit heavy handed, but it was a wonderful experience and it helped me understand and learn more about the man Lincoln.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"BeneCumb","8","0","2","3 January 2013"," A strong movie - in every aspect
","Steven Spielberg has done it again... Created a powerful movie with solid plot (with real events and characters) and employed talented character actors, incl. several Academy Award winners. Of course, the screenplay is compact (created by world-famous Tony Kushner) and not catchy for those not fond of history and/or something happening in a limited time and space. And, above all, the movie is made for Americans - by Americans - and could be a good aid in teaching/learning 19th century American history; Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was really a major step in the U.S. politics back then.<br/><br/>All the cast is evenly strong, with the most brilliant (and most frequently visible) performances carried out by 3 Academy Award winners (Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones) and 1 nominee (David Strathairn). All them, starting with Day-Lewis, could be strong candidates for another Academy Awards. But those in smaller roles are also very good: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson... All versatile actors, no just ""cute faces"". On the other hand, a dignitary person like Spielberg can afford this.<br/><br/>Lincoln by Spielberg is a tough and serious movie without any usual entertainment nuances. And even in the United States history there have been not too many presidents with so broad views and comprehension as Lincoln, politicians have dominated over statesmen."

","Lincoln was overall a great movie. It did a great job at revealing the story of the 13th amendment and how Abraham Lincoln fought to pass it in the midst of the Civil War. The inter-workings of his cabinet and the congress were represented very well, especially his relationship with his Secretary of State, Seward, and how they disagreed but still managed to work together. The views of the southern Democrats and radical Republicans were clearly explained and the actors showed just how passionate both sides were. Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of the strong abolitionist was excellent and you really got to see how strongly the amendment effected people during the time. It was also good to see how Lincoln had to deal with this while trying to keep his family together. Lincoln struggled with his and his wife's mental health after one of their sons died and he had to try to keep his other son from joining the army. Finally, the movie was a great way to find out the various details of the passage of the amendment like how they had to work to convince representatives to switch sides. Overall, the movie kept my attention while still telling the story of the 13th amendment with historical accuracy. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in history or wants to learn more about America."

","Ill have to admit Lincoln did get a little bit slow at times. But it was overall a good watch because it better increased my knowledge on the time period of the terminating moments of the Civil War. From my knowledge it was historically correct throughout most of the film and Daniel Day-Lewis spoke just as I imagined Lincoln would in my head. I wonder, though, if Lincoln could really spin fantastic tales and make those great connections so eloquently in real life as he did in the movie. It seems as though would have had to think about what he was going to say for a week in advance to almost poetically word his phrases as he did. I also wonder if Congress debates went down as feisty in real life as they did in the film. I would give the film an 8 of 10, for a historical film, it was very interesting."

","I found the film heavy going but not being an American found that I was watching History and that was something I really did enjoy as I watched the film unfold and how Lincoln was a very clever and masterful politician in achieving the goal of the 13th Amendment (abolishment of slavery) and how he did that against a background of negativity and prejudice. This is not a film for the faint hearted already 150 minutes long and very heavy in dialogue throughout. It is a very intense film and focuses well on the build up to the 13th amendment which was written into the American constitution which goes to the heart of the American psyche. Spielberg draws out an acting Masterclass from some worthy actors and Sally Field as Mrs Lincoln comes out strong in a mainly male environment. Daniel Day Lewis appears to have been born to play the part come Oscar time if he hasn't won Best Actor I wonder how he could be beaten on this performance he is head and shoulders above anyone else. I go to the cinema to be enthralled, mesmerised or educated, on this occasion I was educated - I don't feel that I know everything about Lincoln what i do know he was a great American and what he achieved and what he stood for is something that Americamns can be proud of- Spielberg does a good job in that sense sadly he uses a few too many clichés but he does a great job of evoking pride in a Nation that now has a Black President."

Some of the secondary casting was a little suspect (notably James Spader) and it took me a while to warm to Tommy Lee Jones as Thadius Stevens but after I while I was able to put aside his Men in Black persona. Day-Lewis was convincing without overacting, altho at the very start of the movie Spielberg put him in an embarrassing set piece whereby two white soldiers started to recite the Gettysberg address and a black soldier finished it. I almost left the theatre at that early point but was glad I did not since what followed was a moving and thought provoking movie."

He really absorbed himself in this role and made me feel I was actually watching Lincoln on screen. Lewis is one of the best actors of my generation, and it's amazing to see him on screen really incorporate a role. Sally Field plays his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, whom he calls Molly throughout the film, which is his nickname for her. Sally Field begged Spielberg to play this role, which she does finely, however, she seemed to old to play such a character at the time frame this movie is set in.<br/><br/>The character that steals the movie and brings us the most laughs is W.N. Bilbo, who is played amazingly by James Spader. His mannerisms, his walk, his run, his facial reactions, gestures, everything about him is hilarious, entertaining and fun. He was my favorite character in the entire movie.<br/><br/>This movie is long, but it's entertaining, interesting and will keep you entertained until the very end. The costumes, the music, the writing and the cinematography are beautiful. I would not recommend this movie for young audiences because there are some violent, bloody scenes from war, corpses, cursing and this movie deals with mature subject matter that younger audiences may not understand or grasp like mental institutions, politics, death and family strife."

I honestly don't know why the concentration was on the 13th amendment being signed before Appromatox when there was so much involved in his life. The last 25 minutes(after the signing) was outstanding. A lot of the courtroom and back room scenes could have been out of ""Bonanza"" with bombastic oratory and cheap sideburns.

","You make it your mission to rid your nation of its most shameful human rights violation. While fighting a war to achieve that goal, you're simultaneously trying to pass legislation in furtherance of that goal. What if you fail?<br/><br/>Abraham Lincoln (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) has brought the south to the edge of defeat in The Civil War but has yet to pass the thirteenth amendment which will outlaw slavery and involuntary servitude. He feels that he can't end the war without first passing the amendment. His cabinet, in contrast, feels they will not be able to pass the amendment if they are not trying to end the war. His Secretary of State, William Seward (played by David Strathairn) tells him that peace and the amendment are mutually exclusive. Debates among congressmen rage on the floor on a constant basis with arguments in favor of abolition being voiced by Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens (played by Tommy Lee Jones) and arguments opposing abolition coming from Fernando Wood (played by Lee Pace) and George H. Pendleton (played by Peter McRobbie). Behind the scenes, operative William N. Bilbo (played by James Spader) is constructing backroom, and in some cases backwoods, deals that will ensure anyone who may vote for the amendment will and anyone who won't will abstain. As far as any struggles Abraham Lincoln is dealing with in his home life, his son, Robert Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Joseph Gordon- Leavitt), has abandoned studies at Harvard to join the Union army. His mother, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (portrayed by Sally Field) is foursquare against the idea of her son going to war, as she is still dealing with the loss of two sons. Edward Baker Lincoln who died in 1850 and William Wallace Lincoln who succumbed to typhoid fever one year prior to the Emancipation Proclamation. <br/><br/>I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed this movie. Some actors simply play themselves while answering to different names and others disappear into a role. Where Bruce Willis is the former, Daniel Day-Lewis is most definitely the latter. Makeup or no, this is not an actor's portrayal of Abraham Lincoln, this is a brilliant man transforming himself into the most courageous politician this country's ever known. Likewise, Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, a man even more devoted to the cause of abolishing slavery but far less concerned with matters such as tact and courtesy steals every scene he is in. There is no justification for foregoing this movie for this long but, if you haven't seen it yet, you should. It is brilliant."

It shows all the effort and the ""dirty business"" in order to get it passed and how difficult it was to get ""yes"" votes. I highly recommend this movie to those who love history, and even those who don't so they can get an idea of what it took to run this nation and the difficulties Lincoln had to deal with in his two terms as president.

DDL is a phenomenal actor who generally does not make missteps in his artistic choices. Choosing to play Lincoln with such a weak script and such poor direction by Spielberg, was a mistake in an otherwise near-perfect acting career. But heck, the critics seem to disagree, as their love-fest with all-things Spielberg continues, and they have bestowed a number of Golden Globe nominations (and likely, Academy Award nominations to follow) upon the players involved in this mess of a movie.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones; I just love the man. I saw Coal Miner's Daughter as a child, and have watched his performance in that movie numerous times. I never get tired of that movie. I have watched the Fugitive dozens of times; that movie is great because of TLJ. No Country for Old Men - more greatness from TLJ. Two great actors in Lincoln - DDL and TLJ - and this movie just fails, utterly fails. Who do I blame for this flop? The screenwriter and the director.<br/><br/>Unlike Spielberg's last over-hyped flick (Warhorse), this movie does have a couple of worthwhile moments - not shining moments mind you, but good moments nonetheless. I truly enjoyed some of the scenes between the President and his young son. There were some touching scenes between the aging leader, ravaged by the burden of sending boys and men to death on battlefields, finding solace from the horror of war by holding his son, talking to his son, parenting his son. There were also some notable scenes between Lincoln and his wife as well, with Sally Field playing her part well. I also enjoyed the moments when Lincoln would tell rambling anecdotes from his legal career with a bit of glint in his sparkling eyes, as though such stories lifted him to a different place, brought him back to a time when his life was not burdened with the horror of war and the devastating, demanding, daily, decision-making. The portrayal of Lincoln as father, as husband, as a lawyer turned politician now perhaps longing to return to the simplicity of the profession, had some appeal to it, and I left wishing that these aspects of his life had been more fully developed in the script."
"jaxbubba","8","0","3","16 December 2012"," Spielberg is a GENIUS!!!!!
","This is the type of film that the members of the Academy of Motions Pictures just fawn over. It's a period piece, historical in nature, well written, wonderfully filmed, a star-studded ensemble cast, and superiorly acted. This film will be well rewarded in the upcoming award season. Even though this was truly an unbelievable film, (for me) there seemed to be something missing that hint of intensity / drama / chutzpah that changes a really good film into a really great movie. Please do not get me wrong, do I feel that this film should be shown in every American History class across the United States ABSOLUTELY!!! However, being an avid movie watcher who enjoys viewing the same film numerous times; I am not so that this film is the same caliber as some of Spielberg's other marvelous films (i.e. – Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, E.T.), nor do I feel the want/desire to view this film again.<br/><br/>Set in the winter of 1865 as the Civil War is coming to a close, Abraham Lincoln (played wonderfully by Daniel Day Lewis) comes to the realization that he must use every fathomable power within his means to expedite the passing of the 13th Amendment: Abolishing Slavery before the war ends. Being a former lawyer, he recognizes that if ""slaves"" are still considered ""property"" of the plantation owners at the war's end, then this will be a negotiable clause in the War Reparations talks, and a point of concession for the North in order to end the war before the upcoming Spring fighting is re-initiated. Lincoln's only course of action is to amend the Constitution prior to the war's end.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is an extraordinary director, who excels at getting the best performances from his acclaimed actors; this is never more ubiquitous than in this film. The performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Abraham Lincoln is nothing less than astounding. I have read that it had taken Spielberg nearly 10 years of pursuit to finally securing Lewis' acceptance to this role. I can tell you now, it was definitely worth it. Lewis personifies Lincoln, the likeness and make-up is astonishing, and he (Lewis) is definitely the front runner candidate for the Best Actor awards this year. However, kudos can also be given to Sally Field's performance as Mary Todd Lincoln, and even more so to Tommy Lee Jones' performance as Thaddeus Stevens sure to win him some well deserved accolades in the Male Actor Supporting role categories.<br/><br/>This is truly a wonderful film, and a definite ""MUST SEE"" film in which I highly recommend for this holiday season. With very little competition from any other Oscar worthy films thus far this year, this film could very easily sweep the Academy Awards field this year , a feat in which only three other films have ever accomplished: Silence of the Lambs (1991), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), and It Happened One Night (1934). I anticipate 'Titanic' like nominations and wins (14 Nominations / 11 Wins) for this film, and Steven Spielberg to secure his third Best Director's Oscar (Schindler's List-1993, Saving Private Ryan-1998) and second Best Picture award (Schindler's List / Saving Private Ryan lost to Shakespeare In Love-1998).<br/><br/>See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel"""

","Watching this movie, I realized that my picture of Lincoln was devoid of the bitter reality that he truly experienced. I believe our current government needs to see this movie to realize how it is dangerously split and unproductive. We must find a civil way to come together for the good of all. Argue, but commit to a good outcome for next generations. I will read more about Lincoln and the Civil War before I watch this movie again. Lincoln, according to this movie, was willing to break the law for good of the country. I enjoyed hearing him tell stories while in the middle of very tense moments. What a man! Did Civil War soldiers actually memorize Lincoln's famous speech at Gettysburg?"

","This movie should be entitled the ""Thirteenth Amendment."" The role of Lincoln was a great role in this feat however the movie revolved around the Thirteenth Amendment and not necessarily President Lincoln. ""Lincoln"" is a movie that will bring you to some of the mechanisms that are contained in the government of the United States. I enjoyed this movie greatly and found humor in the name calling which took place during normal sessions of congress. The beards were also of great fun for the film. My favorite part of this movie would have to be the ending. No, it's not because the movie was finally over all though the pace was a little slow; it's because pieces came together about the ambition of a few of those who wanted to get the amendment passed. The serious tone of this subject and the film is what keeps me from claiming a perfect movie. I have a hard time imagining someone would not enjoy this film but this is not a movie I would want to watch often. ""Lincoln"" falls into a category almost as if a documentary, where you typically only watch once. While the movie was not a truly accurate film it is a film that does faithfully present the tone and inner workings of the nation's capital and the difficulties that were present to pass the amendment which ended slavery."
"kingfishfilmco","10","0","2","16 December 2012"," Amazing writing, I laughed throughout.
","I had heard so many reviews about the length and the long winded speeches by Daniel Day-Lewis, but I found this film to be a completely entertaining experience. Of course I expected the man to nail his part and finally humanize someone we really know so little about, but I didn't expect the humor. The writing was such a dead on commentary on how politics never change except in this case the two parties have changed faces. The reality of what has changed is that when it comes down to what's truly best for our country some of the other team members will jump ship. Who knows how truly accurate the film is but it rings true that when a great leader like Lincoln shows true passion for a cause enough of the other leaders would rally around him to do what's right.<br/><br/>Amazing cast, writing, directing, art direction, cinematography and everything else. Well done Mr. Spielberg!"
"clocacola","10","0","2","16 December 2012"," Great Movie
","I thought this movie was fantastic and really shows the issues that troubled Lincoln with his decisions pertaining to the Civil War and slavery and the constitutionality of his actions. Instead of portraying Lincoln as a President and an American hero, it shows him as a father and a man who leads the nation and struggles with his conscience to make the right decision for the nation. I think this portrayal of Lincoln makes him seem all the greater, because it shows how much thought and effort he put into his actions. This movie really shows the conflicting opinions in Congress about the 13th Amendment, and how many of the Congressmen were affiliated with a stance on the Amendment because of the political party association, and how easily swayed some of the Congressmen were. However, this movie shows how strongly some politicians felt about slavery, especially George Pendleton and Thaddeus Stevens. My favorite part was when Stevens states how he supports the 13th Amendment, but he believes that all men are not created equal because there are people, like Pendleton, that are some of the most vile human beings."
"thefilmdiscussion","8","0","3","3 December 2012"," Wonderfully crafted performances highlight this Oscar-bait period drama
","After the 16th President of the United States was somewhat lampooned earlier this year as he chopped off the heads of vampires, Steven Spielberg was finishing work on a more serious look at Honest Abe, aptly title ""Lincoln"", and though it may lack the action of Vamp Abe it is certainly every bit as powerful in its portrayal of a torn nation, and the man who will stop at nothing to bring it back together. The intensity in the film is drawn from heated conversations about slavery and the Civil War, and this word-sparring is stuff for the ages as a whole host of famous faces get screen time to connive and throw insults across the House of Representatives floor. Tommy Lee Jones is stellar as a Republican whose verbose insults are like bolts of electricity jumping out of the screen. But of course it is Daniel Day-Lewis who offers up yet another transforming performance as the titular character. His mannerisms, voice, look, and style give us not just a character, but another person entirely. He channels the spirit of Lincoln in every form and fashion, and it's scary-good to watch. He'll be in a familiar place come time for the Best Actor nominations to be passed out.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"
"luckyhorsegirl","6","0","8","25 November 2012"," The story of Lincoln's attempt to pass the 13th amendment and people's lives during the time.
","I really liked the honesty in this film. The movie makers really didn't go for the pretty and entertaining version of Lincoln's story. They didn't emphasize Lincoln's assassination like you would expect from a film about him. They focused on the true hardship that he went through. Though, I can't vouch for the historical correctness, they did acknowledge some things that are usually left under represented when you study Abraham Lincoln which I liked. I also thought that the way they started when he already in the thick of the Civil War and has already done the Emancipation Proclamation was interesting because it emphasized Lincoln's most profound and trying years. I was bothered by Mr. Stephan's wig, I was relieved when he finally took it off."
"PekoesDad","7","0","4","25 November 2012"," Kudos to Doris Goodwin & Daniel Day-Lewis, But...
","Without question, Doris Kearns Goodwin is THE historical writer of our times. Her depiction of what Abraham Lincoln had to endure -- not to mention what the hundreds of thousands of men on both sides of the Civil War had to suffer -- whilst he made the agonizing decision of whether to end the war early (and forever keep ""Negroes"" enslaved by those in the Confederacy) versus ""cajoling"" those in his Cabinet to secure the necessary votes to ban slavery was extraordinary.<br/><br/>With regard to the ""But..."" in the title of my posting, following are the problems I had with this film, which, admittedly, will surely add to Day-Lewis' Best-Actor Oscar collection:<br/><br/>o This is the first English-speaking film to NEED SUBTITLES. The use of English in Lincoln's day was, of course, very much different than it is today. I found myself trying to follow/understand/comprehend what was being spoken at the moment as much as I was attempting to follow the story line.<br/><br/>o The choice of Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln was simply a poor choice. As I was following the interactions between Day-Lewis and Field I found it difficult to reconcile the actual difference (11 years) in their real-life ages.<br/><br/>o Tommy Lee Jones was perhaps the most miscast character for my taste. He just didn't convince me that he was a man of the times. Perhaps I have Mr. Jones just too connected to the ""Men In Black,"" ""Fugitive,"" and ""U.S. Marshalls"" movies.<br/><br/>Basically, a good movie...with issues."
"Hellmant","8","0","4","19 November 2012"," It would have taken a huge miscalculation for Spielberg not to deliver a good film (given the subject matter).
","'LINCOLN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's adaptation (in part) of Doris Kearns Goodwin's 2005 book ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"". The movie centers solely on the last four months of Lincoln's life (unlike the book) when he fought to emancipate the slaves. The screenplay was written by Tony Kushner (who also wrote the 2005 Spielberg directed film 'MUNICH'). It stars Daniel Day-Lewis as America's 16th President Abraham Lincoln (and perhaps most beloved). It co-stars Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, John Hawks and Jackie Earl Haley. The film is powerful and moving (as it should be, given it's subject matter) but it's still just a little too long and slow paced at times. Spielberg gives it his Spielberg touch though and Day-Lewis is amazing.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1865 as the American Civil War is coming to a conclusion and President Abraham Lincoln has began his second term in office. His main objective is to pass the historical constitutional amendment which banned slavery from the United States. He fights to do this before the war ends because if peace is reached before he can pass the amendment the southern states will stop it. As Lincoln deals with trying to collect enough votes he also deals with his conscience for not ending the war earlier (which would save thousands of lives). He must decide which is more important. <br/><br/>The film deals with one of the most important moments in the history of the United States so it would have taken a huge miscalculation for Spielberg not to deliver a good film. The subject almost guarantees an Oscar caliber film in the hands of any decent director. Some say Spielberg has lost his touch and although this film has received wide critical praise many viewers and former fans of Spielberg find it a tad boring. It is grand, visually breathtaking and monumentally epic and Spielberg does give it his usual magical touch. With that said it's also a little too long and slow paced at times. As emotionally moving as it is it seems like it could have been even more touching and powerful (given the subject matter). Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing as Lincoln though and gives one of the best performances of the year (without a doubt). The supporting cast is all exceptional as well, especially Tommy Lee Jones in my opinion. The movie may not be as classic and memorable as it could have been but it's still a great film and if you're interested in the subject matter (which almost everyone should be) you're bound to find it at least somewhat interesting and involving.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NArnnDLm6Zo"
